AB  - Many Asian elephant populations inhabit fragmented human-dominated landscapes. Human-elephant conflict (HEC) has intensified in such regions, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of people and elephants each year. Controversy between stakeholders then arises as people debate the merits of HEC mitigation approaches, stifling progress. We conducted a survey to evaluate the opinions of experts, farmers and others who have and have not experienced HEC (n = 611), on the causes of HEC, the importance of, conservation of and co-existence with elephants, and on the acceptability and effectiveness of potential HEC mitigation methods. Analysis of variance and the Potential for Conflict Index showed that all groups agreed with nine of the 10 causes of HEC assessed, on average. All respondent groups had mostly positive attitudes towards the importance and conservation of elephants. However, farmers exposed to HEC disagreed that people should co-exist with elephants and supported the view that elephants should be removed from human habitats. All groups agreed on the acceptability and effectiveness of electric fencing, early warning systems with infrasonic call detectors, Global Positioning System collars and geophones. However, there was disparity in views between the experts and other stakeholder groups on the acceptability and effectiveness of restricting elephants to protected areas, and translocation of problem elephants to protected areas away from their capture site or to wild elephant holding grounds. While similar views between stakeholders on many subjects are encouraging for elephant conservation, the disparities identified should be given greater attention when planning HEC management programs to minimize conflict between stakeholders.

AB  - In brief: GRK2 deficiency disrupts the early embryonic development in pigs. The regulation of GRK2 on HSP90 and AKT may also play an important role during embryo development and tumor formation. Abstract: Among the family of GPCR kinases (GRKs) that regulate receptor phosphorylation and signaling termination, G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) binds to HSP90 in response to hypoxia or other stresses. In this study, we investigated the effects of GRK2 knockdown and inhibition on porcine embryonic development from the zygote stage. Immunofluorescence and western blotting were used to determine the localization and expression, respectively, of GRK2 and related proteins. First, GRK2 and p-GRK2 were expressed in both the cytoplasm and membrane and co-localized with HSP90 on the membrane. The mRNA level of GRK2 increased until the 8C-morula stage, suggesting that GRK2 may play an essential role during the early development of the porcine embryos. GRK2 knockdown reduced porcine embryo development capacity and led to significantly decreased blastocyst quality. In addition, inhibition of GRK2 also induced poor ability of embryo development at an early stage, indicating that GRK2 is critical for embryonic cleavage in pigs. Knockdown and inhibition of GRK2 reduced HSP90 expression, AKT activation, and cAMP levels. Additionally, GRK2 deficiency increased LC3 expression, suggesting enhanced autophagy during embryo development. In summary, we showed that GRK2 binds to HSP90 on the membrane to regulate embryonic cleavage and AKT activation during embryonic development in pigs.

AB  - In this study, the effect of lairage on carcass traits, physicochemical parameters, and sensory properties of Longissimus lumborum muscle in lambs transported by road was investigated. Thirty (30) one-year-old Awasi Syrian lambs were randomly allotted into three slaughtering groups. The first group of lambs was not moved and served as a control (NT), while the animals in the other two groups were loaded into an open vehicle covered with straw and transported by road for two hours, followed by 0hours of lairage (T2L0) and 12hours for (T2L12). The collected data demonstrated that lambs that ware given a lairage period before slaughter lost significantly more live weight (p <= 0.05) than those slaughtered immediately upon arrival at the slaughterhouse. The carcass shrinkage of T2L0 lambs was less (p <= 0.05) than that of T2L12 and control lambs. On postmortem days 1 and 7, the muscles of T2L0 treated lambs had significantly (p <= 0.05) less drip loss but more shear force than T2L12- and control-treated lambs. At day 7 postmortem, bacterial counts in the meat of T2L0 lambs were higher (p <= 0.05) than those of NT and T2L12 lambs, most likely due to a numerical increase in ultimate pH at day 7. In conclusion, the lairage after transit had no effect on meat quality indicators compared to the control group. The meat from lambs in both groups (non-transported and transported with lairage) had a longer shelf life after postmortem aging than when slaughtered immediately upon arrival at the abattoir.

AB  - Simple Summary: To reduce the impact of livestock on the environment, in modern rations for farm animals the concentration of relevant nutrients is aimed to be lowered. The main nutrients in focus are nitrogen and phosphorus. Because phosphorus is essential for bone development, the degree to which dietary phosphorus can be decreased is limited. There are case reports that pigs indicate leg problems under specific practical conditions, and theories that this might be linked to reduced phosphorus level in feeds are circulating. To verify whether these observations are connected to the nutritionally recommended reduction of dietary mineral phosphorus and to increase the acceptance of these feeding regimes on farmer level, three diets with variable phosphorus levels were fed throughout grower and finisher stages. Performance, bone mineralization, blood parameters and selected mineral transporters involved in P homoeostasis were studied. The results did not show any indication of an insufficient outcome. Thus, it is concluded that the digestible phosphorus supply was sufficient within the range of this study. It is further highlighted that it is essential to decrease the calcium concentration in phosphorus-reduced diets to maintain high P digestibility and availability, which is often neglected under practical conditions. The reduction of emissions of nutrients from livestock is one of the main topics in areas with intensive animal husbandry. In order to minimize the loss of nutrients into the environment, it is common practice to feed animals as close as possible to metabolic demands. For phosphorus (P), there are various studies for swine and poultry, which showed that a reduction of dietary P levels is possible, if a sufficient level of phytase is added to the diet. The supplementation of a sufficient dosage of phytase to plant-based diets leads to an increase in digestible phosphorus (dP) upon the hydrolisation of phytate (InsP6) to P and lower inositol-phosphates. However, most of these studies were conducted under standardized experimental conditions. In terms of transfer to practical conditions with varying housing, management and genetics, there are concerns that have led to speculation by farmers and veterinarians whether the reduction of dietary P could negatively affect bone health and therefore animal welfare. In order to test whether a reduction of dietary P according to the recommendations for dP of the German Society of Nutrition Physiology (GfE) affects bone mineralization and growth performance, a ringtest was conducted where piglets and fattening pigs were fed at four experimental stations with three centrally produced diets from the same batches. The diets contained three different levels of P and were designed to reflect practical diets. The P level decreased from diet one to three, respectively. Diets one and two were calculated to contain P levels, which are typically fed under practical conditions in Germany. The third diet was optimized to fulfill the requirements of dP by the GfE. The animals were fed in two phases as post-weaning piglets (8-15 kg and 15-28 kg BW) followed by a three-phase fattening regime (28-60 kg, 60-90 kg and 90-120 kg BW). Individual body weight and feed consumption (pen basis or individually, depending on the experimental station) were recorded for every feeding phase. At the end of the experiment, animals were slaughtered.
   At one experimental station, additional blood serum, metatarsi of the left leg and kidney tissue were sampled to analyze serum P concentration, expression of P transporters in the kidney and bone traits. In two experimental stations, femur and vertebra were sampled, and bone ash was determined. Overall, animal performance and all other traits analyzed did not differ between the treatment with the highest and the treatment with the lowest dietary P concentration. The results demonstrate that it is possible to decrease dietary P according to the recommendations for dP of the GfE, without impairing the animals' performance or mineral homeostasis and health. A reduction of total P by reducing mineral P to the levels of the present study require the supplementation of phytase to achieve sufficient concentrations of dP.

AB  - Adolescence is a developmental period characterized by brain maturation and changes in social engagement. Changes in the social environment influence social behaviors. Memories of social events, including remembering familiar individuals, require social engagement during encoding. Therefore, existing differences in adult and adolescent social repertoires and environmentally-driven changes in social behavior may impact novel partner preference, associated with social recognition. Several amygdala subregions are sensitive to the social environment and can influence social behavior, which is crucial for novelty preference. Amygdala neurons project to the septum and nucleus accumbens (NAc), which are linked to social engagement. Here, we investigated how the social environment impacts age-specific social behaviors during social encoding and its subsequent impact on partner preference. We then examined changes in amygdala-septal and -NAc circuits that accompany these changes. Brief isolation can drive social behavior in both adults and adolescents and was used to increase social engagement during encoding. We found that brief isolation facilitates social interaction in adolescents and adults, and analysis across time revealed that partner discrimination was intact in all groups, but there was a shift in preference within isolated and non-isolated groups. We found that this same isolation preferentially increases basal amygdala (BA) activity relative to other amygdala subregions in adults, but activity among amygdala subregions was similar in adolescents, even when considering conditions (no isolation, isolation). Further, we identify isolation-driven increases in BA-NAc and BA-septal circuits in both adults and adolescents. Together, these results provide evidence for changes in neuronal populations within amygdala subregions and their projections that are sensitive to the social environment that may influence the pattern of social interaction within briefly isolated groups during development.

AB  - The availability of nitrogen (N) can dramatically influence crops resistance to herbivorous insects. However, the interaction between N fertilization and crop resistance to insects is not well understood. In this study, the effects of N fertilization on the grain aphid (Sitobion miscanthi) were investigated using three wheat (Triticum aestivum) cultivars with different aphid resistances. We measured aphid life cycle parameters, fecundity, survival rate, weight and feeding behavior, in conjunction with wheat metabolomics, transcriptomics and alien introgression analysis. Our results demonstrated that higher N application benefits aphid feeding across all three wheat cultivars. We also reveal that the highly resistant cultivar (ZM9) can only exert its resistance-advantage under low N fertilization, losing its advantage compared to moderately resistant cultivar YN19 and susceptible cultivar YN23 under higher N fertilization. The effects of N fertilization on wheat-aphid interactions were due to changes in the regulation of carbon and nitrogen metabolism. Integration of multi-omics highlighted specific aphid-induced differentially expressed genes (DEGs, e.g., TUB6, Tubulin 6; ENODL20, Early nodulin-like protein 20; ACT7 Actin 7; Prx47, Peroxidase 47) and significantly different metabolites (SDMs, e.g., crotonoside, guanine, 2 '-O-methyladenosine, ferulic acid) in ZM9. Additionally, we report the unique SDMs-DEGs interactions, associated with introgression during wheat domestication, may help infer aphid resistance. In summary, this study provides new insights into the relationships between N fertilization practices, defense responses and integrated pest management for sustainable wheat production.

AB  - Mice belonging to the genus Peromyscus are one of the most important reservoirs of tick-borne pathogens in the United States. However, the composition and abundance of Peromyscus species may vary geographically. The woodland deer mouse, Peromyscus maniculatus gracilis, is often abundant in the northern counties of Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan. In these states, multiple pathogens transmitted by the blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis, are endemic. In comparison to the well-studied white-footed mouse, Peromyscus leucopus, little is known about the importance of P. maniculatus in maintaining natural cycles of tick-borne pathogens. We conducted small mammal trapping in north-central Wisconsin and compared the modified reservoir potential of P. maniculatus to P. leucopus. Based on mixed-model regression analysis, individual P. maniculatus were 2.07 (1.07-4.01) times more likely to be infected with Borrelia burgdorferi compared with P. leucopus. We report the first detection of three emerging tick-borne pathogens (Babesia microti, Borrelia mayonii, and Ehrlichia muris eauclairensis) in P. maniculatus. Additionally, P. maniculatus infected with Ba. microti were 4.8 (2.74-8.50) times more likely to be concurrently infected with Bo. burgdorferi compared with P. leucopus. While we found individual P. leucopus to be more infested with both larval and nymphal I. scapularis, P. maniculatus was the more abundant species. As a result, P. maniculatus had a higher modified reservoir potential in our study area and was likely responsible for feeding and infecting more ticks with pathogens than P. leucopus. Overall, our results illustrate that P. maniculatus is an important reservoir in areas of the Midwest, where it occurs in high abundance.

AB  - ACTH/MSH-like peptides (melanocortins) have a wide range of neurotropic effects, including effects on learning and memory processes, neuroprotection, emotional state and pain sensitivity. Present work is aimed to compare the effects of peptides, the structure of which includes a natural fragment of ACTH and a stabilizing tripeptide PGP. The peptides ACTH4-7PGP (Semax), ACTH6-9PGP, and ACTH7-10PGP were used in the work. The effects of these peptides on the exploratory behavior, anxiety level and pain sensitivity of white rats, as well as on the protein levels of the neurotrophic factors BDNF (brain derived neurotrophic factor) and VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) in primary neuron cultures were studied. A comparative study of the effects of analogs of different ACTH/MSH fragments revealed both similarities and differences in their neurotropic activity. The peptides structure of which includes a sequence of ACTH4-7 or ACTH6-9 have nootropic, anxiolytic and analgesic activity, and also cause an increase in VEGF levels in the culture of hippocampal neurons. The peptide containing the ACTH7-10 sequence in the structure exhibits anxiolytic activity, increases exploratory behavior, does not affect pain sensitivity and has a stimulating effect on BDNF and VEGF levels in neuronal cultures. The data obtained indicate that different parts of the N-terminal region of the ACTH molecule are responsible for the manifestation of certain neurotropic effects of melanocortins. The results of the study can be used in the development of therapeutics based on natural melanocortins.

AB  - In India, agricultural emissions affect regional air quality and climate change, driven by the extensive cultivation of arable land, large livestock population, and widespread crop residue burning (CRB). Existing emission inventories (EIs) predominantly focus on macro-scale CRB and livestock emissions, with limited attention to particulate matter (PM) emissions from tillage activities. This study develops an updated EI for CRB, tillage, and livestock across multiple pollutants at 0.1 degrees x 0.1 degrees spatial and monthly temporal resolution for 2018-2019. Using field survey data from 102 districts, tillage emissions contributed 583 Gg of PM10 and 278 Gg of PM2.5, with 87 % from 10 states. CRB emissions, modeled using fire radiative energy and open burning proportion correlations (R-2 > 0.7), show that rice, wheat, sugarcane, and maize account for 73-89 % of total emissions. Livestock emissions, derived using updated India-specific emission factors, reveal NH3 emissions of 3.4 Tg, with cattle and buffalo contributing 91 % of CH4. Tillage and livestock emissions peaked between May-July. Indo Gangetic Plain dominates CRB emissions (peak in October-November). Mitigation strategies demonstrate remarkable potential (up to 44 %), with zero tillage reducing PM by 17 % (25 % adoption), sustainable residue management cutting emissions by 36-45 %, and dietary interventions lower methane by 12 %.

AB  - ? The abundance of N-cycling genes differently responded to NPK application.? Chemical NPK application greatly altered the N-cycling microbial community structure.? Soil acidification was the main driver for the variation in the N-cycling microbial community.? Manure addition was beneficial for stabilizing the N-cycling microbial community.Straw and manure are widely applied to agricultural systems, and greatly shape soil N-cycling microflora. However, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of how these organic materials struc-ture soil N-cycling microbial communities. In this study, metagenomic analysis was performed to investigate the compositional variation in N-cycling microbial communities in a 30-year long-term experiment under five fertilization regimes: no fertilization (Control), chemical fertilization only (NPK), and NPK with wheat straw (NPK + HS), pig manure (NPK + PM), and cow manure (NPK + CM). Long-term NPK application differentially changed N-cycling gene abundance and greatly altered N-cycling microbial community structure. NPK + HS resulted in a similar pattern to NPK in terms of gene abundance and community structure. However, NPK + PM and NPK + CM significantly increased most genes and resulted in a community similar to that of the Control. Further analysis revealed that serious soil acidification caused by long-term NPK fertilization was a major factor for the variation in N-cycling microbial communities. The addition of alkaline manure, rather than wheat straw, stabilized the N-cycling microbial community structure presumably by alleviating soil acidification. These results revealed the strong impact of soil acidification on microbial N-cycling communities and illustrated the possibility of resolving nitrogen-related environmental problems by manipulating pH in acidified agricultural soils.

AB  - Antibiotics are an indispensable component of the livestock industry and are released into the environment through various pathways during livestock rearing processes. Among various environmental mediums, groundwater holds significant importance as it serves as a crucial resource for potable water supply and agricultural practices. However, the persistent use of antibiotic-contaminated groundwater can lead to prolonged exposure to these agents in human and ecological systems, thereby engendering serious apprehensions, including the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains. Therefore, in this study, the concentration of antibiotics in groundwater within densely populated livestock farming areas was analyzed using UHPLC-q-orbitrap HRMS combined with online solid-phase extraction. The measured cumulative concentrations of antibiotics in the groundwater samples collected from the surveyed areas ranged from 15.8 ng L-1 to 1530.0 ng L-1. The residual antibiotics obtained from the surveyed region exhibited significant seasonal variation, with higher concentrations observed during summer. This seasonal pattern is attributed to the combined effects of agricultural activities and climatic factors. The concentrations of antibiotics in the investigated area demonstrated associations between the composition of livestock species and the density of livestock farming facilities. Specifically, veterinary-specific antibiotics (sulfaquinoxaline [SQX] and clopidol [CLO]), commonly employed in poultry farming, were found to be more prominent in the area with a high concentration of poultry farming facilities. In regions characterized by a dense poultry farm presence, the highest concentrations of SQX and CLO were founded at 135.7 ng L-1 and 178.6 ng L-1, respectively. In contrast, areas without any farms exhibited lower concentrations, measuring 39.9 ng L-1 for SQX and 10.1 ng L-1 for CLO. Similarly, antibiotics primarily used in swine farming showed a strong correlation with the presence of large-scale swine farming operations. In the case of sulfamethazine, which is commonly used in pig farming, concentrations exceeding 500 ng L-1 were observed in groundwater samples collected near large-scale swine farming facilities. These observations suggest that antibiotics are introduced into groundwater through the discharge of wastewater and excreta from livestock farming facilities. Consequently, this study establishes that regional variations in antibiotic concentrations within groundwater are influenced by factors such as local usage patterns, the scale and types of livestock farming, and the prevailing climatic conditions. In order to elucidate the precise associations between multiple sources of contamination, including livestock farming facilities, and to enhance our understanding of their spatial correlations, there appears to be a need for research focused on spatial correlation analysis.

AB  - BackgroundAscending clinical evidence supports that electroacupuncture (EA) is effective in treating post-ischemic depression (PID), but little is known about how it works at the cellular level. Astrocytes are exquisitely sensitive to their extracellular environment, and under stressful conditions, they may experience aberrant structural remodeling that can potentially cause neuroplastic disturbances and contribute to subsequent changes in mood or behavior.ObjectivesThis study aimed to investigate the effect of EA on behavioral deficits associated with PID in mice and verify the hypothesis that astrocytic morphology may be involved in this impact.MethodsWe established a PID animal model induced by transient bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO, 20 min) and chronic restraint stress (CRS, 21 days). EA treatment (GV20 + ST36) was performed for 3 weeks, from Monday to Friday each week. Depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors and sociability were evaluated using SPT, FST, EPM, and SIT. Immunohistochemistry combined with Sholl and cell morphological analysis was utilized to assess the process morphology of GFAP+ astrocytes in mood-related regions. The potential relationship between morphological changes in astrocytes and behavioral output was detected by correlation analysis.ResultsBehavioral assays demonstrated that EA treatment induced an overall reduction in behavioral deficits, as measured by the behavioral Z-score. Sholl and morphological analyses revealed that EA prevented the decline in cell complexity of astrocytes in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the CA1 region of the hippocampus, where astrocytes displayed evident deramification and atrophy of the branches. Eventually, the correlation analysis showed there was a relationship between behavioral emotionality and morphological changes.ConclusionOur findings imply that EA prevents both behavioral deficits and structural abnormalities in astrocytes in the PID model. The strong correlation between behavioral Z-scores and the observed morphological changes confirms the notion that the weakening of astrocytic processes may play a crucial role in depressive symptoms, and astrocytes could be a potential target of EA in the treatment of PID.

AB  - Simple Summary This experiment explored how feeding grape wine production waste product grape marc impacts on sheep production. Forty merino sheep were divided into two groups; one group received a sheep industry standard diet (control), and one group received a treatment diet which had 20% of the control diet replaced by grape marc. The results showed that the grape marc diet led to a higher intake and faecal nitrogen/urinary nitrogen ratio, but no difference in sheep live weight gain, behaviour, and parasitic egg count compared with control diet-fed sheep. Overall, the results showed that feeding grape wine production waste product grape marc as a cheap feed, to replace 20% of the control ration, can maintain sheep productivity, health, and environmental sustainability. A 39-day field experiment was conducted to assess the effect of grape marc (GM) feeding on sheep productivity, health, and environmental sustainability. Forty merino sheep were divided into two dietary groups, each having five replications (n = 4 sheep/replication). Experimental diet consisted of: (i) control: 55% lucerne hay + 40% wheat grain + 5% faba bean; (ii) GM treatment: control diet with 20% replaced by GM on a dry matter (DM) basis. The GM treatment contained 2-10% higher phytochemical contents than the control. The DMI from the GM treatment was 15% higher than the control (p < 0.001). No difference was found in sheep live weight gain, behaviour, and quality between groups (p > 0.05). No difference was found in total faecal production, faecal organic matter, and nitrogen contents (p > 0.05) and parasitic egg count. The GM treatment led to higher nitrogen intake (23.1 vs. 27.2 g/d) and faecal nitrogen excretion (6.3 vs. 8.7 g/d) compared to the control. Urinary creatinine, allantoin, and purine derivatives were lower in the GM treatment than control (p < 0.05). However, both groups had similar purine derivatives/DMI (i.e., indicator of rumen microbial protein synthesis efficiency; p > 0.05). Overall, the results showed that GM can replace 20% of the control ration to maintain sheep productivity, health, and environmental sustainability.

AB  - Plants allocate their limited resources toward different physiological processes, dynamically adjusting their resource allocation in response to environmental changes. How beneficial plant-associated microbes influence this allocation is a topic that continues to interest plant biologists. In this study, we examined the effect of a beneficial fungus, Phialemonium inflatum, on investment in growth and anti-herbivore resistance traits in cucumber plants (Cucumis sativus). We inoculated cucumber seeds with P. inflatum spores and measured several growth parameters, including germination rate, above and belowground biomass, and number of flowers. We also examined plant resistance to adult and larval striped cucumber beetles (Acalymma vitattum), and quantified levels of defense hormones in leaves and roots. Our results indicate that P. inflatum strongly enhances cucumber plant growth and reproductive potential. Although fungus treatment did not improve plant resistance to cucumber beetles, inoculated plants were more tolerant to root herbivory, experiencing less biomass reduction. Together, these findings document how a beneficial plant-associated fungus shifts plant investment in growth over herbivore resistance, highlighting the importance of microbes in mediating plant-herbivore interactions. These findings also have important implications for agricultural systems, where beneficial microbes are often introduced or managed to promote plant growth or enhance resistance.

AB  - Wireworms (Agriotes spp., Coleoptera, Elateridae) are a major threat to potatoes, as are the current commercial standards for assessing potato damage. To reduce wireworm impacts on potato crops and comply with IPM legislation, we started research to assess the potential for new Italian 4x-breeding clones to reduce wireworm feeding on daughter tubers. Two sets of trials were carried out over a six-year period (2018-2023): in-field and in semi-natural conditions, with pots used to introduce a set number of reared wireworms. In the field trials, the varieties were planted in 4.8 x 9-12 m plots in a randomized-block layout with at least three replications. The same wireworm damage assessment was used for both sets of trials. The assessment involved counting all the erosions/scars caused by wireworm feeding activity. The prevalent wireworm species studied was Agriotes sordidus. Both sets of trials showed that some 4x-breeding clones were tolerant to wireworm attacks. The percentages of tubers damaged (any symptom) or with at least one ordinary/large hole was up to five times lower than in the commercial varieties. Glycoalkaloids and the caffeic acid content in tubers are considered to be the main cause of lower appetibility to wireworms.

AB  - The European Griffon Vulture Gyps fulvus is a large-sized scavenger exploiting carcasses of livestock and wild ungulates and thus having a paramount importance in the natural ecosystems. In this study, we report on an adult Griffon Vulture detected with lead levels in the bones over the threshold. After two years of tracking, the bird died. The corpse's clinical examination and radiography detected the presence of two embedded lead pellets from a healed gunshot wound in its right wing. Quantitative laboratory analysis of lead in bone and liver samples evidencing subclinical/chronic lead intoxication of the Griffon Vulture could potentially be a result of the longterm exposure to the lead originating from the pellets in its wing.

AB  - Stressors during the adolescent period can affect development of the brain and have long-lasting impacts on behavior. Specifically, adolescent stress impairs hippocampal neurogenesis and can increase risk for anxiety, depression, and a dysregulated stress response in adulthood. In order to model the functional effects of reduced hippocampal neurogenesis during adolescence, a transgenic neurogenesis ablation rat model was used to suppress neurogenesis during the adolescent period and test anxiodepressive behaviors and stress physiology during adulthood. Wildtype and transgenic (TK) rats were given valganciclovir during the first two weeks of adolescence (4-6 weeks old) to knock down neurogenesis in TK rats. Starting in young adulthood (13 weeks old), blood was sampled for corticosterone at several time points following acute restraint stress to measure negative feedback of the stress response, and rats were tested on a battery of anxiodepressive tests at baseline and following acute restraint stress. Although TK rats had large reductions in both cell proliferation during adolescence, as measured by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), and ongoing neurogenesis in adulthood (by doublecortin), resulting in decreased volume of the dentate gyrus, negative feedback of the stress response following acute restraint was similar across all rats. Despite similar stress responses, TK rats showed higher anxiety-like behavior at baseline. In addition, only TK rats had increased depressive-like behavior when tested after acute stress. Together, these results suggest that long-term neurogenesis ablation starting in adolescence produces hippocampal atrophy and increases behavioral caution and despair amid stressful environments.

AB  - Background Macracanthorhynchus hirudinaceus (Pallas, 1781) is a zoonotic acanthocephalan that parasitizes the small intestine of wild boars. It is a pathogenic that causes economic losses, and poses a public health threat due to increased emergence. Purpose The aims of this study is describes histopathologically the damage caused by M. hirudinaceus in the small intestine of wild boar Sus scrofa Linnaeus, 1758, and molecularly characterize this parasite (sequences, haplotypes, phylogeny) for the first time in Elazig city, T & uuml;rkiye. Results A high prevalence of infection was obtained. Upon separating the worms, it was discovered that there were ulcers resembling craters in the center, of the small intestine mucosa, surrounded by edema. The intestine wall where the parasite attached was damaged, with the villi epithelium and lamina propria in the mucosa being destroyed. The genomic DNA was isolated from all M. hirudinaceus samples, and PCR amplified the 489 bp gene fragments were sequenced and confirmed that all 21 sequences were M. hirudinaceus. The haplotype analysis of the sequences revealed the presence of a central star-shaped haplotype, in addition to four other haplotypes. Conclusion After conducting sequence analysis, the genetic differences between the M. hirudinaceus sequences obtained in this study and those reported from Europe and Japan suggest that this parasite is endemic to T & uuml;rkiye's local wild boar population. Also, four haplotypes were identified, distinguishing it from other haplotypes by 1-5 mutation steps. It is essential to consider the worm's sequences and the formation of haplotypes, since these intrinsic characteristics may impact in the epidemiology and pathology of the worm in the future.

AB  - During implantation, trophoblast cell invasion and differentiation is predominantly important to achieving proper placental formation and embryonic development. The chemokine, C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12) working through its receptor C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) is implicated in implantation and placentation but precise roles of this axis are unclear. Suppressing CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling at the fetal-maternal interface in sheep reduces trophoblast invasion, disrupts uterine remodeling, and diminishes placental vascularization. We hypothesize these negative impacts during implantation will manifest as compromised fetal and placental growth at midgestation. To test, on day 12 postbreeding, osmotic pumps were surgically installed in 30 ewes and delivered intrauterine CXCR4 inhibitor or saline for 7 or 14 days. On day 90, fetal/maternal tissues were collected, measured, weighed, and maternal (caruncle) and fetal (cotyledon) placenta components separated and analyzed. The objectives were to determine if (i) suppressing CXCL12/CXCR4 during implantation results in reduced fetal and placental growth and development and (ii) if varying the amount of time CXCL12/CXCR4 is suppressed impacts fetal/placental development. Fetal weights were similar; however greater placental weight and placentome numbers occurred when CXCL12/CXCR4 was suppressed for 14 days. In caruncles, greater abundance of fibroblast growth factor 2, vascular endothelial growth factor A, vascular endothelial growth factor A receptor 1 (FLT-1), and placental growth factor were observed after suppressing CXCL12/CXCR4. Similar results occurred in cotyledons except less vascular endothelial growth factor in 7 day group and less fibroblast growth factor in 14 day group. Our data underscore the importance of CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling during placentation and provide strong evidence that altering CXCL12-mediated signaling induces enduring placental effects manifesting later in gestation.

AB  - Featured Application Enterocin A/P is promising stabilizing additive for dairy products. In Slovakia, goat milk is used for the production of traditional/local products, for example goat milk lump cheese. Healthy and safe dairy products are one of the major objectives for producers and consumers. Staphylococci are found in frequent contaminants of raw milk and dairy products. A promising approach of how to prevent/eliminate them is represented by bacteriocins. The aim of this study was testing in situ the anti-staphylococcal effect of Enterocin A/P, characterized in our laboratory and produced by the non-autochthonous strain Enterococcus faecium EK13 = CCM7419 against the contaminant strain Staphylococcus aureus SA5 experimentally inoculated in a goat milk vat during processing of goat milk lump cheese to show the application potential of Enterocin A/P. In addition, the parameters influencing the ripening of the cheese (lactic acid -LA), the acidity degrees SH and the pH were also checked. The 2.5 log cycle difference was found in the EV comparing to the CV at day 168 (1 week), which indicates a reduction of SA5 cells due to Ent A/P. The acidity value (pH and degrees SH) and LA were not negatively influenced. These preliminary results indicate that Enterocin A/P seems to be a promising additive for dairy products. Moreover, this is the first study showing in situ (in goat milk cheese) the anti-staphylococcal effect of Ent A/P.

AB  - Pesticide resistance in medically significant disease vectors can negatively impact the efficacy of control efforts. Resistance research on ticks has focused primarily on species of veterinary significance that experience relatively high degrees of control pressure. Resistance in tick vectors of medical significance has received little attention, in part because area-wide pesticide applications are not used to control these generalist tick species. One of the few effective methods currently used for area-wide control of medically important ticks, including Ixodes scapularis Say (Acari: Ixodidae), is deployment of 4-poster devices. Deer self-apply a topical acaricide (permethrin) while feeding on corn from the devices. A 4-poster program using permethrin has been deployed on Shelter Island, NY to control I. scapularis populations since 2008. We collected engorged female ticks from deer in this management area and a location in the Mid-Hudson River Valley, NY without area-wide tick control. Larvae were reared from egg masses and their susceptibility to permethrin was tested. Larvae originating from a long-term laboratory colony were used as a susceptible baseline for comparison. Compared against the laboratory colony, resistance ratios at LC-50 for Shelter Island and Hudson Valley I. scapularis were 1.87 and 1.51, respectively. The susceptibilities of the field populations to permethrin were significantly lower than that of the colony ticks. We provide the first data using the larval packet test to establish baseline susceptibility for I. scapularis to permethrin along with information relevant to understanding resistance emergence in tick populations under sustained control pressure from 4-poster devices.

AB  - Estrus identification is one of the common issues in buffaloes because of their short estrus duration and silent estrus problem. Hence, specific biomarkers facilitating in identifying the estrus stage would be helpful to buffalo farmers and researchers. In our previous studies, taurine, a non-protein amino acid that helps in the secretion of reproductive hormones such as GnRH, was found to be associated with postpartum anestrus in buffaloes. Therefore, the present study was conducted to explore the level of taurine in serum during different stages of the oestrous cycle in healthy cyclic buffaloes. Blood samples were collected from healthy cyclic buffaloes (n = 4), and taurine was estimated at the estrus (0th day), proestrus (-2nd day), metestrus (3rd day) and diestrus (+10th day) stages using TLC method. The days of the oestrous cycle were determined by ultrasonography and observation of behavioural signs by trained professionals. The results revealed that taurine was consistently present in the serum. However, the highest concentration of taurine was observed at the proestrus (0.20 +/- 0.03 mg/mL) stage, which was greater (p < .05) than metestrus (0.10 +/- 0.05 mg/mL) and diestrus (0.13 +/- 0.03 mg/mL) stages, but comparable with the estrus stage. These results were also validated in the simulated population datasets of population size 6 to 10,000. Further, ROC curve analysis for the large simulated population indicated the efficiency of taurine to distinguish proestrus from metestrus and diestrus stages at a lower cutoff value of <0.1643 mg/mL with 60% sensitivity and specificity. Therefore, the present study concludes that serum taurine concentration could help in detecting proestrus stage of buffalo estrous cycle.

AB  - In order to optimize diets for Bengal tiger cubs and improve their health condition and survival rates, we conducted microbiota and metabolomics analyses on fecal samples from Bengal tiger cubs fed goat and dog milk replacer formulae. The results showed that there were significant differences in fecal microorganisms and metabolites between the two groups. At the phylum level, the major components of the microbial composition in the feces of cubs were Firmicutes, Actinobacteriota, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidota and Fusobacteriota. In addition, the abundance of gut microbiota varied significantly between the two groups of tiger cubs. The fecal microbiota of the tiger cubs fed dog milk replacer powder exhibited an increase in probiotic bacteria (Anaerostipes and Clostridium_scindens) (p < 0.05), and the microbial community tended to be more balanced. Metabolomics data further elucidated that feeding different milk formulae significantly affected the fecal metabolites and metabolic pathways in the Bengal tiger cubs. In the dog milk replacer powder group, 76 metabolites were up-regulated (p < 0.05), and 278 metabolites were down-regulated (p < 0.05), particularly affecting the metabolism of vitamin D3, vitamin B5, isoleucine, valine, phenylalanine and oleic acid. At the same time, 19 metabolic pathways were affected (p < 0.05), including the amino acid metabolism, lipid metabolism and nucleotide metabolism pathways. In conclusion, this study confirms that milk formula composition affects the gut microbiota and metabolism of Bengal tiger cubs. These findings may provide new insights into how different milk powder formulae and dietary strategies influence the regulation of gut microbiota and overall health in Bengal tiger cubs.

AB  - Simple Summary It is difficult to improve the reproductive performance of sheep (fecundity, fertility, and prolificacy) through the simple selection of animals that are outstanding due to phenotype. The genetic transmission of the reproductive performance to progeny is of low effectiveness for these types of traits, which is why traditional selection has not been successful. Presently, there is scarce information about the reproduction of Katahdin sheep and apparently no information about genes associated with reproductive traits. In this study, a genetic scan was conducted to detect genes associated with fecundity in Katahdin ewes. It was found that genes expressed in reproductive tissues tend to be reported frequently as candidates; that is, they are genes that directly influence the fecundity of ewes: CNOT11, GLUD1, GRID1, MAPK8, and CCL28. Other genes have indirect influence, for example, those that affect hormonal processes such as lipid synthesis: ADIRF, CCL28, and HMGCS1. New genes associated with the fecundity of Katahdin ewes are reported in this study. One of the strategies to genetically improve reproductive traits, despite their low inheritability, has been the identification of candidate genes. Therefore, the objective of this study was to detect candidate genes associated with fecundity through the fixation index (F-ST) and runs of homozygosity (ROH) of selection signatures in Katahdin ewes. Productive and reproductive records from three years were used and the genotypes (OvineSNP50K) of 48 Katahdin ewes. Two groups of ewes were identified to carry out the genetic comparison: with high fecundity (1.3 +/- 0.03) and with low fecundity (1.1 +/- 0.06). This study shows for the first time evidence of the influence of the CNOT11, GLUD1, GRID1, MAPK8, and CCL28 genes in the fecundity of Katahdin ewes; in addition, new candidate genes were detected for fecundity that were not reported previously in ewes but that were detected for other species: ANK2 (sow), ARHGAP22 (cow and buffalo cow), GHITM (cow), HERC6 (cow), DPF2 (cow), and TRNAC-GCA (buffalo cow, bull). These new candidate genes in ewes seem to have a high expression in reproduction. Therefore, future studies are needed focused on describing the physiological basis of changes in the reproductive behavior influenced by these genes.

AB  - Sanitization by pH adjustment of dairy and pig slurries was evaluated for potential use as organic fertilizer in horticulture. This requires absence of Salmonella in 25 g of slurry and less than 1000 Escherichi coli colony-forming unit per gram of fresh slurry (Regulation (EU) 2019/1009). Additives used in the alkalinization and acidification treatments, included hydroxide-salts and nitrogen-based reactants to increase slurry pH to a basic range (9.0-11.0) and concentrated H2SO4 to decrease slurry pH to an acidic range (5.5-3.5). While low-cost urea was unable to increase the slurry pH above 9.5, ammonia efficiently increased slurry pH to the targeted values (but enhanced the emissions risk), whereas the effect of Ca(OH)(2) was hindered by its low solubility. Slurry sanitization by alkalinization was achieved at a pH of 9.5 for both slurries, using similar quantities of KOH or NaOH. KOH was selected for further tests since it provides a plant macronutrient. Acidification with concentrated H2SO4 was able to achieve sanitization by lowering the pH to 5.0. After a 60-d storage experiment with raw and treated slurries, the level of E. coli was below the sanitization limit for all samples. Storage had no significant impact on slurry characteristics, except for ammonium-nitrogen content. Acidification treatment minimized ammonia losses.

AB  - Maintaining an optimal indoor thermal environment is crucial for enhancing the welfare and productivity of livestock in intensive breeding farms. This paper investigated the application of a combined geothermal heat pump with a precision air supply (GHP-PAS) system for cooling dairy cows on a dairy farm. The effectiveness of the GHP-PAS system in mitigating heat stress in lactating dairy cattle, along with its energy performance and local cooling efficiency in the free stalls were evaluated. A total of 140 multiparous lactating Holstein cows was tested in two groups. One group was housed in a barn equipped with a GHP-PAS system (GP barn, n = 70), and the other was housed in a barn with a conventional fan-sprinkling system (FS barn, n = 70). Results showed that the ambient temperature of both GP and FS barns were lower than that outside the barn (P < 0.05), with no significant difference between the GP and FS barns (P > 0.05). Compared to cows in the FS barn, those in the GP barn exhibited lower skin temperature, rectal temperature, and respiratory rate (P < 0.05). The mean temperature difference between outflow and inflow water was 2.56( degrees)C of the GHP unit. The average energy efficiency ratios (EER) of the GHP unit and the GHP-PAS system were 5.03 and 2.92, respectively. The daily average electricity consumption was 20.4 +/- 1.0 kWh. The field test results indicated that the airflow from a single nozzle of the GHP-PAS system effectively covered a stall space with an average width of 1.84 m at a cow reclining height of 0.5 m, with an average air velocity of 1 m/s. The per-cow hourly electricity consumption for cooling was 2.04 kWh for the GHP-PAS system and 0.36 kWh for the FS system, highlighting that the GHP-PAS system is approximately 5.6 times more energy-intensive than the FS system. In conclusion, the GHP-PAS system showed the potential for alleviating heat stress in dairy cows. Further research is needed to enhance the energy efficiency and cooling effectiveness of the current GHP-PAS system.

AB  - Biochar was derived from rice straw pyrolyzed at 400 degrees C, and biochar was added to the excess sludge at the ratio of 10% DS, 25% DS, and 50% DS as a supplementary skeleton for sludge Fenton pre-treatment. Rice husk biochar mixed with fungus residue as compost conditioner. In this study, we explored the effects of seven groups of composting materials on the composting effect and fertilizer quality under different pre-treatment methods of Fenton-pretreated sludge cake and conventional dewatered sludge cake, and different biochar additions. Specifically, we conducted a 22-day composting experiment using a composting reactor to investigate the effect of rice husk biochar combined with Fenton oxidation on the physicochemical properties of sludge composting. The results of this study showed that the FB50 group significantly increased the composting rate. Nutrient analysis showed that the FB50 group was rich in fertilizer nutrients, such as available phosphorus, and alkali-hydrolyzable nitrogen content increased. Heavy metals (Cu, Cd, Cr, Pb, Zn, Ni) met China's 'Agricultural Sludge Pollutant Control Standard' GB 4284-2018 Grade A standard, with obvious passivation and significantly reduced bioavailability. All these results suggested that biochar coupled with Fenton oxidation was more beneficial to sludge composting.

AB  - Livestock slurry has gathered significant interest as a secondary raw material for fertilisers industry due to its content on macronutrients -nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium- and organic carbon. In this study, the performance of an on-site pilot plant composed by microfiltration, membrane-assisted stripping, and reverse osmosis for selective recovery of nitrogen as fertiliser and water reclamation was demonstrated for 2 years in a pig farm, referenced to 8 batches for seasonal assessment. Microfiltration mitigated the seasonal variation in the composition of pig slurry leading to stable process efficiency in the following steps. Membrane-assisted stripping resulted in the recovery of up to 56% of nitrogen as high-purity ammonium sulphate, and up to 42% of reclaimed water as reverse osmosis permeate. The proposed train of technologies reported proper performance and robustness during the whole demonstration period as it resulted in the production of reclaimed water and ammonium sulphate with no significant quality variations. The energy cost for both products obtained in this study was found in the average of the previous works reviewed with 12.49 kWh kg(-1) NH3 produced, and 0.37 kWh m(-3) of reclaimed water. The environmental assessment showed that nitrogen losses could be reduced by up to 90 kg N ha(-1) d(-1) by replacing manure spreading with precise fertilisation techniques, enabled by the selective recovery of nitrogen from SLF. Finally, the financial study showed that the scaling up of the proposed train of technologies would result in benefits for farms with more than 1600 pig heads.

AB  - White-tailed deer (WTD) spread communicable diseases such as the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which is a major public health concern, and chronic wasting disease (CWD), a fatal, highly contagious, brain disease occurring in species of the deer family. Currently, it is not well understood how WTD are spreading these diseases. In this paper, we speculate that "super-spreaders" mediate disease transmission via direct social interactions and indirectly via body fluids exchanged at scrape sites. Super-spreaders are infected individuals that infect more contacts than other infectious individuals within a population. Using social network analysis, we identified potential superspreaders among multiple communities of a rural WTD herd in Mississippi. Analysis of age structure revealed that the majority of potential super-spreaders were young males, less than 2.5 years of age. We also compared infection risk across the landscape by combining social network analysis and heatmapping software to locate disease transmission hotspots, where the risk of disease transmission is higher as compared to other locations. We also monitored predator and hunting activity and hunter deer harvests to better understand how predators influence social networks and potential disease transmission. We found that predator activity influenced the age structure of male WTD communities. We assessed disease-management strategies by social-network modeling using hunter harvests or the removal of potential super-spreaders, which fragmented WTD social networks reducing the potential spread of disease. Overall, this study demonstrates a model for predicting potential super-spreaders of diseases, describes new methods to locate transmission hotspots, and provides new knowledge for disease management and prevention strategies.
   White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus, WTD) spread communicable diseases such the zoonotic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which is a major public health concern, and chronic wasting disease (CWD), a fatal, highly contagious prion disease occurring in cervids. Currently, it is not well understood how WTD are spreading these diseases. In this paper, we speculate that "super-spreaders" mediate disease transmission via direct social interactions and indirectly via body fluids exchanged at scrape sites. Super-spreaders are infected individuals that infect more contacts than other infectious individuals within a population. In this study, we used network analysis from scrape visitation data to identify potential super-spreaders among multiple communities of a rural WTD herd. We combined local network communities to form a large region-wide social network consisting of 96 male WTD. Analysis of WTD bachelor groups and random network modeling demonstrated that scraping networks depict real social networks, allowing detection of direct and indirect contacts, which could spread diseases. Using this regional network, we model three major types of potential super-spreaders of communicable disease: in-degree, out-degree, and betweenness potential super-spreaders. We found out-degree and betweenness potential super-spreaders to be critical for disease transmission across multiple communities. Analysis of age structure revealed that potential super-spreaders were mostly young males, less than 2.5 years of age. We also used social network analysis to measure the outbreak potential across the landscape using a new technique to locate disease transmission hotspots. To model indirect transmission risk, we developed the first scrape-to-scrape network model demonstrating connectivity of scrape sites. Comparing scrape betweenness scores allowed us to locate high-risk transmission crossroads between communities. We also monitored predator activity, hunting activity, and hunter harvests to better understand how predation influences social networks and potential disease transmission. We found that predator activity significantly influenced the age structure of scraping communities. We assessed disease-management strategies by social-network modeling using hunter harvests or removal of potential super-spreaders, which fragmented WTD social networks reducing the potential spread of disease. Overall, this study demonstrates a model capable of predicting potential super-spreaders of diseases, outlines methods to locate transmission hotspots and community crossroads, and provides new insight for disease management and outbreak prevention strategies.

AB  - Leopards Panthera pardus are top predators that play a crucial role in maintaining ecosystem balance and stability by exerting top-down control on prey species populations through direct predation. Despite their wide distribution, in recent years leopard populations have become endangered in many regions due to increasing anthropogenic activity. Studying the feeding habits of endangered species provides insight into their survival from the perspective of their trophic niche and can help identify factors contributing to their decline, aiding in the development of targeted conservation strategies. In this study, the North China leopard (P. p. japonensis) and Amur leopard (P. p. orientalis) were selected as the study objects. A total of 97 fecal samples were collected throughout their typical habitats, 83 of which were confirmed as originating from leopards using molecular identification. DNA metabarcoding identified 13 prey species for the North China leopard and 15 for the Amur leopard, with small- and medium-sized prey (< 37 kg) comprising over 75% of biomass intake. Among all the prey species, roe deer (Capreolus pygargus) provided the highest biomass contribution-41.69% for the North China leopard and 29.2% for the Amur leopard. In addition, the frequent occurrence of domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) in their diet (> 5.8%) highlights the impact of anthropogenic activities on leopard feeding habits. To support leopard conservation, it is recommended to protect all prey species within reserves and reduce anthropogenic interference in these habitats.

AB  - Obesity, caused by a high-fat diet (HFD) in elderly, is a risk factor for insulin resistance and a precursor to diabetes and can lead to impaired cognitive function. Physical exercise has positive effects on decrease obesity and improvement brain function. We investigated which type of aerobic (AE) or resistance (RE) exercise can be more effective in reducing HFD-induced cognitive dysfunction in obese elderly rats. 48 male Wistar rats (19-monthold) were divided into six groups: Healthy control (CON), CON+AE, CON+RE, HFD, HFD+AE, and HFD+RE. Obesity was induced by 5 months of HFD feeding in older rats. After obesity confirmation, RT (with a range of 50% to 100%1RM/3 days/week) and AE (running at 8-m/min for 15-min to 26-m/min for 60-min /5 days/week) was performed for 12-weeks. Morris water maze Test was used to evaluate cognitive performance. All data were analyzed using two-way statistical test of variance. The results showed that obesity had a negative effect on glycemic index, increased inflammation, decreased antioxidant levels, decreased BDNF/TrkB and decreased nerve density in hippocampal tissue. The Morris water maze results clearly showed cognitive impairment in the obesity group. But 12 weeks after AE and RE, all the measured variables were on the improvement path, and in general, no difference was observed between the two exercise methods. Two mods of exercise (AE and RE) may be having same effects on nerve cell density, inflammatory, antioxidant and functional status of hippocampus of obese rats. Each of the AE and RE can create beneficial effects on the cognitive function of the elderly.

AB  - This study investigates the effects of replacing fish meal with fermented feather meal-soybean meal product (FFSMP) from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens CU33 in the starter on growth performance, relative health performance, and digestibility of Alpine goat kids. In trial 1, thirty-two Alpine goat kids (male) were randomly assigned to dietary supplementation of 2% feather meal-soybean meal mix (FSM), 2% fish meal, or replacing fish meal with 50% or 100% FFSMP (FFSMP-50 or FFSMP-100) in starter (n = 8). In trial 2, sixteen goat kids were selected after trial 1 and used in this digestion trial which began from 12 weeks old. The treatments were the same as in trial 1 (n = 4). In trial 1, the growth performance of the FFSMP groups was better than the FSM group at 0 to 10 weeks (p < 0.05). The fecal consistency index of the FFSMP-100 group was better than the FSM group at 0 to 5 weeks and 5 to 10 weeks. In trial 2, the crude protein (CP) digestibility of the FSM group decreased (p < 0.05). In conclusion, dietary supplementation with 2% FFSMP in goat kids' diets can improve the growth performance, the CP digestibility, and diarrhea status, and it can completely replace the fish meal in starter diets.

AB  - Aesculus chinensis Bunge, a deciduous tree in the genus Aesculus of the Hippocastanaceae family, has ornamental, economic, and medicinal values. But the scarcity of comprehensive genetic data hinders the utilization of this species, especially the EST-SSR markers in A. chinensis Bunge have not been reported previously. In this study, the transcriptomes of A. chinensis Bunge were assembled from novo, which enabled the identification of 33,365 unigenes with a mean length of 1348 bp. The sum of 25450 (76.27%) unigenes showed similarities with at least one database including Nr (71.39%), Swiss Prot (57.03%), GO (53.31%), KO (27.13%) and KOG (19.27%). Based on the transcriptome data collected for A. chinensis Bunge, 16,103 SSR loci were detected with a distribution density of one SSR per 2.79 kb. The most dinucleotide and trinucleotide repeats were AG/CT and AAG/CTT. Then 58 primer pairs were randomly selected for polymorphism validation and 31 primer pairs were polymorphic among eight Aesculus samples. There were 167 alleles detected, varying from 2 to 9 with a mean of 5.387 alleles per locus. According to the allelic variation, 7 primers were capable of distinguishing the 8 Aesculus samples from 6 species. These findings will be useful for the conservation, genetic diversity assessment and molecular identification of Aesculus resources.

AB  - Porcine artificial insemination primarily utilizes liquid-preserved (17 degrees C) semen; however, the quality of sperm diminishes progressively with extended preservation time. Ergothioneine (EGT) is a mitochondria-targeting antioxidant. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze the effect of various concentrations of EGT (0, 0.15, 0.3, and 0.6 mM) on the quality of boar sperm during in vitro liquid preservation and elucidate the underlying mechanisms of the mitochondrial electron respiratory chain inhibitor ROT. The results demonstrated that the addition of 0.3 mM EGT to the modified Modena extender significantly improved sperm motility and kinetic parameters, as well as mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), adenosine triphosphate (ATP), antioxidant capacity, and the integrity of both the sperm plasma membrane and acrosome. Additionally, ROT significantly inhibited sperm motility, kinetic parameters, MMP, ATP levels, antioxidant capacity, and sperm integrity of the plasma membrane and acrosome. However, these adverse effects could be partially mitigated by the addition of 0.3 mM EGT. In conclusion, the novel findings of this study indicated that EGT plays a crucial role in protecting sperm from oxidative damage by regulating the mitochondrial electron respiratory chain, suggesting that the use of EGT is a promising approach for enhancing the in vitro liquid preservation efficiency of boar semen at 17 degrees C.

AB  - Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disorder impacting cerebral function. The administration of Streptozotocin (STZ) is a well-known animal model of insulinopenic type 1 DM in rats. STZ-induced DM results in a myriad of alteration in the periphery and central nervous system (CNS). Cerebrolysin (CBL) is a neuropeptide preparation that promotes synaptic and neuronal plasticity in various animal models. In all cases, CBL was administered when the model was established. This research aims to investigate the neuroprotective and neurorepair effect of CBL on the cytoarchitecture of neurons and spine density in pyramidal neurons of the prefrontal (PFC) and the CA1 region of the dorsal hippocampus, as well as spheroidal neurons of the dentate gyrus (DG), in STZ-induced DM. In the first experimental condition, STZ and CBL are administered at the same time to evaluate the potential preventive effect of CBL. In the second experimental condition, CBL was administered two months after establishing the DM model to measure the potential neurorepair effect of CBL. STZ-induced hyperglycemia remained unaltered by the administration of CBL in both experimental conditions. In the first experimental condition, CBL treatment preserved the neuronal morphology in PFC layer 3, PFC layer 5 and the DG of the hippocampus, while also maintaining spine density in the PFC-3, DG and CA1 hippocampus. Furthermore, CBL induced neurorepair in neurons within the PFC-3, PFC-5 and CA1 regions of the hippocampus, along with an increase in spine density in the PFC-3, DG and CA1 hippocampus. These findings suggest that CBL <acute accent>s effects on neuroplasticity could be observed before or after the damage was evident.

AB  - Natural fibres constitute interesting, low cost and environmentally friendly precursors of carbon fibres. However, they are prone to fuse and degrade upon thermal treatment, affecting the properties of the products unless a stabilization step was included. Aiming to reach a better understanding of the stabilization mechanism of wool as a potential precursor for the preparation of carbon fibres, in this study we have analysed the chemical, structural and morphological transformations during its oxidative stabilization in air. Below 400 ?C, both the structure and morphology of the fibres were preserved. The chemical composition changed with the stabilization temperature; main changes include the loss of secondary protein structure, cleavage of sulphur bridges, dehydration, oxidative crosslinking and rearrangements of N-groups through the formation of carbodiimides. Oxidation of the wool at 300 ?C rendered materials with a fibrous morphology and high carbon yield (ca. 36 wt%), yielding carbon fibres upon carbonization at high temperatures.

AB  - Simple Summary Long-term exposure to hypoxia, a major source of cellular stress, can induce hypoxia-related diseases and even death. Mitochondria play an important role in mediating the energy production response to hypoxia, but little is known about the mechanisms involved. Tibetan sheep are mainly distributed across the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, where they have adapted well to hypoxia after long-term adaptation. In this work, a systematic analysis of the blood indexes, tissue morphology, mRNA and miRNA expression regulation, and changes in the mitochondrial function of Tibetan sheep at different altitudes was carried out to provide insights into the mechanism of animal adaptation to hypoxia and the progression of hypoxia-related illness. This study aimed to provide insights into molecular regulation and mitochondrial functionality under hypoxia by exploring the mechanism of adaptation to hypoxia, blood indexes, tissue morphology, mRNA/miRNA regulation, mitochondrial dynamics, and functional changes in Tibetan sheep raised at different altitudes. With regard to blood indexes and myocardial morphology, the HGB, HCT, CK, CK-MB, LDH, LDH1, SOD, GPX, LDL level, and myocardial capillary density were significantly increased in the sheep at higher altitudes (p < 0.05). The RNA-seq results suggested the DEmRNAs and DEmiRNAs are mainly associated with the PI3K-Akt, Wnt, and PPAR signaling pathways and with an upregulation of oncogenes (CCKBR, GSTT1, ARID5B) and tumor suppressor factors (TPT1, EXTL1, ITPRIP) to enhance the cellular metabolism and increased ATP production. Analyzing mRNA-miRNA coregulation indicated the mitochondrial dynamics and functions to be significantly enriched. By analyzing mitochondrial dynamics, mitochondrial fusion was shown to be significantly increased and fission significantly decreased in the heart with increasing altitude (p < 0.05). There was a significant increase in the density of the mitochondria, and a significant decrease in the average area, aspect ratio, number, and width of single mitochondrial cristae with increasing altitudes (p < 0.05). There was a significant increase in the NADH, NAD+ and ATP content, NADH/NAD+ ratio, and CO activity, while there was a significant decrease in SDH and CA activity in various tissues with increasing altitudes (p < 0.05). Accordingly, changes in the blood indexes and myocardial morphology of the Tibetan sheep were found to improve the efficiency of hemoglobin-carrying oxygen and reduce oxidative stress. The high expression of oncogenes and tumor suppressor factors might facilitate cell division and energy exchange, as was evident from enhanced mitochondrial fission and OXPHOS expression; however, it reduced the fusion and TCA cycle for the further rapid production of ATP in adaptation to hypoxia stress. This systematic study has for the first time delineated the mechanism of hypoxia adaptation in the heart of Tibetan sheep, which is significant for improving the ability of the mammals to adapt to hypoxia and for studying the dynamic regulation of mitochondria during hypoxia conditions.

AB  - Simple Summary Our research question considered whether exogenous glutamate administration would enhance serum insulin levels linked to augmented ovarian activity in yearling goats during the anestrous season. The obtained research outcomes support our initial working hypothesis. Certainly, we found that glutamate evokes serum insulin increases across time, enhancing in parallel the out-of-season ovarian activity, which is an augmented ovulation rate in yearling goats. The neuroendocrine regulation of the seasonal reproductive axis requires the integration of internal and external signals to ensure synchronized physiological and behavioral responses. Seasonal reproductive changes contribute to intermittent production, which poses challenges for optimizing goat product yields. Consequently, a significant objective in seasonal reproduction research is to attain continuous reproduction and enhance profitability in goat farming. Glutamate plays a crucial role as a modulator in several reproductive and metabolic processes. Hence, the aim of this study was to evaluate the potential impact of exogenous glutamate administration on serum insulin concentration and ovarian function during the out-of-season period in yearling goats. During the anestrous season, animals were randomly located in individual pens to form two experimental groups: (1) glutamate (n = 10, live weight (LW) = 29.1 & PLUSMN; 1.02 kg, body condition score (BCS) = 3.4 & PLUSMN; 0.2 units) and (2) control (n = 10; LW = 29.2 & PLUSMN; 1.07 kg, BCS = 3.5 & PLUSMN; 0.2), with no differences (p < 0.05) regarding LW and BCS. Then, goats were estrus-synchronized, and blood sampling was carried out for insulin quantification. Ovaries were ultrasonographically scanned to assess ovulation rate (OR), number of antral follicles (AFs), and total ovarian activity (TOA = OR + AF). The research outcomes support our working hypothesis. Certainly, our study confirms that those yearling goats treated with exogenous glutamate displayed the largest (p < 0.05) insulin concentrations across time as well as an augmented (p < 0.05) out-of-season ovarian activity.

The genuine Gangba mutton was selected as the experimental group, and the commercial Tibetan mutton was selected as the control group, the nutritive composition of basic chemical components, amino acids and fatty acids in mutton were investigated to correlate its unique meat quality and eating satisfaction. The results showed that fatty acids were significantly higher (P<0.05) in Gangba mutton than in commercial mutton, and the higher content of flavoring amino acids (glutamic acid and aspartame) were primarily responsible for the taste attributes umami of meat juices. Moreover, the trace elements analysis in mutton and grazing factors (forage, water source and soil) were conducted, to explain the source of essential trace elements in mutton. The concentrations of essential trace elements show that the Gangba mutton was a valuable source for highly available Cu and Zn in human nutrition, and well managed with few detected of toxicity metal. The concentrations of essential trace elements in mutton are closely related to the trace elements in environmental grazing factors. In conclusion, the congenital grazing conditions (a highly mineralized water resource, natural forages and clean soils) were shown to contribute to the unique meat characteristics of Gangba sheep.

AB  - The electron-electron double resonance (DEER) method, which provides distance distributions between two spin labels, attached site specifically to biomolecules (proteins and nucleic acids), is currently a well-recognized biophysical tool in structural biology. The most commonly used spin labels are based on nitroxide stable radicals, conjugated to the proteins primarily via native or engineered cysteine residues. However, in recent years, new spin labels, along with different labeling chemistries, have been introduced, driven in part by the desire to study structural and dynamical properties of biomolecules in their native environment, the cell. This mini-review focuses on these new spin labels, which allow for DEER on orthogonal spin labels, and on the state of the art methods for in-cell DEER distance measurements.

AB  - SINEs are one type of the most frequently found DNA repetitive sequences in the eukaryotic genome. The polymorphism generated by SINE insertion may affect proximal host genes and even cause phenotypic variations in domestic animals. Glycine N-acyltransferase-like 3 (GLYATL3) is a member of the N-acyltransferase family which may play a role in amino acid and fatty acid metabolism. Previous studies have identified short interspersed nuclear element (SINE) insertion sites in the 5 ' UTR region of GLYATL3. This study investigated the effects of the 294 bp SINE insertion on GLYATL3 expression and phenotypic variation. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to determine the distribution of GLYATL3-SINE-RIP in 15 pig breeds. SINE insertions were absent in hybrid pigs and present in all purebred pigs. Correlation analysis further revealed significant differences in SINE+/+ and SINE-/- individuals when they reached 30 kg of body weight. In light of these findings, qPCR revealed that the SINE insertion significantly increased GLYATL3 expression in the cerebellum of Mi pigs. Additionally, dual-luciferase reporter assays confirmed that the SINE insertion significantly enhanced the activity of the Oct4 promoter. Preliminary evidence indicates the SINE insertion may modulate an increase in the growth rate of pigs through transcriptional regulation of GLYATL3. As a new type marker, this SINE-insertion polymorphism may assist genetic selection to optimize growth traits in porcine breeding programs.

AB  - Camellia sect. Thea contains plants of beverage sources with huge profits. Their natural germplasm resources have yet to be fully explored. Here, morphological, phenological and phylogenetic analyses were undertaken to reveal a new species of tea plants, C. yangii D.Wei Zhao. It is described with an illustration and photos of fresh characters provided. The new species is similar to C. fangchengensis and C. ptilophylla by the densely pubescent new branchlets, abaxial surface of leaves and pedicel, but differs from them in bearing a larger flower, fewer (3 vs. 5) but larger sepals, and the indumentum of the sepals. Molecular phylogenetic analysis using RPB2 introns 11-15 and 23 and waxy suggests that it is a member of C. sect. Thea and its phylogenetically closely related species are C. longissima and C. taliensis. Camellia yangii has a later flowering phase compared with other taxa of C. sect. Thea that occurred or were planted nearby, so it cannot naturally hybridize with other tea plants. The new species bears a red or purplish red and densely pubescent terminal bud, which suggests it is a rare germplasm resource of tea plants. Camellia yangii is only known from a single extremely vulnerable population and strict conservation and asexual propagations are urgently needed to avoid extinction.

AB  - BACKGROUND Plant pathogens and pests often occur together, causing damage while interfering with plant growth. The effects of phytopathogenic infections on plant-herbivore-natural enemy tri-trophic interactions (TTIs) have been extensively investigated, but little is known about how the interval of infection influences such relationships. Here, the effect of rice plants infected by the phytopathogen Rhizoctonia solani on the herbivorous rice brown planthopper (BPH) and associated egg parasitoid Anagrus nilaparvatae over a temporal scale was examined.
   RESULTS Our results showed that rice plants infected by R. solani showed increased volatile profiles and significantly attracted BPH and A. nilaparvatae at 5-15 days post infection (DPI) and 5-10 DPI, respectively, when compared with healthy plants. Jasmonic acid and salicylic acid content decreased significantly in BPH-damaged plants after 15 DPI, whereas oxalic acid accumulated soon after 5 DPI when compared with healthy plants. To adapt to adverse environment, BPH laid more eggs and developed into macropterous adults. Under field conditions, R. solani infection had no substantial effect on the arthropod community when compared with healthy plants.
   CONCLUSION Taken together, R. solani infection altered rice-pest-parasitoid TTIs over a temporal scale. This result will shed more light on our understanding of plant pathogen-insect cross-talk essential for developing novel pest management strategies.

AB  - The rapid growth in livestock farming since the late 1960s has resulted in problems managing excess waste excreted from livestock. A study on the water quality of groundwater, river water, and soil solution clarified that groundwater pollution by nitrate nitrogen was caused by nitrogenous compounds permeating livestock wastes under inappropriate waste management, including dumping and/or digging in. The appropriate treatment of livestock waste as compost and liquid fertilizer improved nitrate nitrogen pollution. The full-scale enforcement of "The Law Concerning the Appropriate Treatment and Promotion of Utilization of Livestock Manure" in 2004 reduced inappropriate waste management practices such as dumping and/or digging in. In 2019, all livestock farms installed comprehensive waste management facilities for composting, wastewater treatment, and other measures. However some issues remain to be resolved relating to the inappropriate operation of facilities and the existence of facilities aged over 20 years, which may cause pollution problems. In addition, elution of nitrate nitrogen from place of use digging in requires care even now. In 2021, an investigation report on livestock waste management was published by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. Most solid livestock waste matter is converted into compost, which can be widely distributed on croplands of agricultural farms. Broiler litter is used for combustion energy. Liquid dairy cattle waste is applied on croplands. Wastewater from pig farms is purified with an activated sludge process to obtain clear water that complies with effluent standards and then is discharged into rivers and public waters. An appropriate application rate of compost on croplands is recommended to promote the recycling of organic and nitrogen resources and to control nitrate nitrogen in groundwater.

AB  - The hypothalamic molecular processes participate in the regulation of the neuro-immune-endocrine system, including hormone, metabolite, chemokine circulation, and corresponding physiological and behavioral responses. RNA-sequencing profiles were analyzed to understand the effect of juvenile immune and metabolic distress 100 days after virally elicited maternal immune activation during gestation in pigs. Over 1,300 genes exhibited significant additive or interacting effects of gestational immune activation, juvenile distress, and sex. One-third of these genes presented multiple effects, emphasizing the complex interplay of these factors. Key functional categories enriched among affected genes included sensory perception of pain, steroidogenesis, prolactin, neuropeptide, and inflammatory signaling. These categories underscore the intricate relationship between gestational immune activation during gestation, distress, and the response of hypothalamic pathways to insults. These effects were sex-dependent for many genes, such as Prdm12, Oprd1, Isg20, Prl, Oxt, and Vip. The prevalence of differentially expressed genes annotated to proinflammatory and cell cycle processes suggests potential implications for synaptic plasticity and neuronal survival. The gene profiles affected by immune activation, distress, and sex pointed to the action of transcription factors SHOX2, STAT1, and REST. These findings underscore the importance of considering sex and postnatal challenges when studying causes of neurodevelopmental disorders and highlight the complexity of the "two-hit" hypothesis in understanding their etiology. Our study furthers the understanding of the intricate molecular responses in the hypothalamus to gestational immune activation and subsequent distress, shedding light on the sex-specific effects and the potential long-lasting consequences on pain perception, neuroendocrine regulation, and inflammatory processes.

AB  - Composting is an environment-friendly and sustainable way to transform grape branches (GBs) into a useful product. Different parameters can differently affect fertilizer quality. Here, the compost product nutrient content was evaluated using an L9 orthogonal array (parameters, nitrogen source: chicken manure, sheep manure, urea; stirring temperature: 50, 60, 70 & DEG;C; initial pH: 6, 7, 8; conditioning agent: calcium superphosphate, zeolite, and copper sulfate). Among the treatments, the T3 (chicken manure, 70 & DEG;C, pH = 8, copper sulfate), T2 (chicken manure, 60 & DEG;C, pH = 7, zeolite), and T9 (urea, 70 & DEG;C, pH = 7, calcium superphosphate) had high gray relational grades (0.7424, 0.7132, 0.7110, respectively). The nitrogen source type (R = 0.1140) had the greatest influence on the nutrient content of the final product, followed by the stirring temperature (R = 0.1104), the conditioning agent (R = 0.0522), and the initial pH (R = 0.0408). Finally, the best nitrogen source of the grape branch compost was chicken manure, the best stirring temperature was 70 & DEG;C, the best initial pH was 7, and the best conditioning agent was zeolite. An experimental verification showed that the weighted correlation degree of the optimal treatment predicted by the orthogonal experiment increased by 3.63%.

AB  - Reactive oxygen species (ROS) exert a vital role in sperm quality during semen preservation, where excessive ROS leads to oxidative damage and undermines sperm integrity. Curcumin, a botanical extract, is capable of neutralizing ROS and enhancing the activity of antioxidant enzymes. This study was aimed at evaluating the effects of curcumin on sperm viability, acrosome integrity, and antioxidant levels, as well as metabolomic and lipidomic profiles. The results demonstrated that curcumin at 25 mu mol/L significantly enhanced sperm motility, plasma membrane, and acrosome integrity, elevated the levels of antioxidant enzymes (T-AOC, CAT, SOD), and decreased ROS production (p < 0.05). Metabolomic analysis identified 93 distinct metabolites that showed significant differences between the control and curcumin-treated groups. KEGG pathways emphasized the participation of these metabolites in key metabolic processes such as the citric acid cycle, cholesterol metabolism, and fatty acid metabolism. Curcumin treatment brought about notable variations in lipid profiles, including increased levels of phosphatidylcholine, acylcarnitine, and triglyceride over the storage time, suggesting enhanced lipid anabolic activity. Overall, the supplementation of curcumin at 25 <mu>mol/L effectively mitigates oxidative stress and prolongs the viability of semen storage at 16 degrees C by modulating specific metabolic and lipid profiles.

AB  - Fodder scarcity, inadequate nutritional quality, and lack of degradation kinetics research are among the serious concerns hindering sustainable development of livestock globally. Rumen degradation kinetics data on neutral detergent fibre (NDF) in buffaloes are lacking for most tropical forage species. This study evaluated the effect of forage species, family, and growing location on NDF concentration and in situ degradability of six tropical cereal and four legume fodder crops. The fodder crops were grown following uniform recommended agronomic practices at three different agroecological locations and harvested at the appropriate growth stage: cereals at booting and legumes at 50% flowering. Later, the dried ground forage samples were incubated in the four rumen-cannulated Nili-Ravi buffalo cows in a four x two x three split-plot design for 0, 4, 8, 16, 24, 48, 96, and 168 h. The degradation fractions and degradability, expressed either on an NDF or dry matter basis, were considerably affected by forage family (cereal vs. legume) and growing locations and their interaction. Legume fodders degraded more rapidly but to a lesser extent than cereal fodders. The chemical components, notably the NDF, showed a significant but moderate negative relationship with the effective NDF degradability. Among studied fodders, the legumes had a significantly lower NDF concentration and subsequent degradability than the cereals. Although the cereals showed a slower rate of NDF degradation, their overall degradability was higher. The agro-climatic variability among three locations strongly impacted the NDF concentrations and fractions in the tropical forages. Effective NDF degradability was also correlated with the fodders' NDF concentration, especially in cereals where the nature of the correlation was negative. In conclusion, the nutritional composition and NDF degradation parameters of the fodders were significantly affected by the species, family, and location of growth and their interactions. These results will help to improve agronomy and usage of these important fodder crops.

AB  - Facing of increasingly serious resource and environmental constraints, the adoption of green technology has become the key to driving the green production transformation of farmers under the constraints of environmental regulation. Whether environmental regulation can improve the adoption of green technology in breeding industry still needs to be further tested. Based on the survey data of 544 pig farmers in Sichuan, Shandong, Henan and Hebei provinces, this paper first measures the adoption degree of green breeding technology by using the coefficient of variation method. Then, the econometric model is used to empirically test the relationship between environmental regulation and farmers' adoption of green technology. The results show that: firstly, environmental regulation can improve the adoption of green technology by farmers; Economic incentive regulation and educational guidance regulation can significantly improve the adoption of green technology by farmers from the perspective of environmental regulation. Secondly, environmental regulation has different effects on the adoption of green technology of different attributes of farmers. Its effect on the adoption of resource utilization technology is higher than that of harmless treatment technology and higher than that of reduction technology. Different dimensions of environmental regulation have different effects on the adoption of green technology by farmers with different attributes. Thirdly, the impact of environmental regulation on the adoption of green technology by different scale farmers is different, and its impact on high-scale farmers is more obvious. At the same time, different dimensions of environmental regulation have different effects on the adoption of green technology by farmers of different sizes.

A two-month 2 x 2 factorial experiment was conducted using 32 healthy five-month-old male fawns randomly assigned to four groups: P18E8 (18% CP, 8% EE), P18E4 (18% CP, 4% EE), P15E8 (15% CP, 8% EE), and P15E4 (15% CP, 4% EE). The P18E4 group showed the highest total weight gain and average daily gain (p < 0.05), along with greater apparent digestibility of dry matter, crude protein, calcium, and fiber fractions (p < 0.05). Serum urea content was significantly lower in this group, indicating improved nitrogen utilization (p < 0.05). Dominant fecal microbiota at the phylum level across all groups included Firmicutes_A and Bacteroidota, with the P18E4 group showing a unique genus composition within Bacteroidota, known for enhancing fiber digestion. In summary, a diet with 18% CP and 4% EE optimized growth performance, nutrient digestibility, and gut microbiota composition, providing a strategy for improving the health and productivity of sika deer fawns during overwintering.

AB  - Simple Summary The Chinese goral (Naemorhedus griseus) is listed as a national second-class key protected wild animal in China. It is the only high level protected wild ungulate in Beijing. However, it faces threats that include habitat fragmentation and the disappearance of local populations. Population viability analysis (PVA) is one of the main ways to project the future abundance of species and provide reliable information for developing effective protection strategies. Through a pilot study, we found that the studied population in Beijing Yunmengshan Nature Reserve will initially increase in the next 20 years and then decrease with a 32% probability of extinction risk. Supplementation would help this population survive. The results show that vital limiting factors include the initial population size, sex ratio at birth, and mortality of infants.Abstract The Chinese goral (Naemorhedus griseus) is identified as a vulnerable species on the Red List of China's Biodiversity and listed as a national second-class key protected wild animal in China. It is a representative flagship ungulate in Beijing. Its distribution range is fragmented and small populations are separated by dense infrastructures and tourism sites. Understanding its population status provides a foundation to plan effective conservation strategies. In this study, a population viability analysis was conducted with VORTEX (10.5.6.0) on a Chinese goral population in Beijing Yunmengshan Nature Reserve with the data collected by camera trapping and parameters referenced from other goral populations. The results show that this population will initially increase in the next 20 years and then decrease with a 32% probability of extinction risk. Supplementation with four adults, two females and two males, every 10 years would help minimize the extinction risk of this population. The results highlight the vital limiting factors for Chinese goral, including the initial population size, sex ratio at birth and mortality of infants (especially female infants). To improve the protection efficiency, detailed population parameters should be further acquired through continuous monitoring of this population. A thorough large-scale study should be carried out on other segregated goral populations in Beijing to facilitate the recovery of this endangered species.

AB  - Residues from broccoli stems and leaves, which are generated during broccoli (Brassica oleracea L. var. italica) processing, are commonly discarded, contributing to environmental pollution due to their high moisture content. However, these residues are protein-rich and can be repurposed as animal feed. Fermentation further enhances their nutritional value by introducing probiotic bacteria and bioactive components. This study evaluated the influences of fermented broccoli residues (FBR) on fattening pig growth performance, nutrient utilization, and pork properties. The results demonstrated that FBR supplementation influenced meat quality, improved muscle antioxidant capacity, and reduced digestibility of finishing pigs without significantly altering amino acid composition and impacting growth and carcass traits. The study determined the impacts of dietary fermented residues' (FBR) inclusion on growth, nutrient utilization, carcass characteristics, and meat properties in fattening pigs. Seventy-two robust pigs were randomly assigned to two experimental groups (Duroc x Landrace x Yorkshire, thirty-six pigs each). Each group was subjected to a 52-day trial, during which they received either a corn-soybean meal-based diet or diet enhanced with a 10% addition of FBR. Consequently, adding 10% FBR caused a significant decrease in the digestive utilization of crude dietary components in fattening pigs (p < 0.05) but showed no significant impact on the growth performance. Additionally, FBR inclusion increased the marbling scores (p < 0.05) and total antioxidant functions (p < 0.05) of muscle tissues, indicating improved meat quality. Gender affected backfat depth, with barrows showing thicker backfat depth. In conclusion, dietary supplementation with 10% FBR in finishing pigs influenced the meat quality by improving the marbling score and antioxidant performance while reducing digestibility without compromising growth performance.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the effects of untreated pig manure from diets incorporating growth-promoting supplements (antibiotics and Zn oxide) on the survival and reproduction of Eisenia andrei earthworms. The tested manures were obtained from four different groups of pigs fed with four different diets: CS, a diet based on corn and soymeal; TR, a diet based on corn, soymeal, and ground wheat (15%); CSa, a diet based on corn and soymeal + 100 ppm of doxycycline + 50 ppm of colistin + 2500 ppm of Zn oxide; and TRa, a diet based on corn, soymeal, and ground wheat (15%) + 100 ppm of doxycycline + 50 ppm of colistin + 2500 ppm of Zn oxide. The study used two soils representative of the Southern region of Brazil (Oxisol and Entisol). In general, there were no significant differences between the different manures tested in each soil. However, there were differences in the toxicity manure on E. andrei between the soils, and the magnitude of this effect was dependent on the applied dose. In Oxisol, LC50 values were higher than 80 m(3) ha(-1), and EC50 varied from 9 to 27 m(3) ha(-1). In Entisol, the LC50 values were below the lowest dose tested (< 25 m(3) ha(-1)), and EC50 remained around 5 m(3) ha(-1). It may be possible that the effects observed were attributed to an excess of nitrogen, copper, and zinc, promoted by the addition of the untreated manure and how these factors interacted with soil type.

AB  - Structural variants (SVs), such as deletions (DELs) and insertions (INSs), contribute substantially to pig genetic diversity and phenotypic variation. Using a library of SVs discovered from long-read primary assemblies and short-read sequenced genomes, we map pig genomic SVs with a graph-based method for re-genotyping SVs in 402 genomes. Our results demonstrate that those SVs harboring specific trait-associated genes may greatly shape pig domestication and local adaptation. Further characterization of SVs reveals that some population-stratified SVs may alter the transcription of genes by affecting regulatory elements. We identify that the genotypes of two DELs (296-bp DEL, chr7: 52,172,101-52,172,397; 278-bp DEL, chr18: 23,840,143-23,840,421) located in muscle-specific enhancers are associated with the expression of target genes related to meat quality (FSD2) and muscle fiber hypertrophy (LMOD2 and WASL) in pigs. Our results highlight the role of SVs in domestic porcine evolution, and the identified candidate functional genes and SVs are valuable resources for future genomic research and breeding programs in pigs.

AB  - Simple Summary Thermal stress (TS) is a critical challenge in the swine industry, but knowledge about the influence of TS on intestinal development and microbiota in piglets is still scarce. Thus, the present study investigated the effects of high ambient temperature on growth performance, small intestinal morphology, and colonic microbiota in weaned piglets. Our results showed that high ambient temperature had negative effects on growth performance and colonic microbiota of weaned piglets. A total of 16 crossbred (Duroc x Landrace x Yorkshire) barrows, with an average initial body weight of 8.61 +/- 0.24 kg (28 days of age), were randomly allotted into the control group (CON group) and high ambient temperature group (HT group) with 8 replicates per group, 1 pig per replicate. The ambient temperature of the CON group was controlled at 26 +/- 1 degrees C, and the HT group was controlled at 35 +/- 1 degrees C. The study lasted for 21 days. Our results showed that high ambient temperature significantly decreased the average daily feed intake (ADFI) and average daily gain (ADG) of piglets (p < 0.05), and the feed-to-gain ratio was significantly increased (p < 0.05). The liver index, spleen index, and thymus index of piglets in the HT group were significantly decreased (p < 0.05). The villous height (VH) of the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum of piglets in the HT group was significantly decreased (p < 0.05), whereas the crypt depth (CD) of the duodenum was significantly increased (p < 0.05), and the VH-to-CD ratio of the duodenum and ileum was significantly decreased (p < 0.05). The piglets in the HT group showed a higher (p < 0.05) observed-species index, PD whole tree index, and Shannon index, indicating that there was a significant difference in species richness and diversity between the two groups. At the genus level, the piglets in the HT group showed a greater (p < 0.05) percent of Desulfovibrio, Occillibater, and Catenisphaera. HT reduced glycan biosynthesis and metabolism, transport and catabolism, lipid metabolism, amino acids metabolism, secondary metabolites biosynthesis, aging, endocrine system, signaling molecules, and interaction of colon microbiota (p < 0.05), and increased signal transduction, cell motility, transcription, and genetic information processing (p < 0.05).

AB  - Correcting taxonomic misidentifications is crucial to ensuring the conservation and use of wild relatives in crop breeding programmes. Macrotyloma sar-garhwalensis R.D.Gaur & L.R.Dangwal, described as a new species from Uttarakhand (India) in 1997, is one such case of mistaken identity. Critical study of its protologue, type specimen, and field-grown plants indicated that this species was conspecific to Clitoria annua J.Graham. Molecular systematic studies using ITS 2 sequence regions further confirmed its closeness to C. ternatea L., than to any of the studied Macrotyloma species. This taxon, when considered as a wild relative of horsegram (M. uniflorum (Lam.) Verdc.), was given much importance in plant genetic resources programmes. This communication, besides revealing the differences of the taxon in question from Macrotyloma, brings out implications of this wrong taxonomic placement (under Macrotyloma). It also highlights the need for depositing type specimen in national repositories for ready access and strengthening the taxonomic base of botanists in general and agricultural scientists in particular.

AB  - Background Serine/threonine kinase 3 (AKT3) is a protein-coding gene that is associated with several cattle immune diseases including different tumors and cancers. The objective of this study was to investigate the differences in structures and functions of AKT3 of cow and buffalo cattle. Methods The sequence differences of gene-coding sequence (CDS) and core promoter region of AKT3 in cow and buffalo were analyzed by using bioinformatics tools and PCR sequencing. Also, the functional analysis of promoter regulating gene expression by RT-PCR was performed using 500 Holstein cows and buffalos. And, evaluation of AKT3 inflammatory response to the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mastitis was performed between both species. Results The results revealed the variation in 6 exons out of 13 exons of the two species of CDS. Also, 4 different regions in 3-kb promoters of the AKT3 gene were significantly different between cow and buffalo species, in which cow's AKT3 promoter sequence region was started from - 371 to - 1247, while in buffalo, the sequence was started from - 371 to - 969 of the promoter crucial region. Thus, the promoter was overexpressed in cows compared to buffaloes. As a result, significant differences (P < 0.05) between the two species in the AKT3 gene expression level related to the LPS stimulation in their mammary epithelial cell line. Conclusions This study emphasized the great importance of the structural differences of AKT3 between the animal species on their different responses against immune diseases like mastitis.

AB  - Here we provide a comprehensive update on the diversity and genetic relatedness of adenoviruses occurring in rodents. Extensive PCR screenings revealed the presence of adenoviral DNA in samples originating from representatives of 17 rodent species from four different suborders of Rodentia. Distinct sequences of 28 different adenoviruses were obtained from the positive samples. Out of these, 20 were from hitherto unknown, putative novel adenoviruses, whereas 6 were variants of previously published murine adenoviruses. Additionally, two known viruses, guinea pig adenovirus 1 and squirrel adenovirus 1 were also detected. By PCR and primer walking, we determined the sequence of a considerable part of the genomic DNA of squirrel adenovirus 1, detected in red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris) samples from Germany previously. We annotated the almost complete genome sequence of a novel mastadenovirus found by data mining in the bulk data of the Ord's kangaroo rat (Dipodomys ordii) genome project. We revisited the sequence of the gene of E1B 19 K protein of mouse adenovirus 3. In contrast to the prototype strain, where a truncated version of this gene has been found, in our sample of mouse adenovirus 3, it seemed to be intact. Based on phylogeny reconstructions, all rodent adenoviruses clustered in the genus Mastadenovirus. Interestingly, however, there wasn't a common monophyletic clade encompassing every adenovirus of rodent origin. Instead, three major lineages were observed. Because two lineages contained viral sequences deduced from samples of three suborders, and one consisted almost exclusively of adenoviruses from the family Muridae, we hypothesize there has been a long-term coevolution with the rodent hosts, as a result of possible ancient host-switch events. Several putative viruses appeared in distinct branches further away from the three clades. Thus, the evolutionary past of the adenoviruses of rodents remains to be studied further.

AB  - We studied plant-plant communication in a system that included eggplants, herbivores as prey, and the omnivorous mirid Nesidiocoris tenuis. When uninfested eggplants were exposed to volatiles from conspecific plants infested by N. tenuis adults, the amounts of jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA) in the exposed plants remained to be similar to those in uninfested eggplants that were exposed to volatiles from uninfested conspecific plants (control eggplants). Subsequent artificial damage to the leaves of either the exposed or control eggplants using scissors led to a significant increase in JA content in the leaves. Furthermore, following the damage, the JA content in the exposed plants was significantly higher than in the control plants. In contrast, the amount of SA in the eggplants was not affected by either exposure or subsequent artificial damage. The fecundity of Kanzawa spider mites on the leaf disks of the exposed plants was significantly lower than that on the leaf disks of the control plants. The weight gain of 2nd stadium Spodoptera litura larvae on the exposed plants was significantly lower than on the control plants. However, the survival and fecundity of N. tenuis females on both exposed and control plants were not significantly different. This study demonstrates the potential variations in the tolerance of herbivorous and omnivorous arthropods to plant defenses in response to exposure to plant volatiles.

AB  - Simple Summary A well-balanced diet seems to play a key role in disease prevention and health promotion in young animals. Therefore, many attempts have been made to supplement feeds with novel nutritional components, with potential prebiotic capacity. It seems that chicory root fulfils those criteria as it contains high amounts of inulin-type fructans. Hence, the aim of the study was to determine the effect of dietary supplementation with 4% dried chicory root on the cecal mucosa proteome of piglets. It is shown that this feed additive may affect cellular metabolism in the cecal epithelium and may be beneficial for gut health. Prebiotics are known to have many beneficial effects on intestinal health by modulating the gut microbiota composition, thereby affecting epithelial cell proliferation and metabolism. This study had two aims: (1) to identify the protein constituents in the cecal mucosa of 50-day-old healthy (PIC x Penarlan P76) barrows, and (2) to assess the effects of 4% inclusion of dried chicory root in a cereal-based diet on the cecal mucosa proteome changes. Pigs (eight per group) were randomly allotted to the groups and were fed a control diet from the tenth day of life (C) or a diet supplemented with 4% of died chicory root (CR), for 40 days. At the age of 50 days, animals were sacrificed and cecal tissue samples were collected. It was found that feeding a CR diet significantly decreased the expression of 16 cecal mucosa proteins. Among them, fifteen proteins were down-regulated, while only one (KRT20) was shown to be up-regulated when compared to the C group. Dietary supplementation with CR caused down-expression of metabolism-associated proteins including enzymes involved in the process of glycolysis (G6PD, TPI1, ALDH9A1, CKMT1 and AKR1A1) as well as those engaged in transcriptional and translational activity (PRPF19, EEF1G) and several structural proteins (ACTR3, KRT77, CAP1 and actin). From our findings, it is possible to conclude that dietary chicory root at 4% had beneficial effects on the gut health of pigs as indicated by a changed abundance of certain cecal proteins such as KRT20, SERPINB1, HSP27, ANAXA2 and ANAXA4.

AB  - Provision of safe drinking water sources is one of the most important agenda of the governing bodies in developing countries across the globe. Hence, the current study was taken up to assess the overall groundwater quality and the spatial distribution of the physico-chemical parameters governing the groundwater quality in Raebareli district (North India). In general, the groundwater was found to be slightly alkaline, with the order of ionic abundance being F- < K+ < Ca2+ < NO3- < Mg2+ < SO42- < Na+ < HCO3-. The results of 'Pollution Index of Groundwater' (PIG) suggest that around 50% of the samples were in the category of 'insignificant pollution', with 1 sample each under 'high' and 'very high' pollution categories. The dominant water type in the study area was found to be 'mixed CaNaHCO3 type' through hydrochemical facies assessment. The spatial distribution suggests that the north and central parts were the most affected areas with respect to PIG. The non-carcinogenic effects of consuming water contaminated with F- and NO3- were assessed through Hazard Quotient (HQ) and Total Hazard Index (THI) values. The HQ(Fluoride) varies between 0.16-6.34, 0.12-4.69, and 0.14-5.54 for the children, male, and female, respectively. The HQ(Nitrate) varies between 0.03-4.96, 0.02-3.67, and 0.02-4.33 in the case of children, male, and female, respectively. The spatial distribution of THI suggested that central parts of the study area were under high risk. The potential health risks to the residents in the study area should cause immediate attention from the society, governing authorities, and the research community.

AB  - The flavor profile of tea is influenced not only by different tea varieties but also by the surrounding soil environment. Recent studies have indicated the regulatory role of soil microbes residing in plant roots in nutrient uptake and metabolism. However, the impact of this regulatory mechanism on tea quality remains unclear. In this study, we showed that a consortium of microbes isolated from tea roots enhanced ammonia uptake and facilitated the synthesis of theanine, a key determinant of tea taste. Variations were observed in the composition of microbial populations colonizing tea roots and the rhizosphere across different seasons and tea varieties. By comparing the root microorganisms of the high-theanine tea variety Rougui with the low-theanine variety Maoxie, we identified a specific group of microbes that potentially modulate nitrogen metabolism, subsequently influencing the theanine levels in tea. Furthermore, we constructed a synthetic microbial community (SynCom) mirroring the microbe population composition found in Rougui roots. Remarkably, applying SynCom resulted in a significant increase in the theanine content of tea plants and imparted greater tolerance to nitrogen deficiency in Arabidopsis. Our study provides compelling evidence supporting the use of root microorganisms as functional microbial fertilizers to enhance tea quality.

AB  - Main conclusionVOC emissions increased with herbivore load, but this did not result in concomitant increases in resistance in neighbouring plants, suggesting that communication occurred independently of herbivore load in emitter plants.Herbivore-damaged plants emit volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that can alert neighbours and boost their resistance. While VOC-mediated plant communication has been shown to be herbivore-specific, we know little about its contingency on variation in herbivore load. To address this knowledge gap, we tested herbivore load effects on VOC-mediated communication between potato plants (Solanum tuberosum) using the generalist herbivore Spodoptera exigua. First, we tested whether herbivore load (three levels: undamaged control, low, and high load) affected total VOC emissions and composition. Second, we matched emitter and receiver plants and subjected emitters to the same herbivore load treatments. Finally, we performed a bioassay with S. exigua on receivers to test for induced resistance due to VOC-mediated communication. We found that herbivory significantly increased total VOC emissions relative to control plants, and that such increase was greater under high herbivore load. In contrast, we found no detectable effect of herbivory, regardless of the load, on VOC composition. The communication experiment showed that VOCs released by herbivore-induced emitters boosted resistance in receivers (i.e., lower leaf damage than receivers exposed to VOCs released by control emitters), but the magnitude of such effect was similar for both levels of emitter herbivore load. These findings suggest that changes in VOCs due to variation in herbivore load do not modify the outcomes of plant communication.

AB  - Early detection of health issues in pigs is critical for efficient farming and animal welfare. This study employs statistical analysis and machine learning to analyze and classify the health status of pigs using hourly activity data. We collected data from 176 pigs over 145 days using pig ear tags and applied statistical analysis and visualization methods to identify activity patterns associated with normal and abnormal health statuses. Key features, encompassing statistical, peak, and trend features, were extracted to train several machine learning models, including Random Forest, CatBoost, and the CNN_LSTM_Attention (CLA) model, among others. The findings indicated that pigs were most active from 05:00 h to 10:00 h and from 12:00 h to 18:00 h. Compared with normal pigs, abnormal pigs presented markedly reduced activity levels, particularly during peak hours. Pigs with different types of abnormalities demonstrated distinct activity levels compared to normal pigs. Those with cardiopulmonary abnormalities showed declining trends similar to those with spleen and digestive system abnormalities, while pigs with growth and development abnormalities presented the most significant differences compared to normal pigs. The CLA model achieved the highest performance in classifying pig health status, with an accuracy of 89.3 %. This research presents an innovative approach to pig health monitoring and management utilizing activity data, which has significant practical implications.

AB  - In birds, like in mammals, the hippocampus critically mediates spatial navigation through the formation of a spatial map. This study investigates the impact of active exploration of an environment on the hippocampus of young domestic chicks. Chicks that were free to actively explore the environment exhibited a significantly higher neural activation (measured by c-Fos expression) compared with those that passively observed the same environment from a restricted area. The difference was limited to the anterior and the dorsolateral parts of the intermediate hippocampus. Furthermore, the nucleus taeniae of the amygdala showed a higher c-Fos expression in the active exploration group than in the passive observation group. In both brain regions, brain activation was correlated with the number of locations that chicks visited during the test. This suggests that the increase of c-Fos expression in the hippocampus is related to increased firing rates of spatially coding neurons. Furthermore, our study indicates a functional linkage of the hippocampus and nucleus taeniae of the amygdala in processing spatial information. Overall, with the present study, we confirm that in birds, like in mammals, hippocampus and amygdala functions are linked and likely related to spatial representations.

AB  - An efficient mRNA knockdown strategy is needed to explore gene function in cells and embryos, especially to understand the process of maternal mRNA decay during early embryo development. Cas13, a novel RNA-targeting CRISPR effector protein, could bind and cleave complementary single-strand RNA, which has been employed for mRNA knockdown in mouse and human cells and RNA-virus interference in plants. Cas13 has not yet been reported to be used in pigs. In the current study, we explored the feasibility of CRISPR/Cas13d-mediated endogenous RNA knockdown in pigs. KDMSB, a histone demethylase of H3K4me3, was downregulated at the transcriptional level by 50% with CRISPR/Cas13d in porcine fibroblast cells. Knockdown of KDM58-induced H3K4me3 expression and decreased the abundance of H3K27me3, H3K9me3, H3K4ac, H4K8ac, and H4K12ac. These changes affected cell proliferation and cell cycle. Furthermore, stable integration of the CRISPR/Cas13d system into the porcine genome resulted in the continuous expression of Cas13d and persistent knockdown of KDM5B. Finally, the RNA-targeting potential of Cas13d was further validated in porcine parthenogenetic embryos. By microinjection of Cas13d mRNA and gRNA targeting KDMSB into porcine oocytes, the expression of KDMSB was downregulated, the abundance of H3K4me3 increased as expected, and the expression of embryonic development-related genes was changed accordingly. These results indicate that CRISPR/Cas13d provides an easily programmable platform for spatiotemporal transcriptional manipulation in pigs.

AB  - Livestock production poses a threat to water quality worldwide. A better understanding of the contribution of individual livestock species to nitrogen (N) pollution in rivers is essential to improve water quality. This paper aims to quantify inputs of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) to the Yangtze River from different livestock species at multiple scales and explore ways for reducing these inputs through coupling crop and livestock production. We extended the previously developed model MARINA (Model to Assess River Input of Nutrient to seAs) with the NUFER (Nutrient flows in Food chains, Environment, and Resource use) approach for livestock. Results show that DIN inputs to the Yangtze River vary across basins, sub-basins, and 0.5 degrees grids, as well as across livestock species. In 2012, livestock production resulted in 2000 Gg of DIN inputs to the Yangtze River. Pig production was responsible for 55-85% of manure-related DIN inputs. Rivers in the downstream sub-basin received higher manure-related DIN inputs than rivers in the other sub-basins. Around 20% of the Yangtze basin is considered as a manure-related hotspot of river pollution. Recycling manure on cropland can avoid direct discharges of manure from pig production and thus reduce river pollution. The potential for recycling manure is larger in cereal production than in other crop species. Our results can help to identify effective solutions for coupling crop and livestock production in the Yangtze basin.

AB  - Background As a mammal living at the highest altitude in the world, the yak has strong adaptability to the harsh natural environment (such as low temperature, scarce food, especially low oxygen) of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) after a long process of natural selection. Objective Here, we used Weighted Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA), a systematic biology method, to identify hypoxic adaptation-related modules and hub genes. The research of the adaptability of yak against hypoxia is of great significance to identify the genetic characteristics and yak breeding. Methods Based on the transcriptome sequencing data (PRJNA362606), the R package DESeq2 and WGCNA were conducted to analyze differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and construct the gene co-expression network. The module hub genes were identified and characterized by the correlation of gene and trait, module membership (kME). In addition, GO and KEGG enrichment analyses were used to explore the functions of hub genes. Results Our results revealed that 1098, 1429, and 1645 DEGs were identified in muscle, spleen, and lung, respectively. Besides, a total of 13 gene co-expression modules were detected, of which two hypoxic adaptation-related modules (saddlebrown and turquoise) were found. We identified 39 and 150 hub genes in these two modules. Functional enrichment analyses showed that 12 GO terms and 18 KEGG pathways were enriched in the saddlebrown module while 85 GO terms and 22 KEGG pathways were enriched in the turquoise module. The significant pathways related to hypoxia adaptation include FoxO signaling pathway, Thermogenesis pathway, and Retrograde endocannabinoid signaling pathway, etc. Conclusions In this study, we obtained two hypoxia-related specific modules and identified hub genes based on the connectivity by constructing a weighted gene co-expression network. Function enrichment analysis of two modules revealed mitochondrion is the most important organelle for hypoxia adaptation. Moreover, the insulin-related pathways and thermogenic-related pathways played a major role. The results of this study provide theoretical guidance for further understanding the molecular mechanism of yak adaptation to hypoxia.

AB  - More than 3000 fossil vertebrate specimens have been unearthed from the new Lower Pleistocene locality of Karnezeika, Peloponnese, Greece. The vast majority of the material (similar to 90%) represents bovids, and their systematic study is provided herein. The bovid assemblage consists of four taxa. A significant portion of the collected bovid material belongs to a small sized gazelle, attributed to Gazella bouvrainae, and to the large Rupicaprini Gallogoral meneghinii. A relatively small sized form of Gazellospira torticornis has been recorded as well, and in addition the scarce dental material belonging to an unspecified Caprini form is mentioned as Caprini gen. et sp. indet. This combination of taxa is typical for the Middle Villafranchian of Greece (2.6-1.8 Ma).

AB  - Livestock farms are hotspots of antibiotic resistance due to the intensive use of antibiotics, in which the characteristics of air-borne and feces-borne antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and microbial communities are of great significance. This study delves into the distribution of ARGs and microbial communities across various livestock farms in China, and the correlation of microorganisms between livestock farms and other global environments was investigated. The concentrations of ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in air samples were basically at the same level, but those in fecal samples collected from chicken farms were universally higher than those in pig and cattle farms. There was significant ability of ARGs to spread easily among different bacteria in all samples in livestock farms. Additionally, there may be more possible host bacteria of airborne ARGs in chicken farms. In the global-scale analysis of highly similar microbial communities, the database matching with the highest number of similarities to microbial communities collected from livestock farms is genes related to human sources (54.8%). This study advances our understanding of ARG dynamics in different livestock farms and contributes to the development of sustainable livestock management practices.

AB  - Serpentine soils, known for high heavy metal content and low nutrients, create harsh conditions for plants and herbivores. Although previous research has explored how serpentine soils affect herbivory, most studies have been restricted to a specific region, and the mechanisms involved remain unclear. Here, we conducted a large-scale study across 78 plant species from California, Spain, and Sweden, comparing insect herbivory and leaf traits (chemical, nutritional, and physical) in serpentine and non-serpentine habitats within each region. We also analyzed soil properties-pH, texture, nutrient content, and heavy metal concentrations-to investigate their potential role in mediating soil type effects on herbivory. Our results showed that plants growing in serpentine soils experienced lower herbivory levels and exhibited higher concentrations of phenolic compounds, lower nutrient content, and thicker leaves, compared to their non-serpentine counterparts. Additionally, elevated pH and heavy metal levels in serpentine soils were associated with reduced herbivory, increased concentrations of phenolic compounds, and decreased specific leaf area (SLA) and nitrogen content. However, no indirect link between soil properties and herbivory via leaf traits was found, suggesting that bottom-up effects of soil on plants and herbivores operate independently. Collectively, these findings enhance our understanding of the mechanisms linking plant-soil specialization and aboveground plant-herbivore interactions.

AB  - Wild pigs (Sus scrofa) are one of the most destructive invasive species in the US, known for causing extensive damage to agricultural commodities, natural resources, and property, and for transmitting diseases to livestock. Following the establishment of the National Feral Swine Damage Management Program (NFSDMP) in 2014, the expansion of wild pig populations has been successfully slowed. This paper combines two modeling approaches across eight separate models to characterize the expansion of wild pig populations in the absence of intervention by the NFSDMP and forecasts the value of a subset of resources safeguarded from the threat of wild pigs. The results indicate that if wild pigs had continued spreading at pre-program levels, they would have spread extensively across the US, with significant geographic variation across modeling scenarios. Further, by averting the threat of wild pigs, a substantial amount of crops, land, property, and livestock was safeguarded by the NFSDMP. Cumulatively, between 2014 and 2021, wild pig populations were prevented from spreading to an average of 724 counties and an average of USD 40.2 billion in field crops, pasture, grasses, and hay was safeguarded. The results demonstrate that intervention by the NFSDMP has delivered significant ecological and economic benefits that were not previously known.

AB  - Farmers who keep livestock in large carnivore areas are exposed to threat of predation directly impacting on finances and workload as well as the associated psychological stress indirectly impacting on farmers well-being. So far, little is known about such stress responses. The concept of "stress" or "stress reaction" is often used as an undifferentiated umbrella concept for the experience of negative emotional episodes. However, the stress reactions could be divided into cognitive, physiological, and behavioural aspects. This study aimed to develop and apply a theory-based approach to identify stress responses among sheep farmers in the Swedish "wolf-region." A thematic analysis of interviews conducted with sheep farmers showed ample support for stress responses among the informants in relation to large carnivores and their management, although the interviews were conducted with a different focal topic. The findings support the idea that stress responses could be categorised into cognitive, physiological, and behavioural aspects. This distinction would help to identify and fully understand the cumulative impact of stress from the presence of large carnivores on farmers' well-being.

AB  - Animal personality has been shown to predict many behavioral responses across taxa, but the relationship between personality and performance on cognitive tasks remains unclear. To address this gap, we investigated whether personality predicted problem-solving performance and learning in captive Asian and African savanna elephants. We leveraged 3 novel problem-solving tasks to assess success rate, latency to touch the apparatus, exploratory diversity (the number of different behaviors exhibited toward the task), work time (the proportion of time working on the tasks), and latency to solve. To measure multiple different personality traits, such as boldness, activity, aggressiveness, curiosity, and sociability, across contexts, we carried out novel object presentations, behavioral coding through observations, and trait rating through surveys with zookeepers. We found evidence of personality through behavioral observations and surveys, but not through novel object testing. Aggressiveness and activity were important predictors of problem solving, but this was task-dependent, and the traits we measured did not significantly predict learning. Elephants solved 2 out of 3 tasks faster over time, but they did not vary their latency to touch, exploratory diversity, or work time. We discuss our results in terms of task difficulty and previous work on personality in elephants. Results from this study lay the foundation for future work connecting individual variation in personality to cognitive performance in elephants. In addition, for zoo-housed animals, individual differences research could inform enrichment and welfare decisions as well as conservation strategies.

AB  - Simple Summary In rabbits, milk is the primary source of nutrition from early growth to weaning. The ability of the mother rabbit to produce milk, which is also influenced by the maternal genotype, is particularly important in the case of the larger litters. The hormone prolactin is responsible for the initiation and maintenance of lactation and for the synthesis of the major components of milk. Prolactin acts through membrane receptors in target tissues. Point mutations and microsatellites in receptor genes can affect production characteristics. Our aim was to examine the prolactin receptor gene in a wild rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) population with a diverse genetic background. Our hypothesis was that the detected polymorphisms could be associated with milk production. By sequencing the promoter region of the PRLR gene, we detected four point mutations and one microsatellite. Among the genotypes of point mutations in the regulatory region of the PRLR gene, the homozygous genotype and the short repeat of the microsatellite resulted in higher milk production. These could be potential marker candidates for the development of marker-assisted selection. One of the problematic points of rabbit breeding is that the nutritional requirements of the kits are not fully satisfied by the does' milk production from the third week of lactation onwards. The prolactin receptor gene has a significant effect on reproductive processes, and its polymorphisms have been associated with milk production in several species (cattle, goats, sheep, and buffalo). The European wild rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), has a more diverse genetic background compared to domesticated lines. In the course of our study, sequencing of the 1210 bp long segment of the PRLR gene promoter region was accomplished. We detected four point mutations (SNP1-407G > A, SNP2-496G > C, SNP3-926T> and SNP4-973A > C) and one microsatellite at position 574. In our population, the four SNPs were segregated into four genotypes: AACCCCCC, GGGGTTAA, AAGGTTAC, and GGGGTCAC. Our results show that the genotype in the homozygous form is associated with higher milk production (1564.7 +/- 444.7 g) compared to the other three genotypes (AACCCCCC 1399.1 +/- 326.8 g; GTGACCTT 1403.8 +/- 517.1 g; GGGGTCAC 1220.0 +/- 666.2 g), and the short microsatellite repeat (167 bp) also coincides with significantly higher milk production (1623.8 +/- 525.1 g). These results make the marker-assisted selection possible also for domesticated lines.

AB  - Low-temperature injury affects normal physiological function and viability of boar sperm during cryopreservation. Small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) modification of proteins after translation is related to the cell stress response but the relationship between SUMO modification and oxidative stress in freeze-thawed sperm remains unclear. A-kinase ankyrin 4 (AKAP4) and its precursor proAKAP4 are two main proteins in mammalian sperm. Although AKAP4 expression has been studied in many species, its expression in porcine sperm has not been described in detail. In this study, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to determine the differentially expressed SUMO-modified proteins in porcine sperm after freezen and thawed. The results identified 26 down-regulated SUMO-modified proteins, with AKAP4 identified as one of the target proteins of SUMO1 under sperm stress. In addition, the level of SUMO1 protein increased significantly (P < 0.001) and the level of AKAP4 protein decreased (P < 0.05) after freezing and oxidative stress treatment. Inhibition of SUMO1 modification of AKAP4 protein did not affect its degradation (P > 0.05), indicating that SUMO1 is not involved in the degradation of AKAP4. The inhibition of SUMO1 modification by sperm protein decreased sperm motility (P < 0.05), ATP content, and DNA integrity (P < 0.05). In summary, cryopreservation and oxidative stress can induce SUMO modification of porcine sperm proteins and the modification of sperm protein SUMO1 can help sperm resist oxidative stress; and its role in protecting sperm quality is not via regulating the degradation of AKAP4. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying SUMO1 modifications during sperm cryopreservation and oxidative stress.

AB  - Emamectin benzoate (EB) is a widely used insecticide that can damage the central nervous and immune systems. EB exposure significantly reduced the number of eggs laid, hatching rate, and developmental rate of lower organisms such as nematodes. However, effects of EB exposure on the maturation of higher animals such as porcine oocytes remains unknown. Here we reported that EB exposure severely impaired porcine oocyte maturation. EB exposure with 200 mM prevented cumulus expansion and reduced the rates of first polar body (pb1) extrusion, cleavage and blastocyst after parthenogenetic activation. Moreover, EB exposure disrupted spindle organization, chromosome alignment, and polymerization of microfilaments, but also apparently decreased the levels of acetylated a-tubulin (Ac-Tub) in oocytes. In addition, EB exposure perturbed mitochondria distribution and increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), but did not affect the distribution of cortical granules (CGs) in oocytes. Excessive ROS caused DNA damage accumulation and induced early apoptosis of oocytes. EB exposure led to the abnormal expression of cumulus expansion and apoptosis-associated genes.

AB  - Understanding the behaviour of animals in their natural habitats is critical to ecology and conservation. Camera traps are a powerful tool to collect such data with minimal disturbance. They however produce a very large quantity of images, which can make human-based annotation cumbersome or even impossible. While automated species identification with artificial intelligence has made impressive progress, the automatic classification of animal behaviours in camera trap images remains a developing field. Here, we explore the potential of foundation models, specifically vision-language models (VLMs), to perform this task without the need to first train a model, which would require some level of human-based annotation. Using two datasets, of alpine and African fauna, we investigate the zero-shot capabilities of different kinds of recent VLMs to predict behaviours and estimate behaviour-specific diel activity patterns in three ungulate species. By comparing our predictions to behaviours annotated by participatory science, our results show that using these automatic methods, it is possible to achieve F1-score as high as 86.39% in behaviour classification and produce activity patterns that closely align with those derived from participatory science data (overlap indexes between 84% and 90%). These findings demonstrate the potential of foundation models and vision-language models in ecological research. Ecologists are encouraged to adopt these new methods and leverage their full capabilities to facilitate ecological studies.

AB  - Compared to rural areas, the density of predators such as domestic Dogs Canis lupus familiaris is high in urban areas. Greylag Geese Anser anser recently colonised the city of Stuttgart, southwestern Germany where they frequent large public parks that offer rich grazing for these herbivores. People regularly walk their dogs within the parks, which often disturb the geese and provides an opportunity to study the anti-predator behaviour of Greylag Geese to these potential predators. Goose response distances and strength increased with dog size. Small dogs, people without dogs and vehicles resulted in much shorter response distances. Since large dogs can easily kill geese, it may be adaptive for the geese to fine-tune their behaviour to the real danger from domestic predators.

AB  - In this study, typical animal- and plant-derived biochars derived from pig carcass (PB) and green waste (GWB), and their iron-engineered products (Fe-PB and Fe-GWB) were added at the dose of 3% (w/w) to an acidic (pH 5.8) soil, and incubated to test their efficacy in improving soil quality and immobilizing arsenic (As 141.3 mg kg(-1))and lead (Pb = 736.2 mg kg(-1)). Soil properties, microbial activities, and the geochemical fractions and potential availabilities of As and Pb were determined in he non-treated (control) and biochar-treated soil. Modification of PB (pH = 10.6) and GWB (pH = 9.3) with Fe caused a decrease in their pH to 44 and 3.4, respectively. The application of PB and GWB significantly increased soil pH, while Fe-PB and Fe-GWB decreased soil pH, as compared to the control. Application of Fe-GWB and Fe-PB decreased the NH4H2PO4-extractable As by 32.8 and 35.9%, which was more effective than addition of GWB and PB. However, PB and GWB were more effective than Fe-PB and Fe-GWB in Pb immobilization. Compared to the control, the DTPA-extractable Pb decreased by 20.6 and 21.7%, respectively, following PB and GWB application. Both biochars, particularly PB significantly increased the 165 rRNA bacterial gene copy numbers, indicating that biochar amendments enhanced the bacterial abundance, implying an alleviation of As and Pb bio-toxicity to soil bacteria. The results demonstrated that pristine pig carcass and green waste biochars were more effective in immobilizing Pb, while their Fe-engineered biochars were more effective in As immobilization in co-contaminated soils.

AB  - Plants use electrical and chemical signals for systemic communication. Herbivory, for instance, appears to trigger local apoplasmic glutamate accumulation, systemic electrical signals, and calcium waves that travel to report insect damage to neighboring leaves and initiate defense. To monitor extra- and intracellular glutamate concentrations in plants, we generated Arabidopsis lines expressing genetically encoded fluorescent glutamate sensors. In contrast to cytosolically localized sensors, extracellularly displayed variants inhibited plant growth and proper development. Phenotypic analyses of high-affinity display sensor lines revealed that root meristem development, particularly the quiescent center, number of lateral roots, vegetative growth, and floral architecture were impacted. Notably, the severity of the phenotypes was positively correlated with the affinity of the display sensors, intimating that their ability to sequester glutamate at the surface of the plasma membrane was responsible for the defects. Root growth defects were suppressed by supplementing culture media with low levels of glutamate. Together, the data indicate that sequestration of glutamate at the cell surface either disrupts the supply of glutamate to meristematic cells and/or impairs localized glutamatergic signaling important for developmental processes.

AB  - Behavior and fitness are important ecological traits frequently measured in insect bioassays. A common method to measure them in soft-bodied herbivorous insects involves confining individuals to plant leaves using clip cages. Although studies have previously highlighted the negative effects of clip cages on leaf physiology, little is known about the impact that using this confinement method has on insect fitness. The responses of different aphid genotypes/clones to different containment methods have not previously been investigated. Here we measured key fitness traits (intrinsic rate of natural increase, mean relative growth rate, time to reach reproductive adulthood and population doubling time) in the potato aphid, Macrosiphum euphorbiae Thomas (Hemiptera: Aphididae), when confined to plants using two methods: (1) clip cages to confine aphids to individual strawberry leaves and (2) a mesh bag to confine aphids to whole strawberry plants. Our study identified a strong negative impact on all the measured aphid fitness traits when using clip cages instead of mesh bags. We also identified genotype-specific differences in response to confinement method, where clip cage confinement differentially affected the fitness of a given aphid genotype compared to the same genotype on whole plants. These results suggest that clip cage use should be carefully considered when experiments seek to quantify insect fitness and that whole plants should be used wherever possible. Given the prevalence of clip cage use in insect bioassays, our results highlight the need for caution when interpreting the existing literature as confinement method significantly impacts aphid fitness depending on their genotype.
   Confinement method has an important effect on aphid fitness, with clip cages negatively impacting the parameters. Aphid genotype also modulates the extent of the confinement method's impact on aphid fitness. The results herein presented suggest that the results obtained with (the widely used method of) clip cages should be interpreted with caution.image

AB  - Simple Summary The decay of human or animal carcasses usually attracts the colonization of large numbers of car-rion-related arthropods, especially Diptera and Coleoptera. Since insects are ectotherms, their colonization and development on carcasses are strongly temperature-dependent and predictable, rendering them a powerful tool for estimating the postmortem interval. Nitidulidae is a large family of common storage and agricultural pests of forensic significance. In this study, the development of the sap beetle Nitidula rufipes (Linnaeus, 1767) was observed under seven constant temperatures between 16 and 34 degrees C to describe the growth and morphology as well as survival rates of the different developmental stages using multiple scientific imaging and statistical techniques. We showed that N. rufipes can complete its development at temperatures between 16 and 34 degrees C, where the longest developmental time is 71.0 +/- 4.4 days at 16 degrees C and the shortest is 20.8 +/- 2.4 days at 34 degrees C. Body length measurements combined with morphological characteristics allowed for larval aging and instar discrimination, thus providing relatively complete developmental data for N. rufipes. This information serves to aid forensic investigators in determining the postmortem interval of carcasses using N. rufipes. Coleoptera, including the family Nitidulidae, are valuable for estimating long-term postmortem intervals in the late stage of body decomposition. This study showed that, under seven constant temperatures of 16, 19, 22, 25, 28, 31, and 34 degrees C, the developmental durations of Nitidula rufipes (Linnaeus, 1767) from oviposition to eclosion were 71.0 +/- 4.4, 52.9 +/- 4.1, 40.1 +/- 3.4, 30.1 +/- 2.1, 24.2 +/- 2.0, 21.0 +/- 2.3, and 20.8 +/- 2.4 days, respectively. The morphological indexes of body length, the widths of the head capsules, and the distance between the urogomphi of the larvae were measured in vivo. The regression model between larval body length and developmental durations was simulated for larval aging, and the head capsule width and the distance between the urogomphi at different instars were cluster-analyzed for instar discrimination. Based on the developmental durations, larval body length and thermal summation data were obtained, and the isomorphen diagram, isomegalen diagram, linear thermal summation models, and curvilinear Optim SSI models were established. The lower developmental threshold and thermal summation constant of N. rufipes evaluated by the linear thermal summation models were 9.65 +/- 0.62 degrees C and 471.40 +/- 25.46 degree days, respectively. The lower developmental thresholds, intrinsic optimum temperature, and upper lethal developmental threshold obtained by Optim SSI models were 10.12, 24.15, and 36.00 degrees C, respectively. The study of the immature stages of N. rufipes can provide preliminary basic developmental data for the estimation of minimum postmortem interval (PMImin). However, more extensive studies are needed on the effects of constant and fluctuating temperatures on the development of N. rufipes.

AB  - This study aimed to determine the impact of sesame meal, selenium (Se), and vitamin E (VitE) on goats' oxidative status. Thirty mid-lactation crossbred goats were divided into five homogeneous groups, and were fed 1 kg of alfalfa hay and 1.2 kg of concentrates daily. The control group (C) received a basal diet. In the concentrates of the treated groups, 10% of the soybean meal was replaced by sesame meal and no extra VitE or Se (SM), or an extra 60 mg of VitE (SME), or 0.1 mg organic Se (SMSe), or their combination (60 mg VitE and 0,1 mg organic Se/kg of concentrate (SMESe). In the plasma of the goats, the dietary treatments did not affect glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione transferase, catalase, superoxide dismutase activities, malondialdehyde (MDA) content, or the total antioxidant capacity. A reduction and a trend for lower protein carbonyls content was found in goats fed SM (p = 0.03) and SME (p = 0.06) compared to SMESe. In the milk, the lactoperoxidase activity decreased with SMSe and SMESe. A numerical decrease in the total antioxidant capacity and an increase in the MDA content in the milk of the SMESe group compared with the other treated groups was found. In mid-lactation goats, SM improves the oxidative status of both the organism and the milk.

AB  - This study aimed to perform ultrasonography of the tympanic bulla in healthy, non-sedated camelids for the first time. In the first step, dissection and sonography in cadaver specimens allowed the essential identification of the anatomical structures of the region of interest. Ultrasonography of the tympanic bulla was then performed on 71 healthy llamas and alpacas, and the length of the visible lateral bulla wall was measured sonographically. The reproducibility of measuring was determined between two examiners. Differences in length and the influences of gender, age, and body condition scores were monitored. A 10 MHz linear probe was positioned in the rostrocaudal and dorsoventral directions caudal to the mandibular ramus and ventral to the base of the ear using a lateral approach. The equipment used proved to be appropriate to visualize the tympanic bulla, the zygomatic bone, the paracondylar process, the external ear canal, and the parotid gland in the cadaver specimens and all live animals. Llamas revealed a significantly longer visible lateral bulla wall than alpacas, but its length was not influenced by gender, body condition score, or age. In alpacas, older females showed a significantly shorter tympanic bulla wall. The intra- and inter-observer reliability yielded a significant agreement. Based on this study's results, ultrasonography may serve as a non-invasive diagnostic tool for detecting osseous and soft-tissue changes in camelids with otitis media.

AB  - This study identified and evaluated conventional and low -carbon swine production systems through a review of literature and visits to commercial farrow -to -finish swine farms in the Philippines, aiming to recommend a swine production system that costeffectively reduces GHG emissions. Parameters assessed were greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, carbon and payback period, and return on investment through conduct of life cycle assessment. The identified conventional technologies are open -sided housing system, slatted flooring, modified manual feeding system, nipple drinker, and scrapper and power sprayer as cleaning systems. The identified low carbon technologies are low protein swine feed formulation supplemented with amino acids and partial substitution of soybean meal with Protein -Enriched Copra Meal (PECM), open -sided housing with cemented flooring, manual feeding system, bite ball valve, scrapper combined with power sprayer as cleaning system, and biogas digester as manure management system. These entailed a GHG emission reduction potential of 31.93% in reference to the conventional system. The low carbon production system accounted for higher return on investment of 36.75% and shorter payback period at 2.72 years, compared to the conventional system that yielded 19.96% and 5.01 years, respectively. The identified low carbon swine farm production system can be a cost-effective alternative to the conventional production system.

AB  - Introduction Lupins and other legumes have been considered as alternative plant-based protein sources to soybeans for both humans and livestock. Furthermore, they can contribute to more sustainable agricultural systems. The productivity and chemical composition of legumes is highly variable between species, cultivars, and with the edaphoclimatic conditions.Methods This work evaluated the adaptability of seven Lupinus cultivars in two different sowing locations, during two consecutive years, through the characterization of their seed, as a means of investigating their suitability to be used as a source of food and/or feed.Results and discussion Lupinus angustifolius cv. Tango and Lupinus luteus cv. Acos were the most stable genotypes across the environments when considering the seed and protein production, while L. luteus cv. Alburquerque and L. luteus cv. Mister showed less variation in the total alkaloid content across the environments. The edaphoclimatic conditions affected seed and protein yields, as higher rainfall resulted in high productivity. The lower temperatures observed in the first year at both locations caused a reduction in the production of alkaloids in L. luteus cv. Acos and Cardiga. Due to the high alkaloid content of some of the studied cultivars their use as food or feed can pose some safety concerns. However, these cultivars can have high levels of resistance to herbivore and insect attacks, which can be of the utmost importance for the use of these crops for recovering poor or exhausted soils.

AB  - Maternal separation is a detrimental postnatal influence, whereas environmental enrichment is a therapeutic and protective agent. It is unclear if long-term environmental enrichment can compensate for the effects of maternal separation stress on memory-related alterations. This study examined how environmental enrichment affected memory functions, anxiety level, Grin2a, Grin2b, BDNF, and cFos expressions in the maternally separated rats. There are seven groups in this study: control (C), maternal separation+standard cage (MS), maternal separation + enriched cage (MSE), enriched cage (E), the maternal separation that decapitated at postnatal 21 (MS21) and standard cage that decapitated at PN21 (C21) for hormone and gene expression analysis. The maternal sepa-ration procedure consisted of postnatal 21 days. Learning and memory performance were determined with the Morris water tank test; anxiety and locomotor activity were examined with the open field and elevated plus-maze test. The expression levels of genes were measured by the RT-PCR method. Blood corticosterone level was evaluated by the ELISA method. Results showed that MS increased memory performance, locomotor activity, and anxiety, but it did not change gene expression levels. An enriched environment did not change the memory performance, locomotor activity, and related gene expression levels. MSE group increased their memory per-formance, but the anxiety, locomotor activity, and gene expression level did not change. Grin2a, Grin2b, and BDNF gene expression and corticosterone levels increased in the MS21 group. Maternal separation increased memory performance, but it also increased anxiety. Environmental enrichment alone was insufficient to cause alterations in the memory performance.

AB  - Managing reproduction of a dairy sheep flock without using hormones for oestrus induction and synchronisation is an alternative method that complies with agroecological principles, animal welfare and public health concerns. However, shifting from conventional reproductive management to a hormone-free philosophy means leaving more room for individual intraflock variability in oestrus occurrence. The success of establishing alternative hormone-free reproduction systems relies on managing the variability of ewes' individual responses, which are themselves influenced by individual characteristics. Therefore, the so-called REPROsheep model was built to study the effects of individual ewes' characteristics, such as age, body condition score (BCS) or milk yield, on individual responses, as well as the overall productive and reproductive performances of the flock. This dynamic agent-based model (ABM) represents individual reproduction and lactation processes in a hormone-free management context. Outputs at the flock level were simulated using this model. Two dynamic outputs (weekly number of ewes lambing and weekly milk yield) and two punctual outputs (total number of ewes lambing and total milk yield) were simulated. Sensitivity analysis showed that the studied outputs were affected by ewe age, pre-mating BCS and milk-yield distributions in the flock. Increasing average age or pre-mating BCS by 0.5 from a starting point of 2.5 and average milk-yield by 50 L from a starting point of 195 L appeared to increase, for one breeding season, the number of ewes lambing, the concentration of those lambing events over one period, as well as total milk yield, whereas decreasing the average value of these factors by the same amount appeared to produce the opposite effect. Management strategies favouring an optimum age and pre-mating BCS, as well as good milk yield for the individuals of the flock, may thus be a lever for optimising performance, especially lambing distribution over time. Therefore, the REPROsheep model seems relevant to determine how a management strategy (affecting flock structure in terms of age, body condition or production potential) can impact the performance of a dairy sheep flock in the context of hormone-free reproduction.

AB  - A core aspiration of the ecological sciences is to determine how systems work, which implies the challenge of developing a causal understanding. Causal inference has long been approached from a statistical perspective, which can be limited and restrictive for a variety of reasons. Ecologists and other natural scientists have historically pursued mechanistic knowledge as an alternative approach to causal understanding, though without explicit reference to the requirements of causal statistics. In this paper, I describe the premises of an expanded paradigm for causal studies, the Integrative Causal Investigation Paradigm, that subsumes causal statistics and mechanistic investigation into a multi-evidence approach. This paradigm is distinct from the one articulated by causal statistics in that it (1) focuses its attention on the long-term goal of building causal knowledge across multiple studies and (2) recognizes the essential role of mechanistic investigations in establishing a causal understanding. The Integrative Paradigm, consequentially, proposes that there are multiple methodological routes to building causal knowledge and thus represents a pluralistic perspective. This paper begins by describing the crux of the problem faced by causal statistics. To understand this problem, it should be recognized that the word causal has multiple meanings and a variety of evidential standards. An expanded vocabulary is developed so as to reduce ambiguities and clarify critical issues. I further show by example that there is an important ingredient typically omitted from consideration in causal statistics, which is the known information related to the mechanisms underlying relationships being evaluated. To address this issue, I describe a procedure, Causal Knowledge Analysis, that involves an evaluation and compilation of existing evidence indicative of causal content and the features of mechanisms. Causal Knowledge Analysis is applied to three example situations to illustrate the process and its potential for contributing to the development of causal knowledge. The implications of adopting the proposed paradigm and associated procedures are discussed and include the potential for advancing ecology, the potential for clarifying causal methodology, and the potential for contributing to predictive forecasting.

AB  - Tulip trees (Liriodendron tulipifera and Liriodendron chinense), members of the Magnolia family, are known for their distinctive morphology and ecological significance, but their chemical diversity remains understudied. In this study, we report the identification and characterization of an array of sesquiterpene lactones (SQLs) produced by L. tulipifera. Through comprehensive chemical analysis, including high-resolution mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we identified a series of STLs with distinct bioactivity profiles. Notably, one of these compounds exhibited antibacterial activity but was only present in L. tulipifera, being absent in L. chinense. Additionally, some STLs demonstrated significant deterrent effects on herbivory or increased mortality, supporting their role as chemical defenses against grazing organisms. These findings provide new insight into the ecological and chemical functions of Liriodendron, highlighting this group's capacity to produce complex bioactive metabolites that may have pharmaceutical and agricultural applications. Our results also suggest that sesquiterpene lactones could be central to the plant's adaptive strategies following evolutionary differentiation with species-specific production of certain metabolites. This work opens new avenues for the exploration of natural products with antimicrobial and herbivore-deterrent properties, with implications for both natural product chemistry and agrochemical lead development.

AB  - Premise: Invasive plant species often escape from specialist herbivores and are more likely to be attacked by generalist herbivores in the exotic range. Consequently, the shifting defense hypothesis predicts that invasive plants will produce higher concentrations of qualitative defense compounds to deter dominant generalist herbivores in the exotic range. Here, I additionally propose a reduced chemical diversity hypothesis (RCDH), which predicts that reduced herbivory pressure will select for invasive plant genotypes that produce lower diversities of chemical defense compounds in the exotic range.
   Methods: I tested whether (1) invasive Brassica nigra populations express a lower diversity and an overall higher concentration of glucosinolate compounds than native-range B. nigra; (2) Brassica nigra individuals that express high diversities and concentrations of glucosinolate compounds are more attractive to specialist and deterrent to generalist herbivores; and (3) tissues of invasive B. nigra are less palatable than tissues of native-range B. nigra to the generalist herbivores Theba pisana and Helix aspersa.
   Results: Invasive B. nigra populations produced a significantly lower diversity of glucosinolate compounds, a marginally higher concentration of total glucosinolates, and a significantly higher concentration of sinigrin (the dominant glucosinolate). Leaf tissues of invasive B. nigra were significantly less palatable to T. pisana and marginally less so to H. aspersa. Brassica nigra individuals that expressed high concentrations of total glucosinolate compounds were visited by a low diversity of generalist herbivore species in the field.
   Conclusions: In line with the RCDH, the lower diversity of glucosinolate compounds produced by invasive B. nigra populations likely resulted from selection imposed by reduced herbivory pressure in the exotic range.

AB  - Background: The social interactions of farm animals affect their performance, health and welfare. This proof-of-concept study addresses, for the first time, the hypothesis that applying social network analysis (SNA) on AI-automated monitoring data could potentially facilitate the analysis of social structures of farm animals. Methods: Data were collected using automated recording systems that captured 2D-camera images and videos of pigs in six pens (16-19 animals each) on a PIC breeding company farm (USA). The system provided real-time data, including ear-tag readings, elapsed time, posture (standing, lying, sitting), and XY coordinates of the shoulder and rump for each pig. Weighted SNA was performed, based on the proximity of "standing" animals, for two 3-day period-the early (first month after mixing) and the later period (60 days post-mixing). Results: Group-level degree, betweenness, and closeness centralization showed a significant increase from the early-growing period to the later one (p < 0.02), highlighting the pigs' social dynamics over time. Individual SNA traits were stable over these periods, except for the closeness centrality and clustering coefficient, which significantly increased (p < 0.00001). Conclusions: This study demonstrates that combining AI-assisted monitoring technologies with SNA offers a novel approach that can help farmers and breeders in optimizing on-farm management, breeding and welfare practices.

AB  - Simple Summary: Meloxicam is an anti-inflammatory drug used to treat pain and inflammation in ruminants including sheep, and pharmacokinetic studies are needed to protect the food supply from drug residues after use in food-producing animals. This study estimated plasma pharmacokinetic parameters and meat withdrawal intervals (WDI) for market sheep after multiple daily oral doses of meloxicam. Single and multiple dose plasma pharmacokinetic studies, a multi-dose tissue depletion study, and a follow-up study to investigate if events prior to slaughter were associated with differences in plasma meloxicam concentrations, all using sample data collected after completion of dosing, were completed. Using regulatory agency methods for calculating withdrawal times, an estimated WDI of at least 10 d following the last dose is recommended for market lambs treated with ten daily oral 1 mg/kg doses of meloxicam tablets suspended in water. The effect of events surrounding slaughter on plasma meloxicam concentrations in lambs is unknown but should be considered if plasma samples are obtained immediately prior to or during the slaughter process and used for pharmacokinetic investigations.<br></p>

AB  - The host genome may influence the composition of the intestinal microbiota, and the intestinal microbiota has a significant effect on muscle growth and development. In this study, we found that the deletion of the myostatin (MSTN) gene positively regulates the expression of the intestinal tight junction-related genes TJP1 and OCLN through the myosin light-chain kinase/myosin light chain pathway. The intestinal structure of MSTN-/- pigs differed from wild-type, including by the presence of a thicker muscularis and longer plicae. Together, these changes affect the structure of intestinal microbiota. Mice transplanted with the intestinal microbiota of MSTN-/- pigs had myofibers with larger cross-sectional areas and higher fast-twitch glycolytic muscle mass. Microbes responsible for the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were enriched in both the MSTN-/- pigs and recipient mice, and SCFAs levels were elevated in the colon contents. We also demonstrated that valeric acid stimulates type IIb myofiber growth by activating the Akt/mTOR pathway via G protein-coupled receptor 43 and ameliorates dexamethasone-induced muscle atrophy. This is the first study to identify the MSTN gene-gut microbiota-SCFA axis and its regulatory role in fast-twitch glycolytic muscle growth.

AB  - Plant defense strategies against insect herbivores are classified broadly as resistance or tolerance. Resistance deters insect growth or feeding, while tolerance mitigates negative effects of herbivory on plant fitness. Plant investment into resistance or tolerance strategies likely falls along a continuum that has been shaped by ecoevolutionary factors, such as plant domestication or coexistence histories with herbivores. Relatively little is known about how general defense strategies differ against aboveground foliar herbivores and belowground root herbivores. In the current study, we investigated defense strategies of plant species in the gourd family (Cucurbitaceae) against aboveground squash bug (Anasa tristis) or belowground striped cucumber beetle (Acalymma vittatum) herbivory. We selected six cucurbit plant species that differed in domestication status and coexistence history with herbivores: zucchini squash (Cucurbita pepo subsp. pepo); Texas gourd (Cucurbita pepo subsp. texana); pumpkin (Cucurbita maxima); buffalo gourd (Cucurbita foetidissima); cucumber (Cucumis sativus); and watermelon (Citrullus lanatus). For each plant species and herbivore combination, we conducted separate resistance and tolerance assays. We also carried out a field experiment to examine how longer-term herbivory influences plant reproductive and vegetative growth. We observed variation in resistance among cucurbit plant species against aboveground and belowground herbivory. Across species, plants were generally more tolerant of herbivory belowground than aboveground. We determined that wild plants were more resistant than domesticated counterparts to herbivory aboveground but not belowground. Further, plants with an herbivore coexistence history were less resistant to herbivory aboveground and belowground compared to those without. With longer-term herbivory in the field, zucchini plants were more tolerant of either aboveground or belowground herbivory than watermelon plants. Collectively, our findings highlight differences in plant defense against aboveground and belowground herbivores, advancing understanding of the eco-evolutionary factors shaping plant defense strategies and providing new insights for agricultural pest management in cucurbits.

AB  - Thymoquinone nanoparticles (TQNPs) are broadly utilized in numerous pharmaceutical applications. In the present study, we tested the effects of TQNP supplementation on sperm quality and kinematics, acrosome exocytosis, oxidative biomarkers, apoptosis-like and morphological changes of frozen-thawed buffalo sperm, as well as the fertilizing capacity. Semen was collected from buffalo bulls, diluted (1:10; semen/extender), and divided into five aliquots comprising various concentrations of TQNP 0 (CON), 12.5 (TQNP12.5), 25 (TQNP25), 37.5 (TQNP37.5), and 50 (TQNP50) mu g/mL, and then cryopreserved and stored in liquid nitrogen (-196 degrees C). The results revealed that TQNPs (25 to 50 mu g/mL) provided the most optimal results in terms of membrane integrity (p < 0.001) and progressive motility (p < 0.01). In contrast, TQNP50 resulted in a greater post-thawed sperm viability (p = 0.02) compared with other groups. The addition of TQNPs to the extender had no discernible effects on sperm morphology measures. Sperm kinematic motion was significantly improved in the TQNP50 group compared to the control group (p < 0.01). TQNPs effectively reduced the content of H2O2 and MDA levels and improved the total antioxidant capacity of post-thawed extended semen (p < 0.01). The addition of TQNP significantly increased the number of intact acrosomes (p < 0.0001) and decreased the number of exocytosed acrosomes (p < 0.0001). A significant reduction in apoptosis-like changes was observed in TQNP groups. The non-return rates of buffalo cows inseminated with TQNP50-treated spermatozoa were higher than those in the control group (p < 0.05; 88% vs. 72%). These findings suggested that the freezing extender supplemented with TQNPs could effectively enhance the cryotolerance and fertility of buffalo sperm.

AB  - Contextual memories are critical for survival but must be extinguished when new conditions render them nonproductive. By most accounts, extinction forms a new memory that competes with the original association for control over behavior, but the underlying circuit mechanisms remain largely enigmatic. Here, we demonstrate that extinction of contextual fear conditioning recruits somatostatin interneurons (SST-INs) in the ventral hippocampus. Correspondingly, real-time activity of SST-INs correlates with transitions between immobility and movement, signaling exit from defensive freezing bouts. Optogenetic manipulation of SSTINs but not parvalbumin interneurons (PV-INs) elicits bidirectional changes in freezing that are specific to the context in which extinction was acquired. Finally, similar effects were obtained following extinction of sucrose-based appetitive conditioning, in which SST-IN inhibition triggers relapse to reward seeking. These data suggest that ventral hippocampal SST-INs play a fundamental role in extinction that is independent of affective valence and may be related to their disruption of spontaneous emotional responses.

AB  - The microbiome is a complex community of microorganisms, encompassing prokaryotic (bacterial and archaeal), eukaryotic, and viral entities. This microbial ensemble plays a pivotal role in influencing the health and productivity of diverse ecosystems while shaping the web of life. However, many software suites developed to study microbiomes analyze only the prokaryotic community and provide limited to no support for viruses and microeukaryotes. Previously, we introduced the Viral Eukaryotic Bacterial Archaeal (VEBA) open-source software suite to address this critical gap in microbiome research by extending genome-resolved analysis beyond prokaryotes to encompass the understudied realms of eukaryotes and viruses. Here we present VEBA 2.0 with key updates including a comprehensive clustered microeukaryotic protein database, rapid genome/protein-level clustering, bioprospecting, non-coding/organelle gene modeling, genome-resolved taxonomic/pathway profiling, long-read support, and containerization. We demonstrate VEBA's versatile application through the analysis of diverse case studies including marine water, Siberian permafrost, and white-tailed deer lung tissues with the latter showcasing how to identify integrated viruses.

AB  - Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have become a standard approach for exploring the genetic basis of phenotypic variation. However, correlation is not causation, and only a tiny fraction of all associations have been experimentally confirmed. One practical problem is that a peak of association does not always pinpoint a causal gene, but may instead be tagging multiple causal variants. In this study, we reanalyze a previously reported peak associated with flowering time traits in Swedish Arabidopsis thaliana population. The peak appeared to pinpoint the AOP2/AOP3 cluster of glucosinolate biosynthesis genes, which is known to be responsible for natural variation in herbivore resistance. Here we propose an alternative hypothesis, by demonstrating that the AOP2/AOP3 flowering association can be wholly accounted for by allelic variation in two flanking genes with clear roles in regulating flowering: NDX1, a regulator of the main flowering time controller FLC, and GA1, which plays a central role in gibberellin synthesis and is required for flowering under some conditions. In other words, we propose that the AOP2/AOP3 flowering-time association may be yet another example of a spurious, "synthetic" association, arising from trying to fit a single-locus model in the presence of two statistically associated causative loci. We conclude that caution is needed when using GWAS for fine-mapping.

AB  - Simple Summary Heat stress is one of the major problems affecting the thermotolerance of livestock in Australia and in many parts of the world. Dietary interventions are considered to be one of the effective strategies to beat the heat. Hence, this study evaluated the benefits of reducing the fermentability of wheat grains (Bioprotect (TM)) in the diet of Merino lambs. These results indicated that Bioprotect supplementation had a positive effect on the respiratory rate and heart rate of heat-stressed lambs.
   The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of reducing the fermentability of grains on thermoregulatory responses in heat stressed (HS) lambs. To achieve this, wheat grain treated with a commercial starch binding agent, Bioprotect, is compared to maize, which has already demonstrated effects in ameliorating heat stress-induced thermoregulation responses and untreated wheat grains. An initial in vitro experiment was conducted to examine cumulative gas production from the fermentation of wheat grain with different dosages of the commercial starch binding agent, Bioprotect. Based on the in vitro results, an in vivo lamb experiment was conducted using 24 Merino lambs (1 year old; 42.6 +/- 3.6 kg BW). The lambs were offered one of three dietary treatments: a wheat-based diet (WD), a Bioprotect treated wheat-based diet (BD), and a maize-based diet (MD). Three successive 1-week experimental periods were conducted with lambs from all dietary groups (P1, P2, and P3). During P1, lambs were exposed to a TN environment and fed a 1.7x Maintenance feed intake (MF) level; in P2, lambs were kept in a HS environment and fed a 1.7x MF level; and in P3, animals were kept in a HS environment and fed a 2x MF level. The in vitro experiment revealed a reduction in cumulative gas production (p < 0.05) from the Bioprotect treated wheat compared to untreated wheat samples. In the in vivo component of the study, the replacement of wheat with maize or 2% Bioprotect-treated wheat reduced the respiration rate (p < 0.001) and heart rate (p <= 0.01) of lambs during HS. There was a reduction in the concentration of blood gas variables such as a base excess of blood (BE(b)) and extracellular fluid (BE(ecf)), bicarbonate (CHCO3-), the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)), the total concentration of carbon dioxide (ctCO(2)), and sodium (Na+) (p <= 0.001 for all) during the periods of HS compared to the thermoneutral conditions. Moreover, BD- and MD-fed lambs had a higher blood potassium concentration (K+) than the WD-fed lambs (p = 0.008). The results of the present study suggest that Bioprotect can be a viable feed treatment strategy for treating rapidly fermentable grains such as wheat to alleviate the effects of HS. Further, Bioprotect-treated wheat could be an option to replace maize in concentrate rations in jurisdictions where maize is cost-prohibitive or unavailable.

AB  - Using an object-choice task, we measured the relative quantity discrimination ability of Asian elephants. Two zoo-housed elephants were given auditory cues of food being dropped into two containers (Nonvisible condition), and in one condition they could also see the food on top of the containers (Visible condition). Elephants received sets of varying ratios and magnitudes. We found that the elephants chose the greater quantity of food significantly above chance in both the Visible and Nonvisible conditions. Additionally, we found the elephants' ability to discriminate between quantities decreased as the ratio, and not the absolute difference, between the quantities increased, which is predicted by the accumulator model. We also compare our findings to those from a study using the same methods with African savanna elephants and found that the two species performed at similar levels, but given our small sample size it is difficult to make strong species-level conclusions. In discussing our results, we consider differences between the two species' wild environments as well as the types of sensory cues provided in human care, and we provide recommendations for extensions of this work.

AB  - The white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum) is threatened primarily due to continued poaching for its horns. In South Africa, partly to promote the conservation of the species, white rhinos have been introduced into areas where they did not occur historically (i.e. where they are considered extralimital). Few studies have investigated the conservation contribution of extralimital white rhinos to the overall national herd. We aimed to determine whether the white rhinos introduced to a private game reserve in the Eastern Cape province have been successful from a reproductive perspective. We calculated inter-calving intervals, age at first calving, sex ratios of calves, and recruitment rates for white rhinos at a single site between 1992 and 2019. The average net annual population growth rate for the population was 10%, which is higher than the recommended 5% by the Biodiversity Management Plan for white rhinos. Trends in density-dependent parameters such as age at first calving and inter-calving intervals also indicated that the study population is still well below the density at which ecological constraints may manifest. We demonstrate that an extralimital white rhino population in the Eastern Cape can be successful from a reproductive perspective.

AB  - Simple Summary Subclinical mastitis is a common and economically significant disease that affects dairy sheep production. This study aims to develop and evaluate an advanced algorithmic approach that integrates thermal imaging, statistical texture analysis, and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) to accurately detect subclinical mastitis in dairy sheep. This approach focuses on improving the accuracy and reliability of non-invasive subclinical mastitis detection by using more sophisticated algorithmic procedures than traditional temperature differential methods, thereby enhancing livestock management and animal health monitoring.Abstract Subclinical mastitis is a common and economically significant disease that affects dairy sheep production. Thermal imaging presents a promising avenue for non-invasive detection, but existing methodologies often rely on simplistic temperature differentials, potentially leading to inaccurate assessments. This study proposes an advanced algorithmic approach integrating thermal imaging processing with statistical texture analysis and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE). Our method achieves a high classification accuracy of 84% using the support vector machines (SVM) algorithm. Furthermore, we introduce another commonly employed evaluation metric, correlating thermal images with commercial California mastitis test (CMT) results after establishing threshold conditions on statistical features, yielding a sensitivity (the true positive rate) of 80% and a specificity (the true negative rate) of 92.5%. The evaluation metrics underscore the efficacy of our approach in detecting subclinical mastitis in dairy sheep, offering a robust tool for improved management practices.

AB  - Sediment collected from the rivers of southern Alberta, Canada, presents patterns of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) that demonstrate a varied origin within the Rocky Mountains. An influx of PAHs from sub-bituminous coal sources from erosional processes as the river exit the mountains dominates the pattern of PAHs in the river sediment across the prairies to the Alberta-Saskatchewan border (a distance of 750 km for the Red Deer River and 925 km for the Bow River) continues much further downstream. The concentrations of PAHs are similar to the well-studied Athabasca River in the Alberta Oil Sands Region. Although these results relate to rivers flowing east from the Rocky Mountains in Canada, it is likely that coal-sourced PAHs will contribute to any river where erosion of coal formations is possible within the watershed. A distinctive natural pattern of strongly pyrogenic PAHs from nearby thermal hot springs was also discovered near Banff. Natural pyrogenic PAH sources, aside from wildfires, are uncommon and generally related to hydrothermal vents and igneous intrusions into source rocks. This is the first time the authors are aware of sediment from a thermal spring presenting such PAH patterns.

AB  - Mastitis, a production disease with multiple etiologies, inflicts significant economic losses among dairy farmers around the globe. In this study, an attempt has been made to detect mastitis through a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)-based deep learning model using 7615 udder thermograms of 40 Murrah buffaloes. The thermograms were grouped separately as healthy, sub-clinical (SCM), and clinical mastitis (CM) affected udder quarters based on California Mastitis Test (CMT) scores, Somatic Cell Count (SCC) values and thermal image analysis. Results of thermogram analysis revealed a significant increase (p < 0.01) in the mean values of udder skin surface temperature (USST) among SCM and CM-affected quarters compared to healthy quarters to the tune of 1.32 and 2.61 degrees C, respectively. The USST showed a strong positive correlation with the CMT score (r = 0.87, p < 0.01) and log(10)SCC value (r = 0.88, p < 0.01). The sequential (Normal vs. Clinical and Normal vs. Sub-clinical) models had training accuracy and validation accuracy of 0.999 and 0.988, 0.991 and 0.978, respectively. The confusion matrix for Normal vs. Clinical and Normal vs. Sub-clinical models reflected a loss of 0.009 and 0.029, precision of 0.947 and 0.980, and recall of 0.996 and 0.904, respectively. Consequently, the sequential (Normal vs. Clinical and Normal vs. Sub-clinical) models achieved a testing accuracy of 0.970 and 0.943, respectively. Thus, the improved deep-learning CNN models efficiently predicted SCM and CM cases in Murrah buffaloes.

AB  - Context. The appropriate course of angiogenesis in the endometrium is crucial for pregnancy establishment and maintenance. Very little is known about the factors linking vessel formation and immune system functioning.Aims. We hypothesised that chemerin, an adipokine known for its involvement in the regulation of energy balance and immunological functions, may act as a potent regulator of endometrial angiogenesis during early pregnancy in pigs.Methods. Porcine endometrial tissue explants were obtained from pregnant pigs on days 10-11, 12-13, 15-16 and 27-28, and on days 10-12 of the oestrous cycle. The explants were in vitro cultured for 24 h in the presence of chemerin (100, 200 ng/mL) or in medium alone (control). We evaluated the in vitro effect of chemerin on the secretion of vascular endothelial growth factors A-D (VEGF-A-D), placental growth factor (PlGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and angiopoietin 1 and 2 (ANG-1, ANG-2) with the ELISA method. The protein abundance of angiogenesis-related factor receptors, VEGF receptors 1-3 (VEGFR1-3), FGF receptors 1 and 2 (FGFR1-2) and ANG receptor (TIE2) was evaluated with the Western blot (WB) method. We also analysed the influence of chemerin on the phosphorylation of AMPK using WB.Key results. We found that in the studied endometrial samples, chemerin up-regulated the secretion of VEGF-A, VEGF-B and PlGF, and protein expression of VEGFR3. The adipokine caused a decrease in VEGF-C, VEGF-D and ANG-1 release. Chemerin effect on bFGF and ANG-2 secretion, and protein content of VEGFR1, VEGFR2, FGFR1, FGFR2 and TIE2 were dependent on the stage of pregnancy. Chemerin was found to down-regulate AMPK phosphorylation.Conclusions. The obtained in vitro results suggest that chemerin could be an important factor in the early pregnant uterus by its influence on angiogenic factors' secretion and signalling.Implications. The obtained results on the role of chemerin in the process of endometrial angiogenesis may, in the long term perspective, contribute to the elaboration of more effective methods of modifying reproductive processes and maintaining energy homeostasis in farm animals.

AB  - Simple Summary Photosensitization is a cutaneous disorder caused by a substance that makes the skin sensitive to solar radiation. When this substance is endogenous (phylloethrin) as a result of chlorophyll not being metabolized in the liver, by hepatic failure, photosensitization is called secondary. When the substance is of exogenous origin, photosensitization is primary. Outbreaks of photosensitization caused by the ingestion of Chamaecrista serpens have been described in the semi-arid region of Bahia, Northeastern Brazil, in cattle, sheep and horses. However, there are still doubts regarding the type of photosensitization. The objective of this study was to determine if the photosensitization caused by C. serpens is primary or secondary. The disease was reproduced in three groups of two sheep each ingesting C. serpens as the only food or at daily doses of 10 and 20 g per kg bodyweight. The six sheep showed lesions of photosensitization. Two control sheep were not affected. No alterations were observed in the serum activities of aspartate-amino transferase (AST) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), suggesting that liver function was adequate. No histologic lesions were found in the livers of the sheep with photosensitization, demonstrating that the disease is a primary photosensitization caused by the consumption of C. serpens. This study aimed to clarify the type of photosensitization induced by C. serpens and to verify if the plant remains toxic after being collected and stored. Eight crossbred sheep, aged between 6 and 36 months, were divided into three groups (G1 to G3). Over 30 days, daily, G1 received an exclusive diet of C. serpens, and G2 and G3 received 10 g/kg/BW and 20 g/kg/BW, respectively. Two other sheep were used as controls (CG). Before administration, the plant had been harvested every 15 days. Liver biopsies and blood samples were taken from all sheep on day zero and weekly. All sheep that received the plant developed clinical signs of photosensitization, and no changes were observed in the serum activities of AST and GGT. On day 30, all sheep except Ov1 from G1 and Ov7 were euthanized and necropsied. All sheep that received the plant developed clinical signs. Macroscopic or histologic lesions were not observed in the liver. Ov 1 recovered 13 days after the end of ingestion. These results demonstrated that C. serpens causes primary photosensitization. It is advisable to avoid grazing on pastures invaded by the plant or to remove them from the pastures immediately after observing the first signs.

AB  - This study aims to demonstrate an integrated methodology for the valorisation of bakery former food products (FFP) as an ingredient of pig feed diets. The methodology involves: conducting a needs analysis and a full path traceability scheme based on Global Standards 1 (GS1) Organisation (Brussels, Belgium) standards, designing digital tools to support the implementation of the traceability scheme, and assessing the valorisation of FFP and, more specifically, of bakery by-products in bakery meal (BM) production, and its implementation in pig feed diet. BM production comprises various bakery by-products, which were collected, unpacked, grinded, and thermally treated. Physicochemical and microbiological analyses were conducted on BM samples, mainly focusing on nutrient composition, and the presence of aflatoxins, mycotoxins, and pathogenic microorganisms. The BM was then fed to finishing pigs (at an inclusion rate of 20% w/w), in parallel to a control group fed with a conventional pig feed diet. The animals in both dietary groups were evaluated for growth performance, and meat samples were analysed for specific quality parameters and sensory characteristics. The results show that the addition of 20% w/w BM does not significantly affect the growth performance or the meat quality of the pigs. Moreover, a sensory evaluation revealed minor differences in the sensory characteristics of the meat samples, denoting that the BM addition does not seem to dwindle the final meat product.

AB  - Simple Summary Freeze-drying (or lyophilization) is a method to preserve cells and tissues in which frozen material is dried by sublimation of ice. One of the main advantages is that nitrogen and dry ice are no longer required for the storage and shipment of biological material, which can be kept at room temperature or 4 degrees C, resulting in enormous reductions in costs. Although widely used to preserve biomolecules and macromolecular assemblies, freeze-drying of cells and tissues is currently experimental. Here, we lyophilized sheep ovarian tissue with a novel device named Darya and assessed effects on tissue integrity and gene expression. We show that ovarian tissue survives lyophilization procedures, maintaining its general structure and reacting to the different experimental steps by regulation of specific genes. Our results contribute to the optimization of protocols to freeze-dry ovarian tissues and may find application in programs of animal and human reproductive tissue preservation. Cryopreservation is routinely used to preserve cells and tissues; however, long time storage brings many inconveniences including the use of liquid nitrogen. Freeze-drying could enable higher shelf-life stability at ambient temperatures and facilitate transport and storage. Currently, the possibility to freeze-dry reproductive tissues maintaining vitality and functions is still under optimization. Here, we lyophilized sheep ovarian tissue with a novel device named Darya and a new vitrification and drying protocol and assessed effects on tissue integrity and gene expression. The evaluation was performed immediately after lyophilization (Lio), after rehydration (LR0h) or after two hours of in vitro culture (IVC; LR2h). The tissue survived lyophilization procedures and maintained its general structure, including intact follicles at different stages of development, however morphological and cytoplasmic modifications were noticed. Lyophilization, rehydration and further IVC increasingly affected RNA integrity and caused progressive morphological alterations. Nevertheless, analysis of a panel of eight genes showed tissue survival and reaction to the different procedures by regulation of specific gene expression. Results show that sheep ovarian tissue can tolerate the applied vitrification and drying protocol and constitute a valid basis for further improvements of the procedures, with the ultimate goal of optimizing tissue viability after rehydration.

AB  - Many factors underlie the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in humans. In particular, imbalance of microbiota and thinning of the mucosal layer in the large intestine play a huge role. Pathogenic microorganisms also exacerbate the course of diseases. In this research the role of mucin 2 deficiency in the formation of intestinal microflora in the experimental model using the Muc2 gene knockout mice in the presence of Helicobacter spp. was investigated. Also, restorative and anti-inflammatory effect of the dietary L-fucose in the Muc2(-/-) mice on microflora and immunity was evaluated. For this purpose, bacterial diversity in feces was studied in the animals before and after antibiotic therapy and role of the dietary L-fucose in their recovery was assessed. To determine the effect of bacterial imbalance and fucose on the immune system, mRNA levels of the genes encoding pro-inflammatory cytokines (Tnf, Il1a, Il1b, Il6) and transcription factors of T cells (Foxp3 - Treg, Rorc - Th17, Tbx21 - Th1) were determined in the colon tissue of the Muc2(-/-) mice. Significant elimination of bacteria due to antibiotic therapy caused decrease of the fucose levels in the intestine and facilitated reduction of the regulatory T cell transcription factor (Foxp3). When the dietary L-fucose was added to antibiotics, the level of bacterial DNA of Bacteroides spp. in the feces of the Muc2(-/-) mice was partially restored. T regulatory cells are involved in the regulation of inflammation in the Muc2(-/-) mice. Antibiotics reduced the number of regulatory T cell but did not decrease the inflammatory response to infection. Fucose, as a component of mucin 2, helped to maintain the level of Bacteroides spp. during antibiotic therapy of the Muc2(-/-) mice and restored biochemical parameters, but did not affect the inflammatory response.

AB  - Objectives Gene regulation in early embryos has been widely studied for a long time because lineage segregation gives rise to the formation of a pluripotent cell population, known as the inner cell mass (ICM), during pre-implantation embryo development. The extraordinarily longer pre-implantation embryo development in pigs leads to the distinct features of the pluripotency network compared with mice and humans. For these reasons, a comparative study using pre-implantation pig embryos would provide new insights into the mammalian pluripotency network and help to understand differences in the roles and networks of genes in pre-implantation embryos between species. Materials and methods To analyse the functions of SOX2 in lineage segregation and cell proliferation, loss- and gain-of-function studies were conducted in pig embryos using an overexpression vector and the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Then, we analysed the morphological features and examined the effect on the expression of downstream genes through immunocytochemistry and quantitative real-time PCR. Results Our results showed that among the core pluripotent factors, only SOX2 was specifically expressed in the ICM. In SOX2-disrupted blastocysts, the expression of the ICM-related genes, but not OCT4, was suppressed, and the total cell number was also decreased. Likewise, according to real-time PCR analysis, pluripotency-related genes, excluding OCT4, and proliferation-related genes were decreased in SOX2-targeted blastocysts. In SOX2-overexpressing embryos, the total blastocyst cell number was greatly increased but the ICM/TE ratio decreased. Conclusions Taken together, our results demonstrated that SOX2 is essential for ICM formation and cell proliferation in porcine early-stage embryogenesis.

AB  - Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) is an important forage for the development of herbivorous animal husbandry, which is widely planted in the cold climate areas of northern China, where there is low overwintering and forage yield in production, and fertilization is a vital production strategy. A field study was conducted to determine the response of alfalfa's winter survival rate, yield, and yield components to different gradients of phosphate (P) fertilizer (0, 45, 90, and 135 kg P2O5 ha(-1)) in two types of low-phosphorus alkaline soils. The results show that the winter survival rates and forage yield increased at first and then decreased with the increase of P application; the greater winter survival rates were achieved at 45 similar to 90 kg ha(-1) of P fertilizer applied, while the greater forage yield were achieved at 90 kg ha(-1) in the two sites, and the suitable P fertilizer application rates for greater winter survival were less than those for greater forage yield; plant height and shoot mass made a greater contribution to forage yield than other yield components. To pursue greater forage yield, the suitable P fertilization rates for aeolian sandy soil and silt loam soil are 108.1 and 78.3 kg ha(-1), respectively, based on the regression equations. Therefore, in cold winter and soil P deficiency areas, applying P fertilizer can be used as an effective strategy to improve alfalfa's forage yield and persistence, and the most appropriate amount of fertilizer should be determined according to climate and soil conditions.

AB  - This study investigated the enhancement effect of adding eight different conductive materials, namely, biochar (C1), activated carbon (C2), graphite (C3), Fe3O4 (F1), Fe2O3 (F2), micron zero-valent iron (F3), iron filings (F4), and nano zero-valent iron (F5), on the anaerobic codigestion (co-AD) of hulless barley straw and pig manure based on medium-temperature batch anaerobic digestion. The results showed that adding conductive materials improved the methanogenic performance of the co-AD system. The highest cumulative methane production of 362.89 mL/g volatile solids (VS) was obtained with C2, which was 40.47% higher than the control (CK). C2 addition had the best economic efficiency and was the most suitable additive for co-AD. Five additional treatments enhanced methane yields by 18.73%-28.64% in the following order: F4>F3>C1>F1>F2. C3 and F5 inhibited methane production, possibly due to the addition of excessive concentrations of these materials. Microbiological analysis showed that the relative abundance of Syner-01 was higher in all treatment groups with additives, and its distribution pattern was consistent with methane production. Clostridium sensu strict 1 and unclassified Anaerolineaceae had higher relative abundances in the additive treatment groups, excluding C3 and F5. C1, C2, F3, and F4 enriched Methanosarcina and Methanothrix, while F1 and F2 promoted the enrichment of Methanobrevibacter. The addition of C1, C2, F3, and F4 enhanced methane production by enriching acetotrophic methanogens and strengthening direct interspecies electron transfer, whereas F1 and F2 mainly enhanced methane production by promoting the metabolic activity of hydrogenotrophic methanogens.

AB  - Members of the genus Homeomastax have been predicted to exhibit contrasting specialization through ontogeny, with a strong preference for fern plants during the nymphal phase. We investigated whether host-plant specificity and use differ between adults and nymphs of the tropical acridid Homeomastax silvicola (Rehn & Rehn, 1934) within a lowland Caribbean reserve in Costa Rica. Host-plant preference (Nephrolepis brownii (Desv.) Hovenkamp & Miyam. vs. other plants) was assessed by counting adults and nymphs in transects differing in N. brownii fern cover. We assessed their vertical positioning in host plants and analyzed their defensive behavior in response to a potential threat. While adults showed no preference for N. brownii, nymphs were highly associated to ferns, being five times more abundant in areas of high N. brownii cover, and 97% of them being found in that host plant. Nymphs occupy lower parts of the plant, gradually ascending to higher parts as they become adults. Notably, experiments demonstrated that nymphs had over three times less probability of escaping from threats than adults. These results suggest that ferns are crucial host plants for the feeding and protection of H. silvicola progeny, which become more generalist as they develop. We posit that describing specialization patterns in tropical fern-grasshopper systems, and ultimately measuring the drivers of these patterns, offers valuable insights into understanding intraspecific variations of interactions through ontogeny.

AB  - The tick Amblyomma sculptum is of major public health interest given that it transmits the bacterium Rickettsia rickettsii, the pathogen that causes Brazilian spotted fever. Capybaras are primary hosts for this ectoparasite species and natural reservoirs for this bacterium. With the aim of finding new means for controlling this tick, the objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the fungus Purpureocillium lilacinum (IBCB 130) alone and in association with the fungus Metarhizium anisopliae (IBCB 425), in the field. Two areas of 5000 m2 (Pl and MaPl) were used for applications of aqueous suspensions of fungus, once a month over an 11-month period, and there was also a control area that did not receive any application. The fungus P. lilacinum was applied in the area Pl at concentration of 6 x 1011 conidia/ha; and an association of the two fungi (3 x 1011 conidia/ha for P. lilacinum and 1 x 1013 conidia/ha for M. anisopliae) was applied in the area MaPl. One week after each application, ticks were collected by means of CO2 attraction traps that were laid out on the vegetation. The total number of ticks in each trap was then counted and up to 16 individuals (adults and nymphs) from each area were separated out and distributed individually and in pools. These were kept in climate-controlled chambers at 28 degrees C and 80 % relative humidity. On days 5, 10 and 15, mortality among the ticks (individually and in pools) was assessed. Fisher's exact test was used in statistical analysis to ascertain the reduction in population in the treated areas, using data from each area according to periods when either nymphs or adults of A. sculptum predominated (epoch, Ep) or there was no predominance (non-epoch, NEp). The mortality analysis on adult ticks that were housed individually showed percentages of 46 % for area Pl, 44 % for area MaPl and 31 % for the control area, in the evaluation of the 15th day. For the pooled adults, the percentage mortality was 55 % for Pl, 31 % for MaPl and 25 % for the control. The percentage reduction in population for ticks in the adult phase was 69 % for Pl, 69.6 % for MaPl and 7.4 % for the control. For nymphs housed individually, the 15th day mortality was 68 % for Pl, 58 % for MaPl and 60 % for the control; while for the nymphs in pools, the percentages were 92 %, 93 % and 35 % for Pl, MaPl

AB  - Subsistence adaptations respond to environmental instability as well as sociopolitical demands. On the Andean altiplano, camelid husbandry is a key adaptation utilized for thousands of years to mitigate environmental risks to agricultural productivity, to facilitate transport and to generate wealth for political purposes. Here, we reconstruct the history of camelid utilization on the altiplano with fecal stanol biomarkers from Lake Orurillo in southern Peru. Biomarker samples span a 4000-year interval and document changes at centennial timescales. The abundances of individual fecal stanols appear to be less diagnostic of changes in human occupation in the Orurillo region where human population levels apparently remained far lower than those of domesticated camelids. However, ratios of human (coprostanol) to ruminant (24-ethylcoprosanol) fecal stanol concentrations demonstrate that these proxies are reliable indicators of variations in camelid herd sizes. Our data show that camelid utilization intensified after ca. 1050 CE during a severe and protracted drought that was coincident with widespread population movement away from fertile farmlands to higher elevations favorable for grazing. Camelid herds remained in high abundance around Orurillo during improved climate conditions and through the Inca era until after ca. 1500 CE when our data point to a significant disruption after European conquest. The intensification of camelid husbandry among Andean cultures is therefore linked to major environmental and sociopolitical shifts. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Tea plants have a long cultivation history in the world, and the beverage (tea) made from its leaves is well known in the world. Due to the characteristics of self-incompatibility, long-term natural and artificial hybridization, tea plants have a very complex genetic background, which make the classification of tea plants unclear. Molecular marker, one type of genetic markers, has the advantages of stable inheritance, large amount of information, and high reliability. The development of molecular marker has facilitated the understanding of complex tea germ -plasm resources. So far, molecular markers had played important roles in the study of the origin and evolution, the preservation and identification of tea germplasms, and the excellent cultivars breeding of tea plants. How-ever, the information is scattered, making it difficult to understand the advance of molecular markers in tea plants. In this paper, we summarized the development process and types of molecular markers in tea plants. In addition, the application advance of these molecular markers in tea plants was reviewed. Perspectives of mo-lecular markers in tea plants were also systematically provided and discussed. The elaboration of molecular markers in this paper should help us to renew understanding of its application in tea plants.

AB  - The objective was to determine the effects of feeding soybean oil (SBO), an ingredient rich in n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), to late gestation hair ewes on physiological responses, feedlot performance, and serum metabolite and electrolyte concentrations of their growing ewe lambs under outdoor heat stress conditions. Twenty-four Dorper x Pelibuey ewe lambs weaned (body weight = 21.5 +/- 0.2 kg, age= 2 months, and multiple birth) born from ewes fed 0, 30, or 60 mg of SBO/kg dry matter (DM) during late gestation were selected (n = 8/treatment) to conduct a 30-day feeding trial during the summer season of a desert region (temperature = 34 degrees C and temperature-humidity index = 35 units). While rectal temperature was unaffected in any daytime, respiratory rate in the afternoon quadratically increased (P = 0.05) as the SBO levels increased from 0 to 60 mg/kg DM in the maternal diet. Final weight, average daily gain, and feed efficiency linearly increased (P = 0.04) with increasing levels of SBO. Body surface temperatures and serum concentration of glucose, cholesterol, triglyceride, total protein, urea, sodium, potassium, and chlorine did not vary by the SBO inclusion in the maternal diet. In conclusion, feeding late gestation hair ewes with source rich in n-6 PUFA appears to be an effective maternal nutritional strategy to improve post-weaning growth without compromising the thermoregulatory ability of their growing offspring under a heat stress environment.

AB  - The interaction between climate change, agriculture, and financial markets is a topic that has been researched relatively little thus far. This paper intends to extend the literature by empirically testing the relationships between droughts and farms' financing choices (measured in terms of real debt and equity) in New Zealand. Using microeconomic farm-level financial records available from the tax authorities, we quantify how past droughts (measured by the New Zealand pasture growth index) impact farms' financing choices. We show a statistically significant positive impact of droughts on short-term and long-term debts, equity for dairy farms, and short-term debt for sheep and beef farms.

AB  - This article summarizes knowledge on the species composition of oribatid mites of the Transcarpathian lowlands. In total, 174 species of oribatid mites (97 genera and 50 families) are recorded from 53 localities and 18 types of biotopes. Ecological and distributional data for each species are specified. The fauna is compared with that of the other areas of the Pannonian lowlands (Hungary, Slovakia, and Romania).

AB  - The goal of this research was to determine the normal range of arterial blood gas, electrolytes and acid-base status in the healthy male sheep of Iranian Shall breed. For this purpose, the blood sample was collected from the ear artery of 15 Iranian Shall sheep whose health was confirmed by clinical examinations, hematological tests including complete blood count and air-dried blood smear and cardiac evaluations including electrocardiography and echocardiography. Then, the values of pH, partial dioxide carbon pressure, partial oxygen pressure, oxygen saturation, base excess, bicarbonate as well as the concentration of electrolytes and anion gap were measured using a blood gas analyzer. The obtained data were subjected to statistical analyses by SPSS software and the tests of Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Pearson and descriptive statistics of the results were expressed as mean +/- SE, range (minimum and maximum) and confidence interval 95.00%. The results showed the mean value of arterial blood gas including oxygen saturation, partial oxygen pressure, and partial dioxide carbon pressure were 95.69%, 61.58, and 26.28 mmHg, respectively, and the others arterial blood parameters including pH, base excess, and bicarbonate were 7.54, 1.61, and 22.84 mmol L-1, respectively. Also, the mean values of arterial blood electrolytes including Na*, K*, and Cl-, were 143.25, 4.22, and 109.46 mmol L-1, respectively, and the mean anion gap was 12.64 mmol L-1. The present study determined the range of normal amounts of arterial blood gas, electrolytes and acid-base status in the healthy male sheep of Iranian Shall breed which could be used as a reference for further research on sheep diseases and to distinguish healthy status from disease.

AB  - The melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) gene plays a central role in regulating energy homeostasis and food intake in livestock, thereby affecting their economic worth and growth. In a previous study, the p.T117M mutation in the sheep MC4R gene, which leads to the transition of threonine to methionine, was found to affect the body weight at six months and the average daily gain in Hu sheep. However, there are still limited studies on the frequency of the sheep p.T117M missense mutation globally, and the underlying cellular mechanism remains elusive. Therefore, this study first used WGS to investigate the distribution of the MC4R gene p.T117M mutation in 652 individuals across 22 breeds worldwide. The results showed that the mutation frequency was higher in European breeds compared with Chinese sheep breeds, particularly in Poll Dorset sheep (mutation frequency > 0.5). The p.T117M mutation occurs in the first extracellular loop of MC4R. Mechanistically, the basal activity of the mutated receptor is significantly increased. Specifically, upon treatment with alpha-MSH and ACTH ligands, the cAMP and MAPK/ERK signaling activation of M117 MC4R is enhanced. These results indicate that the T117M mutation may change the function of the gene by increasing the constitutive activity and signaling activation of cAMP and MAPK/ERK, and, thus, may regulate the growth traits of sheep. In conclusion, this study delved into the global distribution and underlying cellular mechanisms of the T117M mutation of the MC4R gene, establishing a scientific foundation for breeding sheep with superior growth, thereby contributing to the advancement of the sheep industry.

AB  - A central theme that governs the functional design of biological networks is their ability to sustain stable function despite widespread parametric variability. Here, we investigated the impact of distinct forms of biological heterogeneities on the stability of a two-dimensional continuous attractor network (CAN) implicated in grid-patterned activity generation. We show that increasing degrees of biological heterogeneities progressively disrupted the emergence of grid-patterned activity and resulted in progressively large perturbations in low-frequency neural activity. We postulated that targeted suppression of low-frequency perturbations could ameliorate heterogeneity-induced disruptions of grid-patterned activity. To test this, we introduced intrinsic resonance, a physiological mechanism to suppress low-frequency activity, either by adding an additional high-pass filter (phenomenological) or by incorporating a slow negative feedback loop (mechanistic) into our model neurons. Strikingly, CAN models with resonating neurons were resilient to the incorporation of heterogeneities and exhibited stable grid-patterned firing. We found CAN models with mechanistic resonators to be more effective in targeted suppression of low-frequency activity, with the slow kinetics of the negative feedback loop essential in stabilizing these networks. As low-frequency perturbations (1/f noise) are pervasive across biological systems, our analyses suggest a universal role for mechanisms that suppress low-frequency activity in stabilizing heterogeneous biological networks.

AB  - The quality of precipitation (P) and potential evapotranspiration (PET) data greatly affects the hydrological modeling performance. Considerable attention has been paid to identifying the influence of biased P or PET inputs independently. However, few studies have explored the joint interaction of biases in P and PET inputs on hydrological simulations. Here, we investigate the mutual compensation of P and PET biases on the performance of two widely used conceptual hydrological models, the Xinanjiang model and the Probability Distributed Model. P and PET from HYREX (HYdrological Radar EXperiment) and CAMELS-GB (Catchment Attributes and Meteorology for Large-sample Studies in Great Britain) data sets are collected over five catchments with varying characteristics in Great Britain. Different biases are added to these original time series to generate 6560 biased input scenarios. The results suggest that there is a certain compensational relationship between the biases in P and PET inputs to reproduce desirable streamflow simulations. A new hydrological proxy named Compensational Interaction Angle (CIA) is identified and found to be stationary with various modeling periods, as well as stable with different hydrological models despite model equifinality. Further, the CIA highly relates to the long-term climate aridity ratio. The catchments with greater aridity have larger CIAs. This study offers a fresh perspective to analyze the input errors in hydrological modeling. The results can help to better understand P and PET interactions in hydrological modeling, and guide the selection/evaluation/bias-correction of P and PET data sets for hydrological applications.Plain Language Summary Hydrological modeling helps us understand, predict and manage water resources in the real world. Precipitation (P) and potential evapotranspiration (PET) are two key inputs. Hence their accuracy has a great impact on the modeling outputs. However, the measurements and estimations of P and PET are prone to different sources of errors. We explore the joint interaction of their accuracy on hydrological modeling by considering there are mutual compensational effects between them. It is found that there is a stable compensational relationship between their biases in producing desirable hydrological performance. Moreover, the compensation relationship is highly linked to the climate aridity condition of the region. This study provides a new perspective for hydrologists to explore the sensitivity of input errors in hydrological modeling. We strongly encourage the community to apply the proposed method in other regions to further explore and identify the compensational relationship between P and PET by using different hydrological models. This has the potential to enhance our understanding of the interactions between P and PET in hydrological modeling.

AB  - Newborn lambs are susceptible to pathogenic bacterial infections leading to enteritis, which affects their growth and development and causes losses in sheep production. It has been reported that N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is closely related to innate immunity, but the effect of m6A on sheep small intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and the mechanism involved have not been elucidated. Here, we investigated the effects of m6A on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory responses, apoptosis and oxidative stress in primary sheep IECs. First, the extracted IECs were identified by immunofluorescence using the epithelial cell signature protein cytokeratin 18 (CK18), and the cellular activity of IECs induced by different concentrations of LPS was determined by the CCK8 assay. Meanwhile, LPS could induce the upregulation of mRNA and protein levels of IECs cytokines IL1 beta, IL6 and TNF alpha and the apoptosis marker genes caspase-3, caspase-9, Bax, and apoptosis rate, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and mRNA levels of CAT, Mn-SOD and CuZn-SOD, and METTL3 were found to be upregulated during induction. It was hypothesized that METTL3 may have a potential effect on the induction of IECs by LPS. Overexpression and knockdown of METTL3 in IECs revealed that a low-level expression of METTL3 could reduce the inflammatory response, apoptosis and ROS levels in LPS-induced IECs to some extent. The results suggest that METTL3 may be a genetic marker for potential resistance to cellular damage.

AB  - As a dominant mycotoxin, zearalenone (ZEA) has attracted extensive attention due to its estrogen-like effect and oxidative stress damage in cells. In order to find a way to relieve cell oxidative stress damage caused by ZEA, we treated goat granulosa cells (GCs) with ZEA and did a whole transcriptome sequencing. The results showed that the expression level of Sesterin2 (SESN2) was promoted extremely significantly in the ZEA group (p < .01). In addition, our research demonstrated that SESN2 could regulate oxidative stress level in GCs through Recombinant Kelch Like ECH Associated Protein 1 (KEAP1)/Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) signaling pathway. The overexpression of SESN2 could reduce the oxidative damage, whereas knockdown of SESN2 would aggravate the oxidative damage caused by ZEA. What's more, microRNA (miRNA) chi-miR-130b-3p can bind to SESN2 3'-untranslated region (3 ' UTR) to regulate the expression of SESN2. The mimics/inhibition of chi-miR-130b-3p would have an effect on oxidative damage triggered by ZEA in GCs as well. In summary, these results elucidate a new pathway by which chi-miR-130b-3p affects the KEAP1/NRF2 pathway in GCs by modulating SESN2 expression in response to ZEA-induced oxidative stress damage.

AB  - This study addresses the seasonal distribution of phytoplankton marker pigments (PMP) and the ratios (indicating freshness and fate) from water and surface sediments from the coastal port ecosystem (Paradip port, Odisha, east coast of India) and its utility in understanding phytoplankton pelagic-benthic linkages. Chlorophyll and PMP (for different groups and degradation) distribution revealed distinct seasonality, but the seasonal trend was different for water and sediments. High and low values were observed in the water column during inter-monsoons (fall/spring) and monsoons (southwest/northeast), respectively, whereas, in sediments, the reverse was recorded. However, the contribution of group-specific PMP was different: fucoxanthin > chlorophyll b > zeaxanthin > alloxanthin > peridinin dominated in water and chlorophyll b > zeaxanthin > fucoxanthin > alloxanthin > peridinin in sediment. Selective grazing and stability of sedimentary PMP (fucoxanthin, diatoms PMP, is least stable than other groups) could contribute to such differences. Relatively high chlorophyll:pheopigment ratios in the water and low pheophorbide: pheophytin in sediments indicated the dominance of actively growing microalgae and chlorophyll degradation via chlorophyllidae pathway in the water but not in sediments. These findings suggest that (i) much of the phytoplankton (primarily diatoms) is lost due to herbivory before reaching bottom sediments, and (ii) pigment contribution is determined by selective grazing in water and PMP decay constants in sediments. Documenting such information will give new insights into ecosystem assessment and algal bloom research.

AB  - Interactions with livestock in public settings such as county and state fairs can expose people and other livestock to faecal material capable of spreading zoonotic enteric pathogens. The goal of this study was to understand these risks by screening livestock faeces (n = 245) and livestock bedding (n = 155) for common zoonotic pathogens (Giardia, Cryptosporidium, Salmonella and Campylobacter spp.) and by measuring faecal indicator, Escherichia coli, concentrations in drinking water (n = 153), feed containers (n = 124) and bedding material (n = 157) in four livestock species (cattle, sheep, goats and swine) from county fairs in California, USA. Results indicated that sheep were most likely to have pathogens detected in faeces and that Giardia was the most frequently detected pathogen in both faeces (11%) and bedding (21%) across all livestock species. Additionally, increasing the number of animals in a holding pen at fairs, increasing the stocking density of animals in transport trailers to fairs, and having access to water in transport trailers significantly increased the odds of detecting pathogens in livestock faeces of any animal species. Observing solid material in water, stale feed and soiled bedding was associated with detecting higher E. coli concentrations. These findings provide evidence of faecal pathogens present at county fairs and suggest that site observations can aid in assessing levels of faecal exposure. The findings also indicate that the use of biosecurity measures such as (a) routine changing of livestock drinking water, feed and bedding, (b) not overstocking animals in holding pens and trailers and (c) keeping species in separate holding areas may reduce the risk of humans and livestock being exposed to faecal pathogens.

AB  - Infusing the amnesic agent zeta inhibitory peptide (ZIP) into the dorsal hippocampus disrupts established long-term object location recognition memory without affecting object identity recognition, which likely depends on the perirhinal cortex. Here, we tested whether infusing ZIP into the perirhinal cortex can abolish long-term memory supporting object identity recognition, leaving long-term object location recognition memory intact. We infused ZIP into the perirhinal cortex of rats either 1 day or 6 days after exposing them to two identical objects in an open field arena. One day after ZIP infusion, that is, 2 or 7 days after object exposure, we either assessed whether the animals recognized that now one of the two objects was novel or whether they recognized that one of the two familiar objects was at a new location. Our results show for both retention intervals, infusions of ZIP into the perirhinal cortex impaired novel object recognition but spared novel object location recognition. Rats that received a scrambled version of ZIP had no deficit in either test at both retention intervals and expressed stronger novel object recognition compared to rats infused with ZIP. These findings support the view that object recognition depends on dissociable memory representations distributed across different brain areas, with perirhinal cortex maintaining long-term memory for what objects had been encountered, and hippocampus supporting memory for where these objects had been placed.

AB  - In dairy goat farming, increasing the female kid rate is beneficial to milk production and is, therefore, economically beneficial to farms. Our previous study demonstrated that alkaline incubation enriched the concentration of X-chromosome-bearing sperm; however, the mechanism by which pH affects the motility of X-chromosome-bearing sperm remains unclear. In this study, we explored this mechanism by incubating dairy goat sperm in alkaline dilutions, examining the pattern of changes in sperm internal pH and Ca2+ concentrations and investigating the role of the sAC/cAMP/PKA pathway in influencing sperm motility. The results showed that adding a calcium channel inhibitor during incubation resulted in a concentration-dependent decrease in the proportion of spermatozoa with forward motility, and the sperm sAC protein activity was positively correlated with the calcium ion concentration (r = 0.9972). The total motility activity, proportion of forward motility, and proportion of X-chromosome-bearing sperm decreased (p < 0.05) when cAMP/PKA protease activity was inhibited. Meanwhile, the enrichment of X-chromosome-bearing sperm by pH did not affect the sperm capacitation state. These results indicate that alkaline dilution incubation reduces Ca2+ entry into X-sperm and the motility was slowed down through the sAC/cAMP/PKA signaling pathway, providing a theoretical foundation for further optimization of the sex control method.

AB  - In this study, the differences in protein profiles between the livers of Shannan Tibetan pigs (SNT), Linzhi Tibetan pigs (LZT) and Jiuzhaigou Tibetan pigs (JZT) were comparatively analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry-labeling quantitative proteomics. A total of 6804 proteins were identified: 6471 were quantified and 1095 were screened as differentially expressed proteins (DEPs). Bioinformatics analysis results show that, compared with JZT livers, up-regulated DEPs in SNT and LZT livers mainly promoted hepatic detoxification through steroid hormone biosynthesis and participated in lipid metabolism to maintain body energy homeostasis, immune response and immune regulation, while down-regulated DEPs were mainly involved in lipid metabolism and immune regulation. Three proteases closely related to hepatic fatty acid oxidation were down-regulated in enzymatic activity, indicating higher levels of lipid oxidation in SNT and LZT livers than in JZT livers. Down-regulation of the expression of ten immunoglobulins suggests that JZT are more susceptible to autoimmune diseases. It is highly likely that these differences in lipid metabolism and immune-related proteins are in response to the ecological environment at different altitudes, and the findings contribute to the understanding of the potential molecular link between Tibetan pig livers and the environment.

AB  - Phosphite (Phi) has gained attention in agriculture due to its biostimulant effect on crops. This molecule has been found to benefit plant performance by providing protection against pathogens, improving yield and fruit quality as well as nutrient and water use efficiency. It is still unclear how Phi enhances plant growth and protects against multiple stresses. It has been hypothesized that Phi acts by directly affecting the pathogens and interacting with the plant cellular components and molecular machinery to elicit defense responses. This study elucidates the mechanisms underlying Phi's beneficial effects on plants, revealing their complex interplay with fundamental signaling pathways. An RNA-seq study of Arabidopsis seedlings under optimal and limiting phosphate conditions helped us unveil Phi's role in promoting plant growth by activating the expression of the genes involved in the biosynthesis and signaling pathways associated with abscisic acid (ABA), salicylic acid (SA), and jasmonic acid (JA). The expression of ABA-related genes, known for their involvement in stress response and development regulation, is triggered by Phi treatment, contributing to enhanced resilience and growth. Simultaneously, the activation of the SA pathway, associated with defense responses, suggests Phi's potential in bolstering plant immunity. Moreover, Phi influences JA biosynthesis and signaling, which are crucial for defense against herbivores and pathogens, thereby strengthening plants' defenses. Our findings reveal a multifaceted mechanism through which Phi benefits Arabidopsis development. Understanding its intricate interplay with key signaling pathways opens avenues for leveraging Phi as a strategic tool to enhance plant resilience, immunity, and growth in agricultural and ecological contexts.

AB  - The aim of this research was phenolics and protein characterization and antioxidant properties evaluation of skimmed thermally treated goat's milk powder enriched with different concentration of grape pomace seed extract (SE). The dominant phenolics in SE were phenolic acids, flavan-3-ols and procyanidins. Different electrophoretic techniques together with UHPLC-MS/MS analysis revealed the presence of phenolics-protein interactions in the samples, mainly procyanidins with whey protein/caseins complexes. Addition of SE into thermally treated goat's milk significantly improved antioxidant properties of goat's milk such as TAC, FRP, DPPH center dot and ABTS(center dot+) scavenging activity. Gallic acid, catechin, and procyanidins mostly contributed to these activities. The schematic representation of phenolics-casein micelles interactions in thermally treated goat's milk enriched with SE was given. The addition of SE into thermally treated goat's milk can be a promising strategy in food waste recovery and to enhance the beneficial health effects of goat's milk-based functional foods.

AB  - BackgroundPhotoperiod is the major regulator of circannual patterns in mammals, but at animal facilities, despite the controlled conditions, some rodents still exhibit seasonality in their breeding. By evaluating more than 97,000 breeding records of closed Peromyscus colonies, we explored if seasonal breeding patterns exist in animals maintained for several decades at controlled environments.ResultsSeasonal preferences for offspring production were recorded that depended on maternal birth month. Birth in March and September, especially of mothers, showed best fit in 12-knots generalized additive models, implying that the memory of birth month is more intensively carried during the Spring and Autumn equinoxes. The memory of birth month was associated with circannual CpG methylation at birth and revealed that most intense differential methylation, primarily demethylation, occurs in animals that were born in September. Comparison of breeding performance in the periods between the equinoxes showed preference for summer littering by the winter-born animals, especially in the polygamous P. maniculatus bairdii and P. leucopus stocks, and at least in the former species, this was associated with longer estrus cycles. Genes associated with differentially methylated CpGs in winter and summer periods in polygamous species pointed to regulation of gonadotropin hormone releasing hormone secretion. Birth at individually ventilated cages disrupted methylation profiles.ConclusionsThe cyclicity of breeding and methylation patterns suggest that signals other than the photoperiod regulate circannual patterns in deer mice, that reset in the equinox especially in autumn, and that the females are more sensitive to these signals than males.

AB  - This work aimed to evaluate whether supplementing the freezing extender with olive fruit extract (OFE) would improve the antioxidant defense of buffalo sperm, resulting in improved post-thaw semen quality. Ejaculates (two per 16 Murrah buffalo bulls) were split into four aliquots that were diluted in an extender supplemented with different doses of OFE (0, D50, D100, and D150, based on mu M concentrations of hydroxytyrosol, the most represented polyphenol) and frozen according to standard procedures. At thawing, sperm motility, kinetics, viability, acrosome integrity, and membrane functionality were evaluated. Based on the dose-response results, biological antioxidant potential (BAP) and reactive oxygen metabolites (ROMs) were assessed after thawing in D50 and control groups. The pre-freezing supplementation of the extender with D50 OFE showed higher (P < 0.05) total and progressive sperm motility, as well as straight-line velocity compared to the control. Treatment with D50 OFE of buffalo semen also improved (P < 0.01) post-thaw sperm viability, membrane functionality, and acrosome integrity compared to the control. The enrichment of the extender with D50 OFE increased (P < 0.01) the post-thaw BAP and reduced (P < 0.05) the ROMs levels. The highest concentration tested (D150 OFE) negatively affected (P < 0.05) total and progressive motility, and the percentage of sperm with functional membranes and intact acrosomes, compared to the control. In conclusion, low doses of OFE added to the extender significantly improved post-thawing buffalo semen quality by protecting the spermatozoa from cryopreservation-induced oxidative stress. Further studies should investigate its effectiveness on in vivo and in vitro fertility, for potential commercial applications.

AB  - Multigene families often play an important role in host-parasite interactions. One of the largest multigene families in Theileria parva, the causative agent of East Coast fever, is the T. parva repeat (Tpr) gene family. The function of the putative Tpr proteins remains unknown. The initial publication of the T. parva reference genome identified 39 Tpr family open reading frames (ORFs) sharing a conserved C-terminal domain. Twenty-eight of these are clustered in a central region of chromosome 3, termed the "Tpr locus", while others are dispersed throughout all four nuclear chromosomes. The Tpr locus contains three of the four assembly gaps remaining in the genome, suggesting the presence of additional, as yet uncharacterized, Tpr gene copies. Here, we describe the use of long-read sequencing to attempt to close the gaps in the reference assembly of T. parva (located among multigene families clusters), characterize the full complement of Tpr family ORFs in the T. parva reference genome, and evaluate their evolutionary relationship with Tpr homologs in other Theileria species. We identify three new Tpr family genes in the T. parva reference genome and show that sequence similarity among paralogs in the Tpr locus is significantly higher than between genes outside the Tpr locus. We also identify sequences homologous to the conserved C-terminal domain in five additional Theileria species. Using these sequences, we show that the evolution of this gene family involves conservation of a few orthologs across species, combined with gene gains/losses, and species-specific expansions.

AB  - Flavonoids (especially anthocyanins and catechins) and amino acids represent a high abundance of health-promoting metabolites. Although we observed abscisic acid accumulation in purple leaves and low levels in albino tea leaves, the specific mechanism behind its impact on flavor compounds remains unclear. In this study, we treated tea leaves with exogenous abscisic acid and abscisic acid biosynthesis inhibitors (Flu), measured physiological indicators and conducted comprehensive transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses to elucidate the potential mechanisms underlying color change. Our results demonstrate that abscisic acid treatment induces purple coloration, while Flu treatment causes discoloration in tea leaves. Metabolomic analysis revealed higher levels of four anthocyanins and six catechins in the group treated with abscisic acid in comparison with the control group. Additionally, there was a notable increase in 15 amino acids in the Flu-treated group. Notably, the levels of flavonoids and amino acids showed an inverse relationship between the two treatments. Transcriptomic comparison between the treatments and the control group revealed upregulation of differentially expressed genes encoding dihydroflavonol reductase and uridine diphosphate-glycose flavonoid glycosyltransferase in the abscisic acid-treated group, leading to the accumulation of identified anthocyanins and catechins. In contrast, differentially expressed genes encoding nitrate reductase and nitrate transporter exhibited elevated expression in the group treated with Flu, consequently facilitating the accumulation of amino acids, specifically L-theanine and L-glutamine. Furthermore, our co-expression network analysis suggests that MYB and bHLH transcription factors may play crucial roles in regulating the expression of differentially expressed genes involved in the biosynthesis of flavonoids and amino acids. This study provides insights for targeted genetic engineering to enhance the nutritional and market value of tea, together with the potential application of purple and albino tea leaves as functional beverages. It also offers guidance for future breeding programs and production.

AB  - Simple Summary Our previous study demonstrated that previous aphid infestation significantly upregulates the transcription of marker genes associated with salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis. However, accumulating experimental evidence has revealed that SA and JA signaling cascades in plant immune responses always act antagonistically across a diverse range of herbivore-plant systems. In this study, we determined the potential role of JA in suppressing plant defense responses in seedlings of the wheat cultivar XN979 through preference and performance experiments using grain aphids and evaluated the underlying mechanisms through the transcriptional profiles of marker genes related to JA- and SA-dependent responses and the formation of tryptamine. The obtained results reveal that the accumulation of JA during aphid infestation probably facilitates the forming of tryptamine, which is then probably converted into IAA or serotonin to alter the plant's physiological properties and facilitate the feeding behaviors of aphids, compensating for the adverse effects of SA- or JA-dependent responses in host plants to colonizer attacks. As a result of this experiment, we have a better understanding of the antagonistic interactions between hormone signaling processes. Crop plants have coevolved phytohormone-mediated defenses to combat and/or repel their colonizers. The present study determined the effects of jasmonic acid (JA) accumulation during aphid infestation on the preference and performance of Sitobion miscanthi Takahashi (Hemiptera: Aphididae), and its potential role in fine-tuning hormone-dependent responses in XN979 wheat cultivar seedlings was evaluated via the transcriptional profiles of marker genes related to JA- and salicylic acid (SA)-dependent responses. The preference experiment and the life table data reveal that direct foliage spraying of 2.5 mM methyl jasmonate (MeJA) exhibited weak negative or positive effects on the preferential selection and the population dynamics and oviposition parameters of S. miscanthi. The transcription level of phytohormone biosynthesis genes shows that foliage spraying of MeJA significantly upregulated the marker genes in the JA biosynthesis pathway while downregulating the SA pathway. In addition, either MeJA treatment or previous aphid infestation significantly induced upregulated transcription of the genes involved in the JA- and SA-dependent defense responses, and the transcription level of the tryptophan decarboxylase (TaTDC) gene, which facilitates the conversion of L-tryptophan to tryptamine, was rapidly upregulated after the treatments as well. The main products of tryptamine conversion could play a crucial role in suppressing SA-dependent defense responses. These results will provide more experimental evidence to enable understanding of the antagonistic interaction between hormone signaling processes in cereals under aphid infestation.

AB  - This study examined the effect of glycerin supply strategies in different short-term protocols on follicular dynamics and ovulatory rate in Morada Nova sheep. Eighteen Morada Nova ewes with body condition 0.001) number of growing follicles ( 3 mm) and a larger size of the largest follicle (P < 0.001) were also recorded. Ovulation rate was 30% higher in the groups that received glycerin for seven days (1.6 ?? 0.1 53 vs. 1.1 ?? 0.1; P < 0.05), and they also exhibited a 38% reduction in glutathione peroxidase. Thus, the use of glycerin in Morada Nova sheep as a source of energy in short-term supplementation for increase ovulation rate is an efficient strategy when provided for seven days, either orally or in the feed.

AB  - Hunting and its impacts on wildlife are typically studied regionally, with a particular focus on the Global South. Hunting can, however, also undermine rewilding efforts or threaten wildlife in the Global North. Little is known about how hunting manifests under varying socioeconomic and ecological contexts across the Global South and North. Herein, we examined differences and commonalities in hunting characteristics across an exemplary Global South-North gradient approximated by the Human Development Index (HDI) using face-to-face interviews with 114 protected area (PA) managers in 25 African and European countries. Generally, we observed that hunting ranges from the illegal, economically motivated, and unsustainable hunting of herbivores in the South to the legal, socially and ecologically motivated hunting of ungulates within parks and the illegal hunting of mainly predators outside parks in the North. Commonalities across this Africa-Europe South-North gradient included increased conflict-related killings in human-dominated landscapes and decreased illegal hunting with beneficial community conditions, such as mutual trust resulting from community involvement in PA management. Nevertheless, local conditions cannot outweigh the strong effect of the HDI on unsustainable hunting. Our findings highlight regional challenges that require collaborative, integrative efforts in wildlife conservation across actors, while identified commonalities may outline universal mechanisms for achieving this goal.

AB  - Simple Summary Mecheri sheep are a hair-type sheep breed from India, reared for meat, which play a vital part in the economic well-being of farmers. This study was conducted to evaluate Mecheri sheep by assessing sources of variation and estimating the genetic parameters for growth traits and examining genetic diversity through pedigree analysis. The estimated direct heritability for growth traits was lower in post-weaning age groups when compared to the pre-weaning stages. The intermediate heritability and moderate-to-high genetic correlations observed for the weaning weight indicated that the weaning weight could be employed as a selection criterion for enhancing later-age traits of body-weight trait. Mecheri sheep demonstrate a much lower level of inbreeding due to the widespread use of techniques such as routine genetic diversity monitoring and ongoing efforts to scientifically design and carrying out mating plans for the flock. Determining the genetic and non-genetic sources of variation in a breed is vital for the formulation of strategies for its conservation and improvement. The present study was aimed at estimating the (co)variance components and genetic parameters of Mecheri sheep by fitting six different animal models in the restricted maximum likelihood method, with a preliminary investigation on the performance of animals for non-genetic sources of variation. A total of 2616 lambs were studied, and varying levels of significance were found for the effects of period, season, parity of dam, and birth type on different body-weight traits. Direct heritability estimates derived from the best animal model for body weight at birth, three months, six months, nine months, and twelve months were 0.21, 0.24, 0.10, 0.15, and 0.09, respectively, and the maternal heritability of the corresponding traits was 0.12, 0.05, 0.04, 0.04, and 0.04, respectively. The genetic correlations between the body-weight traits were all positive and moderate-to-strong, except for the correlation between birth weight and the other body-weight traits. The significance of non-genetic factors studied in this work demanded a correction to improve the accuracy of the direct selection of lambs for body-weight traits. The estimated genetic parameters identified the weaning weight as a selection criterion for the improvement in body weight of Mecheri lambs at different ages. Inbred individuals accounted for approximately 13% of the total population in the Mecheri sheep population studied. There were 877 founders in the population, and the actual effective population size was 128.48. The population's mean generation interval was 3.26. The mean inbreeding values ranged from 0.005 to 0.010 across generations. The population's average relatedness ranged from 0.001 to 0.014 across generations. Individual inbreeding was found to be 0.45 per cent for the entire population and 3.4 per cent for the inbred population.

AB  - The demand for organic tomatoes is gaining momentum globally, especially for their nutritional quality, shelf life, and yield sustainability. Similarly, the restoration of metal-contaminated soils and maintenance of soil health is getting momentum through the application of organic inputs and microbial inoculations in soils. The present study evaluates different concentrated organic inputs and biofertilizers with a minimal dosage (14.3% of the recommended dose of fertilizers or RDF) under a field experiment conducted at the Agricultural Farm of Amity Institute of Organic Agriculture, Amity University, Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India. Organic treatments included mustard cake, goat manure, poultry manure, farmyard manure (FYM), neem cake, and biofertilizers (Azotobacter and phosphate solubilizing bacteria, or PSB). FYM (15 t ha-1) and vermicompost (VC 3.0 t ha-1) (T5), and the optimized inputs (containing the dual inoculation of Azotobacter and PSB, a mixture of organic inputs, and 14.3% RDF (T11) significantly improved plant height, number of branches/leaves/fruits, carotenoids, lycopene, fruit weight, yield, ascorbate peroxidase, total antioxidants, superoxide dismutase, total soluble solids (TSS), Vitamin C, and shelf-life in tomatoes. Organic inputs and inoculation of Azotobacter and PSB significantly reduced the concentration of Cd, Cr, and Pb from soils. The authors conclude that (a) the combined application of FYM and VC, and (b) the optimized mixture of bulky and concentrated organic inputs, 14.3% RDF, and the dual inoculation can improve the nutritional quality, minimize heavy metals (Cd, Cr, and Pb), and overall, sustain tomato production in the hot semi-arid alluvial sandy loam soils. The optimized organic inputs with dual microbial inoculations harness the climatic conditions in tropical regions to facilitate better color and ripening, and other quality parameters leading to higher lycopene contents in tomatoes.& COPY; 2023 SAAB.

AB  - Platelet-derived growth factor D (PDGFD) is a member of the PDGF gene family, and it plays an important role in the regulation of adipocyte development in mammals. Furthermore, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have previously identified it as a candidate gene associated with fleece fiber variation, body size, and the fat-tail phenotype in domestic Chinese sheep. In this study, a total of 1919 indigenous Chinese sheep were genotyped to examine the association between nucleotide sequence variations in PDGFD and body morphology. Our results detected both a 14 bp insertion in intron 2 and a 13 bp deletion in intron 4 of PDGFD. Moreover, these two InDel loci had low to moderate polymorphism. Notably, the 13 bp deletion mutation of PDGFD was found to significantly affect sheep body size. Yearling rams in the Luxi black-headed sheep (LXBH) containing a heterozygous genotype (insertion/deletion, ID) were found to have larger body length, chest depth, and body weight than those with wild genotypes. Furthermore, adult ewes in the Guiqian semi-fine wool sheep (GSFW) containing a homozygous mutation (deletion/deletion, DD) were found to have smaller chest width than their peers. Moreover, yearling ewes in this group with the same homozygous mutation were found to have lower body weight, chest width, and cannon circumference compared to those of other individuals. This study demonstrates that PDGFD InDel polymorphisms have the potential to be effective molecular markers to improve morphological traits in domestic Chinese sheep.

AB  - Sexual dimorphism is common in dioecious plants, but the effects of sex-specific interactions on the growth and herbivore resistance of females and males are still unknown. To assess sex-specific interactions, Populus cathayana females (F) and males (M) were grown in a common garden experiment with the same (F/F, M/M) or opposite sex neighbors (F/M) under different herbivory treatments (no herbivores vs. with herbivores). We found that females responded to males by increasing shoot mass under both the presence and absence of herbivores. In contrast, males responded to females by increasing shoot biomass only under the presence of herbivores. Herbivory increased phenolic production in the leaves of both sexes, but more strongly in females. In addition, jasmonic acid (JA) production was enhanced in females under the presence of herbivores, but not in males. Field experiments showed that females in a pure female plantation (PF) had greater total phenolic contents of leaves compared to males in a pure male plantation (PM), ultimately resulting in lower damage by herbivore feeding. Leaf damage of males was reduced in a mixed-sex plantation (MS) compared to PM, but there were no differences in females between PM and MS. Metabolomics analyses highlighted significant differences in leaf metabolic profiles between males and females in agreement with observed differences in herbivore resistance. Female and male metabolomes also differed between pure sex plantations (PF or PM) and MS, while no significant differences were detected in MS between females and males. Thus, the reduction of herbivore feeding in males in MS was not only related to the associational effects of females, but also depended on biochemical adjustments. The present study demonstrated major differences in sex-specific interactions in responses to herbivores. This new knowledge provides novel opportunities for the increase of insect resistance of plantations composed of dioecious plants. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Natural killer (NK) cells play a vital role in xenotransplantation rejection. One approach to induce NK cell immune tolerance is to prevent the NK cell-mediated direct killing of porcine cells by targeting the interaction of the activating receptor NKG2D and its ligands. However, the identity of porcine ligands for the human NKG2D receptor has remained elusive. Previous studies on porcine UL-16 binding protein 1 (pULBP-1) as a ligand for human NKG2D have yielded contradictory results. The goal of the present study was to clarify the role of pULBP-1 in the immune response and its interaction with human NKG2D receptor. To accomplish this, the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing tool was employed to disrupt the porcine ULBP-1 gene in a 5-gene knockout porcine endothelial cell line (GGTA1, CMAH, beta 4galNT2, SLA-I alpha chain, and beta-2 microglobulin, 5GKO). A colony with two allele mutations in pULBP-1 was established as a 6-gene knockout pig cell line (6GKO). We found that pULBP-1-deficient pig cells exhibited a reduced binding capacity to human NKG2D-Fc, a recombinant chimera protein. However, the removal of ULBP-1 from porcine endothelial cells did not significantly impact human NK cell degranulation or cytotoxicity upon stimulation with the pig cells. These findings conclusively demonstrate that pULBP-1 is not a crucial ligand for initiating xenogeneic human NK cell activation.

AB  - Simple Summary:& nbsp;Herbivorous fish are recognized as being ecologically important to the health and survival of coral reef ecosystems because they remove algal turfs growing on corals. Apart from being one of the major components of herbivorous fish communities, rabbitfish are also characterized by possessing rabbit-like mouths. A total of 29 species of rabbitfish are confined to a single genus, Siganus, fish that are highly sought after for the aquarium trade and for food by humans. Natural hybridization between some species that have parapatric distributions across the Indo-West Pacific region may have homogenized their genotypic and morphological features. Relatively little is known, however, about how environmental factors may affect phylogenetic relationships among these siganid species. Based on sequencing of eight siganid species collected from the South China Sea and meta-analysis of sequences from ten siganid species retrieved from the NCBI database, we applied an integrated morphological-molecular approach to elucidate phylogenetic relationships and demographic histories of these species. Our results highlight that diversification and speciation of siganid species were influenced by a series of paleo-climatic events, changes to natural geographical distributions, and associated environmental changes. The target species were differentiated by body shape, and two morphometric parameters, notably body depth and snout length. Our results provide considerable baseline knowledge for strategizing improvement of both breeding and conservation programs for rabbitfish.<br>Rabbitfish (Siganidae) are coral reef fish that are distributed across diverse habitats that include estuaries, mangroves, reefs, and even seaweed mats. Given their ecological diversity and natural widespread distributions across the Indo-Pacific region, we were interested to investigate the evolutionary history of this group and patterns of divergence that have contributed to their present-day distributions. In the present study, samples were collected from the South China Sea to study taxonomic and phylogenetic relationships, and divergence times. We investigated the taxonomic relationships among modern rabbitfish species, reconstructed their molecular phylogeny, and estimated divergence times among selected lineages based on a fragment of the mtDNA cytochrome oxidase I (COI) and sequences of the nuclear rhodopsin retrogene (RHO). Our results indicate that modern rabbitfish likely originated in the Indo-West Pacific during the late Eocene [37.4 million years ago (mya)], following which they diverged into three major clades during the Pliocene/Pleistocene. Subsequent diversification and origins of the majority of siganids may likely be associated with episodes of paleo-oceanographic events, including greenhouse and glaciation events (Eocene-Miocene) as well as major plate tectonic events (Pliocene-Pleistocene). Some modern siganid species may naturally hybridize with congeneric species where their geographical ranges overlap. A comprehensive taxonomic analysis revealed that the phylogeny of Siganidae (cladogenesis of Clades I, II, and III) is characterized by divergence in several external morphological characters and morphometric parameters. Our study demonstrates that morphological characteristics, geographical heterogeneity, and environmental change have contributed to siganids' historical diversification.

AB  - Single Layer Centrifugation (SLC) through a low density colloid offers an alternative solution to antibiotic use in boar semen extenders, with lower costs compared to high density colloids. The aim of this study was to explore the reproductive performance of sows when using SLC-prepared semen doses without antibiotics, employing low density Porcicoll to prepare semen doses for artificial insemination in a commercial swine herd in Thailand. Ejaculates were divided into two equal parts to create insemination doses, with each dose containing 3000 x 10 6 sperm/80 ml for intra-uterine insemination in individual sows. The sows were inseminated twice, with the interval between the two inseminations ranging from 8 to 16 h. The CONTROL group consisted of 206 semen doses treated with antibiotics, prepared for insemination in 103 sows, while the SLC group comprised 194 SLCprepared semen doses without antibiotics for inseminating 97 sows. Fertility and fecundity traits, including non -return rate, conception rate, farrowing rate, and litter traits (i.e., the total number of piglets born per litter, number of piglets born alive per litter, number of stillborn piglets, and number of mummified fetuses), were compared between groups. Furthermore, data on piglet characteristics, including live-born and stillborn piglets (i.e., the prevalence of stillbirth (yes, no), birth weight, crown-rump length, body mass index (BMI), and ponderal index (PI)), were determined. No significant differences in non -return rate (75.7 % vs. 77.3 %), conception rate (73.8 % vs. 73.2 %), and farrowing rate (71.8 % vs. 73.2 %) were observed between the CONTROL and SLC groups, respectively ( P > 0.05). Nevertheless, the total number of piglets born per litter in the SLC group was higher than in the CONTROL group (14.6 +/- 0.9 vs. 12.3 +/- 0.6, respectively, P = 0.049). Interestingly, the prevalence of stillbirth in the SLC group was lower than in the CONTROL group (6.2 % vs. 11.6 %, respectively, P < 0.001). Moreover, the newborn piglets in the SLC group exhibited higher birth weight and BMI compared to those in the CONTROL group (1.36 +/- 0.03 vs. 1.26 +/- 0.02 kg, P = 0.005, and 18.3 +/- 0.3 vs. 17.3 +/- 0.2 kg/m( 2) , P = 0.003). In conclusion, employing sperm doses after SLC through a low density colloid in artificial insemination within a commercial breeding operation did not have a detrimental impact on either fertility or fecundity traits but showed potential benefits in increasing the total number of piglets born per litter. Moreover, improvements were observed in the birth weight and body indexes of piglets, and the percentage of stillbirths was reduced. Our findings introduce new possibilities for antibiotic alternatives in semen extenders to reduce the risk of antimicrobial resistance in the swine industry. Additionally, they provide compelling reproductive outcomes supporting the integration of SLC-prepared semen doses into artificial insemination practices.

AB  - PurposeEchinococcus granulosus sensu stricto (s. s.) consists of the most widespread genotypes (G1, G3) implicated in human cystic echinococcosis worldwide. The present study aimed to evaluate the role of pigs in the transmission dynamics of E. granulosus s. s. genotypes, including the phylogenetics, evolutionary divergence and haplotype network analyses of north Indian pig isolates along with GenBank(& TRADE;) archived sequences.MethodsIn totality, 223 slaughtered pigs were thoroughly screened for the presence of hydatid cysts. The amplification of the partial mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase subunit 1 gene was performed for the molecular confirmation and phylogenetics of the retrieved metacestodes.ResultsThe molecularly confirmed and sequenced present study isolates (n = 2) clustered with the E. granulosus genotype G3. The very low evolutionary divergence values (< 0.0027) of the present study isolates with E. ganulosus genotype G3 indicated the absence of diverged lineages. The significantly negative values of Tajima's D (- 2.598) and Fu and Li's D (- 4.054) of the overall dataset and for the Asian sequences signified an expansion of population size. The overall dataset exhibited low nucleotide (0.067 & PLUSMN; 0.055) and high haplotype (0.574 & PLUSMN; 0.015) diversities, also alluding to demographic expansion. The haplotype network showed that the pig isolates from South America and Europe constituted the predominant haplotype, Hap_2 along with Hap_3 and Hap_6, primarily associated to E. granulosus genotype G1; whereas, the Indian isolates formed different haplotypes (Hap_1 and Hap_5) belonging to genotype G3.ConclusionsThe present study highlighted the important role of pigs in the transmission of E. granulosus s. s., which is of paramount significance given the public health and economic impact of cystic echinococcosis.

AB  - Simple Summary The nutritional recommendations for pigs largely focus on pigs with lean genotypes fed ad libitum until reaching up to 140 kg in body weight (BW). Under different rearing conditions, it is still unclear whether existing recommendations apply to pigs that weigh more than 140 kg in BW, especially in heavy pig production systems. In the current study, pigs growing from 90 to 200 kg in BW were raised with different feeding strategies. We observed that energy restriction had a negligible effect on pigs' estimated metabolizable energy requirements at heavier BW under different feeding conditions. Under energy and protein restrictions, a value of 0.73 could be assumed as the maximum marginal efficiency of standardized ileal digestible lysine (SID lysine) utilization for protein deposition irrespective of BW, which corresponds to 9.8 g of SID lysine per 100 g of protein deposition as a minimum requirement. The current nutrient recommendations focus on pigs fed ad libitum up to 140 kg in body weight (BW). It remains unclear whether this applies to pigs weighing above 140 kg in BW under different rearing conditions. This study aimed to estimate protein (Pd) and lipid (Ld) depositions and the metabolizable energy (ME), standardized ileal digestible lysine (SID lysine) requirement and partitioning in 224 C21 Goland pigs (90-200 kg in BW). The control pigs (C) received diets limiting ME up to 170 kg in slaughter weight (SW) at 9 months of age (SA); older (OA) pigs had restricted diets limiting ME and SID lysine up to 170 kg in SW at >9 months SA; younger (YA) pigs were fed nonlimited amounts of ME and SID lysine up to 170 kg in SW at <9 months SA; and greater weight (GW) pigs were fed as the YA group, with 9 months SA at >170 kg in SW. The estimated MEm averaged 1.03 MJ/kg(0.60). An 11% increase in MEm was observed in OA pigs compared to the controls. Energy restriction had negligible effects on the estimated MEm. The marginal efficiency of SID lysine utilization for Pd averaged 0.725, corresponding to a SID lysine requirement of 9.8 g/100 g Pd.

AB  - Current experiment was planned to investigate the deleterious effects of the graded doses of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) on white leghorn male birds. For this purpose, one-hundred birds of 8 weeks of age were divided into 4 equal groups and reared on feed contaminated with different doses of AFB1 for 10 weeks. Group A was kept as a control group and was fed with normal toxin-free diet; groups B, C, and D were offered feed containing 100 ppb, 200 ppb, and 400 ppb of AFB1, respectively. The birds were euthanized at the 4th and 10th week of the experiment. Clinical signs, behavioral changes, absolute and relative organ weight of the testes, and sperm motility were measured. Cellular immune response was observed through carbon clearance assay (CCA), P-HAP, and antibody response against sheep red blood cells (SRBC). Results showed a dose-dependent decline in the immune response of birds with the increase in the level of AFB1 in the feed. A significant decrease in the serum levels of testosterone, prolactin, and LH were observed at the end of the study. Grossly, testicular size and volume were reduced in ABF1 fed birds, while histological examination showed moderate to severe necrosis of testicular parenchyma, with partial to complete arrest of spermatogenesis. Very few spermatozoa were found in group C, while they were almost absent in group D which was offered a diet containing 400 ppb AFB1. The motility of sperms was reduced in all treated groups except control. The abovementioned results showed that AFB1 had severe toxic effects on the reproductive and immunological parameters of WLH male birds in a dose-dependent manner.

AB  - Under the African swine fever epidemic, the extensive use of lime disinfectants has seriously inhibited anaerobic digestion (AD). In this study, the subject was swine manure containing lime disinfectant wastewater. The research set up a carbon dioxide (CO2) bubbling pretreatment device before it entered AD to explore the effect of breaking the inhibition of lime disinfectant. The results showed that the initial pulmonary hypertension (pH) of 11.0 and CO2 bubbling time of 8 h had the best effect, which could reduce calcium ion (Ca2+) by 73.0%, and the biogas production of the batch AD test increased by 28 times. In the continuous AD test, the Ca2+ of CK increased to 7.67 g/L, while the S1 pretreated by CO2 bubbling stabilized at 2.6 g/L, the biogas production in S1 was 112.4% higher than in CK. CO2 bubbling pretreatment reduces the concentration of Ca2+ in swine by utilizing the combination of exogenous CO2 and Ca2+, breaking the inhibitory effect on AD, and thereby improving the performance of the AD system. The test used CO2 in biogas to break the inhibition of lime disinfectants on AD, which was a convenient and feasible pretreatment process.

AB  - In planning and monitoring measures to protect wildlife in an area, it is important to have a reliable baseline estimate of population size and trends. There has been minimal published information on a small population of elephants, a keystone and endangered species, in a large area west of Etosha National Park in Namibia, known locally as the Northern Highlands. It is a highly remote, mountainous area in which it is difficult to count elephants. It is semi-desert, where the protection of wildlife is at increasing risk from climate change events, and research on the elephant population is a priority. We interviewed 34 community game guards in the Northern Highlands, focusing on the number of elephants and distinguishing features in known groups. Based on the collated knowledge, and analysis to reduce double counting of known groups, we estimate that there are between 78 and 212 elephants in the Northern Highlands, with a best estimate of 128. The wide range is an indication of the current uncertainties in the method. However, we conclude that this low-cost method, if adapted based on lessons from this pilot study, would be applicable for longer-term ecological monitoring in areas that have a low population density.

AB  - Simple Summary Some species of insect herbivores can feed on a wide variety of plant species. Over evolutionary time, insect herbivores can associate preferentially with different host-plant species, which frequently leads to genetic divergence between populations of an herbivore species. This phenomenon, referred to as host-associated differentiation (HAD), not only affects insect herbivores, but can also impact their associated natural enemies, particularly predatory or parasitic insects, which are responsible for biological control in agroecosystems. Although the mechanisms underlying HAD in populations of herbivores and associated natural enemies remain underexplored, we argue that the chemical communication between plants, herbivores, and natural enemies likely plays a major role. Chemical cues emitted by plants and insect herbivores influence natural enemy foraging behavior, and divergent chemical cues can lead to natural enemy HAD, ultimately shaping biological control. In this synthesis paper, we explore how the chemical ecology of HAD could influence classical, conservation, and augmentative biological control, and propose research agendas to further biological control efficacy through natural enemy selection. Host-associated differentiation (HAD) refers to cases in which genetically distinct populations of a species (e.g., herbivores or natural enemies) preferentially reproduce or feed on different host species. In agroecosystems, HAD often results in unique strains or biotypes of pest species, each attacking different species of crops. However, HAD is not restricted to pest populations, and may cascade to the third trophic level, affecting host selection by natural enemies, and ultimately leading to HAD within natural enemy species. Natural enemy HAD may affect the outcomes of biological control efforts, whether classical, conservation, or augmentative. Here, we explore the potential effects of pest and natural enemy HAD on biological control in agroecosystems, with emphases on current knowledge gaps and implications of HAD for selection of biological control agents. Additionally, given the importance of semiochemicals in mediating interactions between trophic levels, we emphasize the role of chemical ecology in interactions between pests and natural enemies, and suggest areas of consideration for biological control. Overall, we aim to jump-start a conversation concerning the relevance of HAD in biological control by reviewing currently available information on natural enemy HAD, identifying challenges to incorporating HAD considerations into biological control efforts, and proposing future research directions on natural enemy selection and HAD.

AB  - Supernumerary teats (SNTs) or nipples often emerge around the mammary line. This study performed a genome-wide selective sweep analysis (GWS) at the copy number variant (CNV) level using two selected signal calculation methods (VST and FST) to identify candidate genes associated with SNTs in goats. A total of 12,310 CNVs were identified from 37 animals and 123 CNVs, with the top 1% VST values including 84 candidate genes (CDGs). Of these CDGs, minichromosome maintenance complex component 3, ectodysplasin A receptor associated via death domain, and cullin 5 demonstrated functions closely related to mammary gland development. In addition, 123 CNVs with the top 1% FST values were annotated to 97 CDGs. 5-Hydroxytryptamine receptor 2A, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha, and the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor affect colostrum secretion through multiple signaling pathways. Two genes, namely, RNA-binding motif protein 46 and beta-1,3-galactosyltransferase 5, showed a close relation to mammary gland development. Six CNVs were identified and annotated to five genes by intersecting the top 1% of candidate CNVs with both parameters. These genes include LOC102185621, LOC102190481, and UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase 2, which potentially affect the occurrence of BC through multiple biological processes, such as cell detoxification, glycogen synthesis, and phospholipid metabolism. In conclusion, we discovered numerous genes related to mammary development and breast cancer (BC) through a GWS, which suggests the mechanism of SNTs in goats and a certain association between mammary cancer and SNTs.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Bisphenol A (BPA) is a substance commonly used in the plastics industry, which is a part of many everyday items. It may leach from plastics and penetrate food, water, soil and air. It is known that BPA negatively affects living organisms. It impairs the functions of the intestine, neurons, reproductive organs, endocrine glands and immune cells. Previous studies have also reported that BPA negatively influences the cardiovascular system, leading to heart arrhythmia, intensification of atherosclerosis, blood hypertension and increased risk of a heart attack. However, many aspects of the influence of BPA on the heart are still poorly understood. One of these aspects is the BPA impact on heart innervation. Therefore, this article aimed to investigate the influence of low doses of BPA on the number of nerves containing selected active substances taking part in neuronal stimuli conduction located in the porcine heart apex. The results indicate that even relatively low doses of BPA are not neutral to the cardiovascular system, because they affect the neurochemical characterization of nerves in the heart. These changes may underlie the negative effects of BPA on the heart.
   Bisphenol A (BPA) contained in plastics used in the production of various everyday objects may leach from these items and contaminate food, water and air. As an endocrine disruptor, BPA negatively affects many internal organs and systems. Exposure to BPA also contributes to heart and cardiovascular system dysfunction, but many aspects connected with this activity remain unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the impact of BPA in a dose of 0.05 mg/kg body weight/day (in many countries such a dose is regarded as a tolerable daily intake-TDI dose of BPA-completely safe for living organisms) on the neurochemical characterization of nerves located in the heart wall using the immunofluorescence technique. The obtained results indicate that BPA (even in such a relatively low dose) increases the number of nerves immunoreactive to neuropeptide Y, substance P and tyrosine hydroxylase (used here as a marker of sympathetic innervation). However, BPA did not change the number of nerves immunoreactive to vesicular acetylcholine transporter (used here as a marker of cholinergic structures). These observations suggest that changes in the heart innervation may be at the root of BPA-induced circulatory disturbances, as well as arrhythmogenic and/or proinflammatory effects of this endocrine disruptor. Moreover, changes in the neurochemical characterization of nerves in the heart wall may be the first sign of exposure to BPA.

AB  - The composition of mammalian gut microbiomes is highly conserved within species, yet the mechanisms by which microbiome composition is transmitted and maintained within lineages of wild animals remain unclear. Mutually compatible hypotheses exist, including that microbiome fidelity results from inherited dietary habits, shared environmental exposure, morphophysiological filtering and/or maternal effects. Interspecific hybrids are a promising system in which to interrogate the determinants of microbiome composition because hybrids can decouple traits and processes that are otherwise co-inherited in their parent species. We used a population of free-living hybrid zebras (Equus quagga x grevyi) in Kenya to evaluate the roles of these four mechanisms in regulating microbiome composition. We analysed faecal DNA for both the trnL-P6 and the 16S rRNA V4 region to characterize the diets and microbiomes of the hybrid zebra and of their parent species, plains zebra (E. quagga) and Grevy's zebra (E. grevyi). We found that both diet and microbiome composition clustered by species, and that hybrid diets and microbiomes were largely nested within those of the maternal species, plains zebra. Hybrid microbiomes were less variable than those of either parent species where they co-occurred. Diet and microbiome composition were strongly correlated, although the strength of this correlation varied between species. These patterns are most consistent with the maternal-effects hypothesis, somewhat consistent with the diet hypothesis, and largely inconsistent with the environmental-sourcing and morphophysiological-filtering hypotheses.

AB  - Anurans have several characteristics in their acoustic communication that distinguish them. These characteristics are influenced by body-related, environmental and social variables. However, the complexity of anuran repertoire and the effect of such variables on it are still understudied. Dendropsophus minutus is a Neotropical treefrog that has a wide repertoire composed of three notes, grouped in at least 71 unique combinations. To quantify complexity, we used the entropy measurement, since it measures the randomness of a sequence. Therefore, we could test if repertoire complexity in D. minutus is related with body condition, social context, and environmental variables. We recorded vocalisations of 80 males in three sites and found 44 unique note combinations not described before, increasing the species' repertoire to 115 combinations. We observed that the species has near maximum entropy for note frequency, but a low entropy for note sequencies, showing a clear a bias for some note combinations. We found a positive relationship between repertoire complexity and air temperature. Thus, based on our results, the complexity of this species' repertoire is an additional trait influenced by climate, and should be considered in future studies.

AB  - Mitochondria are the most important organelles and the main reactive oxygen species producers in spermatozoa. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of mitochondria-targeted antioxidant mitoquinone (MitoQ) supplementation in boar semen extender during cryopreser-vation on sperm quality, antioxidant status and the changes of sperm mitochondrial proteomic profile. Semen collected from 10 Large White boars was cryopreserved in lactose-egg yolk extender supplemented with various concentrations of MitoQ (0, 5, 10, 20 and 40 mu M). After thawing, sperm characteristics, antioxidant status and the abundance of hexose transporters (GLUT 3 and 8) were analyzed. The comprehensive mitochondrial proteomic profiling was per-formed on spermatozoa in the control and MitoQ10 groups. Supplementation with 10 mu M of MitoQ resulted in the highest post-thaw sperm motility and kinematics. Sperm quality, antioxidant ca-pacity and glucose transporter abundance of frozen-thawed boar sperm were also elevated in the MitoQ10 group. Excessive MitoQ (40 mu M) supplementation induced a reduction of sperm motility parameters, sperm quality and antioxidant status and the abundance of GLUT3 and 8 proteins. A total of 189 proteins were defied as differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) using fold change (FC) > 1.2 with P < 0.05, and 33 of them were dramatically (FC > 1.5) regulated by MitoQ. These DEPs are mainly involved in sperm motility, energy metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation. Our data suggest that the beneficial effect of MitoQ on cryopreserved boar semen is achieved by regulating sperm antioxidant capacity and the mitochondrial proteins related to motility and metabolism.

AB  - Populations of mammalian carnivores are growing in the western United States, leading to increases in conflicts with people because carnivores prey on species that are highly valued by humans, such as domestic livestock. Accurate and updated information on the impact of predators on prey is essential when making management decisions and mitigating domestic livestock losses, yet it is difficult to detect mortalities and determine whether depredation has occurred when livestock graze on public allotments. We sought to accurately quantify the effects of predation on domestic lambs when grazing on public allotments. We placed 934 very-high-frequency (VHF) collars on lambs in seven herds that graze on public allotments at two study sites-one in northern and one in central Utah, United States. We then monitored collared lambs daily throughout the summer grazing season (April-September 2021). Of the 934 collared lambs, there were 51 (5%) lamb mortalities, for which 28 were determined to be from predation, 12 from nonpredatory causes, and 11 from unknown causes because they were too decomposed to accurately determine a cause of death. Predators responsible included coyote (Canis latrans), cougar (Puma concolor), and bobcat (Lynx rufus). Overall, few lambs die in their first 3 mo, but of those that died, we found noticeable differences in the causes and number of mortalities among herds but no differences between study sites or in predation rates within herds over time. Our results suggest lamb survival may primarily be a function of animal husbandry practices or specialization by individual predators within a grazing allotment. This study provides insight into what factors influence lamb mortality and highlights areas ranchers and managers might focus on when seeking to increase lamb survival and reduce depredation.

AB  - Many cities across the United States (U.S.) face threats from natural hazards, and as climate change continues to worsen, cities will face increased risks. Emergency management helps cities to mitigate these risks and adapt to shifting threats. Based on the Rockefeller City Resilience Framework and City Resilience Index Driver 3, Indicator 3.4, the scope of this research was to develop an emergency management maturity model and explore emergency management capacity for future disasters based on an assessment of five cities across the U.S. With the resulting data, a city's score would serve as an evaluation of the emergency response indicator (Indicator 3.4) in order to eventually enter the City Resilience Index. The cities selected were Buffalo, New York; Honolulu, Hawaii; Memphis, Tennessee; New Orleans, Louisiana; and Saint Paul, Minnesota, based on their hazard/risk factors. It should be noted that these scores were intended to compare resilience in a city over time and identify unique areas in which the cities could improve emergency management and were not meant to rank the cities against each other. An interesting find was the overlap between the counties and cities regarding policy data, creating a new avenue for research in local level emergency management.

AB  - A study was conducted on eighteen male goats to evaluate the effect of incremental levels of select dietary trace minerals on growth performance, nutrient utilization and minerals balance. Animals (16.65 +/- 0.53 kg average BW) were randomly divided into three groups and fed a basal diet to meet the requirement of all the nutrients except select trace minerals for 60 days. Groups were T-1 (0.204 ppm Se, 35.29 ppm Zn, 7.37 ppm Cu, 39.79 ppm Mn), T-2 (0.504 ppm Se, 55.29 ppm Zn, 17.37 ppm Cu, 59.79 ppm Mn), and T-3 (0.804 ppm Se, 75.29 ppm Zn, 27.37 ppm Cu, 79.79 ppm Mn). Daily dry matter intake (DMI) (% BW) was lower (P < 0.05) in T-3 as compared to other groups however, average daily gain (ADG) in body weight (P = 0.113) and feed: gain ratio (P = 0.102) showed subtle improvement in T-2 and T-3 groups. Feeding of higher levels of select trace minerals did not affect the intake and digestibility of nutrients, or plane of nutrition, however, the digestibility of non-fiber carbohydrates (NFC) increased (P = 0.004) in T-2 and T-3 groups than T-1. The balance of N, Ca, P and Cu did not differ among the groups but balance of Zn, Mn and Se increased in T-2 and T-3 groups than T-1 group. It is concluded that feeding higher levels of Zn (75.29 ppm), Cu (27.37 ppm), Mn (79.79 ppm) and Se (0.804 ppm) in combination, improved NFC digestibility, retention of Zn, Mn and Se and had subtle beneficial effects on the growth performance of male goats.

AB  - Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), an environmental endocrine disruptor, has been found to increase the expression of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN). In this study, adult male mice were given PFOA by oral gavage (p.o.) to evaluate whether it disrupts systems related to mood disorders. PFOA exposure (5 mg/kg) for 10 consecutive days caused depression-like behaviors in male mice. We measured increased corticosterone in serum and in the hippocampus of PFOA-exposed mice, which were linked to enhanced CRF expression measured in the PVN. Elevated corticosterone was associated with reductions in glucocorticoid receptor (GR) protein expression within the hippocampus. CRFR1 antagonist injected into the PVN and intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) GR antagonist both reduced depression-like behaviors, respectively. In addition, NMDA-dependent Schaeffer collateral-CA3 synaptic transmission in PFOA-exposed mice was disrupted. Synaptic deficits could be corrected by either CRFR1 or GR antagonists. In summary, we found exposure of male mice to PFOA enhances CRF expression, which then activates the HPA axis to disrupt GR expression in the hippocampus, leading to depression-like behaviors. This data is relevant for understanding the potential harmful health effects of PFOA.

AB  - This work describes and interprets fossil lagomorphs from seven sites in the Maghreb the ages of which range from the Miocene/Pliocene boundary to the Upper Pleistocene. Some of these sites, such as the Thomas Quarries in Morocco and Tighennif (=Ternifine) in Algeria, are well known for the discovery of fossil humans and their artefacts. The lagomorphs studied herein belong to two families, Prolagidae and Leporidae. The genus Prolagus has been recorded in the Maghreb since the latest Miocene, c. 6.2-6.5 Ma, and its last known representatives in Africa occur at Tighennif and Djebel Ressas 5 and 6 (Tunisia) the ages of which are estimated to be between 1.0 and 1.4 Ma. In other words, this genus, which is well known in Europe since the Early Miocene, crossed the Rifian Corridor during the Messinian crisis, and became extinct in the Maghreb earlier than in southwestern Europe where it survived until historical times. Its oldest representatives in the Maghreb known from the sites of Afoud and Lissasfa (latest Miocene-Early Pliocene) are related to P. michauxi, a species that is well represented in the latest Miocene and Early Pliocene localities in southern Europe. In the Early Pleistocene of Djebel Ressas 1 (Tunisia), it is represented by a new small species, Prolagus ressasensis n. sp. Prolagus is known in Europe as an inhabitant of wooded and humid environments. But in the terminal Miocene and Plio-Pleistocene this genus was confined more particularly to the Mediterranean rim, probably as an inhabitant of open woodland, temperate regions and certainly more open than the humid and wooded environments of the Early and Middle Miocene of Europe. The Leporidae appear in the Maghreb sites around the same time as Prolagus, but in the earlier sites (Afoud and Lissasfa), they are rare and therefore their identification is imprecise (Leporidae indet. at Afoud, Trischizolagus sp. at Lissasfa). In contrast, they are abundant in terminal Pliocene and Pleistocene sites. The genus Trischizolagus, that is well documented at Ahl al Oughlam (c. 2.5-3.0 Ma) by T. meridionalis Sen and Geraads, 2023, is even more abundant in the deposits of the Casablanca region (Grotte des Rhinoc & eacute;ros, Thomas IL, Thomas I-GH) and in Tighennif in Algeria where it is represented by T. raynali (Geraads, 1994). The last known representatives of this genus, collected from Grotte des Rhinoc & eacute;ros, occur alongside the first known representatives of the genus Lepus, described here as Lepus berbericus n. sp. In the Late Pleistocene site of Thomas I, a form of Lepus similar to L. capensis is represented by numerous mandible fragments. But the systematics of this species are the subject of debate, with no consensus as to whether it is a species occurring over a wide range from South Africa to the Middle East and North Africa or whether it comprises several species of which the morphological and / or genetic features are poorly defined. The genus Trischizolagus is well known in Europe and Anatolia with several species described between 6.5 and 3.5 Ma, while it survived in the Maghreb until the Middle Pleistocene, c. 0.5 Ma. It was probably replaced by the first hares of the Maghreb, described here as L. berbericus n. sp. The extant species Lepus capensis inhabits territories with open grassland and bushland habitats. The introduction of the rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus to the Maghreb occurred later, probably in the Late Pleistocene by prehistoric men for food.

AB  - Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) play a vital role in plant communication and influence plant evolution and ecological interactions. Hence, population-level volatile chemical diversity across the landscape influences plant interactions with local biological communities. Cycads have an insect pollination system. VOC studies have largely focused on the Zamiaceae, but there is a need for research on Cycadaceae, especially because of their strong ecological connections with insect pollinators. The widespread and abundant Cycas revoluta Thunb. was chosen to study geographic variation in cone scent, as it has a known beetle pollinator and a previously identified genetic boundary separating two spatial genetic groups across the central Ryukyu Archipelago, Japan. Headspace sampling with solid-phase microextraction (SPME) fibres combined with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) were used to collect and analyse cone VOCs of C. revoluta. Six sites including both sexes on three Ryukyu islands traversing the genetic boundary were sampled. Between-sex and genetic boundary differences were statistically tested. The VOC profiles were significantly different across the genetic boundary. The fruit-scented cones matched visits of frugivorous pollinators that primarily feed on fermented fruit. We propose fruit mimicry, with sympatric Pandanus odorifer as a candidate mimetic model based on the overlap of reproductive season and the presence of similar dominant VOCs. The study confirmed ethyl acetate as the main VOC in C. revoluta cones rather than the more unusual estragole. Distinct pollination mechanisms were found between the more generalized Cycadaceae and more specialized Zamiaceae which pave the way for further study of ecological interactions with antagonist and mutualist forces, such as differences in herbivore and pollinator compositions across the genetic boundary.

AB  - Vermicomposting is the bio-oxidation and stabilization of organic matter involving relationships between the action of earthworms and microorganisms and the activation and dynamics of several enzyme activities. Semi-arid farmers to make (extra) money and organic production, produce their vermicompost using plant residues and animal manure, but there is no information about the final product generated. Thus, this study aimed to analyze the potential of vermicomposting with mixtures of animal manure and vegetable leaves in the devel-opment of Eisenia foetida, microbial biomass, and enzymatic activity in the semi-arid region, Brazil. The experimental design applied was randomized block in a 6 x 4 factorial scheme with four replicates, with six treatments (mixtures of cattle manure, goat manure, cashew leaves, and catanduva leaves) and evaluated at four -time intervals (30, 60, 90, and 120 days of vermicomposting). The treatments were placed in polyethylene pots in the same site, environmental conditions, and residues proportions as used by farmers. The characteristics analyzed were the number of earthworms (NE), total earthworm biomass (TEB) and earthworm multiplication index (MI), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), and activities of enzymes beta-glucosidase, dehydrogenase, alkaline and acid phosphatases. The cattle manure vermicomposted shows the highest average values observed for NE, MI, TEB, MBC, and enzymatic activity, regardless of the plant leaves mix. In general, the enzymes activities were found in the descending order of beta-glucosidase > alkaline phosphatase > dehydrogenase > acid phosphatase. The maturation dynamics of vermicompost were characterized by a decline in the microbial population and number and biomass of earthworms in the substrate and consequently a decrease in new enzyme synthesis and degra-dation of the remaining enzyme pool. Microbial biomass and enzymatic activity were indicators for changes in the quality of vermicompost.

AB  - The emergence and intensification of the trans-Eurasian exchange during the Late Neolithic and Bronze Ages profoundly influenced human lifestyles, notably in the arc and the Central Plains. Though the exchange was critical to socioeconomic development, humans adopting livelihood strategies in varying ways depending on geography and social pressures remains unclear. Stable C and N isotopic analysis is the primary approach to study paleodiet-an important insight into ancient human livelihoods. Unfortunately, isotopic data are largely absent in China's Yunnan Province-a component of the arc-especially in the periods prior to 3000 BP. Here, we report the earliest and direct evidence of human diets in Yunnan during the Holocene, as shown by stable C and N isotopes and radiocarbon dates from human and animal bones unearthed from the Baiyangcun site. Integrating our data with archaeobotanical and zooarchaeological data from the Late Neolithic and Bronze Ages throughout the arc and Central Plains, we found that humans heavily relied on C-3 foods in Yunnan during 4800-4600 BP and similar to 3800-3300 BP and millet remains (C-4) found in both periods were probably used for feeding other livestock and/or ritual practices rather than as staple food for humans. We also detected asynchronous transformation of human livelihoods across different regions during 4000-2200 BP, when wheat, barley, and herbivorous livestock were generally utilized in China. These exotic crops and livestock were adopted as necessary subsistence during 4000-3000 BP and became the dominant livelihood during 3000-2200 BP in the Gansu-Qinghai region. However, these practices were auxiliary strategies in Yunnan and the Central Plains during 4000-3000 BP and displayed a significant degree of spatial variation during 3000-2200 BP. We propose that the difference in livelihood transformation in these regions is largely a result of the physical features of crops and livestock, local natural environment, terrain, human survival pressures associated with climate change and population fluctuation.

AB  - Some predators prefer to settle on leaf patches with microstructures (e.g., trichomes and domatia), leaving traces on the patches. Herbivorous arthropods, in turn, select leaf patches in response to these traces left by predators. It remains unclear whether traces of predators on leaf patches affect the distribution of herbivorous prey within plants through plant microstructure. Therefore, we examined the distribution of herbivorous mite (Tetranychus urticae) and predatory mite (Phytoseiulus persimilis) by investigating their oviposition pattern. We used a kidney bean plant (Phaseolus vulgaris) with two expanded primary leaves and the first trifoliate leaf, focusing on leaf trichomes as the microstructure. The density of trichomes was higher on the first trifoliate leaf than on the primary leaves and on the abaxial surface of the leaves than on the adaxial surface. Adult female P. persimilis laid more eggs on the first trifoliate leaf to the primary leaves. Although adult female T. urticae preferred to oviposit on the abaxial surface of primary leaves, previous exposure of plants to predators diminished this preference. The altered egg distribution would be a response to the traces of P. persimilis rather than eggs of P. persimilis. Our findings indicate that T. urticae reproduces on leaf patches with traces of predators without altering their oviposition preference. Given that the presence of predator traces is known to reduce the reproduction of T. urticae, it may have a substantial effect on the population of T. urticae in the next generations on kidney bean plants.

AB  - Sheep's fecundity is determined by both twinning rate and litter size, both influenced by several genes, one of which is the OLR1 (oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor) gene. This study aimed to determine the genetic variation of the OLR1 gene affecting the fecundity traits of Awassi ewes. The genomic DNA from 114 ewes with a single progeny and 86 ewes with twins was extracted. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify three fragments (334 bp, 291 bp, and 274 bp) (exon 3, exon 4, and exon 6) of the OLR1 gene. Two genotypes of 334-bp amplicons - CC and CA - were detected. In a sequence reaction, the novel mutation p.K116Q was discovered in CA genotypes. There was a highly significant (P <= 0.01) association between the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and reproductive traits, in that ewes with the p.K116Q SNP had lower litter size, twinning rate, fecundity, and lambing percentages than ewes with the CC genotype. These observations imply that the missense p.K116Q variant has an adverse effect on the traits under study and show that p.K116Q SNP has a negative influence on fecundity traits in Awassi sheep. Based on the findings of this study, it is clear that ewes with the p.K116Q SNP are associated with reduced litter size and reduced fecundity traits for this population. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Microplastic fibres (MPFs) are a major source of microplastic pollution, most are released during domestic washing of synthetic clothing. Organic microfibres (OMF) are also released into the environment by the same means, with cotton and wool being the most common in the UK. There is little empirical evidence to demonstrate that plastic fibres are more harmful than organic fibres if ingested by freshwater animals such as Gammarus pulex. Using our method of feeding Gammarus MPFs embedded in algal wafers, we compared the ingestion, feeding behaviour and growth of Gammarus exposed to 70 mu m sheep wool, 20 mu m cotton, 30 mu m acrylic wool, and 50 mu m or 100 mu m human hair, and 30 mu m cat hair at a concentration of 3% fibre by mass. Gammarus would not ingest wafers containing human hair, or sheep wool fibres. Given the choice between control wafers and those contaminated with MPF, cat hair or cotton, Gammarus spent less time feeding on MPF but there was no difference in the time spent feeding on OMFs compared to the control. Given a choice between contaminated wafers, Gammarus preferred the OMF to the MPF. There were no significant differences in growth or mortality among any of the treatments. These results conclude that MPFs are less likely to be ingested by Gammarus if alternative food is available and are not more harmful than OMFs.

AB  - Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) lights are more energy-efficient and provide adequate illumination compared to compact fluorescent (CFL) lamps and incandescent light (ICD) bulbs. However, as new light sources, the LED lights may have a stress effect on broiler chickens. Thus, this study aimed to determine the effects of dietary L-tryptophan (Trp), as an anti-stress agent and different color temperatures of light-emitting diodes on immune responses and growth performance of male broiler chickens. Four hundred and eighty day-old Ross 308 male chicks were used from day 1 to 42. The chicks were randomly distributed into six treatment groups in a 2 x 3 factorial arrangement [0 or 1 g Trp per kg diet along with neutral-white (4286 K), warm-white (2990 K), and incandescent (2790 K) light bulbs] with four replicates of 20 chicks each. Results showed that dietary Trp and Trpxlight interaction did not affect growth performance, immune responses, a total number of leukocytes, and different leukocytes count (heterophil, eosinophil, monocyte, and lymphocyte) of male broiler chickens. However, LEDs' different color temperatures significantly affected the feed conversion ratio (FCR) and primary antibody of sheep red blood cell (SRBC). The FCR was the lowest in the warm-white light, and primary SRBC antibody titers of the chicks were the highest. In conclusion, although adding Trp to male broiler diets did not affect the growth performance and immune responses of chickens, the warm-white light improved the FCR and primary SRBC.

AB  - Fisheries for Caribbean sponge species began in the mid-1800s and landings peaked around the early 1900s before crashing because of a combination of overexploitation, disease, and hurricanes as well as, later, the introduction of artificial sponges. Still, artisanal sponge fisheries remain in Florida and areas of the Caribbean like The Bahamas, but none of those fisheries or the sponges upon which they depend are well studied. On the basis of data and information published by J. Storr in 1964 as well as of our own data, von Bertalanffy growth parameters were estimated for the most commercially valuable Caribbean sponge, the sheepswool sponge or wool sponge (Hippospongia lachne), along with related statistics, notably longevity. Also, morphological dimensional constraints that are likely to limit the supply of oxygen deep within this and other near-spherical sponge species are presented, along with the sponges' evolutionary and ontogenic responses to these constraints. These considerations are also illustrated with data from species other than the wool sponge and are consistent with a general theory of growth for water-breathing ectotherms, the gill-oxygen limitation theory. The information provided herein should be useful for quantifying the ecosystem effect of sponge fisheries in Florida, The Bahamas, and elsewhere and for improving the management of sponge fisheries and mariculture worldwide.

AB  - This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of selenium (Se) supplementation on growth performance of growing Awassi lambs. Twenty-five lambs were divided randomly into three groups. Lambs received the basal diet plus: no Se (CON; n = 8), 0.15 mg/lambs/day of supplemental Se to the diet as Se selenite (DSE; n = 8), or 0.5 mg/lamb of Se injection as Se selenite (ISE; n = 9). At the end of the study that lasted for 50 day, 3 lambs from each treatment randomly selected and individually housed in metabolism crates to evaluate nutrient digestibility. Nutrients (DM, OM, CP, NDF, ADF, and EE) intake of lambs and nutrient digestibility were not affected by Se supplementation. Growth performance (final body weight, average daily gain, and feed conversion ratio) of lambs were similar among treatment groups. Selenium supplementation (dietary or injection) failed to improve the performance of growing Awassi lambs fed high-concentrate diets containing 0.13 mg Se /kg of dry matter.

AB  - Two new species of Fulvifomes are described from specimens collected in South America (Ecuador and Bolivia) based on morphological and molecular evidence. The species Fulvifomes bolivianus is characterized by perennial, pileate, solitary basidiocarp; ungulate pilei; olivaceous, encrusted, rough, concentrically sulcate, irregularly cracked pileal surface; umber and glossy pore surface; circular pores measuring 7-8 per mm; thick and entire dissepiments; a dimitic hyphal system; and subglobose basidiospores measuring 4.7-5.4 x 4-4.5 mu m. Fulvifomes fragilis is characterized by annual, pileate, imbricate basidiocarps; curry yellow to yellowish brown pileal surface; yellowish brown and narrow pileal margin; yellow and rugged pore surface; circular to elliptical pores measuring 5-6 per mm; thick and entire dissepiments; a dimitic hyphal system; and broadly ellipsoid basidiospores measuring 3.9-5.1 x 3-3.7 mu m. Phylogenetically, the two new species formed two distinct lineages in the Fulvifomes clade based on internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and nuclear-encoded large subunit rRNA gene (nLSU) sequences. The differences between the new species and morphologically similar and phylogenetically related species are also discussed.

AB  - Background Yak (Poephagus grunniens) production on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is influenced heavily by the quality of the natural forage, which can vary significantly in both quality and quantity. Therefore, timely and accurate monitoring of forage variables is essential for optimizing livestock production in this region. Methods This study investigated the use of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) as a tool for estimating the composition and quality of natural forage. A total of 301 natural forage samples were collected, and their spectral data were acquired using NIRS. Conventional methods were used to measure the forage composition, and predictive models were developed based on the spectral data. Results Our findings indicate that NIRS can accurately predict the contents of crude protein, acid detergent fiber, and neutral detergent fiber. However, it demonstrated less accuracy in predicting dry matter digestibility, gross energy yield, and methane production. Conclusions The application of NIRS for assessing the nutritional composition of forages on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is a key advancement for the livestock industry. Understanding forage nutrition enables informed feeding strategies and improvement of livestock production. Future research should refine predictive models to ensure sustainable forage management and enhance livestock productivity in this unique ecological environment.

AB  - Simple Summary The study investigated bone and dental lesions in 180 dry skulls from eleven neotropical deer species, originating from both captive and wild conditions, through direct visual inspection. The research aimed to characterize these lesions, estimate their prevalence, and assess potential risk factors. The results showed a high prevalence of bone and dental lesions in all analyzed species, with dental calculus being the most common alteration (96.7%), followed by dental wear (71.1%). A positive correlation was found between animal age and the presence of lesions, indicating that older animals exhibited more bone and dental alterations. The prevalence of these lesions was similar between sexes. However, lesions were more common in captive-bred animals, likely due to their older age and a less diverse diet. Specific species, such as Blastocerus dichotomus and Mazama americana, were most affected by bone resorption and dental trauma. The study concluded that all eleven evaluated species are susceptible to bone and dental lesions, highlighting the importance of monitoring oral health and diet in captivity as fundamental practices for the conservation of these deer species.Abstract Bone and dental lesions have been documented in various deer species globally, affecting the efficiency of ingestion and digestion, consequently influencing their general health and leading to a decline in survival and reproductive performance. The present study aimed to characterize bone and dental lesions in the dry skulls of individual deer, estimate the prevalence of these lesions, and assess potential risk factors associated with the development of bone and dental alterations. This study assessed bone and dental lesions in 180 dry skulls of eleven neotropical deer species, originating from both captivity and wildlife conditions, through direct visual inspection. A high prevalence of bone and dental lesions was observed in all analyzed species. Dental calculus was the most common alteration (96.7%), followed by dental wear (71.1%). Animal age positively correlated with most bone and dental alterations, indicating that older animals showed more lesions. Additionally, the prevalence of these alterations was similar between sexes. Moreover, all lesions were more common in captive-bred animals, likely attributed to their older age and a less diverse diet. Blastocerus dichotomus and Mazama americana were most affected by bone resorption and dental trauma and had the highest dental calculus prevalence, along with Subulo gouazoubira and Passalites nemorivagus. All eleven species evaluated in the present study were susceptible to the occurrence of bone and dental lesions. Therefore, monitoring oral health and diet in captivity are fundamental practices for the conservation of these species.

AB  - Food neophobia is a behavior observed in rodents involving reduced consumption of a novel food or drink. In the absence of negative post-ingestive consequences, consumption increases with exposure (attenuation of neophobia), which is seen as an associative safe memory. Olfaction and gustation are sensory modalities essential for the development of a food preference. However, little is known about the neural mechanisms underlying neophobia to a food-related odor stimulus. In the present study, we examined the effect of pharmacological inactivation of the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) on neophobia to orally consumed solutions in rats using muscimol, a gamma aminobutyric acid type A receptor agonist. Two different types of solutions, almond odor (benzaldehyde) and sweet taste (saccharin), were prepared. In the results, microinjections of muscimol into the bilateral vHPC before the first odor and taste exposures did not alter the neophobic reactions of the rats to each stimulus. However, in the second odor, but not taste, exposure, the muscimol-injected rats showed higher consumption in comparison to that observed in the control rats, suggesting that the vHPC inactivation facilitates the attenuation of odor neophobia. On the other hand, intra-vHPC muscimol microinjections after the first odor and taste exposures did not facilitate consumption at the second exposures. These results indicate that neural activations within vHPC during orally consuming a novel odor, but not taste, solution play an inhibitory role in the subsequent attenuation of neophobia.

AB  - Research organizations should be proactive in regularly evaluating and refining their animal care and use programs in order to advance animal welfare and minimize distress. Pigs are often used in research, but few empirical studies have examined optimal husbandry and research use practices for pigs in a research environment. We developed the Pig Welfare Working Group (PWWG) to address the need for more formal guidelines on the management and use of pigs in research. The PWWG was a stakeholder focus group whose goal was to identify challenges and opportunities relevant to improving animal welfare through collaboration, knowledge sharing, and inclusive decision-making. Through consensus building, the PWWG developed 12 recommendations for behavioral management, housing, research procedures, transportation, and rehoming programs. The recommendations were rolled out across the contract research organization, business units, sites, and countries. Follow up will be conducted regularly to assess welfare, monitor progress toward implementing the recommendations, and recognize and reward participants making changes at their site.

AB  - Socio-ecological and economic challenges force European farmers to consider their business model (BM). Knowledge on the concept of BMs and BM change is currently lacking behind for agriculture. The agri-food sector as a whole differs in many ways from other sectors in which the BM concept is already widely applied. Therefore, there is relevance to check for the applicability within agriculture of existing knowledge on BMs and BM change. Specifically, this paper aims to study the applicability to the agricultural sector of a general framework to study BM change. By means of 19 interviews, BM change and influencing factors were investigated for the case of a feed composition change at farm level in Flanders. The results highlight that a comprehensive study of BM change requires an additional level of analysis, i.e. the entrepreneurial level, besides the farm and environmental level. Also, besides the factors influencing a BM change process (drivers and factors facilitating or hindering a change), the situation of the farm and its environment before and after a BM change should be analysed. The latter determines how an influencing factor affects the BM in a specific situation. This study contributes to the theory on boundary conditions of the BM innovation construct. In relation to a change in the feed composition at pig and broiler farms in Flanders, interacting factors were identified that shape a BM change. The analysis shows that BM change is a stepwise process of changes to specific BM components. Often, the BM resulting from such a process shows a fit with other BM components or with the environment. However, it often also depends on the initial drivers of the BM change. In conclusion, this study provides more insight into the complexity of BM change in the agricultural sector and highlights key aspects of BM change analysis.

AB  - Describing ontogenetic morphological change is an important part of integrative taxonomy; still, most taxonomic studies are based only on adult characters. Here, we provide illustrations and a morphological description of the sea stars from Bahia, including ontogenetic and intraspecific variation, and identify taxonomic issues. A total of 293 specimens from different localities along the Bahia State coastline and comparative material from other localities were examined. Eighteen species (11 genera, eight families) of Asteroidea were identified; Astropectinidae was the most representative family. All species identified also occur in subtropical Brazilian waters and most species are from shallow water habitats with soft bottoms. Most observed ontogenetic variation was quantitative in nature, such as the increase in the number of spines in the furrow and of spinelets in the paxillae with specimen growth. Genera that require further taxonomic studies are Astropecten and Othilia, whose specimens are commonly misidentified in local studies. One third of the species from Bahia are currently classified as ?Vulnerable? in the Brazilian Red List, but baseline data on the population biology of these species are scarce. An illustrated identification key to the 65 Brazilian sea star species is also provided. This taxonomic study will facilitate the identification of specimens occurring along the Brazilian coast and help scientists and policy makers to establish the conservation status of the Brazilian species.

AB  - Small intestinal growth and health affect its digestion and absorption ability, while little information exists about the small intestinal morphology and function differences among the different pig breeds. Therefore, 90 healthy 35 days of age Taoyuan black (TB), Xiangcun black (XB), and Duroc (DR) pigs (30 pigs per breed) with similar body weight (BW) of the same breed were reared to 185 days of age to evaluate the potential relationship between feed efficiency and small intestinal morphology and function at 80, 125, and 185 days of age. The results show that the TB and XB pigs had lower initial and final BW, ADG, and ADFI and plasma CHO and LDL-C levels, whereas they had higher plasma LIP levels and jejunal trypsin, invertase, lactase, and maltase activities and higher DM, ADF, Tyr, Arg, and His digestibility at 80 days of age compared with the DR pigs. At 125 days of age, TB and XB pigs had lower apparent total tract digestibility and plasma CHO, HDL-C, LDL-C, and NH3 levels; XB pigs had lower DM and NDF digestibility, and TB pigs had higher jejunal lactase and maltase activities. At 185 days of age, TB and XB pigs had lower DM, EE, ADF, and GE digestibility, while having higher plasma ALT and UN levels; TB pigs had higher plasma AST level and jejunal chymase activity. Furthermore, the plasma free amino acid contents, small intestinal VH, and nutrient transporter expression levels differed at different ages. Therefore, the different pig breeds exhibited significantly different growth performance and small intestinal growth, mainly resulting from the differences in digestive enzymes and nutrient transporters in the small intestine.

AB  - Simple Summary Enteric methane emission reduction from livestock is one of the most discussed topics of the 21st century. Plant-based polyphenols are found to be one of the effective solutions to reduce methane emissions from ruminant animals. Hence, this study evaluates the effect of sugarcane-based polyphenolic supplements on enteric methane emission and its effect on microbiota and body weight changes in sheep. The results from this study indicate that both dosages of Polygain reduced methane emission from sheep and increased average daily gain compared to the control group animals with notable changes in rumen microbiota.Abstract The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of feeding sugarcane-derived polyphenolic supplement (Polygain, The Product Makers Australia, Keysborough, VIC, Australia) on enteric methane (CH4) emission, rumen microbiota, and performance of second-cross lambs. For this purpose, 24 Poll Dorset x (Border Leicester x Merino) lambs were allocated to 3 different treatments: Control (C), 0.25% Polygain (0.25 PG), and 1% Polygain (1 PG) diets with a uniform basal feed (25% cracked wheat grain, 25% cracked barley grain, 25% oaten chaff, 25% lucerne chaff). Both doses of Polygain reduced the total CH4 production (g/day; p = 0.006), CH4 yield (CH4, g/kg of dry matter intake; p = 0.003) and CH4 intensity (CH4, g/kg of BW; p = 0.003). Dry matter intake tended to be greater (p = 0.08) in sheep fed 1 PG compared to the C group, with the 0.25 PG group being intermediate. The average daily gain of the lambs was improved (p = 0.03) with 1% Polygain supplementation. The relative abundance of genera Methanobrevibacter_unidentified, Methanomethylophilaceae_uncultured, Methanogenic archaeon mixed culture ISO4-G1, Methanosphaera uncultured rumen methanogen, Methanogenic archaeon ISO4-H5, and Methanobrevibacter boviskoreani JH1 were reduced with Polygain supplementation. In conclusion, feeding Polygain reduced lambs' enteric CH4 emissions, altered the rumen microbiome, and improved the growth performance of lambs.

AB  - Simple Summary Egypt is a carrefour between North African Maghreb countries, East Tropical Africa, Arabian Peninsula, and Near East countries including Turkey. The aim of the present work was to describe the genetic relationships between several domestic sheep populations of these regions. All of the present-day Egyptian breeds are coarse woolen and fat-tailed, but archeologists indicate that this tail form was acquired in the Near East later from populations with a thin tail. To test this idea, we used a phylogenetic-derived program to compare the control region of mtDNA of 37 breeds with fat or thin tails. We showed that most breeds seemed to fit with the archeologist hypothesis, whereas one breed indicates a direct migration of a fat-tailed breed from Turkey. Unexpectedly, one of the breeds from South Egypt was strongly linked to the thin-tailed desert breeds of Sudan, raising the question of the events leading to this situation. (1) Background: It has been recognized that the origin of fat-tailed sheep occurred within coarse wool breeds and that this character was introgressed several times into thin-tailed populations. However, no study has investigated this idea for Egyptian breeds using mtDNA analyses. (2) Methods: Using new sequences of the control region, we constructed a database of 467 sequences representing 37 breeds including fat- and thin-tailed ones with 80 Egyptian individuals belonging to six local breeds (Barki, Fallahi, Ossimi, Rahmani, Saidi, Sohagi). The phylogenetic tree obtained with the maximum likelihood method was submitted to the Newick Extra program to count the direct and indirect links between the individuals of each breed. (3) Results: Several Egyptian breeds were strongly connected to "primitive" thin-tailed breeds from Europe, indicating a clear genetic background of the "thin tail" breed type that supports the view of archeologists. In several cases, we suspected Western Asian breeds to be involved in the introgression of the fat tail character. In contrast, the Ossimi breed showed a high affinity to a fat-tailed breed of Western Asia, suggesting a direct migration and no thin tail ancestors. The Saidi is unique as our analyses revealed its strong connection with thin-tailed Sudanese breeds.

AB  - Agriculture is vital to global food production. Around 550 million smallholding households produce most of the world's food, and many rely on livestock rearing for a living. Smallholder farms must survive and thrive to maintain and increase food production. Baseline information is vital for further extension service interventions. The goal of this Malawian study was to collect quantitative baseline data on crop and livestock production, agriproduct sales, and other indicators through a household survey, and to compare the efficacy (in terms of income) of using the concept of "Lead and Follow" farmer training programs. The baseline study survey was carried out in 44 sections of 11 extension planning areas from Malawi's five districts (Dowa, Kasungu, Mchinji, Mzimba, and Rumphi). In total, 1131 smallholder households were interviewed. Crop production, livestock farming, and providing casual labor for others were all identified as significant sources of income for smallholders, implying that all agriproducts (the whole-farm approach) is equally important for improving smallholder livelihoods. On the one hand, the whole-farm approach should improve smallholders' resilience regarding climate change and poverty. Lower agriproduct sales, on the other hand, indicated that links to the market were frequently poor but an increased market focus should help smallholders sell their produce at a fair margin. In terms of best practices adoption, both Lead and Follow farmers adopted similar farm practices (crops and livestock) to increase income. In general, no significant difference in income was calculated from many farm enterprises for both Lead and Follow farmers. However, the income from pigs and firewood was significantly higher for Follow farmers than for Lead farmers. Lead farmers reported significantly higher off-farm income sources. Significant changes are proposed to the "Lead farmer extension approach".

AB  - Background Chondrocytes are the only cell components in the cartilage, which has the poor regeneration ability. Thus, repairing damaged cartilage remains a huge challenge. Sika deer antlers are mainly composed of cartilaginous tissues that have an astonishing capacity for repair and renewal. Our previous study has demonstrated the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta 1) is considered to be a key molecule involved in rapid growth, with the strongest expression in the cartilage layer. However, it remains to be clarified whether deer TGF-beta 1 has significantly different function from other species such as mouse, and what is the molecular mechanism of regulating cartilage growth. Methods Primary chondrocytes was collected from new born mouse rib cartilage. The effect of TGF-beta 1 on primary chondrocytes viability was elucidated by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technology combined with validation methods such as quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Differential expression genes were identified using the DEGseq package. Results Our results demonstrated that the overexpression of deer TGF-beta 1 possibly promoted chondrocyte proliferation and extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis, while simultaneously suppressing chondrocyte differentiation through regulating transcription factors, growth factors, ECM related genes, proliferation and differentiation marker genes, such as Comp, Fgfr3, Atf4, Stat1 etc., and signaling pathways such as the MAPK signaling pathway, inflammatory mediator regulation of TRP channels etc. In addition, by comparing the amino acid sequence and structures between the deer TGF-beta 1 and mouse TGF-beta 1, we found that deer TGF-beta 1 and mouse TGF-beta 1 proteins are mainly structurally different in arm domains, which is the main functional domain. Phenotypic identification results showed that deer TGF-beta 1 may has stronger function than mouse TGF-beta 1. Conclusion These results suggested that deer TGF-beta 1 has the ability to promote chondrogenesis by regulating chondrocyte proliferation, differentiation and ECM synthesis. This study provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of deer TGF-beta 1 on chondrocyte viability.

AB  - This study aimed to explore the effects of dietary fiber level and breed on the growth performance, nutrient utilization, intestinal morphology, slaughter performance, and meat quality of finishing pigs using fermented corn straw (FCS) as the fiber source. The experiment employed a 2 x 4 factorial design, selecting 96 Songliao Black (SLB) and Duroc x Landrace x Yorkshire (DLY) crossbred finishing pigs (a total of 192 pigs, with an initial body weight of 60.52 +/- 4.59 kg) randomly assigned by breed to four dietary treatment groups (A: 2.92% crude fiber; B: 4.82% crude fiber; C: 6.86% crude fiber; D: 9.01% crude fiber). The results showed that DLY finishing pigs had higher final weight (FW), average daily gain (ADG), and average daily feed intake (ADFI) in both finishing stages 1 and 2 compared to SLB pigs (p < 0.05), while the ratio of feed to weight gain (F/G) showed no significant differences (p > 0.05). Compared to the basal diet, increasing the dietary fiber level to 4.82% improved FW and ADG in both SLB and DLY finishing pigs (p < 0.05) and reduced F/G (p < 0.05). Additionally, SLB finishing pigs had lower ether extract (EE) digestibility but higher crude fiber (CF) and acid detergent fiber (ADF) digestibility than DLY (p < 0.05). Dietary fiber level and breed exhibited an interaction effect on dry matter (DM) and crude protein (CP) digestibility in finishing pigs (p < 0.05). At a dietary fiber level of 4.82%, villus height, crypt depth in the jejunum, and cecal volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentrations were increased in both SLB and DLY finishing pigs (p < 0.05). Dietary fiber level and breed showed an interaction effect on cecal VFA production in finishing pigs (finishing stage 1; p < 0.05). The dietary fiber level of 4.82% increased loin eye area (LA) (p < 0.05) and decreased backfat thickness (BT) (p < 0.05) in both SLB and DLY finishing pigs. Dietary fiber level and breed had an interaction effect on LA in finishing pigs (p < 0.05). SLB pigs had higher muscle redness (a*), shear force, and contents of crude protein (CP), EE, saturated fatty acid (SFA), and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) than DLY (p < 0.05). Increasing the dietary fiber level improved pH(24h) and reduced drip loss and shear force in both SLB and DLY finishing pigs (p < 0.05). Dietary fiber level and breed showed an interaction effect on pig meat color and drip loss (p < 0.05). In conclusion, FCS is a beneficial source of dietary fiber for SLB and DLY pigs. Its proper addition can enhance the growth performance, carcass traits, and meat quality in fattening pigs.

AB  - Northern Australia is characterised by high rainfall variability and extended droughts that challenge sustainable and profitable management of grazing properties. To achieve drought resilience, emphasis must be placed on supporting livestock managers to prepare for drought as well as implementing appropriate drought response and recovery actions. Here we describe insights and learnings gained from working with scientists, industry development and extension officers, and property managers, to enable more profitable and drought resilient extensive livestock production systems across northern Australia. We provide examples from the modelling and analysis of hypothetical grazing properties representative of enterprises across northern Australia. To prepare for drought, we principally propose the application of the farm-management economics framework to identify investment strategies which can improve enterprise resilience through building wealth over the longer term. The critical first step in drought preparedness for beef businesses was the implementation of management strategies to achieve the optimal herd structure, steer sale age, and breeder body condition. Other key strategies to improve profitability across northern Australia were (1) addressing a phosphorus deficiency for cattle through effective supplementation and (2) establishing adapted perennial legume-grass pastures to improve steer nutrition. In addition, we identify the benefits of working closely with livestock managers and industry to gain adoption of proven technologies that effectively improve decision-making capacity and the drought preparedness of extensive livestock production systems. The usefulness of the farm-management economics approach to assess the relative value of alternative tactical destocking and restocking decisions during drought response and recovery is also discussed. These latter analyses can highlight important differences between options in terms of future profit and cash flow, as well as the ability to rapidly return the property to the most profitable herd structure and age of turnoff, with consideration of production and financial risk. Additionally, integrating pasture growth models with herd or flock economic models can provide insights into the effects, on profitability and sustainability, of alternative destocking and later restocking strategies over the longer term. Combined, the farm-management economics framework approach can support more informed decision-making by livestock producers and hence enable more profitable and drought resilient extensive livestock production systems. However, achieving drought resilience in the grazing lands of northern Australia will require emphasis on drought preparation, in addition to appropriate action in response and recovery phases of drought. Key to this approach is increasing the adoption of strategies that enhance drought preparedness.

AB  - Laboratory rats repeatedly exposed to an open field (OF) apparatus display increasingly high levels of grooming -especially that characterized by long and complex sequences- which has been taken as an additional index of novelty habituation. We hypothesized that disrupting such a learning process by administering an amnesic drug as the antimuscarinic scopolamine (SCP) could delay the appearance of more complex grooming subtypes. Thus, rats were pretreated either with SCP (15 mg/kg or 30 mg/kg) or vehicle (VEH) upon four one-day apart OF (OF1-4). On a fifth assessment, all rats received VEH to analyze the likely carry-over effect of SCP. Finally, we measured 50-kHz and 22-kHz ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) as reliable markers of positive and negative emotionality, respectively. We found that SCP increased locomotion during OF1 and reduced rearing on OF1-OF4, causing no disruption in habituation over tests. SCP prevented the increase of total grooming time by inhibiting complex grooming subtypes and promoting short cephalic sequences. Despite the SCP-induced alterations on grooming agreed with our hypotheses, those changes may have resulted from a motor impairment that could have also affected rearing behavior. Additionally, SCP suppressed 50-kHz USVs while marginally increased 22-kHz calls. Once SCP was withdrawn, rearing, grooming, and some 50-kHz USVs subtypes returned to VEH levels, suggesting that novelty habituation occurred despite the SCP administration. Altogether, that mixed profile of SCP-induced behavioral changes may derive from the complex interplay between the contrasting action of SCP on different brain regions and the doses here used.

AB  - Desiccation stress causes mesic-adapted arthropods to lose their body water content. However, mesic-adapted Paederus beetles can survive over prolonged periods under dry field conditions, suggesting that these beetles adopt an array of water conservation mechanisms. We investigated the water balance mechanisms of field-collected Paederus adults over a 14-month sampling period. We also assessed their nutritional adaptations by performing a stable isotope analysis to examine their diet. The water loss rate (WLR) of the beetles was significantly associated with the rice crop cycle and saturation deficit. The cuticular permeability (CP) of adult beetles was maintained at < 30 mu g cm 2h(-1) mmHg(-1); however, CP increased significantly with the WLR. This result indicates that CP might play a minor role in reducing excessive water loss in beetles. The beetles' body water content and percentage total body water content increased when the WLR was high. Trehalose, glucose, and glycogen did not appear to play a central role in enhancing the water reserves in the insects. The body lipid content ranged from 0.22 +/- 0.06 to 0.87 +/- 0.07 mg and was negatively associated with the WLR. This association indicates that the increase in internal metabolic water was mediated by lipid catabolism. Stable isotope analysis results revealed that the Paederus beetles shifted their diet to carbohydrate-rich plants when the saturation deficit increased and the associated WLR reached its peak; otherwise, they consumed a high amount of staple carbohydrate-poor herbivore prey. The accumulation of energy reserves in the form of lipids through seasonal dietary shifts may exert major effects on the survival and population success of mesic-adapted Paederus beetles.

AB  - Wild and domestic animals can be usefully employed as sentinels for the surveillance of diseases with an impact on public health. In the case of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), the detection of antibodies in animals can be more effective than screening ticks for detecting TBEV foci, due to the patchy distribution of the virus. In the Piedmont region, northwestern Italy, TBEV is considered absent, but an increase in tick densities, of Ixodes ricinus in particular, has been observed, and TBEV is spreading in bordering countries, e.g., Switzerland. Therefore, we collected sera from wild ungulates during the hunting season (October-December) from 2017 to 2019 in the Susa Valley, Italian western Alps, and screened them for TBEV antibodies by a commercial competitive ELISA test. We collected 267 serum samples by endocranial venous sinuses puncture from red deer, roe deer and northern chamois carcasses. The animals were hunted in 13 different municipalities, at altitudes ranging between 750 and 2800 m a.s.l. The serological survey for TBEV yielded negative results. Borderline results for five serum samples were further confirmed as negative for TBEV by a plaque reduction neutralisation test. To date, our results indicate that TBEV is not circulating in western Piedmont. However, monitoring of TBEV should continue since TBEV and its vector are spreading in Europe. The wide-range distribution of wild ungulates and their role as feeding hosts, make them useful indicators of the health threats posed by Ixodid ticks.

AB  - The objectives of the current study were to screen antioxidant lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains isolated from traditionally fermented Tibetan yak milk, and to evaluate their probiotic effects on the oxidative senescence of Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). A total of 10 LAB isolates were assessed for their antioxidant activity by in vitro assays, and three strains with high activity were selected for an investigation of their probiotic functions in C. elegans. The results indicated that Lactobacillus plantarum As21 showed high anti-oxidant capacity and had a high survival rate (64%) in a simulated gastrointestinal tract. The lifespan of C. elegans treated with As21 was increased by 34.5% compared to the control group. Strain As21 also showed improved motility and enhanced resistance to heat stress and H2O2 stimulation in C. elegans. Moreover, treatment with As21 reduced the production of age-related reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) damage and promoted the production of the antioxidants superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione GSH. These results suggest that Lactobacillus plantarum strain As21 could be a potential probiotic strain for retarding ageing and could be used in functional foods.

AB  - The intramuscular fat (IMF) content, as an important meat quality trait, can directly affect the tenderness, juiciness, and flavor of pork. Reasonably increasing the IMF content can improve the palatability of pork. Therefore, identification of important factors for the lipid accumulation among muscles is the breakthrough point for improving meat quality. FGF21, identified as a novel metabolic regulator, has been found to regulate glucose and lipid metabolism in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, but its function in porcine adipocytes remains unclear. In this study, we discovered that the administration of recombinant FGF21 protein promotes adipogenic differentiation and increases triglyceride accumulation in porcine adipocytes. While the expression of FGFR1 in adipocytes under muscle conditions is inhibited, affecting the signal transduction of FGF21. This inhibitory effect is accompanied by activation of the AhR signaling pathway. When treated with the AhR antagonist CH223191, there was a partial restoration of FGFR1 expression levels. This indicates that muscle cells suppress the expression of FGFR1 in adipocytes by activating the AhR signaling pathway, thereby affecting the signal transduction of FGF21. Our results reveal the regulatory role of FGF21 in pig adipocyte differentiation and the regulatory mechanism of muscle environment on FGFR1 expression, providing new theoretical basis for IMF content improvement from the perspective of FGF21-FGFR1 signaling transduction.

AB  - Early life stress has been associated with elevated risk for later psychopathology. One mechanism that may contribute to such long-term risk is alterations in amygdala development, a brain region critical to stress responsivity. Yet effects of stress on the amygdala during human infancy, a period of particularly rapid brain development, remain largely unstudied. In order to model how early stressors may affect infant amygdala development, several discrepancies across the existing literatures on early life stress among rodents and early threat versus deprivation among older human children and adults need to be reconciled. We briefly review the key findings of each of these literatures. We then consider them in light of emerging findings from studies of human infants regarding relations among maternal caregiving, infant cortisol response, and infant amygdala volume. Finally, we advance a developmental salience model of how early threat may impact the rapidly developing infant brain, a model with the potential to integrate across these divergent literatures. Future work to assess the value of this model is also proposed.

AB  - The effects of drought stress on stomatal opening dynamics, plant volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions and plant-insect interactions have been well-documented individually, but how they interact mechanistically remains poorly studied. Here, we studied how drought-triggered stomatal closure affects VOC emission and plant-trophic interactions by combining RNAi silencing, molecular biological and chemical analyses (GC-MS) of a potato-tuber moth-egg parasitoid tritrophic system. Drought stress attenuated stomatal apertures and VOC emissions, which made the potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) plants more attractive to the herbivore but less attractive to the parasitoid. Stomatal aperture manipulations through StSLAC1 gene knockdown and chemical treatments (ABA and 5-aminolevulinic acid) consistently affected drought-triggered VOC emissions and plant-herbivore-parasitoid interactions, supporting aperture-dependent VOC emission. RNA-Seq analysis revealed that drought stress did not transcriptionally inhibit VOC biosynthesis. Collectively, our findings are consistent with the stomatal regulation of plant-insect interactions through the modulation of VOC emissions under drought stress. This highlights the intricate interplay between stomatal dynamics, VOC emission and plant-insect interactions.

Leveraging a unique sheep model of developmental programming, we conducted an exploratory analysis of the programming effects of BPA on the endocrine pancreas. Pregnant ewes were administered environmentally relevant doses of BPA during gestational days (GD) 30-90, and pancreata from female fetuses and adult offspring were analyzed. Prenatal BPA exposure induced a trend toward decreased islet insulin staining and beta-cell count, increased glucagon staining and alpha-cell count, and increased alpha-cell/beta-cell ratio. Findings were most consistent in fetal pancreata assessed at GD90 and in adult offspring exposed to the lowest BPA dose. While not assessed in fetuses, adult islet fibrosis was increased. Collectively, these data provide further evidence that early-life BPA exposure is a likely threat to human metabolic health. Future studies should corroborate these findings and decipher the molecular mechanisms of BPA's developmental endocrine toxicity.

AB  - Antithrombin III is an important anticoagulant factor with anti-inflammatory properties. However, few studies have explored its anti-inflammatory actions in ATIII overexpressed transgenic animals. In this study, the dairy goats with mammary overexpression of ATIII were used to investigate their general health, milk quality and particularly their response to inflammatory challenge. The results showed that transgenic goats have a normal phenotype regarding their physiological and biochemical parameters, including whole blood cells, serum protein levels, total cholesterol, urea nitrogen, uric acid, and total bilirubin, compared to the WT. In addition, the quality of milk also improved in transgenic animals compared to the WT, as indicated by the increased milk fat and dry matter content and the reduced somatic cell numbers. Under the stimulation of an LPS injection, the transgenic goats had elevated contents of IGA, IGM and superoxide dismutase SOD, and had reduced proinflammatory cytokine release, including IL-6, TNF-alpha and IFN-beta. A 16S rDNA sequencing analysis also showed that the transgenic animals had a similar compositions of gut microbiota to the WT goats under the stimulation of LPS injections. Mammary gland ATIII overexpression in dairy goats is a safe process, and it did not jeopardize the general health of the transgenic animals; moreover, the compositions of their gut microbiota also improved with the milk quality. The LPS stimulation study suggests that the increased ATIII expression may directly or indirectly suppress the inflammatory response to increase the resistance of transgenic animals to pathogen invasion. This will be explored in future studies.

AB  - Hair, as a non-invasive biospecimen, retains metabolic deposits from sebaceous glands and capillaries, reflecting substances from the peripheral circulation, and provides valuable biochemical information linked to phenotypes, yet its application in animal disease research remains limited. This work applied ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) to compare the hair metabolomic characteristics of healthy forest musk deer (FMD, Moschus berezovskii) and those diagnosed with hemorrhagic pneumonia (HP), phytobezoar disease (PD), and abscess disease (AD). A total of 2119 metabolites were identified in the FMD hair samples, comprising 1084 metabolites in positive ion mode and 1035 metabolites in negative ion mode. Differential compounds analysis was conducted utilizing the orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) model. In comparison to the healthy control group, the HP group displayed 85 upregulated and 92 downregulated metabolites, the PD group presented 124 upregulated and 106 downregulated metabolites, and the AD group exhibited 63 upregulated and 62 downregulated metabolites. Functional annotation using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) indicated that the differential metabolites exhibited significant enrichment in pathways associated with cancer, parasitism, energy metabolism, and stress. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed that both the individual and combined panels of differential metabolites exhibited area under the curve (AUC) values exceeding 0.7, demonstrating good sample discrimination capability. This research indicates that hair metabolomics can yield diverse biochemical insights and facilitate the development of non-invasive early diagnostic techniques for diseases in captive FMD.

AB  - Simple Summary Goats with diverse economic phenotypic traits play an important role in animal husbandry. However, the genetic mechanisms underlying complex phenotypic traits are unclear in goats. Genomic studies of variations provided a lens to identify functional genes. The work aimed to search for candidate genes related to body measurements and body weight of Karachai goats based on genome-wide associations. Structural annotation of the identified genomic regions showed that they regulate the processes of transcription, cell proliferation, angiogenesis, body growth, fatty acid and lipid metabolism, nervous system development, and spermatogenesis. For further use in breeding, SNPs were selected that were significant for live weight at four and eight months. It was located in the vicinity of structural genes. An experimental PCR-RV test system was developed and tested for the genotyping of significant SNPs. Our study found a set of new DNA markers for genetic improvement in meat goats and provided novel insights into the genetic mechanisms of complex traits.Abstract Goats with diverse economic phenotypic traits play an important role in animal husbandry. However, the genetic mechanisms underlying complex phenotypic traits are unclear in goats. Genomic studies of variations provided a lens to identify functional genes. The work aimed to search for candidate genes related to body measurements and body weight of Karachai goats and develop an experimental PCR-RV test system for genotyping significant SNPs. Comparison of GWAS results for ages 4 and 8 months revealed 58 common SNPs for significant genotypes. 11 common SNPs were identified for body weight, 4 SNPs-for group of traits withers height, rump height, body length, 2 SNPs-for withers height and rump height, 1 SNP-for body length and chest depth. Structural annotation of genomic regions covering a window of +/- 0.20 Mb showed the presence of 288 genes; 52 of them had the described functions in accordance with gene ontology. The main molecular functions of proteins encoded by these genes are the regulation of transcription, cell proliferation, angiogenesis, body growth, fatty acid and lipid metabolism, nervous system development, and spermatogenesis. SNPs common to body weight and localized within a window of +/- 200 kb from the structural genes CRADD, HMGA2, MSRB3, FUT8, MAX, and RAB15 were selected to create a test system. The study of meat productivity after slaughter and chemical analysis of muscle tissue in Karachai goats at the age of 8 months of different genotypes according to the identified SNPs revealed that rs268269710 is the most promising for further research and use in breeding. The GG genotype is associated with a larger live weight of animals, a larger carcass yield, the content of the boneless part in it, and the ratio of protein and adipose tissue in meat preferred for dietary nutrition. These results will contribute to the genetic improvement of Karachai goats.

AB  - Novel transgenic (TG) pigs co-expressing three microbial enzymes, beta-glucanase, xylanase, and phytase, in their salivary glands were previously generated, which exhibited reduced phosphorus and nitrogen emissions and improved growth performances. In the present study, we attempted to explore the age-related change of the TG enzymic activity, the residual activity of the enzymes in the simulated gastrointestinal tract, and the effect of the transgenes on the digestion of nitrogen and phosphorus content in the fiber-rich, plant-based diets. Results showed that all the three enzymes were stably expressed over the growing and finishing periods in the F2 generation TG pigs. In simulated gastric juice, all the three enzymes exhibited excellent gastrointestinal environment adaptability. The apparent total tract digestibility of phosphorus was increased by 69.05% and 499.64%, while fecal phosphate outputs were decreased by 56.66% and 37.32%, in the TG pigs compared with the wild-type littermates fed with low non-starch polysaccharides diets and high fiber diets, respectively. Over half of available phosphorus and water-soluble phosphorus in fecal phosphorus were reduced. We also found the performance of phosphorus, calcium, and nitrogen retention rates were significantly improved, resulting in faster growth performance in TG pigs. The results indicate that TG pigs can effectively digest the high-fiber diets and exhibit good growth performance compared with wild type pigs.

AB  - The systemically induced production of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in undamaged tissues of plants under herbivore attack is still not fully understood, particularly with respect to below- and aboveground signaling. Here, we test the hypotheses that treatment of trees with jasmonic acid (JA) to simulate local herbivory (i) systemically induces VOC emissions in leaves and roots by signal propagation via the vascular bundle system and (ii) that bidirectional signaling occurs between below- and aboveground organs. We applied JA to roots and branches of Fagus sylvatica and Picea abies in a controlled experiment and shielded untreated tissues from volatile cues. VOC emissions and gas exchange were measured continuously over 6-8 days and complemented by quantification of tissue terpenoid storage pools. In contrast to the strong increase in terpenoid emissions from directly treated leaves and needles, which were mainly composed of sesquiterpenes, no systemically induced terpenoid emissions were found. Direct JA treatment of shoots reduced net photosynthesis and stomatal conductance in P. abies by similar to 50%, while the gas exchange of F. sylvatica remained unaffected. In the root system of P. abies, terpenoid contents increased both locally and systemically in response to belowground JA treatment. Overall, our results challenge the concept of systemically induced terpenoid emissions through vascular JA signaling, which is commonly induced in trees in response to insect herbivory. Instead, our data point toward a possible role of volatile cues in intra-plant signaling.

AB  - Exosomes have shown good potential for alleviating neurological deficits and delaying memory deterioration, but the neuroprotective effects of exosomes remain unknown. Methylmalonic acidemia is a metabolic disorder characterized by the accumulation of methylmalonic acid (MMA) in various tissues that inhibits neuronal survival and function, leading to accelerated neurological deterioration. Effective therapies to mitigate these symptoms are lacking. The purpose of this study was to explore the neuroprotective effects of plasma exosomes on cells and a mouse model of MMA-induced injury. We evaluated the ability of plasma exosomes to reduce the neuronal apoptosis, cross the blood-brain barrier, and affect various parameters related to neuronal function. MMA promoted cell apoptosis, disrupted the metabolic balance, and altered the expression of B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), Bcl2-associated X (Bax), and synaptophysin-1 (Syp-1), and these changes may be involved in MMA-induced neuronal apoptosis. Additionally, plasma exosomes normalized learning and memory and protected against MMA-induced neuronal apoptosis. Our findings indicate that neurological deficits are linked to the pathogenesis of methylmalonic acidemia, and healthy plasma exosomes may exert neuroprotective and therapeutic effects by altering the expression of exosomal microRNAs, facilitating neuronal functional recovery in the context of this inherited metabolic disease. Intravenous plasma-derived exosome treatment may be a novel clinical therapeutic strategy for methylmalonic acidemia.

AB  - Whenever resources are limited and indivisible, fighting will evolve as a means to resolve ownership. Among such resources are mates, and individuals (usually males) of many species compete agonistically with rivals in order to gain access to potential mates. However, securing access is not necessarily enough to guarantee a mating or, if a mating is obtained, to guarantee that it is effective for securing reproductive success. Thus, in addition to fighting, individuals participate in a wealth of behaviours to maximize their reproductive success, from courtship to sperm competition to mate guarding. In recent years, the striking parallels between fighting and mating behaviour have become a subject of discussion. In particular, insights have been drawn from the predictions of contest theory to help us understand the use of repetitive signalling in courtship. Here, we take this discussion further, highlighting similarities between fighting and mating in the use of dynamic repeated behaviours, which function to (1) advertise quality and (2) convince or coerce an individual to relinquish the contested resource (gametes in terms of mating). We focus specifically on a performance trait of emerging interest in the field of animal contests, skill. We identify behaviours used throughout the mating process in which skill is likely to be of importance for securing success, and highlight key questions for future study.

AB  - This study explored the neuroprotective effect of the peptide LYLKPR derived from fermented yak milk by Lactiplantibacillus plantarum JLAU103 on H2O2-injured HT-22 cells. Peptide LYLKPR showed good stability in the simulated gastrointestinal tract and strong penetrating ability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in vitro. LYLKPR could activate the Nrf2/Keap-1/HO-1 pathway, increase the activities of SOD and CAT, and reduce the levels of ROS and MDA in HT-22 cells. In addition, LYLKPR controlled the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by inhibiting the oxidative stress, ultimately preventing the cleavage of pro-IL-18 and pro-IL-1 beta by caspase-1, and reducing the level of intracellular mature IL-18 by 29.08%. Based on the molecular docking verification, LYLKPR could effectively bind to the Keap-1 protein, and directly inhibit the inflammasome to significantly increase intracellular BDNF, synaptophysin, and PSD95, and protect synaptic function. Collectively, LYLKPR ameliorated oxidative stress-mediated neuronal injury by inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome via modulation of the Nrf2/Keap-1/HO-1 pathway.

AB  - Global warming is predicted to change the growth conditions for plants and crops in regions at high latitudes (>60 degrees N), including the Arctic. This will be accompanied by alterations in the composition of natural plant and pest communities, as herbivorous arthropods will invade these regions as well. Interactions between previously non-overlapping species may occur and cause new challenges to herbivore attack. However, plants growing at high latitudes experience less herbivory compared to plants grown at lower latitudes. We hypothesize that this finding is due to a gradient of constitutive chemical defense towards the Northern regions. We further hypothesize that higher level of defensive compounds is mediated by higher level of the defense-related phytohormone jasmonate. Because its biosynthesis is light dependent, Arctic summer day light conditions can promote jasmonate accumulation and, hence, downstream physiological responses. A pilot study with bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) plants grown under different light regimes supports the hypothesis.

AB  - Folpet, a fungicide, is utilized even in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. The LD50 of folpet in mammals, birds, and fish is relatively high. Recently, several negative effects of folpet on the respiratory system and cornea have been reported. However, there is no study on the negative effects of folpet on maternal-fetus interactions. In the present study, we used porcine trophectoderm (pTr) cells and porcine luminal epithelial (pLE) cells to investigate the toxic effects of folpet during implantation. Folpet treatment decreased cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis with cell cycle arrest. In addition, the ERK, JNK, and AKT signal pathways were activated by folpet treatment. Folpet treatment induced calcium overload in pTr and pLE cells mediating antimigratory and antiadhesive effects in both cell lines. Co-treatment with calcium chelates decreased the anti-implantation effect of folpet. Overall, our results demonstrated potential reproductive toxicity of folpet in pig.

AB  - Aim of study: To investigate the influence of environmental conditions and feed forms on productivity and feeding behavior of growing -finishing pigs. Area of study: Farm located in the North-East of Spain (42 degrees 03'11.0"N 2 degrees 06'59.5"E). Material and methods: Two trials were conducted (n = 72 pigs each). In the Hot-Temperate/Pelleted trial (HT -P), pigs were half the time under hot conditions (average temperature Ta=28.1 degrees C) and half the time under thermoneutral conditions (Ta=25.5 degrees C) and were fed in pellet. In the Temperate-Hot/Mash trial (TH-M), pigs were half the time under thermoneutral conditions (Ta=23.5 degrees C) and half the time under hot conditions (Ta=27.3 degrees C) and were fed in mash. Productivity and feeding behavior were registered. Main results: Hot conditions during the finishing period in TH-M trial reduced by 118 g/d growth rate and increased feed conversion ratio (2.28 vs. 2.07 kg/kg) compared to HT -P trial (p < 0.001) due to feed intake reduction. Growing pigs under hot conditions and fed in pellet increased total feeder visits (12.8 vs. 7.9 visits/d) and reduced visit size (147 vs. 230 g/visit, p < 0.001); whereas finishing pigs under hot conditions and fed in mash only tended to reduce visit size (308 vs. 332 g/visit, p = 0.08). Pigs fed with mash ate slower (22.8 vs. 34.8 g/min) than pelleted-fed pigs (p < 0.001), independently of environmental conditions. Research highlights: Feed form and environmental conditions affect both feeding behavior and performance of growing-finishing pigs. Unfortunately, due to a design weakness, it was not possible to obtain the sharp effect of both factors.

AB  - This study compared the performance, meat quality and adipose tissue characteristics of Kr & scaron;kopolje pigs and modern hybrid pigs under identical rearing conditions, besides examining the effects of dietary protein reduction in both genotypes. A total of 29 pigs (14 Kr & scaron;kopolje and 15 hybrids) were assigned to litter into two dietary groups (high and low protein). The low-protein diet for hybrid pigs corresponded to the high-protein diet for Kr & scaron;kopolje pigs. All diets were iso-energetic. Dietary protein reduction decreased growth rate and muscle development in modern hybrids but had no significant impact on performance, quality or metabolic traits in Kr & scaron;kopolje pigs. Genotype differences revealed that Kr & scaron;kopolje pigs had lower growth rates, less lean and more fat deposition, as reflected in thicker subcutaneous and higher intramuscular fat compared to modern hybrids. Kr & scaron;kopolje pigs also exhibited higher myoglobin concentration and fatty acid saturation. Lipogenic enzyme activity and histo-morphological traits behaved in a tissue-specific manner but still indicated a greater lipogenic potential in Kr & scaron;kopolje pigs. This study provides valuable insights into breed-specific responses to dietary changes and highlights the unique characteristics of Kr & scaron;kopolje pigs.

AB  - Citrus fruits are among the commercial fruits most consumed and most affected by fungal rot during storage. Chemical management of fungal diseases poses numerous health and environmental concerns. Biological control using plant extracts has been considered a safe, eco-friendly, and sustainable management practice. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of Alhagi maurorum extract and pesticide (carbendazim) on fungal pathogens. Fungal pathogens were isolated from infected fruits and identified based on morphological characteristics. These isolates were tested for their pathogenicity in citrus fruits. The antifun- gal activity of these preparations was performed using diffusion assay. Morphological characters identified these isolates as Penicillium digitatum, Penicillium italicum, and Alternaria sp. These isolates produced characteristic infections in citrus fruits. All the preparations, A. maurorum extract, carbendazim, and a combination of these two exhibited antifungal activity against P. digitatum, Penicillium italicum, and Alternaria sp. However, the combination of A. maurorum essence and carbendazim produced pronounced effects (50 % more) against fungal pathogens. The results showed that the combined effect of Alhagi maurorum essence and extract with carbendazim effectively controls fungal pathogens infection of orange and tangerine during storage.

   Some natural phytogenic feed additives, which contain several active compounds, have been shown to be effective alternatives to traditional antibiotics. Gelsemium elegans (G. elegans) has been used as a traditional Chinese herbal medicine for many years, and it has an obvious growth-promoting effect on animals such as pigs. To our knowledge, the internal mechanism of the influence of G. elegans on the animal body is still unclear. Here, the plasma metabolomics and liver transcriptional profile of crude extract of G. elegans in pigs were reported for the first time and the metabolic consequences of feeding piglets G. elegans for 45 days were evaluated. The results showed that the addition of 2% G. elegans powder to feed is nontoxic to pigs. In addition, G. elegans could be used as a phytogenic feed additive, which could improve the immune function of piglets, and the latent mechanism of G. elegans may be related to various signaling pathways, including the MAPK signaling pathway and PPAR signaling pathway. Collectively, results of the current provide a clearer understanding of the molecular mechanism of the pharmacological effects of G. elegans, which is of great significance for a safer and more rational application of this phytogenic feed additives.
   Some naturalphytogenic feed additives, which contain several active compounds, have been shown to be effective alternatives to traditional antibiotics. Gelsemium elegans (G. elegans) is a whole grass in the family Loganiaceae. It is a known toxic plant widely distributed in China and has been used as a traditional Chinese herbal medicine for many years to treat neuropathic pain, rheumatoid pain, inflammation, skin ulcers, and cancer. However, G. elegans not only is nontoxic to animals such as pigs and sheep but also has an obvious growth-promoting effect. To our knowledge, the internal mechanism of the influence of G. elegans on the animal body is still unclear. The goal of this work is to evaluate the metabolic consequences of feeding piglets G. elegans for 45 days based on the combination of transcriptomics and metabolomics. According to growth measurement and evaluation, compared with piglets fed a complete diet, adding 20 g/kg G. elegans powder to the basal diet of piglets significantly reduced the feed conversion ratio. Results of the liver transcriptome suggest that glycine and cysteine-related regulatory pathways, including the MAPK signaling pathway and the mTOR signaling pathway, were extensively altered in G. elegans-induced piglets. Plasma metabolomics identified 21 and 18 differential metabolites (p < 0.05) in the plasma of piglets in the positive and negative ion modes, respectively, between G. elegans exposure and complete diet groups. The concentrations of glycine and its derivatives and N-acetylcysteine were higher in the G. elegans exposure group than in the complete diet group.This study demonstrated that G. elegans could be an alternative to antibiotics that improves the immune function of piglets, and the latent mechanism of G. elegans may be related to various signaling pathways, including the MAPK signaling pathway and the PPAR signaling pathway.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine whether a high-fat diet (HFD) fed to goats for a brief period during peri-conception would optimize reproductive and foetal responses. Thirty-four Anglo-Nubian crossbred adult goats were allocated into three groups: control (n = 11), fed with a total mixed ration (TMR) based on chopped elephant grass and concentrate; HFBM (n = 11), given TMR supplemented with soybean oil on a 0.5% dry matter basis for 11 days starting nine days before mating (BM); and HFAM (n = 12), fed with soybean oil included in the TMR for 15 days after mating (AM). The TMR diets differed in their fat content (7.5% vs. 2.9%). All goats had oestrus synchronized for 14 days BM by intravaginal administration of 60 mg MPA sponge for 12 days. Forty-eight hours BM, the sponge was removed and 0.075 mg PGF2 alpha was applied intramuscularly. After 36 h, 1 ml GnRH was administered intramuscularly, and goats were mated after sponge removal. The fat groups showed lower feed intake (p < .001) and higher cholesterol levels (p < .001) when HFD was administered. Doppler and B-mode ultrasound evaluations revealed a greater (p < .05) number of small (<3 mm, 10 +/- 0.6 vs. 8 +/- 0.5) and large (>= 3 mm, 6 +/- 0.4 vs. 5.0 +/- 0.2) follicles and intraovarian blood area (p < .05) in the HFBM group during sponge removal (57.6%) and mating (24.2%) than those of the no-fat group. During AM, the fat-fed groups exhibited higher glutathione peroxidase levels (p < .05) and a reduction (p < .001) in corpus luteum size (19%) and vascularized Doppler area (41%). No difference (p > .05) between groups was found in foetal traits, placentome and umbilical vascular development, except for the embryonic vesicle where HFAM twin pregnancy showed a smaller size than the control (26.1 +/- 3.5 cm vs. 33.7 +/- 2.7 cm; p < .01). Thus, HFD applied during peri-conception of goats has no impact on later foetal development but improved the follicular growth when given before the mating. Thus, the use of HFD in periconception has no impact on foetal development but increases follicular growth before breeding time.

AB  - Dermatophytosis is a superficial fungal infection that affects humans and is very common in small animals. The treatment using the most commonly used antifungals is failing, and new therapeutic alternatives are required to combat the resistance of these fungal infections. Previous studies by the group have shown that clioquinol is an important therapeutic alternative in the treatment of dermatophytosis. The object was to conduct studies of antidermatophytic activity and the irritant potential from the double and triple combinations of clioquinol, terbinafine and ciclopirox in ex vivo and in vivo alternative models. To evaluate the irritant potential of antifungal combinations, the alternative HET-CAM method (chicken egg test chorioallantoic membrane) was used. Ex vivo models were used to assess the effectiveness of antifungal combinations, using pig hooves and veterinary fur. Any possible tissue damage was to assess through in histopathology of swine ears. HET-CAM results showed that all combinations can be classified as non-irritating, corroborated by the results of the histopathological evaluation of the pig's ear skin. Only the double combinations managed to remove 100% of the colony-forming units (CFU) formed on the pig's hooves. The clioquinol + terbinafine combination and the triple combination were more effective than clioquinol + ciclopirox in eradicating the preformed biofilm in fur of veterinary origin. These results show the potential of formulations of clioquinol in combination with antifungals for use in humans and in the veterinary field to combat dermatophytosis, as an important alternative therapy, for use in the near future.

AB  - Trace fossils of insect herbivory are an important tool, which provide evidence for palaeoecological and palaeoclimatic interpretations, as well as being a unique and direct record of the plant-insect interactions in the geologic past. In the Iberian Peninsula, these types of surveys have been scarce and purely descriptive. The La Val fossil site is an interesting, new megaflora assemblage from the Late Oligocene of Spain, which encompasses numerous plant-insect interactions and their palaeoclimatic and palaeoecological implications. A total of 1337 fossil specimens from 13 stratigraphic levels were analyzed for this study. We identified 28 different types of plant-insect interactions belonging to seven Functional Feeding Groups (FFGs). Hole feeding was the most common category of external-feeding insect damage, followed by margin feeding, skeletonization, and surface feeding. Among the internal-feeding FFGs, galling was the richest and most abundant FFG. All other internal feeding FFGs were relatively uncommon: piercing/sucking, and incertae sedis (DT114). Among stratigraphic levels, the mean herbivory frequency was significantly greater at lower levels compared to the upper levels. La Val presents a marked drop in the diversity of plant-insect interactions through time, possibly due to changes in temperature or humidity levels. A marked decrease in galling diversity and a generalized decrease in interactions are observed at the youngest levels. This could be related to an increase in humidity though time in the La Val palaeoforest, since modern xeric environments favour the proliferation of galls.

AB  - Simple Summary The fetal growth pattern in twin pregnancies is usually affected by the sex of the co-twin pairs, among other factors, with females being lighter than males at birth. We aimed to determine the effect of the sex of co-twins on lambs' birth weight in ovine pregnancies developed under natural undernourishment, a condition of sheep farming frequently encountered worldwide. Additionally, we sought to investigate whether the nutritional and/or antioxidant supplementation provided to ewes during pregnancy could modulate the potential effects associated with the sex of co-twins. We found that maternal nutrient restriction abolishes the sex differences in body weight at birth between co-twins. However, improving maternal nutrition and supplementation with antioxidants during gestation not only improves maternal weight and body condition but also tends to restore birth weight and its differences between female and male offspring, an effect that is enhanced with the combined supplementation of concentrated food and antioxidants. These results suggest that undernutrition not only may alter the intrauterine growth through the maternal-fetal relationship, but also through the feto-fetal relationship, which can be normalized via strategically targeting interventions such as maternal nutrient supplementation or antioxidant supplementation during gestation. Thus, a better understanding of the driving factors of this effect is of major relevance to improving fetal growth and lamb survival in harsh environments.Abstract In twin pregnancies of discordant sex, the male fetus grows larger than the female co-twin. Our study aimed to determine the effect of the sex of co-twins on lambs' birth weight in ovine pregnancies developed under natural undernourishment. Additionally, we investigated whether the nutritional and/or antioxidant supplementation provided to ewes during pregnancy could modulate the potential effects associated with the sex of co-twins. Ninety-six birth records of twin pregnancies of sheep grazing the natural Patagonian prairies were analyzed. The animals were divided into four groups: control (no supplementation), N (concentrate supplementation, 100% NRC), A (antioxidant supplementation), and NA (concentrate + antioxidant supplementation). Supplementation occurred from day 35 of gestation onwards until lambing. There were no differences in female or male birth weight in the control undernourished group. However, in group N, females or males with sex-discordant co-twins had a higher birth weight than did those with co-twins of the same sex. Group A males with female co-twins had a higher birth weight compared to males whose co-twins were also males. In NA lambs, males had a higher birth weight compared to females, regardless of their co-twin's sex. Therefore, chronic undernutrition abolished the differences in birth weight due to fetal sex. Restoring maternal nutrition or antioxidant supplementation tends to normalize birth weight and restore the differences between females and males. This effect is enhanced with the combined supplementation of concentrated food and antioxidants.

AB  - Typical amnestic treatments are ineffective when administered to subjects trained in aversively-motivated tasks using relatively high foot-shock intensities. This effect has been found when treatments that disrupt neuronal activity are administered to different regions of the brain, including the amygdala. However, the molecular mechanisms induced by this intense training are unknown. We made a detailed mapping of c-Fos-expressing neurons in four regions of the amygdala after moderate and intense one-trial inhibitory avoidance training. Rats were sacrificed 90 min after training or after appropriate control procedures, and their brains were prepared for immunohistochemical c-Fos protein detection in the central, lateral, and in the anterior and posterior parts of the basolateral amygdaloid nucleus. We found a high percentage of neurons expressing c-Fos in the anterior part of the basolateral nucleus after moderate training, and this percentage increased further after intense training. Moderate and intense training did not induce changes in c-Fos expression in the other explored amygdaloid regions. These results show that inhibitory avoidance training produces a localized expression of c-Fos in the basolateral anterior nucleus of the amygdala, which is dependent upon the intensity of training, and indicate that synaptic plastic changes in this region may be required for the formation of memory of moderate and intense aversive learning.

AB  - Substitution with black soldier fly larvae meal (BLM, Hermetia illucens L.) has been studied as a possible means of replacing expensive protein sources such as soybean meal and fish meal. However, availability of BLM can differ depending on the substrate and its processing. We investigated the effect of supplementation with defatted and hydrolyzed BLM as an alternative to fish meal in weaning pigs. We found that supplementation with defatted BLM improved nutrient digestibility, growth performance, and economic returns when compared with fish meal (FM) in weaning pigs. In Experiment 1, a total of eighteen crossbred ([Landrace x Yorkshire] x Duroc) barrows with an initial body weight of 6.74 +/- 0.68 kg were randomly divided into three dietary treatments (one pig per cage and six replicates per treatment) and housed in metabolic cages that were equipped with a feeder and slatted floor to collect urine and feces. In Experiment 2, a total of 96 crossbred ([Landrace x Yorkshire] x Duroc) barrows with an initial body weight of 8.25 +/- 0.42 kg were used in the 6-week trial. The pigs were randomly divided into three dietary treatments (three pigs per pen and eight replicates per treatment). In Experiment 1, nutrient composition of defatted black soldier fly larvae meal (BLM) was superior to that of hydrolyzed BLM but lower than that of fish meal (FM). Also, defatted BLM and FM had better apparent total track digestibility (ATTD) of crude protein (CP) and better nitrogen retention (p < 0.05) than hydrolyzed BLM, but there was no significant difference (p > 0.05) between defatted BLM and FM. In Experiment 2, defatted BLM improved (p < 0.05) average daily gain (ADG), feed conversion ratio (FCR), and feed cost per kg gain (FCG) compared with FM. Defatted BLM could replace soybean meal and fish meal as an alternative protein source for weaning pigs.

AB  - Solanum rostratum Dunal is an aggressive invasive weed invading many countries worldwide. Our previous study indicated differences in herbicide response between young and mature plants. In this study, we explore the functional leaf surface anatomy of S. rostratum. Leaf area surface characterisation was performed by counting stomata, stellate and glandular trichomes on upper and lower leaf sides on scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs. Total cuticular waxes were extracted and weighed in young and mature leaves. Young and mature leaves were tested for water permeability of the epidermal surfaces using the apoplastic tracer Calcofluor. S. rostratum plants were sprayed with luminous trace colour solution with and without 1% surfactant, droplet number and area were calculated. In young S. rostratum leaves, the leaf surface was densely covered with stellate trichomes on both leaf sides; however, in the mature leaf, stellate trichomes density became low, and prickle rigid increased in mature leaves. Wax amount was significantly higher in mature leaves, while number of stomata was higher in young leaves. Young leaves showed high leaf permeability, with the fluorescent dye permeating the leaf staining the vascular bundles. In young and mature leaves treated with a spraying solution with the addition of surfactant, low droplet number alongside higher coverage area was recorded. Our data highlight the notable differences in leaf epidermal structure of young versus mature plants. We conclude that differences in herbicide permeability, water loss and herbivory in young versus mature leaves of S. rostratum are governed by variation in leaf functional anatomy.

AB  - Background: Arterial hypertension is the most important risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, myocardial infarction, heart failure, renal failure and peripheral vascular disease. In the last decade, milk-derived bioactive peptides have attracted attention for their beneficial cardiovascular properties. Methods: Here, we combined in vitro chemical assay such as LC-MS/MS analysis of buffalo ice cream, ex vivo vascular studies evaluating endothelial and smooth muscle responses using pressure myograph, and translational assay testing in vivo the vascular actions of PG1 administration in murine models. Results: We demonstrate that a novel buffalo ice-cream-derived pentapeptide "QKEPM", namely PG1, is a stable peptide that can be obtained at higher concentration after gastro-intestinal digestions (GID) of buffalo ice-cream (BIC). It owns potent vascular effect in counteract the effects of angiotensin II-evoked vasoconstriction and high blood pressure levels. Its effects are mediated by the inhibitory effect on AT1 receptor leading to a downregulation of p-ERK1/2/Rac1-GTP and consequent reduction of oxidative stress. Conclusions: These results strongly candidate PG1, as a novel bioactive peptide for the prevention and management of hypertension, thus expanding the armamentarium of preventive strategies aimed at reducing the incidence and progression of hypertension and its related cardiovascular complications.

AB  - Salicylic acid (SA) is a plant hormone involved in a series of growth, development, and stress responses in plants. Nonexpressor of pathogenesis-related genes 1 (NPR1) is the core regulatory gene in the process of SA-mediated systemic acquired resistance (SAR). Whether NPR1 is involved in pollen tube growth mediated by SA and its derivative MeSA (methyl salicylate) remains to be explored. Here, we found that the contents of endogenous SA and MeSA in self- or cross-pollinated pistils changed significantly, and exogenous SA and MeSA significantly promoted pollen germination and pollen tube elongation of Camellia oleifera at lower concentrations. CoNPR1, CoNPR3.1, CoNPR3.2, and CoNPR5 were identified, and they were all located in the nucleus. A high level of consistency was observed across the phylogenetic relationships, gene structures, and functional domains, indicating a clear division of function, as observed in other species. The expression levels of CoNPR1, CoNPR3.1, CoNPR3.2, and CoNPR5 in self- and cross-pollinated pistils had certain regularity. Furthermore, they exhibited tissue-specific expression pattern. CoNPR1 and CoNPR3.1 were expressed in pollen tubes, whose expression was regulated by SA or MeSA, and their expression patterns were basically consistent with the trend of pollen germination. These results indicate that SA and MeSA are involved in the pollen tube growth of C. oleifera, and CoNPRs may play an important role therein.

AB  - Land spreading of liquid animal manure (slurry) is a major source of atmospheric emissions. Ammonia (NH3) emission is of concern, as it is one of the main contributors to ambient air pollution and nitrogen deposition. Storage and field acidification of the slurry prior to application is used to mitigate NH3 emission, but the effect of acidification on emissions of odorous non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC) has not been investigated, and there is a scarcity of data investigating the effect of field acidification. Four field experiments, two with cattle slurry and two with pig slurry, were performed. Ammonia and NMVOC emissions were measured simultaneously in a system of dynamic chambers and online measurements by cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS) and proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS). The system allowed for a high time resolution and low variation. All four experiments were performed under cold conditions (< 10? average temperature). Storage and field acidification significantly lowered the NH3 emission by 79 & PLUSMN; 18% and 30 & PLUSMN; 6% on average, respectively. The NMVOC cumulative emission increased by 202 & PLUSMN; 133% and 17 & PLUSMN; 16% on average after storage and field acidification, respectively, even if the increase was only significant for storage acidification. Storage acidification significantly increased the emissions of odour at most measuring times. The increases of cumulative NMVOC emissions and odour was primarily caused by higher emissions of volatile fatty acids.

AB  - Soil heavy metal pollution is a major abiotic stressor frequently encountered by plants in conjunction with other biotic stresses like insect herbivory. Yet, it remains largely unexplored how soil metal pollution and insect herbivory act together to influence emissions of plant volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which mediate multiple ecological functions and play crucial roles in atmospheric processes. Here, we assessed the individual and combined effects of soil cadium (Cd) pollution and insect herbivory by Clostera anachoreta on VOC emissions from the seedlings of eastern cottonwood Populus deltoides, and whether these effects depend on plant sex. We found that plant sex notably influenced VOC emission and altered blend compositions, with male seedlings emitting higher amounts of monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, homoterpenes and green leaf volatiles (GLVs) than females. Soil Cd exposure significantly increased emissions of monoterpenes, GLVs, and nitrogenous VOCs in males but not in females. Comparatively, larval feeding exerted the strongest effects on VOC emissions and their composition, albeit to varying extent between males and females, and among different VOC classes. Importantly, Cd exposure amplified herbivore-induced VOC emissions in males. For instance, under both Cd and herbivory conditions, male seedlings showed a 68.1-fold increase in nitrogenous VOC emissions, almost twice the combined effects of Cd (8.7-fold) and herbivory (26.3-fold). Taken together, these results suggest that soil metal pollution can boost herbivore-induced VOC emissions in a sex-specific manner, with potential implications for ecological interactions and atmospheric processes.

AB  - The use of organic fertilizers is becoming a routine measure of soil improvement in China, and therefore organic fertilizers are considered an emerging contributor to microplastic accumulation in farmland soils. However, little is known regarding the microplastic contents in organic fertilizers used across China. Here, we investigated the occurrence and distribution of microplastics in 102 organic fertilizer samples across 22 provincial administrative regions of China to serve as a basis for the development of better microplastic management strategies. Organic fertilizers are made of a wide variety of feedstocks, including livestock manure (chicken, cow, goat, and pig manure) and bacterial residues etc., and are mainly produced via aerobic composting. In present study, microplastics within a 0.1-5 mm range in different types of organic fertilizers were separated using a general sequential density flotation method. Microplastic abundances ranged from undetectable to 2550 items/kg, with an average value of 325 +/- 511 items/ kg and a detection frequency of 80.4 %. The highest microplastic abundances were detected in Beijing City (758 items/kg) and in compound organic fertilizers (average of 386 items/kg). The microplastics in organic fertilizer were primarily white/transparent (75.9 %), 1-3 mm in size (55 %), and film-shaped (39 %). Interestingly, microplastics were not detected in cow dung fertilizer, suggesting that cow dung-based fertilizers might generally contain lower microplastic levels. Moreover, organic fertilizer microplastics tended to be concentrated in provincial areas with intensive agriculture, and the input flux of microplastics from organic fertilizer into fertilized soils reached an average of 5.07 x 1012 items per year. Collectively, our findings provide key insights into the current state of microplastic levels in organic fertilizers in China and serve as a basis for the creation of novel microplastic mitigation strategies in farmland soils.

AB  - Limited data are available regarding the effects of Brachiaria decumbens on sheep's growth performance at different times. Therefore, this current study focused on sheep's nutrient apparent digestibility, feed efficiency, body index, and growth hormone when they are fed with low and high levels of B. decumbens diets. A total of 30 six-month -old male Dorper cross sheep were divided randomly into three treatment groups with 10 sheep per treatment. Treatment 1 (control) sheep were fed with Pennisetum purpureum and pellets as the basal diet, whereas Treatment 2 and 3 sheep were fed with feed mixed with low (10%) and high (60%) levels of B. decumbens, respectively. The study was conducted in two phases consisting of short-term feeding (seven days) and long-term feeding (90 days). Throughout the experiment, daily fecal voided were collected in the morning for seven days continuous before the end of each feeding phases for the determination of nutrient apparent digestibility. The amount of feed offered and refusals plus body weight gain were recorded daily to determine the feed efficiency (FE). Besides, the body measurements of each sheep from every treatment were measured weekly and blood samples were collected for the analysis of growth hormone (GH) concentration. There were significant differences (p < 0.05) in the nutrient apparent digestibility, growth performance, body measurement, and GH concentration among treatment sheep throughout the study period. Treatment 3 sheep fed with 60% of B. decumbens diet revealed the lowest dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and acid detergent fiber (ADF) digestibility during the long-term feeding. Likewise, Treatment 3 (T3) sheep had the lowest total bodyweight gain, average daily gain, total feed intake, and daily feed intake among treatment sheep. The heart girth index (HGI) of T3 sheep was also significantly lower during the short-term feeding. Moreover, the GH concentration of T3 sheep was significantly lower as compared to the control that decreases steadily throughout the study period. In conclusion, high levels of B. decumbens showed the most significant results out of all three treatments indicating the presence of saponins, which produce negative effects on the sheep's overall performance.

AB  - Domestic pigs are considered as one of the main intermediate hosts in the zoonotic transmission of Toxoplasma gondii in many countries. Serological and molecular studies are warranted to better understand the epidemiology and transmission patterns of this parasite worldwide. To date, seroepidemiological information on T. gondii in domestic pigs in Cuba is very scarce and there are no reports of T. gondii genotypes circulating in this country. Here, we aimed to estimate the seroprevalence of T. gondii and provide genetic characterization of the strains circulating in slaughtered pigs intended for human consumption in Central Cuba. Seroprevalence was determined in 450 serum samples from slaughtered pigs in Villa Clara province using ELISA. Anti-Toxoplasma gondii IgG antibodies were detected in 100 animals (22.2%, 95% CI: 18.5-26.2). Conventional PCR of the 529-bp marker of T. gondii was performed in hearts and diaphragm tissues of all ELISA-seropositive pigs. Toxoplasma gondii DNA was detected in four animals. Further genetic characterization of the positive DNA samples was performed by multilocus PCR-RFLP and PCR-sequencing typing tools. Molecular analysis revealed four different genetic profiles that were combinations of type I, II, III and u-1 alleles, suggesting the circulation of non-clonal genotypes of T. gondii in domestic pigs in Cuba. Our results indicate that T. gondii is widely distributed in slaughtered pigs in this country, which might have important implications for public health. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on genetic characterization of T. gondii in Cuba. Although preliminary, the results suggest a high genetic diversity of T. gondii in the study region. Further studies based on parasite isolation are needed to definitively identify the genotypes circulating and characterize the virulence of strains detected in pigs in Cuba, and to assess the risk of zoonotic transmission from pork products in this country.

AB  - Soil pollution by metals and metalloids as a consequence of anthropogenic industrialisation exerts a seriously damaging impact on ecosystems. However, certain plant species, termed hyperaccumulators, are able to accumulate extraordinarily high concentrations of these metal(loid)s in their aboveground tissues. Such hyperaccumulation of metal(loid)s is known to act as a defence against various antagonists, such as herbivores and pathogens. We investigated the influences of metal(loid)s on potential defence traits, such as foliar elemental, organic and mechanical defences, in the hyperaccumulator plant species Arabidopsis halleri (Brassicaceae) by artificially amending the soil with common metallic pollutants, namely cadmium (Cd) and zinc (Zn). Additionally, unamended and metal-amended soils were supplemented with the metalloid silicon (Si) to study whether Si could alleviate metal excess. Individuals originating from one non-/low- and two moderately to highly metal-contaminated sites with different metal concentrations (hereafter called accessions) were grown for eight weeks in a full-factorial design under standardised conditions. There were significant interactive effects of metal amendment and Si supplementation on foliar concentrations of certain elements (Zn, Si, aluminium (Al), iron (Fe), potassium (K) and sulfur (S), but these were accession-specific. Profiles of glucosinolates, characteristic organic defences of Brassicaceae, were distinct among accessions, and the composition was affected by soil metal amendment. Moreover, plants grown on metal-amended soil contained lower concentrations of total glucosinolates in one of the accessions, which suggests a potential trade-off between inorganic defence acquisition and biosynthesis of organic defence. The density of foliar trichomes, as a proxy for the first layer of mechanical defence, was also influenced by metal amendment and/or Si supplementation in an accession-dependent manner. Our study highlights the importance of examining the effects of co-occurring metal(loid)s in soil on various foliar defence traits in different accessions of a hyperaccumulating species.

AB  - Simple Summary A native, widely spread beetle, Oryctes rhinoceros, in Southeast Asia may clean up some of the persistent organic pollutants (POPs) for us if guarded in a controlled manner. Some xenobiotics persisting in our environment may cause harmful effects to the living creatures within their food web via a so-called "bioaccumulation effect". The encounter of wild creatures with the POPs appears inevitable. Luckily, this study revealed that the proper breeding of the commonly seen beetle could degrade more than 95% of some studied POPs simply by ingestion. The beetle larvae tolerated different POPs at various extents, yet through an acclimation operation, the beetle's mortality rate could be greatly reduced. Even though O. rhinoceros is considered a pest for some valuable corps, its removal of POPs in a natural, efficient and passive (i.e., fewer energy inputs) manner makes this alternative promising and deserving of further explorations. The potential use of invertebrates as bioreactors to treat environmental pollutants is promising and of great interest. Three types of the persistent organic pollutants (POPs), namely pentachlorophenol (PCP), PAHs (naphthalene and phenanthrene) and dieldrin (DLN), were spiked in soil and treated by using Oryctes rhinoceros larvae, a known pest of coconut trees in southeast Asia, and also the indicators of POP toxicity and the fate and degradability of the ingested POPs were assessed. The larvae were tested at various levels of the POPs and went through an acclimation process. Without acclimation, the tolerance limits of the larvae toward PCP, PAHs and DLN were 200, 100 and 0.1 mg/kg-soil, respectively, yet with acclimation, the tolerance levels increased to 800, 400 and 0.5 mg/kg-soil, respectively. Biodegradation rates of all the tested POPs were >90% by week 2, with <5% and nearly 0% remaining in the feces and body of the larvae, respectively. The results suggest that the use of the beetle larvae in soil POP decontamination is doable.

AB  - Infertility affects a significant percentage of couples worldwide, and male factors contribute significantly to this problem. Traditional assessments of male fertility rely primarily on parameters such as sperm motility, morphology, viability, and concentration. However, these metrics often do not provide a comprehensive understanding of sperm function, which is critical not only for fertilization but also for successful embryo development. Herein, we used porcine spermatozoa as a model to investigate the potential of sperm RNA markers in assessing various aspects of sperm function from motility to fertility. Using artificial insemination, we evaluated male fertility based on the litter size of sows inseminated with sperm from 20 boars. In addition, we measured parameters such as weaning rate, death births, live births, and mummy births. Sperm functional parameters, including motility and kinematics, were assessed before and after in vitro capacitation. Finally, correlations between various sperm functional parameters and sperm RNA markers were explored. Our results revealed interesting relationships between sperm functional parameters. While motility and kinematics were correlated, they were not correlated with sperm capacitation status. Surprisingly, no significant correlations were found between these parameters and male fertility. However, specific parameters of sperm capacitation status after in vitro capacitation were correlated with weaning rate and live births, highlighting their importance in predicting successful fertilization. Further analysis of sperm RNA markers identified genes related to male fertility, including IZUMO1, known for its role in sperm-egg fusion. These genes showed correlations with motility, capacitation, and fertilization parameters, shedding light on their potential roles in sperm function. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that sperm RNA markers hold promise for the diagnosis and prognosis of various aspects of sperm function, providing valuable insights into male infertility. These markers may serve as diagnostic tools to improve our understanding of male fertility problems, ultimately benefiting couples struggling with infertility.

AB  - Background: The sacha inchi plant contains nutrients that are beneficial for health, cosmetics, and food products, so it has the potential to be developed economically. The development of sacha inchi involves agricultural technology, which includes the treatment of fertilizer types that need to be studied in maintaining production and productivity. Objectives: This study aims to analyze the optimal type of fertilizer treatment on crop yields and the influence of farmers' perceptions of socio-economic factors in the development of sacha inchi plants so that an optimal sacha inchi development prediction model is formed. Methods: The partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) method was applied in the study to analyze the effect of perception of socio-economic factors, and the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) method was applied to predict the optimal fertilizer treatment model. Findings: The results of the PLS-SEM analysis showed that farmers' perceptions of sacha inchi cultivation considered economic factors at a percentage of 50.66% and social factors at a percentage of 49.33% and had a linear relationship with the economic development of sacha inchi with a value of 0.832, although simultaneously, 77.7% was influenced by economic factors and social factors, and 22.3% was influenced outside these two factors. The ANFIS prediction results reinforced the results of the analysis, which stated that fertilizer treatment based on sacha inchi plant waste in the form of seed shells produced greater harvest weight compared with goat manure fertilizer. If farmers wanted to use a combination fertilizer, the used composition was 80% sacha inchi seed shell waste and 20% goat manure fertilizer or other materials; if the used composition was otherwise, the yield tended to decrease. This research contributes to the theory of production sustainability by integrating the optimal fertilization factor as a decision support unit in the model. Practically, this study recommends the application of fertilizer from the basic ingredients of sacha inchi seed shells to create a sustainable sacha inchi processing industry that ensures production stability, strengthens the agribusiness ecosystem, and develops the economic potential of sacha inchi and reduces the operational costs of sacha inchi farming by reducing the cost of purchasing fertilizer and supporting the circular economy model.

AB  - BACKGROUND Pesticide residues in animal feed can endanger animal health and compromise the safety of livestock products for human consumption. Even though policymakers such as the European Union and the World Health Organization have established maximum residue levels (MRLs) for pesticides in both human food and animal feed, there is no systematic management of pesticides in animal feed that considers the entire supply chain. In response, we propose a framework for defining consistent MRLs for pesticides in animal feed that assesses the impact of defined MRLs on upstream (e.g., MRLs in feed crops) and downstream (e.g., MRLs in livestock products) sectors of the livestock-product supply chain. RESULTS The MRLs determined for the selected pesticides in the feed of cattle and sheep as case study animals indicate that lipophilic pesticides tend to have lower MRLs than hydrophilic pesticides, primarily due to the relatively high toxicity and biotransfer factors of lipophilic pesticides. In addition, we observe that, primarily for lipophilic pesticides, upstream and downstream regulations are not aligned in terms of defining MRLs in feed using current MRLs in crops with relevance to feed and foods of animal origin. CONCLUSION Some of the current pesticide regulations in the livestock-product supply chain need to be re-evaluated to ensure that MRLs in the upstream sector (i.e., crops) do not result in unacceptable residues in the downstream sector (i.e., MRLs in livestock products affecting animal and human health). Finally, we provide recommendations for optimizing the derivation of MRLs in feed, including the evaluation of residue fate during feed and food manufacturing processes. (c) 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Introduction: Heavy metals can affect the content of secondary metabolites in plants, which are one of the important defenses of plants against herbivores. However, studies on the effects of heavy metals on secondary metabolites of invasive plants are scarce. Phytolacca americana is an invasive plant in China, which can hyperaccumulate the heavy metal Mn. Methods: This study used two Mn treatments (control and treatment group) and four species from Phytolacca (including the native and introduced populations of P. americana, its native and exotic congeners in China) to investigate the impact of heavy metal Mn on the invasive ability of P. americana. Results: The results show that heavy metal Mn can enhance the inhibitory effect of the introduced populations of P. americana on the growth of herbivore (the weight of herbivore has decreased by 66%), and altered the feeding preferences of herbivore. We also found that heavy metal Mn can significantly increase the content of quantitative resistance in the leaves of the introduced populations of P. americana and is higher than its native populations, native and exotic congeners. In addition, heavy metal Mn caused the quantitative resistance of the exotic congener significantly higher than that of the native congeners. Discussion: In summary, the heavy metal Mn can increase the content of secondary metabolites in leaves to enhance the interspecific competitive advantage of P. americana and promote its invasion, and also increase the invasion risk of exotic species.

AB  - Little is known about how zoonotic virus infections manifest in wildlife reservoirs. However, a common health consequence of enteric virus infections is gastrointestinal diseases following a shift in gut microbial composition. The sub-Saharan hipposiderid bat complex has recently emerged to host at least three coronaviruses (CoVs), with Hipposideros caffer D appearing particularly susceptible to Hibecovirus CoV-2B infection. In this study, we complement body condition and infection status data with information about the gut microbial community to understand the health impact of CoV infections in a wild bat population. Of the three CoVs, only infections with the distantly SARS-related Hibecovirus CoV-2B were associated with lower body condition and altered the gut microbial diversity and composition. The gut microbial community of infected bats became progressively less diverse and more dissimilar with infection intensity, arguing for dysbiosis as per the Anna Karenina principle. Putatively beneficial bacteria, such as Alistipes and Christensenella, decreased with infection intensity, while potentially pathogenic bacteria, namely Mycoplasma and Staphylococcus, increased. Infections with enterically replicating viruses may therefore cause changes in body condition and gut dysbiosis with potential negative health consequences even in virus reservoirs. We argue that high-resolution data on multiple health markers, ideally including microbiome information, will provide a more nuanced picture of bat disease ecology.

AB  - Simple Summary Dietary probiotic strategies that benefit animal performance by producing antibacterial substances in the intestine, competing with harmful gut flora, and stimulating the immune system should be developed. Thus, this study examined optimum levels of growing-finishing pigs using a mixture of microbial additives producing antimicrobial substances and digestive enzymes to improve growth performance, blood metabolites, fecal microflora, and carcass characteristics. Three treatments were used: 0, 0.5, and 1.0% microbial additives in the basal diet, which led to a higher average daily gain and feed efficiency in growing-finishing pigs but not in the initial and final weights. Supplementation of pig diets with microbial additives has been demonstrated to be an effective strategy for improving the conent of immunoglobulin G (IgG) as a blood metabolite, increasing fecal lactic acid bacteria count, and reducing Escherichia coli (E. coli) count in pig manure. However, the use of microbial additives to improve carcass characteristics has been questioned due to their lack of influence on pigs. Consequently, 1.0% microbial additive could be optimal for growing-finishing pigs to improve growth performance, IgG content, and the fecal microflora environment.Abstract This study aimed to assess the effects of microbial additives that produce antimicrobial and digestive enzymes on the growth performance, blood metabolites, fecal microflora, and carcass characteristics of growing-finishing pigs. A total of 180 growing-finishing pigs (Landrace x Yorkshire x Duroc; mixed sex; 14 weeks of age; 58.0 +/- 1.00 kg) were then assigned to one of three groups with three repetitions (20 pigs) per treatment for 60 days of adaptation and 7 days of collection. Dietary treatments included 0, 0.5, and 1.0% microbial additives in the basal diet. For growth performance, no significant differences in the initial and final weights were observed among the dietary microbial additive treatments, except for the average daily feed intake, average daily gain, and feed efficiency. In terms of blood metabolites and fecal microflora, immunoglobulin G (IgG), blood urea nitrogen, blood glucose, and fecal lactic acid bacteria count increased linearly, and fecal E. coli counts decreased linearly with increasing levels of microbial additives but not growth hormones and Salmonella. Carcass quality grade was improved by the microbial additive. In addition, carcass characteristics were not influenced by dietary microbial additives. In conclusion, dietary supplementation with 1.0% microbial additive improved average daily gain, feed efficiency, IgG content, and fecal microflora in growing-finishing pigs.

AB  - Simple Summary Different compounds with potential phytogenic activity are being studied in the feeding of monogastrics and ruminants. The present study evaluated the effect of ferulic acid (FA) dietary supplementation on the growth performance, carcass quality and histochemical characteristics of the Longissimus thoracis muscle from finishing pigs. The growth performance, carcass quality, histomorphometric characteristics, and histochemical characteristics of skeletal muscle were affected by FA supplementation. The addition of FA on diet improved average daily gain, 12th rib fat depth and Longissimus muscle area in the same way as ractopamine treatment. Histochemical analysis indicated that FA treatment induces a shift in muscle fiber, a lower cross-sectional area, and a greater number of muscle fibers per area. The findings indicate that ferulic acid supplementation without extra-lysine can replace the use of ractopamine as a growth promoter in finishing pigs. FA dietary supplementation on the growth performance, carcass traits and histochemical characteristics of the Longissimus thoracis muscle from finishing pigs was investigated. Four hundred and twenty pigs were used in this study, and 105 animals (with five replicate pens and 21 pigs per pen) were assigned to one of four treatments: basal diet (BD) without additives (C-); BD + 10 ppm ractopamine hydrochloride + 0.97% lysine (C+); BD + 25 ppm of FA (FA); and BD + 25 ppm of FA + 0.97% lysine (FA-Lys). Dietary supplementation with FA or ractopamine increased both the average daily gain (14%) and loin muscle area (19%), while fat deposition decreased by 53%, in comparison with C- (p < 0.05). The growth performance of pigs treated with FA was similar to those of ractopamine (p > 0.05). The histochemical analysis showed that FA and C+ treatments induced a shift in muscle fiber types: from fast fibers to intermediate (alkaline ATPase) and from oxidative to glycolytic fibers. Muscle tissues from animals treated with FA or ractopamine had a lower cross-sectional area and a greater number of muscle fibers per area (p < 0.05). Findings regarding growth performance and carcass traits indicate that FA supplementation at 25 ppm without extra-lysine can replace the use of ractopamine as a growth promoter in finishing pigs.

AB  - Plants have evolved multiple mechanisms to defend themselves from their multiple herbivores. Thus, being able to recognise among them and respond accordingly is fundamental for plant survival and reproduction. Defence priming prepares the plant to better or more rapidly respond to future damage; however, while it is considered an adaptive trait, to date, no studies have evaluated the extent and specificity of the priming recognition. To estimate the costs, benefits and specificity of priming, we used a highly specialist plant-insect system (Datura stramonium-Lema daturaphila) and performed a reciprocal transplant experiment with two populations where a priming stimulus (sympatric vs. allopatric) and a damage treatment (sympatric) were applied. We found no evidence of a fitness cost of priming, given that primed plants without damage showed no reduction in fitness. In contrast, our treatments affected the probability of bud abortion. That is, when damaged plants received no priming or the priming came from an allopatric insect, the likelihood of aborting the first bud was 1.9 times greater compared to plants being primed by their sympatric insect. We also found that damaged plants primed with an allopatric insect produced 14% fewer seeds compared to plants receiving a sympatric priming stimulus. Tolerance to herbivore damage was also the lowest when plants received the priming stimulus from an allopatric insect. Overall, these results suggest that, in our study system, plants recognise their local insect population reducing the negative effect of damage through a tolerance response.

AB  - A graphene-coated iron nanoparticles produced by carbon arc method, which can be used as a new kind of magnetic targeting and heating drug carrier for cancer therapy. It presents an special nanostructure of iron nanoparticles in inner core and nano-graphene shells outside. The inner core has great effect of targeting magnetic heating and its nano-graphene shells have a high drug adsorption ability due to its high surface area. Magnetic induction heating effect of pig liver injected mixed liquids with different concentration graphene coated iron particles in physiological saline indicates that the more quantity of nanoparticles used, the higher temperature it is. Magnetic induction heating effect of the pig liver was compared in the case of filling method and injection method (both were containing 0.3g graphene coated iron nanoparticles). The iron nanoparticle in its inner core has good effect of magnetic induction heating, the temperature can go up to 51 degrees C in the case that graphene coated iron nanoparticles mixed with physiological saline were distributed uniformly in pig liver. And the temperature can go up to 46 degrees C in the case that graphene-coated iron nanoparticles was injected in a certain section of pig liver. It is obvious that injected one is much better than that of filled, but they are all enough to kill the cancer cells.

AB  - In August 2019, an unknown disease was first reported in farmed seahorses (Hippocampus erectus) in Binhai New Area in Tianjin city, China, with a cumulative mortality rate of 25% within seven days of onset. The main symptoms of the affected seahorses were discoloration of the body surface, abdominal distention, kidney erosion, and intestinal enlargement. Histopathological observation revealed damage to the diseased seahorses' intestines, liver, and kidneys. Strains HM-2019-5 and HM-2019-6 were isolated from diseased kidneys and identified as Photobacterium sp. based on physiological and biochemical tests and 16S rDNA sequencing analysis. Artificial infection experiments demonstrated that strain HM-2019-5 could cause a 90% morbidity rate in healthy seahorses. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests showed that HM-2019-5 and HM-2019-6 were resistant to 13 of 16 antimicrobial agents tested. This is the first report of photobacterial disease in a seahorse to the best of our knowledge.

AB  - Simple Summary It is economically significant to perform early selection of breeding goats. Given that the effect of genetic and environmental factors on growth can be estimated more accurately, estimation of adult body weight is viable, and rapid genetic progress can be achieved in the herd through the application of selection in this manner. Thus, profitability can be increased in goat breeding. Additionally, genetic and maternal influences on pre-weaning growth traits are important in identifying variation between individuals. In this study, herd, sex, age of dam, type and year of birth, and maternal genetic influence were considered according to their effects on pre-weaning growth characteristics in Turkish Saanen kids. As a result of the study, it has been determined that the economic significance of the maternal effect is high due to its effect on the growth characteristics of Turkish Saanen kids. In the selection program for offspring who grew up alongside their mothers from birth until weaning, it is recommended to account for the maternal effect as well as environmental factors. Data on 4487 Turkish Saanen kids from 176 bucks and 1318 dam-goats, obtained from the Turkish Saanen goats in the Izmir region and collected between 2018 and 2019, were analyzed to examine the effect of genetic and non-genetic factors on growth traits. The average birth weight of the kids was determined as 3.33 +/- 0.68 kg, the average W60 was 13.06 +/- 2.94 kg, the average WW was 18.38 +/- 4.14 kg, and the average PreWDG until weaning was 0.17 +/- 0.04 g. Model 1, which does not account for the maternal effect, and Model 2, which includes the maternal effect, were used in the estimation of genetic parameters. The heritability estimates of BW, W60, WW, and PreWDG ranged from 0.05 to 0.59 in both models. It is recommended to consider the maternal effect as well as the environmental factors in the selection program for the best early breeder selection of kids growing alongside their mothers until the weaning period.

AB  - Tropospheric ozone (O3) pollution can affect plant nutritional quality and secondary metabolites by altering plant biochemistry and physiology, which may lead to unpredictable effects on crop quality and resistance to pests and diseases. Here, we investigated the effects of O3 (ambient air, Am; ambient air +80 ppb of O3, EO3) on the quality compounds and chemical defenses of a widely cultivated tea variety in China (Camellia sinensis cv. 'Baiye 1 Hao') using open-top chamber (OTC). We found that elevated O3 increased the ratio of total polyphenols to free amino acids while decreasing the value of the catechin quality index, indicating a reduction in leaf quality for green tea. Specifically, elevated O3 reduced concentrations of amino acids and caffeine but shows no impact on the concentrations of total polyphenols in tea leaves. Within individual catechins, elevated O3 increased the concentrations of ester catechins but not non-ester catechins, resulting in a slight increase in total catechins. Moreover, elevated O3 increased the emission of biogenic volatile organic compounds involved in plant defense against herbivores and parasites, including green leaf volatiles, aromatics, and terpenes. Additionally, concentrations of main chemical defenses, represented as condensed tannins and lignin, in tea leaves also increased in response to elevated O3. In conclusion, our results suggest that elevated ground-level O3 may reduce the quality of tea leaves but could potentially enhance the resistance of tea plants to biotic stresses.

AB  - This study was conducted to investigate the effects of the addition of dried mealworm, hydrolyzed mealworm, fermented poultry by-product meal (FPBM), and hydrolyzed fish soluble protein (HFSP) on the growth performance, nutrient digestibility, fecal score, and blood profiles of weaning pigs. A total of 40 (21-day-old) weaned piglets ([Yorkshire x Landrace] x Duroc) with an initial average body weight (BW) of 7.14 +/- 1.29 kg were randomly assigned to one of four treatments for 35 days. There were four treatment groups with five replicates and two pigs (male and female) per pen. The dietary treatment included TRT1, a basal diet + 10% dried mealworm; TRT2, a basal diet + 10% hydrolyzed mealworm; TRT3, a basal diet + 10% fermented poultry by-product meal (FPBM); and TRT4, a basal diet + 10% hydrolyzed fish soluble protein (HFSP). The inclusion of FPBM in weaning pig diets had a significant effect on the blood profile with blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels (p < 0.05), but not on other blood profiles of serum IGF-1, IgG, and IgA concentrations. BUN concentration decreased in response to the dietary inclusion of FPBM (p = 0.019). BUN concentration decreased and was at its lowest with FPBM (6.3 mg/dL), followed by hydrolyzed mealworm (7.3 mg/dL), while increasing with dried mealworm and HFSP (8.5 mg/dL). There was no significant difference in the growth performance, nutrient digestibility, and fecal score of piglets fed a basal diet with dried mealworm, hydrolyzed mealworm, FPBM, and HFSP. Hence, the addition of fermented poultry by-products in weaning pigs' diets decreases the blood urea nitrogen, without any detrimental effect on performance, nutrient digestibility, or fecal score.

AB  - In vertebrates, male testosterone levels vary across the year being generally higher during the mating season relative to the offspring rearing season. However, male testosterone levels may also be associated with male anogenital distance (AGD) length (a proxy of prenatal androgen exposition), and influenced by the social group environment. In social species, it has been proposed that high levels of testosterone could be incompatible with the development of an amicable social environment. Thus, in these species, it is predicted that males have relatively low levels of testosterone. Our goal was to examine the potential association between male serum testosterone levels, season, male AGD length, and the social environment in the rodent Octodon degus under natural conditions. We quantified male serum testosterone levels during the mating and offspring rearing seasons, and we determined the number of females and males in each social group, as well as the composition of groups, in terms of the AGD length of the female and male group mates, from 2009 to 2019. Our results revealed that male testosterone levels covary with season, being highest during the offspring rearing season. Additionally, male testosterone levels vary with male AGD length, and female and male social group environments. More importantly, male degus exhibit low levels of testosterone that are indistinguishable from female levels during offspring rearing season. Similar to other highly social mammals, where males and females live together yearround, male amicable behavior could be the best male mating strategy, thus leading to a reduction in circulating testosterone levels.

AB  - The potentials of ABO replacer of ENZ and DFM on growth performance, AID, colonic VFAs, gut morphology, fecal score and diarrhea incidence were evaluated. We randomly assigned 120 piglets to four experimental diets that included: (1) control diet (CON), fed the basal ration; (2) ABO was added at 250 ppm of in-feed ABO; (3) ENZ was added at a rate of 3 kg/ton feed; (4) DFM was added with 50 x 10(6) cfu/g of Bacillus subtilis and 2 x 10(6) cfu/g of Lactobacillus spp. at a rate of 1.2 kg/ton feed. A complete randomized design used six pens per treatment with five pigs per pen. Pigs had ad libitum access to feed and water throughout the 6-week trial. Feed intake and BW were recorded on weeks 0, 2, 4 and 6, as well as fecal scores and diarrhea incidences (visually recorded and calculated). At weeks 2 and 4, a sub-sample of pigs (n = 6) was sacrificed for intestinal morphology, enzyme activity and VFAs. The results of the study demonstrated that DFM piglets showed increased final BW (3 kg) (p < 0.001) vs. CON. Likewise, ADG was positively affected by the incorporation of ABO, ENZ and DFM in the diets, with an average increase of 8 to 17% on ADG compared with CON (p < 0.001). The AID of gross energy, organic matter, CP and EAAs in piglets fed ENZ and DFM were significantly higher (p < 0.05) than those of CON and ABO at weeks 2 and 4. Inclusion of DFM increased intestinal morphology, enzymatic activities and propionic and butyric acid more than in pigs fed CON, ABO and ENZ (p < 0.05). The fecal score and diarrhea incidence generally decreased over time in pigs fed DFM (p < 0.05). These findings indicate that dietary supplementation with DFM has better effects at any period on growth performance, CP and AA digestibility and beneficially altered the intestinal health in weanling piglets.

AB  - The origin of vitamin D2 in herbivorous animals was investigated in vivo in sheep and in bovine as well as mouse gastrointestinal tracts. A high concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D2 in blood plasma of sheep both in summer and winter appeared to be incompatible with the undetectable level of vitamin D2 in the pasture on which the sheep were grazing. Studies with bovine rumen contents from a cow grazing the same pasture as the sheep, demonstrated an increased concentration of vitamin D2 on anaerobic incubation in a 'Rusitec' artificial rumen, which was further enhanced when cellulose powder was added as a fermentation substrate. The colon contents of mice that were fed from weaning on a vitamin D-free diet were found to contain vitamin D2. The results of these comparative studies in 3 animal species indicated that vitamin D2 was being generated by microbial anaerobic metabolism in the gastrointestinal tract.

AB  - Simple Summary In the face of the challenge posed by antibiotic prohibition, the identification of sustainable, eco-friendly alternatives to antibiotics is important. Ampelopsis grossedentata flavonoids, a plant-based extract, have high antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities provide a non-toxic and innocuous option for the extended application of additives. This study examined the viability of Ampelopsis grossedentata flavonoids as a potential substitute for antibiotics. The results showed that supplementation of Ampelopsis grossedentata flavonoids in the diet exhibited the capacity to enhance rumen microbial diversity and immune competence, thereby fostering improved growth performance among weaned kids. Consequently, this study provides an important reference for the future development of Ampelopsis grossedentata flavonoids as a new environmentally friendly additive. This study was conducted to evaluate the influences of supplementing Ampelopsis grossedentata flavonoids (AGF) on the rumen bacterial microbiome, plasma physiology and biochemistry, and growth performance of goats. Twenty-four Nubian kids were randomly allocated to three dietary treatments: the control (CON, basal diet), the 1.0 g/kg AGF treatment (AGF), and the 12.5 mg/kg monensin treatment (MN). This trial consisted of 10 days for adaptation and 90 days for data and sample collection. The results reveal that Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria are the dominant phyla in kids' rumen. Compared with the CON group, the alpha diversity in the MN and AGF groups significantly increased (p < 0.01). Beta-diversity shows that rumen microbial composition is more similar in the MN and AGF groups. LEfSe analysis shows that Prevotella_1 in the AGF group were significantly higher than those in the MN and CON group. The high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and glucose levels in the AGF group were significantly higher than those in the CON group (p < 0.05), whereas the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, glutamic-pyruvic transaminase, and alkaline phosphatase levels exhibited the opposite trend. The average daily gains in the AGF and MN groups significantly increased, while the feed-to-gain ratios were significantly decreased (p < 0.05). The results suggest that adding AGF to the diet improves microbial composition and has important implications for studying juvenile livestock growth and improving economic benefits.

AB  - Purpose: Foeniculum vulgare (fennel) is one of the most important medicinal and aromatic plants well known for its essential oil and fruit value. The research on adding vermicompost and sheep manure to the soil is an important area of applied agricultural research in sustainable development. The objective of our study was to compare the fixed and essential oil composition of fennel in organic and conventional farming systems to find out the impact of organic farming system. Method: In this study, different doses of vermicompost and sheep manures (10, 15, 20 t/ha) and ammonium sulphate (40, 80, 120 kg/ha) were applied by sowing and compared to a control group (no manure). Essential oils were extracted in Neo-clevenger apparatus, fixed oils were extracted in Soxhlet device. These oil components were quantified using Gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry with a flame ionization detector. Results: The obtained results showed that the application of 10 t/ha sheep manures not only increased the content of essential oils, but also increased the concentration of the main components, such as camphor and p-anisaldehyde. While the highest fixed oil was achieved in the application after 120 kg/ha ammonium sulphate, the application of 10 t/ha sheep manure had a higher fixed oil content than vermicompost manure. The maximum petroselinic acid content was obtained from vermicompost manure. Conclusion: The present study clearly indicated that inorganic fertilizer could be replaced by organic manures due to the higher positive impacts on essential oil and essential oil components, fixed oil and fatty acids.

AB  - CircRNAs have been found to play key roles in many biological processes and have diverse biological functions. There have been studies on circRNAs in sheep pituitary, and some important circRNAs have been found. But there are still few studies on circRNAs in sheep pituitary with different fecundity. In this study, we obtained the circRNAs expression profiles in the pituitary of FecB ++ genotype Small Tail Han sheep with different fecundity and estrous phases. A total of 34,878 circRNAs were identified in 12 pituitary samples, 300 differentially expressed circRNAs (DE circRNAs) (down: 104; up: 196) were identified in polytocous sheep in the follicular phase (PF) and monotocous sheep in the follicular phase (MF) (PF vs. MF), and 347 DE circRNAs (down: 162; up: 185) were identified in polytocous sheep in the luteal phase (PL) and monotocous sheep in the luteal phase (ML) (PL vs. ML). Cortisol synthesis and secretion pathway (follicular phase) and estrogen signaling pathway (luteal phase) were obtained by functional enrichment analysis of circRNAs source genes. Competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network analysis of key DE circRNAs revealed that oar-circ-0022776 (source gene ITPR2, follicular phase) targeted oar-miR-432, oar-circ-0009003 (source gene ITPR1, luteal phase) and oar-circ-0003113 (source gene PLCB1, luteal phase) targeted oar-miR-370-3p. We also explored the coding ability of DE circRNAs. In conclusion, our study shows that changes in the pituitary circRNAs may be related to the response of the pituitary to steroid hormones and regulate the reproductive process of sheep by affecting the pituitary function. Results of this study provide some new information for understanding the functions of circRNAs and the fecundity of FecB ++ genotype sheep.

AB  - Maintenance of intestinal metabolic function is important for optimal growth performance in post-weaning pigs. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) on maintaining intestinal glycolipid metabolism in weaned pigs. Seventy-two Duroc x Landrace x Yorkshire crossbred pigs were divided into two groups: pigs fed a basal diet (CTRL group) and pigs fed a basal diet supplemented with 3.0 mg kg(-1) PQQ (PQQ group). On d 14, serum was harvested from six pigs per group and the pigs were slaughtered to sample jejunal tissue. Compared with the CTRL group, pigs in the PQQ group had increased average daily gain (P < 0.05), decreased feed : gain (P < 0.05) and tended to have a reduced diarrhea ratio (P = 0.057). Jejunal villus height and villus height/crypt depth ratio were increased, and the crypt depth was decreased in the PQQ group (P < 0.01). The proteomics results showed that PQQ supplementation acted on three metabolic pathways, type I diabetes mellitus, the pancreatic secretion pathway and immune-related signalling. Compared with the CTRL group, PQQ supplementation increased (P < 0.05) serum insulin and jejunal mucosal pyruvate, triglyceride, total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the pigs. Jejunal mucosal lactic dehydrogenase and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in the pigs were decreased by PQQ supplementation (P < 0.05). In addition, PQQ supplementation reduced glucose transporter 5 and phosphorylated-AMP-activated protein kinase expression in the jejunal mucosa of the pigs (P < 0.05). In conclusion, dietary supplementation with PQQ improved the growth performance and jejunal morphology and regulated glycolipid metabolism via inhibiting AMPK phosphorylation in weaned pigs.

AB  - Camellia petelotii (Merr.) Sealy is an endangered Chinese native species that originates from Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China. Previous research demonstrated that proper water and fertilizer treatments could improve the growth and quality of Camellia species. This study uses a three-factor, fi ve-level quadratic rotational combination experimental design to investigate the impact of water-fertilizer coupling on plant growth characteristics and the most suitable treatment for 24-month-old grafted C. petelotii seedlings. The experimental design includes irrigation levels [30%, 40%, 55%, 70%, 80% of fi eld capacity (FC)], nitrogen application (0, 2.17, 5.43, 8.70, 10.87 g<middle dot>plant-1), and phosphorus application (0, 0.96, 2.40, 3.85, 4.81 g<middle dot>plant-1). The results indicated that: (1) Water-nitrogen and water-phosphorus interactions significantly affected ground diameter, chlorophyll content and specific leaf weight (SLW), while water-nitrogen interactions significantly affected plant height and photosynthesis; (2) Application of nitrogen (8.70 g<middle dot>plant-1) and phosphorus (3.85 g<middle dot>plant-1) fertilizers under appropriate irrigation conditions (40% FC and 70% FC) improved growth. Applying fertilizers containing either nitrogen (10.87 g<middle dot>plant-1) or phosphorus (4.81 g<middle dot>plant-1) under adequate irrigation (55% FC) increased the Chl content. However, high nitrogen levels (10.87 g<middle dot>plant-1) reduced photosynthesis. Conversely, it was enhanced under appropriate phosphorus (4.81 g<middle dot>plant-1) when the irrigation level was 55% FC, indicating the sensitivity of C. petelotii seedlings to nitrogen fertilizer. (3) Under specific conditions of 40% FC or 70% FC irrigation and 8.70 g<middle dot>plant-1 or 2.17 g<middle dot>plant-1 nitrogen fertilizer application, 3.85 g<middle dot>plant-1 phosphorus addition boosted the SLW whereas, 0.96 g<middle dot>plant-1 phosphorus addition inhibited it. Under W = 55% FC, deficiencies in either nitrogen (N = 0 g<middle dot>plant-1) or phosphorus (P = 0 g<middle dot>plant-1) significantly decreased leaf growth, affecting SLW. In summary, C. petelotii was more sensitive to nitrogen fertilizer at W = 55% FC, and nitrogen deficiency inhibited C. petelotii growth in terms of ground diameter more than phosphorus deficiency. The C. petelotii seedlings performed best when treated with 55% FC, 5.43 g<middle dot>plant-1 nitrogen, 2.40 g<middle dot>plant-1 phosphorus per plant. These parameter estimates could optimize water and fertilizer application for C. petelotii seedlings.

AB  - The main goal of the study was to investigate the genotoxic response of N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) and ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) at low doses in a multi-endpoint genotoxicity assessment platform in rats and to derive potential thresholds and related metrics. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated by daily oral gavage for 28 consecutive days with ENU (0.25 similar to 8 mg/kg bw) and EMS (5 similar to 160 mg/kg bw), both with six closely spaced dose levels. Pig-a gene mutation assay, micronucleus test, and comet assay were performed in several timepoints. Then, the dose-response relationships were analyzed for possible points of departure (PoD) using the no observed genotoxic effect level and benchmark dose (BMD) protocols with different critical effect sizes (CES, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, and 1SD). Overall, dose-dependent increases in all investigated endpoints were found for ENU and EMS. PoDs varied across genetic endpoints, timepoints, and statistical methods, and selecting an appropriate lower 95% confidence limit of BMD needs a comprehensive consideration of the mode of action of chemicals, the characteristics of tests, and the model fitting methods. Under the experimental conditions, the PoDs of ENU and EMS were 0.0036 mg/kg bw and 1.7 mg/kg bw, respectively.

AB  - Active fault zones have complex structural and geometric features that are expected to affect earthquakenucleation, rupture propagation with shear and volumetric deformation, and arrest. Earthquakes, in turn,dynamically activate co-seismic off-fault damage that may be both distributed and localized, affecting faultzone geometry and rheology, and further influencing post-seismic deformation and subsequent earthquakesequences. Understanding this co-evolution of fault zones and earthquakes is a fundamental challenge incomputational rupture dynamics with consequential implications for earthquake physics, seismic hazard andrisk. Here, we implement a continuum damage-breakage (CDB) rheology model in our MOOSE-FARMS dynamicrupture simulator to investigate the interplay between bulk damage and fault motion on the evolution ofdynamic rupture, energy partitioning, and ground motion characteristics. We demonstrate several effects ofdamage (accounting for distributed cracking) and breakage (accounting for granulation) on rupture dynamicsin the context of two prototype problems addressed currently in the 2D plane-strain setting: (1) a single planarfault and (2) a fracture network. We quantify the spatio-temporal reduction in wave speeds associated withdynamic ruptures in each of these cases and track the evolution of the original fault zone geometry. Theresults highlight the growth and coalescence of localization bands as well as competition between localizedslip on the pre-existing faults vs. inelastic deformation in the bulk. We analyze the differences between off-fault dissipation through damage-breakage vs. plasticity and show that damage-induced softening increases theslip and slip rate, suggesting enhanced energy radiation and reduced energy dissipation. These results haveimportant implications for long-standing problems in earthquake and fault physics as well as near-fault seismichazard, and they motivate continuing towards 3D simulations and detailed near-fault observations to uncoverthe processes occurring in earthquake rupture zones

AB  - When navigating heterogeneous landscapes, large carnivores must balance trade-offs between multiple goals, including minimizing energetic expenditure, maintaining access to hunting opportunities and avoiding potential risk from humans. The relative importance of these goals in driving carnivore movement likely changes across temporal scales, but our understanding of these dynamics remains limited. Here we quantified how drivers of movement and habitat selection changed with temporal grain for two large carnivore species living in human-dominated landscapes, providing insights into commonalities in carnivore movement strategies across regions. We used high-resolution GPS collar data and integrated step selection analyses to model movement and habitat selection for African lions Panthera leo in Laikipia, Kenya and pumas Puma concolor in the Santa Cruz Mountains of California across eight temporal grains, ranging from 5 min to 12 hr. Analyses considered landscape covariates that are related to energetics, resource acquisition and anthropogenic risk. For both species, topographic slope, which strongly influences energetic expenditure, drove habitat selection and movement patterns over fine temporal grains but was less important at longer temporal grains. In contrast, avoiding anthropogenic risk during the day, when risk was highest, was consistently important across grains, but the degree to which carnivores relaxed this avoidance at night was strongest for longer term movements. Lions and pumas modified their movement behaviour differently in response to anthropogenic features: lions sped up while near humans at fine temporal grains, while pumas slowed down in more developed areas at coarse temporal grains. Finally, pumas experienced a trade-off between energetically efficient movement and avoiding anthropogenic risk. Temporal grain is an important methodological consideration in habitat selection analyses, as drivers of both movement and habitat selection changed across temporal grain. Additionally, grain-dependent patterns can reflect meaningful behavioural processes, including how fitness-relevant goals influence behaviour over different periods of time. In applying multi-scale analysis to fine-resolution data, we showed that two large carnivore species in very different human-dominated landscapes balanced competing energetic and safety demands in largely similar ways. These commonalities suggest general strategies of landscape use across large carnivore species.

AB  - Predator avoidance strategies vary across the ungulate guild. Population-level responses to the presence of large predators to a large extent depend on how well ecological conditions suit the particular predator avoidance strategies of a species. Predation risk from ambush predators, e.g. lions negatively correlates with distance from surface water, but only at scales comparable to the foraging range of lions. Prey species with low surface water requirements spend less time close to surface water, and their predator avoidance revolves around selecting predator-free zones. Arguably, spatial segregation would be further encouraged by competition from water-dependent conspecifics. The scarcity of predator-free zones in confined spaces raises the expectation that they are exposed to a high predation risk relative to species more dependent on surface water. Based on this premise, we argue that lion introductions to insular conservation areas of limited size, compromise diverse ungulate communities. We do an across-species comparison of the long-run population growth of a selection of prey species across fourteen small conservation areas. Study areas are categorised according to those harbouring apex predators (lions) and those that do not. Our findings suggest species differentially respond to the presence of lions, with negative responses biased towards species with low surface water requirements. In smaller conservation areas harbouring lions, reducing surface water frequency might prove key to the successful conservation of water-independent large herbivores.

AB  - In insects, nicotine activates nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, which are expressed throughout the central nervous system. However, little work has been done to investigate the effects of chronic nicotine treatment on learning or other behaviors in non-herbivorous insects. To examine the effects of long term nicotine consumption on learning and memory, honey bees were fed nicotine containing solutions over four days. Bees were able to detect nicotine at 0.1 mM in sucrose solutions, and in a no choice assay, bees reduced food intake when nicotine was 1 mM or higher. Treatment with a low dose of nicotine decreased the proportion of bees able to form an associative memory when bees were conditioned with either a massed or spaced appetitive olfactory training paradigm. On the other hand, higher doses of nicotine increased memory retention and the proportion of bees responding to the odor during 10 min and 24 h recall tests. The reduction in nicotine containing food consumed may also impact response levels during learning and recall tests. These data suggest that long term exposure to nicotine has complex effects on learning and memory.

AB  - Insect herbivores frequently must balance host plant quality and the risk of attack by their natural enemies when making oviposition decisions. Yet, which factor is more important remains unresolved in plant-insect ecology. Here, we report the oviposition preference and larval performance of the brassicaceous specialist Plutella xylostella, in the context of plant quality (cabbage Brassica oleracea vs. mustard B. juncea) and associated natural enemies. Despite the greater larval weight and adult lifespan on cabbage, ovipositing females strongly preferred mustard. Both the egg parasitoid Trichogrammatoidea bactrae and the larval ectoparasitoid Bracon brevicornis are more likely to attack P. xylostella that feed on cabbage; thus, mustard represents enemy-reduced space from these two parasitoids. However, larval diet had no impact on the parasitism rate of specialist Cotesia vestalis. Feeding on mustard improved larval immune responses. The total hemocyte number, diversity, and phenoloxidase activity were higher in mustard-fed larvae which increased their survival against the entomopathogen, Bacillus thuringiensis. Interestingly, host plants altered the larval body odor profile. Mustard-fed larvae emitted allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) and butyl isothiocyanate (BITC) while cabbage-fed larvae emitted dimethyl disulphide (DMDS) and dimethyl trisulphide (DMTS) that served as short-range cues for larval parasitoids. For B. brevicornis, host body odor guided oviposition choice was crucial as their fitness was affected by the host larval diet. Although C. vestalis showed a clear preference towards volatiles emitted by mustard fed larvae, their fitness was unaltered. Taken together, our results illustrate that P. xylostella prefers to lay eggs on mustard plants providing enemy-reduced space from some, but not all, natural enemies.

AB  - Simple Summary Generally, ecological farming is regarded as an environmentally friendly production process with high costs. The plant fiber source (e.g., maize silage) has become a common practice to reduce the cost during the fattening period to gain more profit, which means a precision feed component is needed in ecological pig-raising systems (EPRS) for achieving the balance between environment and economic profit. This manuscript provided a suitable and easy-operated ratio of sun-dried maize silage added to the feed. Meanwhile, we tried to reveal the trends of the pig growth, environmental impacts, and economic profits with the sun-dried maize silage percentage and raising period increasing. Results showed that the best balance point between environmental impact and economic performance was 20% sun-dried maize silage added to the feed with a 360-day raising period. Ecological pig-raising systems (EPRSs) differ from conventional breeding systems, focusing more on environmental consequences, human health, and food safety during production processes. Thus productions from EPRSs have undergone significant development in China. Thus far, adding plant fiber sources (e.g., sweet potato leaves, maize or wheat straw, potato, alfalfa, and vinasse) to feed has become a common practice to reduce the cost during the fattening period. Under such a context, it is necessary to choose the precision EPRS diet components and fattening period with low environmental consequences and high economic benefits. This study set up a database via pig growth models to predict environmental and economic performance based on two trials with 0%, 10%, 40%, 60%, and 80% maize silage (dry weight) added to the feed. A continuous curve about plant fiber concentration was built through the generated database. Our results showed that, with increased plant fiber concentration, the environmental performance of the EPRSs exhibited an "increase-decrease-increase" trend, and the economic performance firstly increased and then decreased. The best maize silage added percentages of emergy yield ratio (EYR), environmental loading ratio (ELR), unit emergy value (UEV), and emergy sustainability index (ESI), and the economic profits were 19.0%, 34.3%, 24.6%, 19.9%, and 18.0%, respectively. Besides, the 19.9% sun-dried maize silage added to the feed with a 360-day raising period had the best balance for environmental impact and economic performance. At the balance point, the performances of EYR, ELR, UEV, ESI, and the economic profit were only 0.04%, 3.0%, 0.8%, 0.0%, and 0.1%, respectively, lower than their maximum values. Therefore, we recommended the feed added 20% sun-dried maize silage is suitable for practical pig raising systems.

AB  - Premise Current knowledge about defense strategies in plants under herbivore pressure is predominantly based on vascular plants. Bryophytes are rarely consumed by herbivores since they have ample secondary metabolites. However, it is unknown whether bryophytes have induced defenses against herbivory and whether there is a trade-off between growth and defense in bryophytes.
   Methods In an experiment with two peatland bryophytes, Sphagnum magellanicum Brid. and S. fuscum (Schimp.) H. Klinggr., two kinds of herbivory, clipping with scissors and grazing by mealworms (Tenebrio molitor L.) were simulated. At the end of the experiment, we measured growth traits, carbon-based defense compounds (total phenolics and cellulose) and storage compounds (total nonstructural carbohydrates) of these two Sphagnum species.
   Results Grazing but not clipping increased total phenolics and C:N ratio and reduced biomass production and height increment. A negative relationship between biomass production and total phenolics was found in S. magellanicum but not in S. fuscum, indicating a growth-defense trade-off that is species-specific. Grazing reduced the sugar starch content of S. magellanicum and the sugar of S. fuscum. Either clipping or grazing had no effect on chlorophyll fluorescence (including actual and maximum photochemical efficiency of photosystem II) except that a significant effect of clipping on actual photochemical efficiency in S. fuscum was observed.
   Conclusions Our results suggest that Sphagnum can have induced defense against herbivory and that this defense can come at a cost of growth. These findings advance our knowledge about induced defense in bryophytes, the earliest land plants.

AB  - Pig manure (PM) is often highly enriched in heavy metals, such as Cu and Zn, due to the wide use of feed additives. To study the potential risks of heavy metal accumulation in the soil and rice grains by the application of PM and other organic manure, a four-year field experiment was conducted in the suburb of Shanghai, southeast China. The contents of Cu, Zn, Pb, and Cd in the soils and rice plants by the treatments of PM and fungal culturing residues (FCR) show a trend of annual increase. Those in the soils and rice by the PM treatment are raised even more significantly. Cu and Zn contents in the soil and rice roots by the PM are significantly higher than those by the non-fertilizer control (CK) during the four years, and Pb and Cd also significantly higher than CK in the latter two years. Heavy metals taken up by the rice plants are mostly retained in the roots. Cu and Zn contents in the rice plants are in the decreasing order of roots > grains > stems > leaves, and Pb and Cd in the order of roots > stems > leaves > grains. Cu, Zn, Pb, and Cd contents in the soils by the PM treatment increase by 73%, 32%, 106%, and 127% on annual average, and those in the brown rice by 104%, 98%, 275%, and 199%, respectively. The contents of Cu, Zn, Pb, and Cd in the brown rice of the treatments are significantly correlated with those in the soils and rice roots (p < 0.05), suggesting the heavy metals accumulated in the rice grains come from the application of PM and FCR. Though the contents of heavy metals in the brown rice during the four experimental years are still within the safe levels, the risks of their accumulative increments, especially by long-term application of PM, can never be neglected.

AB  - Anticoagulant rodenticides (ARs) are used worldwide for the control of rodent pests and are the main method of control of rat pest populations in agricultural areas. The main aim of this review is to discuss the risk of ARs to non-target wildlife in oil palm areas in Southeast Asia, mainly Indonesia and Malaysia. We discussed AR use in oil palm areas and toxicities of ARs on target and non-target animals. We also reviewed published literature on wildlife species reported in oil palm areas in Southeast Asia and utilizing this information, we assessed the hazard risk of ARs to non-target wildlife in oil palm plantations. ARs are a secondary exposure hazard to rodent-consuming mammalian carnivores, such as leopard cats and civets, and rodent-consuming raptors, such as barn owls. Consumption of dead poisoned prey puts scavengers, such as water monitors, at high risk for AR exposure. Domestic livestock and granivorous birds are at high risk for AR exposure via primary exposure to toxic bait, while omnivores such as macaques and wild pigs are at moderate risk for both primary and secondary exposure to ARs. The effects of ARs on barn owls have been well studied in the field and in laboratory secondary toxicity studies. Thus, the nest-box occupancy and reproductive parameters of local barn owl populations can be monitored as an indicator of the AR exposure level in the area.

AB  - Simple Summary In a glasshouse experiment, the effects of wireworm-damaged lettuce roots on the antioxidative defense system and movement of insect/slug parasitic nematodes were studied. Lettuce seedlings were grown with or without wireworms, and antioxidants and photosynthetic pigments were analyzed. Volatile organic compounds emitted from lettuce roots were investigated, and certain compounds were selected for a chemotaxis assay with nematodes. Results showed that wireworm-damaged roots negatively affected photosynthetic pigment contents and induced reactive oxygen species even before visible symptoms appeared. The ascorbate-glutathione system was identified as a redox hub in defense response against wireworms. Entomopathogenic nematodes were found to be more mobile than slug parasitic nematodes towards chemotaxis compounds, and 2,4-nonadienal repelled all tested nematodes. The study highlights the importance of understanding belowground tritrophic interactions for pest management in agricultural systems. The effect of wireworm-damaged lettuce roots on the antioxidative defense system (ascorbate-glutathione cycle, photosynthetic pigments) and movement of insect/slug parasitic nematodes towards determined root exudates was studied in a glasshouse experiment. Lettuce seedlings were grown in a substrate soil in the absence/presence of wireworms (Elateridae). The ascorbate-glutathione system and photosynthetic pigments were analyzed by HPLC, while volatile organic compounds (VOC) emitted by lettuce roots were investigated by GC-MS. Herbivore-induced root compounds, namely 2,4-nonadienal, glutathione, and ascorbic acid, were selected for a chemotaxis assay with nematodes Steinernema feltiae, S. carpocapsae, Heterorhabditis bacteriophora, Phasmarhabditis papillosa, and Oscheius myriophilus. Root pests had a negative effect on the content of photosynthetic pigments in the leaves of infested plants, indicating that they reacted to the presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Using lettuce as a model plant, we recognized the ascorbate-glutathione system as a redox hub in defense response against wireworms and analyzed its role in root-exudate-mediated chemotaxis of nematodes. Infected plants also demonstrated increased levels of volatile 2,4-nonadienal. Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs, S. feltiae, S. carpocapsae, and H. bacteriophora) proved to be more mobile than parasitic nematodes O. myriophilus and P. papillosa towards chemotaxis compounds. Among them, 2,4-nonadienal repelled all tested nematodes. Most exudates that are involved in belowground tritrophic interactions remain unknown, but an increasing effort is being made in this field of research. Understanding more of these complex interactions would not only allow a better understanding of the rhizosphere but could also offer ecologically sound alternatives in the pest management of agricultural systems.

AB  - The content and composition of intramuscular fat (IMF) affect the cooked meat palatability such as tenderness and juiciness. Thus, elucidation of lipid deposition and its composition in goat IMF is necessary. Here, Jianzhou big-ear goats with higher IMF content is associated with lower mRNA level of LKB1 gene, compared with those of Chuannan black goats. Functionally, knockdown of LKB1 promoted intramuscular adipocyte lipid accumulation. Next, LC-MS/MS based pseudo target analysis found that 409 lipids existed in goat intramuscular adipocytes, of which polyunsaturated fatty acids accounted for most lipids. Compared with the control, 78 differential lipids were screened in the si LKB1 group, enriched in the triacylglycerols and fatty acids subclasses. The combined analysis between lipidomic and published transcriptomic data showed that siLKB1 enhanced polyunsaturated fatty acids synthesis through upregulation expression of HACD4. Finally, the promotion of lipid accumulation and polyunsaturated fatty acids synthesis in the LKB1 knockdown cells were partly rescued by ablation of HACD4. Collectively, these data provide a genetic target to produce PUFA enriched functional goat meat and expand new insights into improvement of meat quality.

AB  - There are phospholipase and yolk agglutinase in the seminal plasma of dairy goat. The existence of these enzymes will hydrolyze lecithin in yolk into lysophosphatides and cause the change of pH value of diluent, resulting in toxic and side effects on sperm. In order to explore the effect of bovine seminal plasma replacing different doses of dairy goat seminal plasma (0%, 25%, 50%, 100%) on semen freezing quality of Guanzhong dairy goat, we used computer-aided sperm analysis (CASA) system, specific fluo-rescent probe detection technology, hypo osmotic swelling test (HOST), oxidation index determination and in vivo fertilization verification test to study the semen cryopreservation of Guanzhong dairy goat. The results showed that if we used bovine seminal plasma instead of 100% dairy goat seminal plasma, the sperm motility, plasma membrane functionality and acrosome integrity rate were the highest after thawing, reaching 67.04%, 38.12% and 68.83% respectively, which was significantly higher than that of other groups (P < 0.05); In terms of oxidation indexes, the values of SOD and GSH-PX in sperm of dairy goats were 199.78 U/mL and 133.55 U/L, respectively, which were significantly higher than those in other groups (P < 0.05), and the values of ROS and MDA were 397.58 U/mL and 5.16 nmol/L, respectively, which were significantly lower than those in other groups (P < 0.05); The results of artificial insemination also showed that using bovine seminal plasma instead of 100% of dairy goat seminal plasma could signifi-cantly improve the fertilization ability of sperm. The quality of frozen Guanzhong dairy goat sperm can be improved by using bovine seminal plasma instead of dairy goat seminal plasma and using bovine diluent.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Dairy cattle with a high milk yield are susceptible to many infectious diseases, such as mastitis. Subclinical mastitis (SCM) is the most prevalent form of mastitis that predominantly affects animal health, and causes adverse effects on the quality and quantity of milk. In dairy animals, subclinical mastitis often remains undetected, as no gross changes in udder characteristics are visible. In the present study, 135 Holstein Friesian dairy animals were selected and screened as healthy (n = 25) and mastitic (n = 110) based on diagnostic tests such as the California mastitis test, pH, electrical conductivity, and somatic cell count. In this study, the somatic cell count was used as a gold-standard test in differentiating subclinical mastitis animals from healthy ones. The present study was carried out to study polymorphisms in the bovine transferrin gene in cows (with subclinical mastitis and healthy). For the early detection of resistant/or susceptible animals, a useful marker could be provided by the detection of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the transferrin gene, which are often associated with mammary innate immune response. The sequencing results revealed three nucleotide substitutions: two transversions (230 A > C, 231 C > A) and one transition (294 A > G) in susceptible cows as compared to disease-free subjects. The nucleotide variations at position 230 (GAC > GCA) and 231 (GAC > GCA) were nonsynonymous, and corresponded to an amino acid change from aspartic acid to alanine; whereas at position 294 (GAA > GAG), the mutation was synonymous. In the present study, many in silico tools were taken into consideration to determine the effect of SNPs on protein structure and function. The PROVEAN tool found the amino acid substitution to be neutral and deleterious. PolyPhen-2 revealed the amino acid variations at positions 320 and 321 to most likely be damaging; and at the 341 position, the variations were benign. The I-Mutant and MUpro tools found that the protein stability decreased for nonsynonymous variations. The SIFT tool revealed the protein function was likely to be affected in nonsynonymous variations, with no change in the case of synonymous ones. Phylogenetic analysis of the bovine transferrin gene revealed a close relation of the CA allele with the Bos taurus transferrin, while the G allele was closely related to a cross of Bos indicus x Bos taurus serotransferrins, followed by the Bison bison transferrin. The least relation was shown by both alleles to Capra hircus, Ovis aries, and Bubalus bubalis.

AB  - Toxodonts constitute a group of extinct native South American ungulates that have been subject of extensive paleobiological research. Among the traits analyzed, enamel crest complexity (ECC; through fractal dimension) and occlusal surface tooth area (OTA) have recently been studied. However, they have not yet been applied to evaluate differences between ontogenetic stages, (e.g., juveniles, subadults, and adults). Here, we analyzed these traits in the p2-m3 of three species of Toxodontidae, Adinotherium ovinum (n = 8), Nesodon imbricatus (n = 11), and Toxodon platensis (n = 19), along ontogeny by standardized major axis regressions using OTA of m1 as an age proxy, and compared adult and young individuals (i.e., m3 not fully erupted) by Kruskal-Wallis test. Our results showed that ECC decreases with age in all teeth, and p2-m1 seems to share a common slope for Adinotherium and Nesodon. Kruskal-Wallis test showed significant differences between age and species in p3 and molars, with young individuals having higher ECC values than adults. There is a decreasing trend in ECC values from A. ovinum (highest), through N. imbricatus (intermediate), to T. platensis (lowest). These differences are more pronounced from m1 to m3. We conclude that both ECC and OTA can serve as effective tools for differentiating adult toxodonts from those that have not yet reached adulthood. The lower ECC in adult molars may be due to crown simplification during ontogeny, as teeth wear over time by abrasion from food particles during chewing. Conversely, OTA increases in adults as a mixed effect of wear and the larger size of their teeth compared to younger individuals.

AB  - Functional asymmetries of the avian visual system can be studied in monocularly occluded birds, as their hemispheres are largely independent. Right and left monocularly occluded homing pigeons and control birds under binocular view have been trained in a food localisation task in an octagonal outdoor arena provided with one coloured beacon on each wall. The three groups were tested after the removal of the visual beacons, so to assess their sun compass learning abilities. Pigeons using the left eye/right hemisphere system exhibited slower learning compared to the other monocular group. During the test in the arena void of visual beacons, the three groups of birds, regardless of their visual condition, were generally able to identify the training sector by exclusively relying on sun compass information. However, the directional choices of the pigeons with the left eye/right hemisphere in use were significantly affected by the removal of the beacons, while both control pigeons and birds with the right eye/left hemisphere in use displayed unaltered performances during the test. A subsample of pigeons of each group were re-trained in the octagonal arena with visual beacons present and tested after the removal of visual beacons after a 6 h fast clock-shift treatment. All birds displayed the expected deflection consistent to the sun compass use. While birds using either the left or the right visual systems were equally able to learn a sun compass-mediated spatial task, the left eye/right hemisphere visual system displayed an advantage in relying on visual beacons.

AB  - Cathepsin D (CTSD), the major lysosomal aspartic protease that is widely expressed in different tissues, potentially regulates the biological behaviors of various cells. Follicular granulosa cells are responsive to the increase of ovulation number, hence indirectly influencing litter size. However, the mechanism underlying the effect of CTSD on the behaviors of goat granulosa cells has not been fully elucidated. This study used immunohistochemistry to analyze CTSD localization in goat ovarian tissues. Moreover, western blotting was applied to examine the differential expression of CTSD in the ovarian tissues of monotocous and polytocous goats. Subsequently, the effects of CTSD knockdown on cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle, and the expression of candidate genes of the prolific traits, including bone morphogenetic protein receptor IB (BMPR-IB), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSHR), and inhibin alpha (INHA), were determined in granulosa cells. Results showed that CTSD was expressed in corpus luteum, follicle, and granulosa cells. Notably, CTSD expression in the monotocous group was significantly higher than that in the polytocous group. In addition, CTSD knockdown could improve granulosa cell proliferation, inhibit cell apoptosis, and significantly elevate the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), but it lowered the expression of Bcl-2-associated X (Bax) and caspase-3. Furthermore, CTSD knockdown significantly reduced the ratios of cells in the G0/G1 and G2/M phases but substantially increased the ratio of cells in the S phase. The expression levels of cyclin D2 and cyclin E were elevated followed by the obvious decline of cyclin A1 expression. However, the expression levels of BMPR-IB, FSHR, and INHA clearly increased as a result of CTSD knockdown. Hence, our findings demonstrate that CTSD is an important factor affecting the litter size trait in goats by regulating the granulosa cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle, and the expression of candidate genes of the prolific trait.

AB  - Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 5'-flanking regulatory regions of genes could affect their expression levels. This is a follow-up study aimed to identify polymorphic variants in the 5'-flanking regulatory regions of genes expressed in boar spermatozoa, and to predict the interactions of such variants with transcription factors (TFs) on the gene promoter activity, using bioinformatics. Five and six boars were classified as having good and poor semen freezability (GSF and PSF, respectively) according to post-thaw (PT) assessment of sperm motility and membrane integrity characteristics. The 5'-flanking region sequences of the 14 genes (FOS, NFATC3, EAF2, FGF-14, BAMBI, RAB33B, CKS2, LARS2, SLC25A16, ACADM, CPT2, CCT3, DTD2 and CCDC85A) were PCR amplified and analyzed by Sanger sequencing method. A total of 32 polymorphic variants were identified in the 5'-flanking regions of the genes, including 4 insertion/deletion (indel) polymorphisms, and 8 unknown (novel) SNPs. Multiple sequence alignment analysis revealed a 26-bp indel variant in the 5'-flanking region of the LARS2 gene, which showed greater protein expression in spermatozoa from boars of the PSF group. It was found that 17 polymorphic variants, observed in the differentially expressed (DE) genes, showed significant allele frequency differences between the GSF and PSF groups. Polymorphic variants in the 5'-flanking regulatory regions of the genes contributed to the decrease or increase in the binding affinity for different testis-specific TFs, such as SMAD1, NF-1, FOXMI, RXRA, STAT4 and C/EBP beta. This study provides more insights into the mechanisms responsible for variations in transcriptional activity in promoters of genes expressed in boar spermatozoa. The allelic variants are promising genetic markers for predicting the freezability of boar spermatozoa. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Small macropodoid marsupials are well represented among Australia's extinct and threatened mammals. Population monitoring is central to understanding how remaining species respond to on-going landscape change and threatening processes on private land and within managed conservation reserves. Camera trapping and occupancy modelling provide a reliable approach to monitor these often cryptic species. However, understanding the survey effort required to detect population declines of a given magnitude with high statistical certainty is often overlooked. We use empirical data from camera trapping and occupancy modelling to determine an optimal survey design for a regionally endangered population of the black-striped wallaby. We established a 1200 ha grid of 60 cameras and sampled in three 30-day intervals over a 1-year period. We investigated factors that may influence occupancy and detection followed by power analyses with our broad objective being to devise a monitoring program that would be robust enough to detect a 50% decline with at least 80% power. This species was not detected at rainforest sites. Naive occupancy within eucalypt forest was 0.42. The detection probability (using 5-day detection occasions) varied with season (from 0.17 +/- 0.04 in autumn to 0.34 +/- 0.05 in spring). Occupancy was positively influenced by shrub cover and negatively influenced by elevation. We found no apparent influence of dingo detection on occupancy or detection of the black-striped wallaby. We explored different configurations of detection sites and number of survey occasions to satisfy our 50:80 criteria when initial occupancy was 0.40. Sampling 60 sites for a minimum of 30 days would satisfy these criteria. Power analyses can inform optimal designs for threatened species monitoring and similar investigations should be conducted for other threatened small macropods to assist their conservation.

AB  - For the intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) procedure in pigs, an electrical pulse (EP) has been used as an effective method for oocyte stimulation, but unlike sperm, EP is unable to induce Ca2+ oscillations. In this study, we investigated the effects of generating artificial Ca2+ oscillations with phospholipase C zeta (PLC zeta) mRNA, a candidate sperm factor, on fertilization, embryonic development, and gene expression after ICSI. Firstly, the concentration of PLC zeta mRNA of a fixed volume (1.0 pl) that would induce a pattern of Ca2+ rise similar to that of in vitro fertilized (IVF) sperm was examined and determined to be 300 ng/mu l. Secondly, the effects of oocyte stimulation methods on fertilization and embryonic development were investigated. ICSI-oocytes were activated by EP (EP group) or by PLC zeta mRNA (PLC zeta group). Furthermore, IVF-oocytes (IVF group) and ICSI-oocytes with and without an injection of buffer (buffer and untreated groups, respectively) were used as controls. It was found that the rates of normal fertilization in the PLC zeta and EP groups were significantly higher than those in the buffer and untreated groups. The blastocyst formation rates did not differ among the groups. The embryo quality in the EP group was inferior to those in the PLC zeta and IVF groups. Additionally, the expression level of a proapoptosis-related gene (Caspase-3) in the EP group was significantly higher than those in the PLC zeta and IVF groups. Our data suggest that oocyte activation by PLC zeta mRNA has the effect of improving embryo quality.

AB  - While host switches can promote speciation in herbivorous insects, the benefits of switching hosts have only been ascribed to escaping competition and natural enemies. Herbivores might also escape from the defences of their ancestral host if their new host species lacks those defences, but 'defence-free space' has not been tested as a potential driver of host-associated speciation by increasing the likelihood of host shifts. We used field and laboratory experiments to test this hypothesis in goldenrod (Solidago spp.) and its gall fly (Eurosta solidaginis). The ancestral host (S. altissima) senses the volatile emissions (a putative sex pheromone) of male flies and increases its defences against both gall induction by the fly and chewing herbivory from co-occurring herbivore species, while the effect of exposure to this emission was unknown for the derived host (S. gigantea). In growth chamber experiments, we found that both host plant species responded similarly to fly pheromone in the levels of signalling phytohormones jasmonic acid and salicylic acid but that only S. altissima experienced reduced feeding by leaf beetles after pheromone exposure. In the field, S. altissima ramets were less preferred by ovipositing female gall flies after pheromone exposure, while there was no effect for S. gigantea. Conversely, pheromone exposure made S. gigantea ramets more susceptible to one type of herbivory: bunch galling by midge species. Our data show that the derived host, S. gigantea, does respond to the gall fly pheromone, but does so in a way that appears maladaptive for the plant, suggesting that escaping the defence of the ancestral host species provides an additional benefit to herbivores and an ecological mechanism for host switching and eventual speciation.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

AB  - Background/Objectives: Reproductive efficiency in breeding boars critically impacts swine industry productivity, with sperm quality being multifactorially regulated by gut microbiota. This study aimed to elucidate the microbiota-metabolite interactions underlying sperm quality differences in Tibetan boars. Methods: Integrated 16S rRNA sequencing and untargeted metabolomics were performed on fecal and semen samples from eight healthy Tibetan boars (31-33 months old), stratified into low-semen (CJ) and high-semen utilization (HJ) groups. Analyses included sperm quality assessment, microbial profiling, and metabolic pathway enrichment. Results: The HJ group exhibited significantly enhanced sperm motility and semen utilization rates (p < 0.05). Gut microbiota composition differed markedly, with Firmicutes and Proteobacteria enriched in HJ boars. Metabolomics identified key metabolites positively correlated with sperm quality (e.g., butyrate, phenyllactic acid), while lithocholic acid showed negative associations. KEGG analysis revealed predominant involvement in butanoate metabolism and bile acid biosynthesis. Core microbiota (e.g., Ruminococcus) modulated sperm quality through short-chain fatty acid networks and bile acid homeostasis. Conclusions: Gut microbiota regulated the sperm microenvironment via a "metabolic-immune" dual pathway mediated by the gut-testis axis. These findings establish a theoretical basis for probiotic or metabolite-targeted strategies to improve boar reproductive performance.

AB  - Background Babesia orientalis is an intra-erythrocytic protozoan parasite that causes babesiosis in water buffalo. The genome of B. orientalis has been reported and various genes have been accurately annotated, including heat shock proteins (HSP). Three B. orientalis HSPs (HSP90, HSP70 and HSP20) have been previously identified as potential antigenic targets. Here, a new validation strategy for the chaperone activities and cell protection characteristics of the three HSPs was developed in vitro.Methods BoHSP20, BoHSP70 and BoHSP90B were amplified from cDNA, followed by cloning them into the pEGFP-N1 vector and transfecting the vector plasmid separately into 293T and Hela mammalian cells. Their expression and localization were determined by fluorescence microscopy. The biological functions and protein stability were testified through an analysis of the fluorescence intensity duration. Their role in the protection of cell viability from heat-shock treatments was examined by MTT assay (cell proliferation assay based on thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide).Results Fusion proteins pEGFP-N1-BoHSP20, pEGFP-N1-BoHSP70, and pEGFP-N1-BoHSP90B (pBoHSPs: pBoHSP20; pBoHSP70 and pBoHSP90B) were identified as 47 kDa/97 kDa/118 kDa with a 27 kDa GFP tag, respectively. Prolonged fluorescent protein half-time was observed specifically in pBoHSPs under heat shock treatment at 55 degree celsius, and BoHSP20 showed relatively better thermotolerance than BoHSP70 and BoHSP90B. Significant difference was found between pBoHSPs and controls in the cell survival curve after 2 h of 45 degree celsius heat shock.Conclusion Significant biological properties of heat stress-associated genes of B. orientalis were identified in eukaryote by a new strategy. Fusion proteins pBoHSP20, pBoHSP70 and pBoHSP90B showed good chaperone activity and thermo-stability in this study, implying that BoHSPs played a key role in protecting B. orientalis against heat-stress environment during parasite life cycle. In conclusion, the invitro model explored in this study provides a new way to investigate the biological functions of B. orientalis proteins during the host-parasite interaction.

AB  - Accurately detecting the insect damage caused in plants might reduce losses in crop yields. Hyperspectral data is a well-accepted data source to attend this issue. However, due to their high dimensional, both robust and intelligent methods are required to extract information from these datasets. Therefore, we explore the processing of hyperspectral data with artificial intelligence methods joined with clustering techniques to detect insect herbivory damage in maize plants. We measured the leaf spectral response from three different groups of maize plants: control (undamaged plants); damaged by Spodoptera frugiperda herbivory, and damaged by Dichelops meiacanthus. Data were collected with a FieldSpec 3.0 Spectroradiometer from 350 to 2500 nm for eight consecutive days. We adjusted eight machine learning methods. We also determined the most contributive wavelengths to differentiate undamaged from damaged plants by insect herbivore attack using clustering strategy. For that, we applied the clusterization method based on a self-organizing map (SOM). The Random Forest (RF) model is the overall best learner, and up to the 5th day of analysis represents the most adequate day to segregate maize undamaged from damaged maize. RF was able to separate the three groups of treatments with an F1-measure of up to 96.7% (Recall of 96.7% and Precision of 96.7%). Additionally, we found out that the most representative spectral regions are located in the near-infrared range. Our approach consists of an original contribution to early differentiate the undamaged plant from the damaged one due to insect-attack, highlighting the most contributive wavelengths to map this occurrence.

AB  - Neanderthals are known primarily from their habitation of Western Eurasia, but they also populated large expanses of Northern Asia for thousands of years. Owing to a sparse archaeological record, relatively little is known about these eastern Neanderthal populations. Unlike in their western range, there are limited zooarchaeological and paleobotanical studies that inform us about the nature of their subsistence. Here, we perform a combined analysis of carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes on bone collagen and microbotanical remains in dental calculus to reconstruct the diet of eastern Neanderthals at Chagyrskaya Cave in the Altai Mountains of Southern Siberia, Russia. Stable isotopes identify one individual as possessing a high trophic level due to the hunting of large- and medium-sized ungulates, while the analysis of dental calculus also indicates the presence of plants in the diet of this individual and others from the site. These findings indicate eastern Neanderthals may have had broadly similar subsistence patterns to those elsewhere in their range. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Mining operations have a significant negative impact on the surrounding ecosystems. The operation of mines and quarries creates a large amount of waste that accumulate and are practically unrecyclable in the environment. The involvement of these wastes in economic activity is an extremely urgent task. This can make the economy more sustainable and reduce its influence on ecosystems. This work presents the attempts of using quarry wastes as a fertilizer applied for growing tea crops. The novelty of this research involves revealing the quarry wastes as a fertilizer when growing Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze and assessing changes in the productivity of this plant when applying these calcium wastes. The waste of a quarry intended for extracting crushed stone was studied in this article. The composition of the waste was analyzed. Fertilizers used for manuring the soil were prepared based on the waste. Two experimental sites were selected. One of them was a control, where Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze was grown without using fertilizers. Fertilizers obtained from the waste were applied on the second site. The experimental work proceeded for 10 years. When discussing the results, special attention was paid to climatic conditions. This was caused by the need to show that it was the use of the fertilizer that influenced the change in the yield, not the climatic conditions. As a result of using calcium fertilizers based on the waste, the productivity of Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze was increased. The application of the fertilizers based on the quarry wastes was shown to provide an increase in the yield. The possibility of using calcium fertilizers to overcome unfavorable agroclimatic conditions during the tea cultivation was also demonstrated. To assess the climatic impact of applying new fertilizers, three-dimensional modeling in the "gnuplot v.5.4" software was used. As a result, an increase in the average annual precipitation, from 1000 to 1980 mm/year, in the range of the average annual air temperature, from 14 to 16 & DEG;C, was found to lead to an increase (when using a new fertilizer) in the yield of Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze up to 4.8 times (from 20 to 95 centner/ha). The results have shown that applying fertilizers based on the quarry wastes is also possible in unfavorable climatic conditions.

AB  - Currently, the intraspecific taxonomy of snow sheep (Ovis nivicola) is controversial and needs to be specified using DNA molecular genetic markers. In our previous work using whole-genome single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis, we found that the population inhabiting Kharaulakh Ridge was genetically different from the other populations of Yakut subspecies to which it was usually referred. Here, our study was aimed at the clarification of taxonomic status of Kharaulakh snow sheep using mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. A total of 87 specimens from five different geographic locations of Yakut snow sheep as well as 20 specimens of other recognized subspecies were included in this study. We identified 19 haplotypes, two of which belonged to the population from Kharaulakh Ridge. Median-joining network and Bayesian tree analyses revealed that Kharaulakh population clustered separately from all the other Yakut snow sheep. The divergence time between Kharaulakh population and Yakut snow sheep was estimated as 0.48 +/- 0.19 MYA. Thus, the study of the mtDNA cytb sequences confirmed the results of genome-wide SNP analysis. Taking into account the high degree of divergence of Kharaulakh snow sheep from other groups, identified by both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA markers, we propose to classify the Kharaulakh population as a separate subspecies.

AB  - BackgroundSocial network analysis of animal societies allows scientists to test hypotheses about social evolution, behaviour, and dynamic processes. However, the accuracy of estimated metrics depends on data characteristics like sample proportion, sample size, and frequency. A protocol is needed to assess for bias and robustness of social network metrics estimated for the animal populations especially when a limited number of individuals are monitored.MethodsWe used GPS telemetry datasets of five ungulate species to combine known social network approaches with novel ones into a comprehensive five-step protocol. To quantify the bias and uncertainty in the network metrics obtained from a partial population, we presented novel statistical methods which are particularly suited for autocorrelated data, such as telemetry relocations. The protocol was validated using a sixth species, the fallow deer, with a known population size where similar to 85%\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\sim 85\%$$\end{document} of the individuals have been directly monitored.ResultsThrough the protocol, we demonstrated how pre-network data permutations allow researchers to assess non-random aspects of interactions within a population. The protocol assesses bias in global network metrics, obtains confidence intervals, and quantifies uncertainty of global and node-level network metrics based on the number of nodes in the network. We found that global network metrics like density remained robust even with a lowered sample size, while local network metrics like eigenvector centrality were unreliable for four of the species. The fallow deer network showed low uncertainty and bias even at lower sampling proportions, indicating the importance of a thoroughly sampled population while demonstrating the accuracy of our evaluation methods for smaller samples.ConclusionsThe protocol allows researchers to analyse GPS-based radio-telemetry or other data to determine the reliability of social network metrics. The estimates enable the statistical comparison of networks under different conditions, such as analysing daily and seasonal changes in the density of a network. The methods can also guide methodological decisions in animal social network research, such as sampling design and allow more accurate ecological inferences from the available data. The R package aniSNA enables researchers to implement this workflow on their dataset, generating reliable inferences and guiding methodological decisions.

AB  - The use of brackish water causes chemical changes in cultivated soils. It is therefore necessary to apply strategies that can minimize its negative impacts, such as the use of organic fertilizers. This study aimed to evaluate in the field the chemical attributes of a Red Yellow Argisol under irrigation with saline water and organic fertilizing in an area cultivated with corn. The design was randomized blocks, in a split-plot scheme, with the plots comprising salinity levels for the irrigation water (0.8 and 3.0 dS m-1) and the subplots combinations of organic fertilizers (cattle manure + poultry biofertilizer + goat biofertilizer; cattle manure + goat biofertilizer; cattle manure + poultry biofertilizer; control), with four replications. The 3.0 dS m-1 irrigation has a negative effect on the soil chemical attributes, particularly reducing the pH and increasing the sodium, exchangeable sodium percentage and electrical conductivity of the soil saturation extract. The combination of cattle manure + poultry biofertilizer + goat biofertilizer mitigates the salt stress by favouring the accumulation of nitrogen and organic matter, while the cattle manure + poultry biofertilizer favours the potassium accumulation in the soil. The combination of cattle manure + poultry biofertilizer + goat biofertilizer increases the contents of phosphorus and potassium when using the 0.8 dS m-1 irrigation.

AB  - Estuaries contain some of the highest concentrations of accumulated microplastics (MPs) that can be ingested by abundant deposit-feeding crabs. We investigate MPs in gill, hepatopancreatic, and gastrointestinal tissues of seven intertidal crab species in Kokubu River, Kochi, Japan. By applying a reliable method that considers limits of detection and quantification, we report MPs in 63 of 116 crabs (>50%), with a mean of 3.2 MPs individual-1. Concentrations are greatest in gastrointestinal tracts (62.15%), suggesting that feeding is the main route for MP uptake. PET is the dominant polymer (44%), and fragments are the dominant shape (50%-77%). A greater MPs burden g(-1) body weight is reported for deposit-feeding small ocypodid crabs than for larger herbivorous/ omnivorous grapsoid crabs. Factors possibly influencing MP uptake by crabs include feeding habit, crab size, and ambient MP composition.

AB  - Gall induction is one of the main life strategies of endophagous insects, which serves to provide food and protection against natural enemies. It is proposed that gall size is one of the most important traits in the life history of the inducer insect, since a balance exists between the protection afforded by the gall and exposure to natural enemies. The aims of this study were first to describe the trophic interactions between E. xanthochaeta and its native parasitoids on a new host plant Lippia myriocephala, and then to assess the relationships between gall size, location on the plant architecture and parasitism rates. A community of seven native parasitoid morphospecies was found, representing 22.2% of the overall parasitism, highlighting two wasp species, Torymus sp. (Torymidae) and Pteromalinae (Pteromalidae) as the most abundant. Gall size exhibited significant variations related to their distribution within the plant architecture, with a gradual reduction in size found from the main stem toward the peripheral branches. Such differences were associated with an increase in parasitized pupae and smaller galls were found to be more susceptible to parasitoid attack. Parasitism rates revealed that Torymus sp. uses a broader gall size range than Pteromalinae, and we hypothesized that such variations may be related to certain morphological traits of the parasitoids such as ovipositor length, since the former presents an ovipositor nearly four times longer than the latter. Thus, we infer that growth of bigger galls reduced the likelihood of parasitism of the flies.

AB  - Simple Summary Sheep meat in Greece is considered a by-product of dairy production, associated with undefined quality and low revenues. Production is based on slaughtering of young lambs and consists of light carcasses. Heavy carcasses are scarce and mainly derived from rams and ewes that are no longer appropriate for dairy farming due to age, health or productivity issues; no dietary treatments or fattening protocols are implemented prior to slaughter. Improving production sustainability implies more efficient use of available resources, including local fat-tailed sheep that are reared in high numbers for their milk, although their carcasses are undervalued; supportive research data are scarce. Hence, we used objective methods to assess the quality of carcasses of fat-tailed sheep slaughtered at different live weights (representing five developmental stages, from young lambs to adult sheep) and to compare them with carcasses of thin-tailed sheep, which are considered superior. We found that quality of fat-tailed sheep carcasses was equal or higher compared to thin-tailed. Differences between sexes and developmental stages existed. Slaughtering of fat-tailed sheep at higher live weights (50-70% of the average adult sheep weight) will benefit production quality and quantity, improving profitability and sustainability of the sector. Sheep farming in Greece is focused on milk production. Meat is considered a by-product and consists mainly light carcasses of undefined quality. The main challenge of the sector is to ensure sustainability, and hence efforts are towards efficient use of available resources, including undervalued carcasses of local fat-tailed sheep. The objective here was twofold: (i) to assess the carcass quality of fat-tailed sheep slaughtered at different live weights and (ii) to compare them with carcasses from thin-tailed sheep. In total, 146 fat-tailed and 97 thin-tailed dairy sheep were used. They belonged to five live-weight categories (LWC), representing 25%, 35%, 50%, 70% and 100% of mature body weight. Carcass length/weight/yield/pH and wither height were recorded. Muscle fiber minimum Feret's diameter and meat color/tenderness/moisture/lipid and protein content were determined. Sex and LWC differences in fat-tailed sheep were assessed. Parametric and non-parametric tests were used to compare with thin-tailed sheep, considering the effects of LWC, sex and their interactions with sheep population (fat-tailed/thin-tailed). Most traits were significantly different (p < 0.05) between groups of fat-tailed sheep. Carcass yield of fat-tailed sheep was significantly higher compared to thin-tailed (p < 0.01). Interactions of sheep population with LWC or sex affected wither height, carcass pH, meat color and tenderness (p < 0.05). Fat-tailed sheep meat quality is equal or higher compared to thin-tailed. Finishing weights corresponding to 50 and 70% LWC may improve capitalization of fat-tailed carcasses.

AB  - African elephants (Loxodonta africana) are increasingly exposed to high levels of human disturbance and are threatened by poaching and human-elephant conflict. As anthropogenic pressures continue to increase, both inside and outside protected areas, understanding elephant behavioural responses to human activity is required for future conservation management. Here, we use bycatch data from camera trap surveys to provide inferences on elephant habitat use and temporal activity in Kasungu National Park (KNP), Malawi. The KNP elephant population has declined by similar to 95% since the late 1970s, primarily because of intensive poaching, and information on elephant ecology and behaviour can assist in the species' recovery. Using occupancy modelling, we show that proximity to water is the primary driver of elephant habitat use in KNP, with sites closer to water having a positive effect on elephant site use. Our occupancy results suggest that elephants do not avoid sites of higher human activity, while results from temporal activity models show that elephants avoid peak times of human activity and exhibit primarily nocturnal behaviour when using the KNP road network. As key park infrastructure is located near permanent water sources, elephant spatiotemporal behaviour may represent a trade-off between resource utilisation and anthropogenic-risk factors, with temporal partitioning used to reduce encounter rates. Increased law enforcement activity around permanent water sources could help to protect the KNP elephant population during the dry season. Our findings highlight that camera trap bycatch data can be a useful tool for the conservation management of threatened species beyond the initial scope of research.

AB  - The Linxia Basin of Gansu Province, China contains the most complete record of Miocene kubanochoere fossils from Eurasia. A kubanochoere discovered in the late Early Miocene Shangzhuang Formation (ca. 17.2 Ma) is the earliest known member of the group from Eurasia; it is slightly older than the medium-sized Kubanochoerus marymunnguae discovered in Africa, and may indicate an Eurasian origin for kubanochoeres. A giant-sized kubanochoere found in the upper part of the Middle Miocene Dongxiang Formation (ca. 14.6-12.8 Ma) also occurs in the Dingjiaergou fauna (Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region) and the Halamagai fauna (Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region), of a similar age. Large-sized kubanochoeres discovered in the upper part of the Dongxiang Formation (ca. 14.6-12.8 Ma) and in the late Middle Miocene Hujialiang Formation (ca. 12.8-12.4 Ma) are widespread and elsewhere found in the Dingjiaergou fauna, the Halamagai fauna, the Kekemaideng fauna (Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region), the Koujiacun fauna (Shaanxi Province), and the Quantougou fauna (Gansu Province); they partly coexist with giant or medium-sized kubanochoeres in some localities. Mediumsized kubanochoeres recovered from the boundary between the Hujialiang Formation and the "Liushu Formation" (ca. 12.4-11.6 Ma) are also found in the Laogou fauna, the Lierbao fauna (Qinghai Province) and the Kangping fauna (Gansu Province). Due to significant changes in temperature and atmospheric CO2 during the Mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum and the Mid-Miocene Climate Transition, decreasing levels of available nutrition likely influenced the evolution and size of the kubanochoeres. Coexisting fossil suids may have been another important factor in the extinction of the kubanochoeres in Eurasia and Africa.

AB  - Changes in fish species composition in the principal rivers of the Ararat Plain have been assessed over the last century through an analysis of the literature and field studies. A total of 39 fish species, spread across 12 families and 31 genera, have been documented across the Ararat Plain (Araks River basin within southern Armenia and northeast Turkey). In the Armenian section of the plain, 37 taxa have been recorded, including 12 non-native species. Over the past century, the number of fish species in the Metsamor River has increased from 15 to 23, and from 6 to 23 in the Hrazdan River. Currently 16 of the 21 native fish species, previously recorded, are still present in water bodies of the Armenian part of the plain. Rhinogobius cf. similis has been documented for the first time in this region. The primary reasons for the changes in the ichthyofauna composition in the Armenian part of the Ararat Plain are the introduction and subsequent spread of non-native species into reservoirs. This process involves species such as Rhodeus amarus, Knipowitschia caucasica, species of Gobio and invasive non-native species such as Pseudorasbora parva, Carassius gibelio, Rhinogobius lindbergi, R.cf. similis, and Oncorhynchus mykiss.

AB  - Herein, we evaluated the effects of gonadotropin hormone-releasing hormone (GnRH) administration 84 h after medroxyprogesterone acetate (MAP) sponge removal on follicular growth, ovulation timing, and pregnancy per artificial insemination (AI) in cosynchronized postpartum Nili Ravi buffaloes. In this study, 58 Nili Ravi postpartum buffaloes (DIM = 103 +/- 1.64) were randomly divided into two treatment groups (n = 29/treatment): GnRH-TAI-84 and TAI-84. All buffaloes were administered a MAP sponge for seven days. Upon MAP sponge removal, all the subjects received prostaglandin F-2 alpha (PGF(2 alpha)) and Timed AI (TAI) was performed 84 h after sponge removal. In the GnRHTAI-84 group, the buffaloes received GnRH alongside insemination, whereas in the TAI-84 group, the buffaloes were inseminated without GnRH administration. Follicle diameter and blood estradiol levels were measured every 6 h from 72-108 h after MAP sponge removal. The animals were checked for pregnancy using ultrasonography 40 days after AI. Animals subjected to the GnRH-TAI-84 protocol had a higher follicular growth rate and preovulatory follicle size than those in the TAI-84 group. The follicular diameter was also larger in animals that received GnRH-TAI-84 than in those that received TAI-84 90 and 96 h after MAP sponge removal. Buffaloes in the GnRH-TAI-84 group had lower estradiol concentrations at 90, 96, 102, and 108 h than those in the TAI-84 group. Ovulation in GnRHTAI-84 buffaloes occurred 11 h earlier than that in buffaloes from the TAI-84 group. A shorter interval between AI and ovulation in GnRH-TAI-84 buffaloes (14 h vs. 25 h) led to greater pregnancies per AI (62% vs. 17%) compared to buffaloes from the TAI-84 group.

AB  - Consistent and objective species delimitation is crucial to biodiversity studies, but challenges remain when conflicting taxonomic decisions have been made because different data sets and analytical methods were used to delineate species. In the rhinoceros beetle, Xylotrupes siamensis, the use of different morphological characters has resulted in taxonomic disagreement between studies. We used three molecular loci (mitochondrial CO1 and nuclear ITS2 and H3) to investigate the genetic divergence between populations exhibiting different male horn phenotypes. We also applied an approximate Bayesian computation approach to test alternative historical hypotheses that might explain the present genetic diversity among geographical populations. Furthermore, we used species distribution models to estimate the temporal variation in the geographical distribution of suitable habitats. The results show that the two phenotypic taxa within X. siamensis are not genetically structured and that their genetic structure can be explained using isolation by geographical distance. The emergence of the two phenotypic taxa might have been associated with historical isolation in separate refugia. However, spatial expansion and genetic interchange between populations might have gradually eroded the spatial genetic structure. We demonstrate that understanding the historical processes responsible for phenotypic divergence and genetic diversity among current populations could help with making evolutionarily coherent taxonomic decisions.

AB  - Leeches hold significant medical and pharmaceutical value for antithrombotic treatments, yet their genetic diversity patterns remain poorly understood. We performed population genetic analyses on seven Hirudinaria manillensis populations from southern China using mitochondrial protein-coding genes (MitPCGs). Complete sequences of all 13 MitPCGs were obtained from 74 individuals. Haplotype diversity exhibited a logarithmic relationship with the gene length (R2 = 0.858, p < 0.001), while nucleotide diversity showed a near-perfect alternating low-high pattern (Z = 2.938, p = 0.003). Concatenated sequence analyses indicated high haplotype diversity (>0.5) and low nucleotide diversity (<0.005) across all populations, suggesting a historical bottleneck followed by rapid expansion and mutation accumulation. The haplotype network, haplotype phylogenetics, and genetic structure analyses revealed moderate genetic differentiation across populations, dividing them into three clades: a basal Yunnan population (YNHH), sub-basal Guangxi populations (GXGG, GXLZ, and GXYL), and distal Guangdong/Hainan populations (GDMM, GDZJ, and HNDA). Analysis of historical population demography revealed five phases from ancient to recent times (P1-5): growth, prolonged stability, rapid decline, rapid growth, and secondary decline. These phases correlate strongly with past climatic events, demonstrating that glacial-interglacial cycles profoundly impacted the leech's effective population size. This study provides a key scientific basis for H. manillensis resource conservation and utilization.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the use of thermal imaging obtained by infrared thermography (IRT) to detect cases of subclinical mastitis in dairy cows under commercial conditions of compost barn systems in a region of Brazil with a semiarid climate. Twenty-eight crossbred cows were evaluated twice a day for one week using IRT. Three thermal images were obtained for each cow, referring to the anatomical regions of the right and left fore udder and rear udder. A computer program was used to analyze the images and obtain the right fore udder temperature (RFUT, degrees C), left fore udder temperature (LFUT, degrees C), rear udder temperature (RUT, degrees C), and average udder temperature (AUT, degrees C). In addition, samples of milk from each quarter of the udder were collected for somatic cell count (SCC) to correlate the diseases observed on the thermal image with any infection in the udder region. The results obtained using IRT were subjected to regression and correlation analyses. It was observed that LFUT, RAQT, RUT, and AUT were adjusted in quadratic polynomial models with good prediction of SCC (i.e., infection) with R-2 = 0.92, 0.97, 0.86, and 0.94, respectively. The region of the anterior quarters of the udder was the most promising for imaging, stronger correlations were obtained between LFUT and RFUT with SCC (r = 0.87 and 0.88, respectively). The IRT is a practical technology capable of detecting cases of mastitis in dairy cows with good precision, especially with thermal images from the anatomical region of the front quarters of the udder. However, more detailed studies are needed to make thermal imaging processing a more useful method for routine activities on farms in compost barn systems.

AB  - Drought profoundly affects the morpho-physiological responses of desert plants in dryland. To scrutinize the morpho-physiological responses of nitrogen (N)-fixing legumes (Ammopiptanthus mongolicus, Caragana korshinskii), N-fixing non-legumes (Elaeagnus angustifolia, Hippophae rhamnoides), and non-N-fixing plants (Nitraria tangutorum, Haloxylon ammodendron) under varied drought stress levels (75%, 50%, 25% and 5% of soil water holding capacity), a pot experiment was conducted in greenhouse. Following prolonged water deficit, carbon (C) and N stoichiometry, metabolic rates, plant growth, and biomass distribution of unstressed and stressed plants were recorded. Intensified drought significantly reduced stem, root and whole-plant biomass, with no significant changes observed in leaf dry-fresh mass ratio, specific leaf area, intrinsic water use efficiency and root to shoot ratio. However, other traits were impacted differently, reflecting distinct adaptive strategies to drought among three plant functional types (PFTs). Patterns of trait-soil water content (SWC) relationships varied across different PFTs, with N-fixing non-legumes followed by N-fixing legumes displayed greater sensitivity to SWC variations than non-N-fixing plants. This resulted in a shift from a stronger trait-SWC relationship in N-fixing non-legumes and N-fixing legumes to a less correlated relationship in non-N-fixing plants. The diverse responses to drought among PFTs suggest a shift from N limitation to water limitation as SWC decreases.

AB  - Background Indirect interactions between individual solitary mammals, such as the giant panda, are often overlooked because of their nature, yet are important for maintaining the necessary sociality in solitary species. Methods and results Here, we determined the genetic identity of all giant panda individuals in a local population and matched these identities with their associations to determine social network of this solitary animal. Total thirty-five giant panda individuals were found in our field survey, and we constructed genetic and social networks for thirty-three individuals who successfully obtained genetic, age and sex information. The results showed that sex had great impact on both social network and genetic network, and age may have the potential to influence the social network of the giant pandas. Adult males, mostly in the central of the social network, which appeared significantly larger network connections than adult females. Due to the female-biased dispersal pattern of wild giant pandas, male-male pairs showed higher relatedness than female-female ones and multi-generational patrilinear assemblages are expected in the study area. Conclusions The relatedness of individuals has an influence on the formation of community social structure of giant pandas, and indirect interactions among solitary giant pandas potentially function to reduce competition for resources and inbreeding.

AB  - Precision livestock farming has been shown to not only be beneficial to producer profitability and production efficiency, but also in improving social acceptance and sustainability in livestock production. The research illustrated here utilizes an advanced computer vision system (NUtrack) that allows for the individual identification and tracking of pigs in a standard commercial setting. Traits that would otherwise be impractical to measure and therefore absent from selection criteria, such as the activity level, are easily obtained with this system. The data here suggest that progeny activity levels are impacted by sire EBVs for production traits. In the current study, pigs from boars with superior growth and feed intake EBVs were less active and faster growing compared to all other groups. Further work may lead to genetic selection for activity traits to decrease RFI levels and ultimately improve production rates through reduced calorie expenditure. Activity differences observed across sexes may contribute to managerial improvements in feeding barrows vs. gilts. Ultimately, furthering the objective tracking of activity patterns with NUtrack may help producers overcome difficulties that prevent them from maximizing feed efficiency; with potential for additional benefits to both the producer and the animal.Feed cost accounts for over two-thirds of the variable cost of production. In order to reduce feed costs without sacrificing production numbers, feed efficiency must be improved. Calorie expenditure has been difficult to quantify in the past but is understood to impact residual feed intake (RFI) greatly. The objective of this work was to utilize an advanced computer vision system to evaluate activity levels across sex and sire groups with different expected breeding value combinations for growth and feed intake. A total of 199 pigs from four different sire groups (DNA Genetics Line 600) High Feed Intake/High Growth (HIHG), Low Feed Intake/High Growth (LIHG), High Feed Intake/Low Growth (HILG), and Low Feed Intake/Low Growth (LILG) were utilized at the UNL ENREC farm over 127 days. The NUtrack system allowed for individual monitoring of pigs in group housing to track daily activity traits. In total, HIHG pigs travelled less (p < 0.05; 139 vs. 150 km), spent more time lying (p < 0.05; 2421 vs. 2391 h), and less time eating (p < 0.05; 235 vs. 243 h) when compared to LILG pigs across time. The results suggest variation in activity occurs across the progeny of the sire groups selected to differentiate in growth and feed intake.

AB  - Microplastics (MPs) and heavy metals (HMs) are important pollutants in terrestrial ecosystems. In particular, the "island" landscape's weak resistance makes it vulnerable to pollution. However, there is a lack of research on MPs and HMs in island landscapes. Therefore, we used Helan Mountain as the research area. Assess the concentrations, spatial distribution, ecological risks, sources, and transport of MPs and HMs in the soil and blue sheep (Pseudois nayaur) feces. Variations in geographical distribution showed a connection between human activity and pollutants. Risk assessment indicated soil and wildlife were influenced by long-term pollutant polarization and multi-element inclusion (Igeo, Class I; PHI, Class V; RI (MPs), 33 % Class II, and 17 % Class IV; HI = 452.08). Source apportionment showed that tourism and coal combustion were the primary sources of pollutants. Meanwhile, a new coupling model of PMF/Risk was applied to quantify the source contribution of various risk types indicated transportation roads and tourism sources were the main sources of ecological and health risks, respectively. Improve the traceability of pollution source risks. Furthermore, also developed a novel tracing model for pollutant transportation, revealing a unique "source-sink-source" cycle in pollutant transportation, which provides a new methodological framework for the division of pollution risk areas in nature reserves and the evaluation of spatial transport between sources and sinks. Overall, this study establishes a foundational framework for conducting comprehensive risk assessments and formulating strategies for pollution control and management.

AB  - Breeding success is an important factor determining fecundity with nest predation being the main factor limiting avian breeding success. Understanding of nest predation and its influencing factors are highly significant to explore the dynamics of bird populations and developing appropriate conservation strategies. In two breeding seasons of the year 2020 and 2021, natural nests of the red junglefowl (Gallus gallus jabouillei) were systematically searched and monitored using infrared camera, in two nature reserves (Datian and Bangxi) of tropical Hainan island, China. Results showed that breeding season of the red junglefowl is mainly from March to July, with April being the breeding peak. The clutch size was 5.15 +/- 1.28 (n = 13), and nesting success of natural nests was 31.2%, with nest predation accounting for 45.4% of nest failure. Artificial nest experiments showed that predation rates of artificial nests were 25% (Datian, 2020), 6.67% (Datian, 2021), and 0% (Bangxi, 2020). Rodents, reptiles, and coucals are the main nest predators of red junglefowls, while activities of Hainan Eld's deers (Panolia siamensis) may interfere with the reproduction of red junglefowls. We suggest that the conservation management policies should consider the impacts on junglefowls' breeding success when reconstructing the suitable habitat of the Hainan Eld's deer.

AB  - The deer antler is a fully regenerable and the fastest-growing osseous organ. Circular RNA (circRNA), a novel member of the non-coding RNA family, has significant research potential and crucial roles in biological processes. This study aims to explore the impact and mechanisms of circRNA505 on antler chondrocytes. Functional experiments demonstrated that m5C-modified circRNA505 inhibits antler chondrocyte proliferation, enhances osteogenic differentiation, and facilitates cellular glycolysis. Mechanistically, dual luciferase and AGO2-RIP assays revealed a direct binding relationship between circRNA505, miR-127, and p53. Rescue assays further showed that circRNA505 affects cell proliferation and differentiation through the miR-127/p53 axis. Meanwhile, RNA Antisense Purification (RAP) screening and analysis of related proteins binding to circRNA505 demonstrated that circRNA505 binds to LDHA and increases the level of LDHA phosphorylation through FGFR1 to promote cellular glycolysis by FISH-IF, RIP, and Western blot experiments. Additionally, Me-RIP assays confirmed the m5C methylation modification of circRNA505. NSUN2 mediates the m5C modification of circRNA505, affecting its stability, while the m5C reader ALYREF promotes the nuclear export of circRNA505 in an ALYREF-dependent manner. This study provides new insights into the regulatory mechanisms underlying rapid antler development.

AB  - Background Circulating miRNA molecules are intensively studied for their usefulness as biomarkers of civilization diseases. Meanwhile, it is known that diet can influence the level of miRNA expression in tissues. Methods Our research aimed to determine how a diet containing various sources of fat (rapeseed oil, beef tallow, coconut oil) and different amounts of cDDGS (corn Dried Distilled Grains with Solubles) affects the miRNA profile in pig fat-the main source of circulating miRNAs. For this purpose, we used Next Generation Sequencing of miRNA libraries. Results We observed the highest number of differentially expressed miRNAs in the samples from animals that were fed with coconut oil in the diet compared to all other treatments. In contrary, cDDGS appeared to have little effect on miRNA expression. Conclusions We propose a subset of diet-related, adipose-specific, conservative miRNAs among mammals, namely: ssc-miR-99b, ssc-miR-4334-3p, ssc-miR-146b, ssc-miR-23a. Moreover, we observed that several miRNAs regulated by dietary fats are considered as biomarkers in human and animal diseases.

AB  - Sexual reproduction, despite its associated costs and risks, is prevalent among many organisms, presumably to generate and maintain genetic diversity. This diversity is vital for adapting to environmental changes and combating natural enemies. Paradoxically, several clonal species also exhibit high genetic diversity. One theory for the maintenance of this genetic diversity is frequency-dependent selection, which favours rare genotypes over common ones, limiting the extent and dominance of a single clone, thereby preserving genetic diversity. Empirical evidence for this theory under natural conditions is sparse. Twelve years ago, we established in the forest 14 genetically diverse plots where all plants had a unique genotype (rare genotypes) and paired with them clonal plots where all plants had the same genotype (common genotypes) to test whether common genotypes have a disadvantage and frequency-dependent selection is in action. Clones were created from cuttings from Piper cordulatum, a naturally clonally reproducing understorey plant. We aimed to test whether common genotypes are disadvantaged and whether frequency-dependent selection is effective in limiting the dominance of clones and preserving genetic diversity. Over the experiment's first 10 years, herbivory, pathogen attacks and plant size remained similar across both genotype categories. Intriguingly, clones exhibited superior survival during the initial 5 years. Survival rates equalized for rare and common genotypes by the decade's end. By year 12, survival remained similar for rare and common genotypes. However, modelled survival projections based on the 12-year-long trend suggest that common genotypes might experience increased mortality in the long run, consistent with the hypothesis of negative frequency-dependent selection. Moreover, plants in clonal plots exhibited lower fitness in terms of infructescence production at the plot level by the tenth year. Our findings suggest that having low genetic diversity in the neighbourhood does not increase disease or herbivory susceptibility or reduce short-term survival. The impact of negative frequency-dependent selection is not immediate. However, it could eventually restrict the survival and reproduction of Piper clones in a tropical forest's understorey, curbing the dominance of any single genotype and potentially maintain genetic diversity.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.
   La mayor & iacute;a de los organismos se reproduce sexualmente, a pesar de sus costos y riesgos asociados, presumiblemente para generar y mantener la diversidad gen & eacute;tica. Esta diversidad es vital para que puedan adaptarse a los cambios ambientales y combatir enemigos naturales. Parad & oacute;jicamente, se ha observado que muchas especies clonales exhiben alta diversidad gen & eacute;tica. Se ha propuesto que la selecci & oacute;n dependiente de la frecuencia, que favorece a los genotipos raros sobre los comunes, podr & iacute;a limitar la extensi & oacute;n y dominancia de un solo clon, preservando as & iacute; la diversidad gen & eacute;tica. Sin embargo, hay poca evidencia emp & iacute;rica de esta hip & oacute;tesis bajo condiciones naturales. Hace doce a & ntilde;os establecimos en el bosque catorce parcelas gen & eacute;ticamente diversas donde todas las plantas ten & iacute;an un genotipo & uacute;nico (genotipos raros) y otras catorce parcelas que llamamos clonales donde todas las plantas ten & iacute;an el mismo genotipo (genotipos comunes) para probar si los genotipos comunes est & aacute;n en desventaja y si ocurre selecci & oacute;n dependiente de la frecuencia. Los clones se crearon a partir de esquejes de Piper cordulatum, una planta de sotobosque que se reproduce clonalmente de forma natural. Nuestro objetivo era probar si los genotipos comunes est & aacute;n en desventaja y si la selecci & oacute;n dependiente de la frecuencia es efectiva para limitar la dominancia de los clones y preservar la diversidad gen & eacute;tica. Durante los primeros diez a & ntilde;os del experimento, la herbivor & iacute;a, los ataques de pat & oacute;genos y el tama & ntilde;o de las plantas permanecieron similares en ambos tratamientos. Sorprendentemente, los clones exhibieron una supervivencia superior durante los primeros cinco a & ntilde;os. Las tasas de supervivencia se igualaron al final de los diez a & ntilde;os y siguieron siendo similares al llegar el duod & eacute;cimo a & ntilde;o. Sin embargo, las proyecciones de supervivencia modeladas, basadas en la tendencia de doce a & ntilde;os, sugieren que los genotipos comunes podr & iacute;an experimentar una mayor mortalidad a largo plazo, lo que es consistente con la hip & oacute;tesis de selecci & oacute;n dependiente de la frecuencia negativa. Adem & aacute;s, las plantas en parcelas clonales exhibieron un menor & eacute;xito reproductivo en el d & eacute;cimo a & ntilde;o. Nuestros hallazgos indican que tener baja diversidad gen & eacute;tica en el vecindario no aumenta la susceptibilidad a enfermedades o herbivor & iacute;a, ni reduce la supervivencia a corto plazo. Sin embargo, la selecci & oacute;n dependiente de la frecuencia si reduce la reproducci & oacute;n y la supervivencia a largo plazo de clones en el sotobosque, sugiriendo que es un mecanismo que puede limitar la dominancia de un genotipo & uacute;nico y ayudar a mantener la diversidad gen & eacute;tica.

AB  - Cadmium (Cd) pollution is on the rise due to rapid urbanization, which emphasize the potential adverse effects on plant biodiversity and human health. Wedelia as a dominant invasive species, is tested for its tolerance to Cdtoxicity and herbivore infestation. We investigate defense mechanism system of invasive Wedelia trilobata and its native congener Wedelia chinensis against the Cd-pollution and Spodoptera litura infestation. We found that Cdtoxicity significantly increase hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), Malondialdehyde (MDA) and hydroxyl ions (O2 center dot-) in W. chinensis 20.61%, 4.78% and 15.68% in leave and 27.44%, 25.52% and 30.88% in root, respectively. The photosynthetic pigments (Chla, Chla and Caro) and chlorophyll florescence (Fo and Fv/Fm) declined by (60.23%, 58.48% and 51.96%), and (73.29% and 55.75%) respectively in W. chinensis and (44.76%, 44.24% and 44.30%), and (54.66% and 45.36%) in W. trilobata under Cd treatment and S. litura. Invasive W. trilobata had higher enzymatic antioxidant SOD 126.9/71.64%, POD 97.24/94.92%, CAT 53.99/25.62% and APX 82.79/50.19%, and nonenzymatic antioxidant ASA 10.47/16.87%, DHA 15.07/27.88%, GSH 15.91/10.03% and GSSG 13.56/ 17.93% activity in leaf/root, respectively. Overall, W. trilobata accumulate higher Cd content 55.41%, 50.61% and 13.95% in root, shoot and leaf tissues respectively, than its native congener W. chinensis. While, nutrient profile of W. chinensis reveals less uptake of Fe, Cu and Zn than W. trilobata. W. trilobata showed efficient alleviation of oxidative damage through upregulating the genes related to key defense such as SOD, POD, CAT, APX, GR, PROL, FLV, ABA and JAZ, and metal transporter in leaves, shoot and root tissues, respectively. Conclusively, W. trilobata efficiently employed Cd-triggered defense for successful invasion, even under S. litura infestation, in Cd-contaminated soil.

AB  - Although plants harbor a huge phytochemical diversity, only a fraction of plant metabolites is functionally characterized. In this work, we aimed to identify the genetic basis of metabolite functions during harsh environmental conditions in Arabidopsis thaliana. With machine learning algorithms we predicted stress-specific metabolomes for 23 (a)biotic stress phenotypes of 300 natural Arabidopsis accessions. The prediction models identified several aliphatic glucosinolates (GLSs) and their breakdown products to be implicated in responses to heat stress in siliques and herbivory by Western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis. Bivariate GWA mapping of the metabolome predictions and their respective (a)biotic stress phenotype revealed genetic associations with MAM, AOP, and GS-OH, all three involved in aliphatic GSL biosynthesis. We, therefore, investigated thrips herbivory on AOP, MAM, and GS-OH loss-of-function and/or overexpression lines. Arabidopsis accessions with a combination of MAM2 and AOP3, leading to 3-hydroxypropyl dominance, suffered less from thrips feeding damage. The requirement of MAM2 for this effect could, however, not be confirmed with an introgression line of ecotypes Cvi and Ler, most likely due to other, unknown susceptibility factors in the Ler background. However, AOP2 and GS-OH, adding alkenyl or hydroxy-butenyl groups, respectively, did not have major effects on thrips feeding. Overall, this study illustrates the complex implications of aliphatic GSL diversity in plant responses to heat stress and a cell-content-feeding herbivore.

AB  - Simple Summary Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith) has been recently identified as a notorious global crop pest that affects wheat production in China. Therefore, exploring preventive solutions based on agricultural strategies is a cost effective and eco-friendly approach in realizing sustainable pest management. The wheat-faba bean intercropping model mitigates the damage caused by wheat aphids, while the possible benefit of this pattern in the control of S. frugiperda remains unevaluated. To provide a fundamental basis for implementing this strategy in a wheat field for S. frugiperda management, this novel study attempted to extensively evaluate the effects of feeding wheat and faba bean plants on S. frugiperda performance and preference and to reveal the underlying mechanisms associated with the biochemical and morphological traits of the two host species. Our results suggested that the faba bean plants exhibited significant antibiosis on larvae and repellency to the females of S. frugiperda compared with wheat plants. Therefore, we concluded the potential usefulness of the faba bean plants as a push crop. These findings will facilitate the adoption of wheat and faba bean intercropping systems against S. frugiperda in the wheat-growing regions of China. Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith), which attacked China in 2019, remains a significant threat to wheat production. Wheat-faba bean intercropping systems prevent damage caused by wheat aphids; however, the potential role in S. frugiperda control remains unclear. Here, the adaptability and preferences of S. frugiperda to wheat and its common intercropped plant, faba bean, were evaluated to implement an eco-friendly approach for S. frugiperda management. Their adaptability showed that both hosts could support S. frugiperda to complete their life cycle; however, the larvae performed worse on faba bean compared with on wheat. The biochemical analysis revealed that faba bean plants had lower contents of soluble sugars and total proteins but higher levels of phenolics and tannins than in wheat leaves. The gravid S. frugiperda preferred (during the preference assays) to oviposit on wheat rather than on faba bean plants in cage tests. The wheat odor was preferred over the faba bean odor in the Y-tube olfactometer bioassays. The morphological scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed increased trichome density on wheat leaves. Therefore, the faba bean plants displayed antibiosis on larvae and were repellent to female moths, thus, suggesting that faba bean plants could serve as a push crop to be intercropped with wheat for S. frugiperda control for wheat fields.

AB  - Simple Summary The Barki sheep is one of the three main breeds in Egypt, which is spread mainly throughout the northwestern coastal zone, which has harsh conditions. Considering the harsh, semi-arid habitat of this breed, milk performance traits such as milk yield and milk composition have a very important role in the feeding of newborn lambs and affect their growth during the early stage of life. In this study, rare milk performance data and genomic information of Barki sheep were used to uncover diversified genomic regions that could explain the variability of milk yield and milk quality traits in the studied population of Barki ewes. Genome-wide analysis identified genomic regions harboring interesting candidate genes such as SLC5A8, NUB1, TBC1D1, KLF3 and ABHD5 for milk yield and PPARA and FBLN1 genes for milk quality traits. The findings offer valuable information for obtaining a better understanding of the genetics of milk performance traits and contribute to the genetic improvement of these traits in Barki sheep. Sheep milk yield and milk composition traits play an important role in supplying newborn lambs with essential components such as amino acids, energy, vitamins and immune antibodies and are also of interest in terms of the nutritional value of the milk for human consumption. The aim of this study was to identify genomic regions and candidate genes for milk yield and milk composition traits through genome-wide SNP analyses between high and low performing ewes of the Egyptian Barki sheep breed, which is well adapted to the harsh conditions of North-East Africa. Therefore, out of a herd of 111 ewes of the Egyptian Barki sheep breed (IBD = 0.08), ewes representing extremes in milk yield and milk quality traits (n = 25 for each group of animals) were genotyped using the Illumina OvineSNP50 V2 BeadChip. The fixation index (F-ST) for each SNP was calculated between the diversified groups. F-ST values were Z-transformed and used to identify putative SNPs for further analysis (Z(F-ST) > 10). Genome-wide SNP analysis revealed genomic regions covering promising candidate genes related to milk performance traits such as SLC5A8, NUB1, TBC1D1, KLF3 and ABHD5 for milk yield and PPARA and FBLN1 genes for milk quality trait. The results of this study may contribute to the genetic improvement of milk performance traits in Barki sheep breed and to the general understanding of the genetic contribution to variability in milk yield and quality traits.

AB  - One of the most important factors influencing animal growth is non-genetics, which includes factors like nutrition, management and environmental conditions. By consuming their prey, predators can directly affect their ecology and evolution, but they can also have an indirect impact by affecting their prey's nutrition and reproduction. Preys used to change their habitats, their foraging and vigilance habits as anti-predator responses. Cooperation during hunting by the predators develops significant fear in their prey which indirectly affects their nutrition. In this work, we propose a two-species stage-structured predator-prey system where the prey are classified into juvenile and mature prey. We assume that the conversion of juvenile prey to matured prey is affected by the fear of predation risk. Non-negativity and boundedness of the solutions are demonstrated theoretically. All the biologically feasible equilibrium states are determined, and their stabilities are analyzed. The role of various important factors, e.g. hunting cooperation rate, predation rate and rate of fear, on the system dynamics is discussed. To visualize the dynamical behavior of the system, extensive numerical experiments are performed by using MATLAB and MatCont 7.3. Finally, the proposed model is extended into a harvesting model under quadratic harvesting strategy and the associated control problem has been analyzed for optimal harvesting.

AB  - The use of deer antlers dates back thousands of years in Chinese history. Deer antlers have antitumor, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties and can be used in treating neurological diseases. However, only a few studies have reported the immunomodulatory mechanism of deer antler active compounds. Using network pharmacology, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulation techniques, we analyzed the underlying mechanism by which deer antlers regulate the immune response. We identified 4 substances and 130 core targets that may play immunomodulatory roles, and the beneficial and non-beneficial effects in the process of immune regulation were analyzed. The targets were enriched in pathways related to cancer, human cytomegalovirus infection, the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, human T cell leukemia virus 1 infection, and lipids and atherosclerosis. Molecular docking showed that AKT1, MAPK3, and SRC have good binding activity with 17 beta estradiol and estrone. Additionally, the molecular dynamics simulation of the molecular docking result using GROMACS software (version: 2021.2) was performed and we found that the AKT1-estrone complex, 17 beta estradiol-AKT1 complex, estrone-MAPK3 complex, and 17 beta estradiol-MAPK3 complex had relatively good binding stability. Our research sheds light on the immunomodulatory mechanism of deer antlers and provides a theoretical foundation for further exploration of their active compounds.

AB  - Contributory citizen science programs focused on ecological monitoring can produce fine-grained and expansive data sets across spatial and temporal scales. With this data collection potential, citizen scientists can significantly impact the ability to monitor ecological patterns. However, scientists still harbor skepticism about using citizen science data in their work, generally due to doubts about data quality. Numerous peer-reviewed articles have addressed data quality in citizen science. Yet, many of these methods are not useable by third-party scientists (scientists who are not directly involved in the citizen science program). In addition, these methods generally capture internal data quality rather than a dataset's potential to be used for a specific purpose. Assessing data fitness for use represents a promising approach to evaluating data accuracy and quality for different applications and contexts. In this article, we employ a Spatial, Temporal, Aptness, and Application (STAAq) assessment approach to assess data fitness for use of citizen science datasets. We tested the STAAq assessment approach through a case study examining the distribution of caribou in Denali National Park and Preserve. Three different datasets were used in the test, Map of Life data (a global scale citizen science mobile application for recording species observations), Ride Observe and Record data (a program sponsored by the park staff where incentivized volunteers observe species in the park), and conventionally collected radio collar data. The STAAq assessment showed that the Map of Life and Ride Observe and Record program data are fit for monitoring caribou distribution in the park. This data fitness for use approach is a promising way to assess the external quality of a dataset and its fitness to address particular research or monitoring questions. This type of assessment may help citizen science skeptics see the value and potential of citizen science collected data and encourage the use of citizen science data by more scientists.

AB  - Neophobia - an animal's reluctance to approach novel objects, try new foods, or explore unfamiliar environments - affects whether animals can adapt to new environments and exploit novel resources. However, despite its importance, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying this personality trait are poorly understood. In this study, we examined regional brain activity using the expression of two immediate early genes (IEGs), ZENK and c-Fos, in response to novel objects or control conditions in captive house sparrows (Passer domesticus, n = 22). When exposed to novel objects, we predicted that we would see differential IEG activity in brain regions involved in regulating stress and emotion (hippocampus, medial ventral arcopallium, lateral septum), reward and learning (striatum), and executive function (NCL) between neophobic and non-neophobic individuals. To classify birds by phenotype, we used behavior trials that tested willingness to approach a food dish in the presence of several different novel objects, habituation to one novel object, and willingness to try several different novel foods. We then exposed birds to a new novel object or a control condition and assessed protein expression of two IEGs in neophobic vs non-neophobic individuals after this final exposure. An analysis of average sparrow feeding times in the presence of novel objects showed a bimodal distribution of neophobia behavior. There was also high repeatability of individual novel object responses, and average responses to all three trial types (novel object, novel food, and habituation to a novel object) were significantly correlated. Although we saw no differences between neophobic and non-neophobic birds in IEG expression in response to novel objects in any of the 6 brain regions examined, there was a significant global decrease in ZENK expression and a significant increase in c-Fos expression in the medial ventral arcopallium and the caudal hippocampus in response to novel objects compared to controls, suggesting that these two regions may be important in novelty detection and threat perception. Additionally, there was no object effect in the rostral hippocampus, which supports the hypothesis that the avian hippocampus may have a rostrocaudal functional gradient similar to the septotemporal gradient in mammals.

AB  - Simple Summary Human-animal relations during Prehistory are an increasingly discussed issue among scholars. Cervids are a symbolically prominent species among hunter-gatherers but are also of relevance to pastoralists. We present a synthesis of available data regarding human-deer relations in Portuguese Late Prehistory. This is achieved by examining deer abundance in subsistence, together with their inclusion in social practices such as food-sharing and their involvement in structured depositions in both funerary and non-funerary contexts. Additionally, the study investigates the utilization of deer remains for the creation of artifacts and their depiction in pottery decoration, figures, and rock art. The dynamics of deer prevalence in subsistence have varied diachronically and synchronically in the periods and areas under study. Although the reasons and meanings for this behavior continue to be discussed, their sociocultural and ideological relevance seems to have persisted in early agropastoral and metallurgical societies, even as they undergo change.Abstract Human-animal relations have been a fruitful research topic worldwide. The importance of deer in hunter-gatherer societies is undeniable, with cervids being commonly found in archaeological and past artistic records, with a notable amount of information recovered in the Iberian Peninsula. This relevance continues during Late Prehistory, but the attempt to discuss cervids under broader perspectives and based on different types of data is not as common. We intend to approach human-deer relations in Central and Southern Portuguese Late Prehistory by considering the zooarchaeological records, both deer abundance in faunal spectra and their presence in "meaningful" assemblages and structured depositions, as well as the use of deer and deer body parts in other socio-cultural and ideological practices. The synthesis of available data shows that human-deer relations changed through time and space, with different abundances related to hunting depending on chronology and geography. The use of deer or their body parts as a resource of symbolic nature also varied, being included in food-sharing events, offerings, structured depositions, and graphic representations. Changeability is part of the different relationships, ontologies, and cosmogonies that humans and deer developed in the Late Prehistoric relational world.

AB  - As important components of the mammalian diet and tissues, fats are involved in a variety of biological processes in addition to providing energy. In general, the increase in basal metabolism and health risks under cold temperature conditions causes the host to need more energy to maintain body temperature and normal biological processes. The intestine and its microbiota are key components in orchestrating host metabolic homeostasis and immunity, and respond rapidly to changing environmental conditions. However, the role of dietary-fat supplementation in regulating host homeostasis of metabolism and barrier functions through gut microbiota at cold temperatures is incompletely understood. Our results showed that dietary-fat supplementation alleviated the negative effects of cold temperatures on the alpha-diversity of both ileal and colonic microbiota. Cold temperatures altered the ileal and colonic microbiota of pigs, and the extent of changes was more pronounced in the colonic microbiota. Translocation of the gut microbiota was restored after supplementation with a high-fat diet. In addition, cold temperatures exacerbated ileal mucosal damage and inflammation, and disrupted barrier function, which may be associated with decreased concentrations of butyrate and isobutyrate. Cold temperature-induced metabolic dysbiosis was manifested by altered hormone levels and upregulation of expression of multiple metabolites involved in metabolism (lipids, amino acids and minerals) and the immune response. Supplementation with a high-fat diet restored metabolic homeostasis and barrier function by improving gut-microbiota composition and increasing SCFAs concentrations in pigs. In conclusion, cold temperatures induced severe translocation of microbiota and barrier damage. These actions increased the risk of metabolic imbalance. Dietary-fat supplementation alleviated the adverse effects of cold temperatures on host metabolism by remodeling the gut microbiota.

AB  - Simple Summary In the realm of livestock management, accurately estimating the weight of pigs presents a critical yet challenging task, particularly in the dynamic environment of farms.

To address these challenges, our study focuses on developing a novel method that simplifies weight estimation while adapting to the constantly changing conditions of real-world pig farms. Our solution, the moving pig weight estimate algorithm based on deep vision (MPWEADV), marks a significant step in this direction. It employs advanced imaging technology to capture both the visual appearance and depth information of moving pigs. The central idea is to combine these two types of data for more accurate weight estimates than traditional methods could provide. To validate our proposed method, we replicated two recently published methods and demonstrated through experimental results that our pig weight estimation model could rapidly and accurately determine the weight of pigs in the challenging scenarios we constructed. This model operates in an unconstrained environment, providing real-time evaluation of pigs' weight, thereby offering data support for grading and adjusting breeding plans, indicating a wide range of potential applications.Abstract In the field of livestock management, noncontact pig weight estimation has advanced considerably with the integration of computer vision and sensor technologies. However, real-world agricultural settings present substantial challenges for these estimation techniques, including the impacts of variable lighting and the complexities of measuring pigs in constant motion. To address these issues, we have developed an innovative algorithm, the moving pig weight estimate algorithm based on deep vision (MPWEADV). This algorithm effectively utilizes RGB and depth images to accurately estimate the weight of pigs on the move. The MPWEADV employs the advanced ConvNeXtV2 network for robust feature extraction and integrates a cutting-edge feature fusion module. Supported by a confidence map estimator, this module effectively merges information from both RGB and depth modalities, enhancing the algorithm's accuracy in determining pig weight. To demonstrate its efficacy, the MPWEADV achieved a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 4.082 kg and a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 2.383% in our test set. Comparative analyses with models replicating the latest research show the potential of the MPWEADV in unconstrained pig weight estimation practices. Our approach enables real-time assessment of pig conditions, offering valuable data support for grading and adjusting breeding plans, and holds broad prospects for application.

AB  - The Slovenian autochthonous breed, Kr & scaron;kopolje pig, is known for high fatness and better adaptability to different environmental conditions and feed resources. However, the metabolic processes underlying these adaptations, especially in response to different diets, have not yet been studied. A deeper understanding of these mechanisms could provide valuable insights into the breed's adaptability to different environmental conditions. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of a low-protein (LP) diet on adipose tissue in Kr & scaron;kopolje pigs reared in either organic outdoor (n = 2 x 12) or conventional indoor (n = 2 x 14) systems. In the outdoor system, the LP diet had no effect on adipocyte size compared to the control (high-protein) diet, while it increased lipogenic enzyme activities and monounsaturated fatty acid content, and decreased polyunsaturated fatty acid content (p < 0.05). RNA sequencing revealed the upregulation of 28 genes and the downregulation of 37 genes. The upregulated genes were mainly involved in lipid metabolism (ACLY, FASN, ACACA, MOGAT2), oxidative stress, and mitochondrial function. In the indoor system, pigs on the LP diet had smaller adipocytes (p < 0.05), whereas no differences were detected in the lipogenic enzyme activities or fatty acid composition (p > 0.10). RNA sequencing revealed 30 upregulated and 28 downregulated genes. In the indoor system, heat shock proteins (HSP70.2, HSPA6) were upregulated in pigs on the LP diet, while genes involved in the innate immune system (MSR1, TREM2, CSF3R) were downregulated. To conclude, the present study showed that LP diet affected adipose tissue metabolism and gene expression in Kr & scaron;kopolje pigs, with different transcriptomic responses observed in outdoor and indoor rearing conditions.

AB  - Breeding constitutes the main socio-economic activity in the steppic regions in Algeria but also a major handicap in terms of sustainable spatial planning. The present study aims to analyze the land occupation dynamics during the period 2000 - 2015 in the region of Sidi Abderrahmane (Tiaret, Algeria) in a perspective of sustainable spatial planning. The obtained results demonstrate a significant regression of steppe and chotts areas against an increase in agricultural spaces even in low fertile soils already deteriorated by drought and desertification. The decisive areas (steppe and wet), which play an economic and ecological role guaranteeing sustainability are threatened and have been reduced by 36,800 ha, which represent 22% of the total area. These findings highlight an advanced and almost irremediable degradation of land which was overexploited by breeding with a pastoral charge exceeding 2.5 sheep/hectare. The extension of agricultural areas on rangelands is another reflection followed by the advance of the dunes. This alarming state of steppe degradation requires the urgent implementation of stern program to manage, rehabilitate and restore these buffer regions against the advance of the desert through the reconciliation between local populations and their natural environment.

AB  - Models using in vitro produced buffalo embryos and in vitro cultured uterine epithelial cells (UECs) may be useful in understanding the intricacies of embryo-uterine cross talk. In the present study, buffalo UECs were obtained from slaughterhouse derived non-gravid uterus. UECs monolayer was treated with steroids (10pg/ml estradiol for 24h and 3.14 ng/ml progesterone for another 5 days). In vitro produced buffalo blastocysts were co-cultured over steroid treated UECs monolayer and at 72 h of co-culture, embryo attachment rate was higher in UECs treated with steroids (71.86% vs. 26.55%) while no attachment was observed on plastic surface. Naturally hatched or assisted hatched blastocysts were co-cultured over UECs monolayer treated with 3.14ng/ml progesterone (P4), or without any treatment for 72 h and the effect of co-culture on the expression profile of adhesion related biomolecules was analyed in UECs and blastocysts. Cultured UECs and blastocysts cultured in embryo culture media were considered as control. It was observed that the expression of MUC1 in UECs was significantly (p < 0.05) higher in control group than treatment groups. The relative mRNA abundance of integrins and osteopontin was significantly (p < 0.05) higher in UECs and blastocysts of treatment groups than control group. Expression of IFN-tau was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in embryos co-cultured with UECs than other treatment groups. It can be concluded that P4 supplementation is required for the modulation of adhesion molecules and co-culture of blastocysts and UECs together affect the expression of adhesion molecules both in blastocyts and in UECs.

AB  - Increasing planting density is one of the most effective ways to improve crop yield. However, one major factor that limits crop planting density is the weakened immunity of plants to pathogens and insects caused by dim light (DL) under shade conditions. The molecular mechanism underlying how DL compromises plant immunity remains unclear. Here, we report that DL reduces rice (Oryza sativa) resistance against brown planthopper (BPH; Nilaparvata lugens) by elevating ethylene (ET) biosynthesis and signaling in a Phytochrome B (OsPHYB)-dependent manner. The DL-reduced BPH resistance is relieved in osphyB mutants, but aggravated in OsPHYB overexpressing plants. Further, we found that DL reduces the nuclear accumulation of OsphyB, thus alleviating Phytochrome Interacting Factor Like14 (OsPIL14) degradation, consequently leading to the up-regulation of 1-Aminocyclopropane-1-Carboxylate Oxidase1 (OsACO1) and an increase in ET levels. In addition, we found that nuclear OsphyB stabilizes Ethylene Insensitive Like2 (OsEIL2) by competitively interacting with EIN3 Binding F-Box Protein (OsEBF1) to enhance ET signaling in rice, which contrasts with previous findings that phyB blocks ET signaling by facilitating Ethylene Insensitive3 (EIN3) degradation in other plant species. Thus, enhanced ET biosynthesis and signaling reduces BPH resistance under DL conditions. Our findings provide insights into the molecular mechanism of the light-regulated ET pathway and host-insect interactions and potential strategies for sustainable insect management.

AB  - Temperate-zone species frequently employ hibernation as a winter energy-saving strategy to overcome periods with unfavourable ambient conditions and low food availability. With winters becoming warmer and seasons becoming less predictable, one question is whether species will show flexibility in the use of hibernation and whether this will be sufficient to keep pace with rapid anthropogenic alteration of the environment. We examined the hibernation pattern of a wild hedgehog population (Erinaceus europaeus) in a semi-rural habitat in the north-west of England that is subject to a mild winter climate. We conducted night surveys across a 1-year study period, collecting population-level activity data on a total of 26 individuals as well as detailed data on hibernation timing and pattern in five individuals tagged with temperature-sensitive VHF tags through the hibernation period. While all five tagged individuals employed hibernation, we found a variation of up to 93 days in the hibernation start date and 47 days in end date between individuals, although the general pattern of hibernation such as average torpor bout duration was similar. Some individuals used shorter torpor bouts over an extended period in combination with extended activity of several days prior to the onset and after termination of hibernation, presumable allowing them to save energy during the colder nights while being able to forage during warmer days when invertebrates were active. This flexibility in hibernation timing suggests that hedgehogs may be able to adapt to changing environmental conditions.

AB  - Perturbations always affect livestock during the breeding process, including harmful diseases. Researching the impact of disease outbreaks on pig herds is extremely important so that disease control measures can be applied early. However, conducting practical experiments on disease outbreaks is extremely expensive. Precision feeding systems (PFS) for pigs use data on the animal's own feed intake to calculate the appropriate amount of feed for each individual. This helps increase productivity and product quality while contributing to reducing waste generation in the environment. Daily feed intake (DFI) and cumulative feed intake (CFI) data can be automatically collected and estimated from the PFS, which can help detect or predict disease outbreaks. In this article, we introduce an advanced simulation model of the PFS for pigs and the integration of disease outbreak models into this system. A disease outbreak simulation application within the pig herd raised by the precision feeding method is also developed for running high-performance experimental simulations. The results of the simulation scenarios are analyzed and compared with data from a real-world experiment to assess the accuracy of the application. The correlation coefficient values of DFI in all scenarios fall within the range of 0.25 to 0.5, suggesting almost no correlation between simulated DFI and actual DFI. The overall average correlation coefficient of CFI for all scenarios is 0.764, falling within the strong correlation range. It can be concluded that the simulation accurately represents CFI values compared to reality.

AB  - Studies on plant-mediated interactions between root parasitic nematodes and aboveground herbivores are rapidly increasing. However, outcomes for the interacting organisms vary, and the mechanisms involved remain ambiguous. We hypothesized that the impact of root infection by the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita on the performance of the aboveground caterpillar Spodoptera exigua is modulated by the nematode's infection cycle. We challenged root-knot nematode-infected tomato plants with caterpillars when the nematode's infection cycle was at the invasion, galling, and reproduction stages. We found that M. incognita root infection enhanced S. exigua performance during the galling stage, while it did not affect the caterpillar's performance at the invasion and reproduction stages. Molecular and chemical analyses performed at the different stages of the nematode infection cycle revealed that M. incognita root infection systemically affected the jasmonic acid-, salicylic acid-, and abscisic acid-related responses, as well as the changes in the leaf metabolome triggered during S. exigua feeding. The M. incognita-induced leaf responses varied over the nematode's root infection cycle. These findings suggest that specific leaf responses triggered systemically by the nematode at its different life-cycle stages underlie the differential impact of M. incognita on plant resistance against the caterpillar S. exigua.

AB  - Endometrial receptivity represents one of the leading factors affecting the successful implantation of embryos during early pregnancy. However, the mechanism of microRNAs (miRNAs) to establish goat endometrial receptivity remains unclear. This study was intended to identify potential miRNAs and regulatory mechanisms associated with establishing endometrial receptivity through integrating bioinformatics analysis and experimental verification. MiRNA expression profiles were obtained by high-throughput sequencing, resulting in the detection of 33 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs), followed by their validation through quantitative RT-PCR. Furthermore, 10 potential transcription factors (TFs) and 1316 target genes of these DEMs were obtained, and the TF-miRNA and miRNA-mRNA interaction networks were constructed. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses indicated that these miRNAs were significantly linked to establishing endometrial receptivity. Moreover, the fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis, dual-luciferase report assay, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis corroborated that chi-miR-483 could directly bind to deltex E3 ubiquitin ligase 3L (DTX3L) to reduce its expression level. In conclusion, our findings contribute to a better understanding of molecular mechanisms regulating the endometrial receptivity of goats, and they provide a reference for improving embryo implantation efficiency.

AB  - Flowering plants use volatiles to attract pollinators while deterring herbivores. Vegetative and floral traits may interact to affect insect behavior. Pollinator behavior is most likely influenced by leaf traits when larval stages interact with plants in different ways than adult stages, such as when larvae are leaf herbivores but adult moths visit flowers as pollinators. Here, we determine how leaf induction and corresponding volatile differences in induced plants influence behavior in adult moths and whether these preferences align with larval performance. We manipulated vegetative induction in four Nicotiana species. Using paired induced and control plants of the same species with standardized artificial flowers, we measured foraging and oviposition choices by their ecologically and economically important herbivore/pollinator, Manduca sexta. In parallel, we measured growth rates of M. sexta larvae fed leaves from control or induced plants to determine if this was consistent with female oviposition preference. Lastly, we used plant headspace collections and gas chromatography to quantify volatile compounds from both induced and control leaves to link changes in plant chemistry with moth behavior. In the absence of floral chemical cues, vegetative defensive status influenced adult moth foraging preference from artificial flowers in one species (N. excelsior), where females nectared from induced plants more often than control plants. Plant vegetative resistance consistently influenced oviposition choice such that moths deposited more eggs on control plants than on induced plants of all four species. This oviposition preference for control plants aligned with higher larval growth rates on control leaves compared with induced leaves. Control and induced plants of each species had similar leaf volatile profiles, but induced plants had higher emission levels. Leaves of N. excelsior produced the most volatile compounds, including some inducible compounds typically associated with floral scent. We demonstrate that vegetative plant defensive volatiles play a role in host plant selection and that insects assess information from leaves differently when choosing between nectaring and oviposition locations. These results underscore the complex interactions between plants, their pollinators, and herbivores.

AB  - In pig production, pigs often show more aggressive behavior after mixing, which adversely affects animal welfare and growth performance. The Jumonji and structural domain-rich AT interaction domain 2 (JARID2) gene plays an important role in neurodevelopment in mice and various psychiatric disorders in humans. The JARID2 gene may impact the aggressive behavior of pigs. By observing the behavior of 500 weaned pigs during the first 72 h after mixing, the ear tissue samples of the 12 most aggressive and 12 least aggressive pigs were selected for DNA resequencing based on the intensity of their aggressive behavior. Large group correlation analysis indicated that the rs3262221458 site located in the 3 '-UTR region of the porcine JARID2 gene has a strong relationship with the aggressive behavior of weaned pigs. Pigs with the mutant TT genotype of rs3262221458 have more aggressive behavior than those pigs with the GG and GT genotypes. The dual luciferase assay indicated that the luciferase activity of the plasmids containing the G allele of rs326221458 was significantly less than that of plasmids containing the T allele of rs326221458 and control groups. The binding ability of miR-9828-3p to sequences containing the T allele was less than that of sequences containing the G allele. The overexpression of miR-9828-3p in porcine neuroglial cells (PNGCs) and PK15 cells significantly decreased the mRNA and protein levels of the JARID2 gene. In addition, miR-9828-3p inhibited the proliferation of PNGCs. After inhibiting miR-9828-3p, the mRNA and protein expression levels of JARID2 increased, and the proliferation of PNGCs showed an opposite trend to the cells that forced the expression of miR-9828-3p. In addition, interference with the JARID2 gene by siRNA can effectively inhibit the proliferation of PNGCs. In summary, we found that the rs326221458 locus regulates the expression of the JARID2 gene by affecting the binding of miR-9828-3p and the JARID2 gene, thereby affecting the aggressive behavior of weaned pigs after mixing.

AB  - Cashmere quality represents a crucial economic trait in cashmere goats. Investigating methods to enhance cashmere yield and quality is essential for the sustainable development of the cashmere industry. Although melatonin (MT) has been shown to promote cashmere wool growth, the underlying molecular mechanisms, particularly those involving melatonin-mediated long non -coding RNA (lncRNA), remain poorly understood. In this study, cashmere growth -related lncRNA (LncRNA MTC) was used as the starting point. LncRNA MTC overexpression and interference lentivirus vectors were constructed and transfected into Liaoning cashmere goat skin fibroblasts. Results from the cholecystokinin-octapeptide (CCK-8) assay demonstrated that LncRNA MTC overexpression significantly enhanced cell proliferation, while LncRNA MTC interference notably suppressed it. RNA pull -down coupled with mass spectrometry revealed a significant increase in LncRNA MTC's binding to glutathione S-transferase M1 (GSTM1) in Liaoning cashmere goat skin fibroblasts following melatonin treatment. RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) technology confirmed that the intracellular GSTM1 protein indeed interacts with LncRNA MTC. CCK-8 results showed that interference with GSTM1 could reverse the promotion of MT on the proliferation of skin fibroblasts of Liaoning cashmere goats. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) results demonstrated an association between GSTM1 and apoptosis signal -regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) proteins in Liaoning cashmere goat skin fibroblasts. The findings indicate that melatonin-mediated LncRNA MTC, which is related to cashmere growth, binds to the GSTM1 protein. This interaction affects the GSTM1-ASK1 protein complex formation, consequently inhibiting the apoptosis of Liaoning cashmere goat skin fibroblasts.

AB  - Simple Summary Ruminants are a major source of greenhouse gases and environmental pollution, which are exacerbated by excessive feeding because excess nutrients are excreted. Since digestion in ruminants is aided by both microorganisms and digestive enzymes, information on gut microbiota in ruminants is vital for assessing the adequate amount of feed supply. The growth of Hanwoo steer is divided into three stages, and specific nutrients are provided in each stage. Growth stages are a major factor influencing rumen fermentation by microorganisms. In this study, changes in fermentation characteristics and microbial community during the growth stages were investigated. Our findings show that there were differences in the levels of total volatile fatty acids, propionate, and valerate. In addition, we found that the relative content of some bacteria and fungi changed with the growth stage. This study improves our understanding of rumen fermentation and changes in the gut microbiota during the various growth stages of Hanwoo steer. Ruminants are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, and information on ruminant fermentation and microorganisms is essential to understand ruminant digestion, which is associated with environmental pollution. The present study investigated rumen fermentation and microbial diversity according to the three different growth stages of four Hanwoo steers: growing (12 months, G), early fattening (18 months, EF), and late fattening (25 months, LF). No significant differences were observed in rumen pH and ammonia nitrogen among growth stages. Total volatile fatty acids were significantly higher and propionate and valerate significantly lower in G than in EF and LF (p < 0.05). Ten bacterial phyla were detected, including Firmicutes (47.5-53.5%) and Bacteroidetes (28.4-31.7%), which accounted for 79.2-82.3% of the total bacteria. Prevotella accounted for the highest proportion (31.6-42.6%) of all bacteria in this study but did not differ significantly among the different growth stages. Metaprevotella abundance was significantly higher in G than in the other treatments (p < 0.05). In addition, Paraprevotella tended to be higher in LF than in the other treatments (p = 0.056). Given the differences in the genera of microorganisms with relatively low abundance, additional experiments are needed to determine the effect on fermentation.

AB  - Myocardial sleeves of the pulmonary veins (PV) extending from the left atrium (LA) are the major source of ectopic activity causing atrial arrhythmias. The structural and electrophysiological characteristics of the PV myocardium differ from those of the LA. The mechanical activity of cardiomyocytes (CM) impacts cardiac excitation-contraction coupling, however, the mechanical function of PV CM has not been studied yet. We compared the characteristics of the actin-myosin interaction and sarcomere length (SL) dynamics in mechanically non-loaded single CM between the PV and LA in the guinea pig heart. We found that the functional properties of myosin from the PV and LA are not different, while the phosphorylation levels of sarcomeric proteins in the PV and LA are different. End-diastolic SL, sarcomere shortening amplitude, and velocities of sarcomere shortening and relengthening of PV and LA CM do not differ, while PV CM are longer and thinner than LA CM. The amplitude of sarcomere shortening increased with an increase in CM length in the LA but not in the PV. We assume that an absence of correlation between the morphometric parameters of CM and the amplitude of sarcomere shortening together with the electrophysiological features of the PV myocardium may contribute to the occurrence and development of atrial fibrillation.

AB  - Aerial surveys are a critical tool for inference of wildlife populations, yet are limited by current available methods to account for imperfect detection without marking animals. N-mixture models use count data from replicate surveys for estimation of wildlife abundance while accounting for imperfect detection. This statistical framework was recently developed but is rarely applied to aerial surveys of terrestrial wildlife. We applied an N-mixture model incorporating temporary emigration to a novel aerial survey design to estimate the availability, detection probability, and abundance of an unmarked population of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in Michigan, USA, using surveys in 2014 and 2016. We assessed the selection of the sample unit size for the N-mixture model in a post hoc sensitivity analysis and compared all estimates to a hierarchical distance sampling (HDS) approach. Hierarchical distance sampling is an expansion of conventional distance sampling (CDS), a standard method applied to aerial survey designs for wildlife, where HDS allows for modeling spatial variation in abundance and detection probability using environmental covariates and can account for changing population demographics. We found N-mixture models produced similar parameter estimates to HDS with both models inferring a population increase between years, which was consistent with independently available estimates for this population (2014 N-mixture = 402 [CI: 303.8-515.27], and HDS = 391 [CI: 297.67-504.63]; 2016 N-mixture = 732 [CI: 572.89-924.22], and HDS = 708 [CI: 552.45-893.89]). Estimates from both models were sensitive to the sample unit size selected in an open population framework. We recommend using ecological (e.g., home range size) and statistical (e.g., sample size) considerations when selecting a sample unit size that reflects the movement ecology of a species and evaluating the sensitivity of parameters to sample unit size. In our study, N-mixture models and HDS models afforded a practical field approach and analytical methodology that resulted in precise estimation in a population of unmarked deer over time. When used with aerial surveys in terrestrial systems where distance sampling methods may be difficult to implement, N-mixture models can address observer error and estimate populations for conservation and management goals without marking individual animals.

AB  - The family Rhinocerotidae is a key component of the Cenozoic European fauna. It reached its peak diversity during Miocene and began to decline in the Pliocene; the last representatives became extinct in Europe during the Quaternary. The present state-of-the-art review takes stock of the knowledge accumulated on Central and Eastern European Pleistocene rhinos to date. Eight species were present in Central and Eastern Europe in the Quaternary; five belonged to the genus Stephanorhinus (S. etruscus, S. jeanvireti, S. hundsheimensis, S. hemitoechus, and S. kirchbergensis), one was the woolly rhino Coelodonta antiquitatis, and two species were members of the genus Elasmotherium (E. peii and E. caucasicum). This review also offered the opportunity to critically reconsider some aspects of the systematics and stratigraphic location of the finds. Coelodonta antiquitatis is shown to have still been present as late as the Interplenivistulian and the Last Glacial Maximum; radiocarbon dating of its latest remains provided the timing of the final disappearance of the woolly rhino from the studied region. The Late Pleistocene distribution of Coelodonta antiquitatis in Central and Eastern Europe was found to largely overlap that of the woolly mammoth.

AB  - Coral reef fishes are diverse in ecology and behaviour and show remarkable colour variability. Investigating the visual pigment gene (opsin) expression in these fishes makes it possible to associate their visual genotype and phenotype (spectral sensitivities) to visual tasks, such as feeding strategy or conspecific detection. By studying all major damselfish clades (Pomacentridae) and representatives from five other coral reef fish families, we show that the long-wavelength-sensitive (lws) opsin is highly expressed in algivorous and less or not expressed in zooplanktivorous species. Lws is also upregulated in species with orange/red colours (reflectance >520 nm) and expression is highest in orange/red-coloured algivores. Visual models from the perspective of a typical damselfish indicate that sensitivity to longer wavelengths does enhance the ability to detect the red to far-red component of algae and orange/red-coloured conspecifics, possibly enabling social signalling. Character state reconstructions indicate that in the early evolutionary history of damselfishes, there was no lws expression and no orange/red coloration. Omnivory was most often the dominant state. Although herbivory was sometimes dominant, zooplanktivory was never dominant. Sensitivity to long wavelength (increased lws expression) only emerged in association with algivory but never with zooplanktivory. Higher lws expression is also exploited by social signalling in orange/red, which emerged after the transition to algivory. Although the relative timing of traits may deviate by different reconstructions and alternative explanations are possible, our results are consistent with sensory bias whereby social signals evolve as a correlated response to natural selection on sensory system properties in other contexts.

AB  - Changes in plant secondary metabolism due to insect galls are one of the frontiers in knowledge of plant-insect interactions, especially concerning volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Here we studied the in vivo VOCs released from healthy apical branches of Haplopappus foliosus DC. (Asteraceae) and compared these volatiles to the VOCs obtained from apical bud galls produced in this host plant when attacked by the gall midge Hap-lopappusmyiia gregaria (Cecidomyiidae). We field-collected VOCs by dynamic headspace and identified them by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. We found changes in the relative proportions of different classes of VOC in apical branches vs. apical bud galls. H. foliosus VOCs had mainly monoterpene hydrocarbons such as p-cymene, a recognized herbivore deterrent. We also found oxygenated monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes in the H. foliosus volatile mixture. H. foliosus modifies its fragrance composition when parasitized by gall midges, showing an increased proportion of some monoterpene hydrocarbons, e.g. limonene and camphene, while others such as alpha-thujene, p-cymene and gamma-terpinene were down-expressed in apical bud gall VOCs. We discuss these results considering gall signaling and chemical ecology hypotheses, including the potential role of plant defenses as well as gall midge-derived modification for host plant VOCs, and comment on the ecological relevance of our findings.

AB  - There is a global decline in marine fish abundance due to unsustainable harvesting. An effective harvesting policy can protect the overfished population from possible extinction. In this study, we used a mathematical model characterized by density-dependent refuge protection for herbivorous fish, exhibiting an anti-predator response in presence of a generalist invasive fish. The anti-predator behavior entails predator density-dependent reduced fecundity of the herbivorous fish. The model assumes a continuous threshold harvesting policy (CTHP) for the herbivorous fish and uses the catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) hypothesis for harvesting the invasive fish. The CTHP allows harvesting of the herbivorous fish only when the density of the herbivorous fish exceeds a specified threshold value, thus ensuring the long-term sustainability of the herbivorous fish stock. The existence and stability of steady-state solutions and the bifurcations of the model are investigated. Our study reveals that the level of apprehension of the herbivorous fish and fishing efforts will play a significant role in the stability of the system. We examine the existence of the bionomic equilibrium and then study the dynamic optimization of the harvesting policy by employing Pontryagin's maximum principle. We discuss different subsidies and tax policies for the effective management of a sustainable fishery. We use numerical simulations to compare the revenues corresponding to the harvest policies based on maximum sustainable yield (MSY), maximum economic yield (MEY), and optimal sustainable yield (OSY) for inferring an ecologically sustainable and economically viable harvesting policy.

AB  - Healthy aging is associated with a shift away from the retrieval of specific episodic autobiographical memories (AMs), towards more general and semanticized memories. Younger adults modulate activity in the default mode network according to the episodic specificity of AM retrieval. However, little is known about whether aging disrupts this neural modulation. In the current study we examine age-related changes in the modulation of whole-brain networks in response to three tasks falling along a gradient of episodic specificity. Younger and older adults retrieved specific (unique) AMs, general (routine) AMs, and semantic (general knowledge) memories. We found that both younger and older adults modulated default mode regions in response to varying episodic specificity. In addition, younger adults upregulated activity in several default mode regions with increasing episodic specificity, while older adults either did not modulate these regions, or downregulated activity in these regions. In contrast, older adults upregulated activity in the left temporal pole for tasks with higher episodic specificity. These brain activation patterns converge with prior findings that specific AMs are diminished in episodic richness with age, but are supplemented with conceptual and general information. Age-related reductions in the modulation of default mode regions might contribute to the shift away from episodic retrieval and towards semantic retrieval, resulting in reduced episodic specificity of personal memories.

AB  - In group-living animals, the social structure and organisation play a significant role in survival and reproduction. Understanding the social aspects of animal lives in the wild may be crucially important for effective conservation of threatened species. The fitness costs and benefits of living in a group are related to particular spatial positions individuals take within their groups. Age and sex of the individual is a major factor determining intra-group spatial position. In the present study, we investigated the within-group spatial positioning of individuals in the Critically Endangered Saiga tatarica (hereinafter - saiga). In saigas living under natural predation pressure in the Stepnoi State Nature Sanctuary (Astrakhan Region, Russia), we investigated the sex-age category of the first individual in the group, the inter-individual distance in the front individuals and the individuals following them, and the distribution of individuals of each sex-age category between various parts of the group. Three (summer) or four (autumn) sex-age categories of the individuals in the moving groups were recognised by direct observations in the field. In summer, adult females, accompanied by their calves, were the very first individuals in most saiga groups observed. This result agrees with the previous notion that experienced females often lead the saiga groups. However, further investigation is needed to confirm whether adult females do indeed take the role of a leader during long-distance group movements. In line with the results on other mammals, the majority of adult females moved in the central third of the group. Spatial preferences of adult females seem to be based on the risk minimisation as the central positions are likely the safest in the group. In autumn, juvenile males were moving first in the majority of the investigated groups probably because they were the most active and fast-moving sex-age category during this season. In addition, juvenile males and females were significantly more often observed in the first third of the group than in the central and the rear thirds. We suggest that despite the fact that the front edge of the group could be the most dangerous spatial position, foraging benefits may outweigh the increased risk for juvenile saigas. In contrast to some other mammals, adult males did not tend to move at the front edge and were equally often observed in the front, central and rear parts of saiga groups. Finally, our results showed that saigas closer to the front edge of the group maintained shorter inter-individual distances than the individuals positioned behind them. The tighter spacing could be used by front individuals to compensate for the increased risks associated with their within-group spatial position.

AB  - Subtropical evergreen broad-leaved trees are usually vulnerable to freezing stress, while hexaploid wild Camellia oleifera shows strong freezing tolerance. As a valuable genetic resource of woody oil crop C. oleifera, wild C. oleifera can serve as a case for studying the molecular bases of adaptive evolution to freezing stress. Here, 47 wild C. oleifera from 11 natural distribution sites in China and 4 relative species of C. oleifera were selected for genome sequencing. "Min Temperature of Coldest Month" (BIO6) had the highest comprehensive contribution to wild C. oleifera distribution. The population genetic structure of wild C. oleifera could be divided into two groups: in cold winter (BIO6 _< 0 degrees C) and warm winter (BIO6 > 0 degrees C) areas. Wild C. oleifera in cold winter areas might have experienced stronger selection pressures and population bottlenecks with lower Ne than those in warm winter areas. 155 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were significantly correlated with the key bioclimatic variables (106 SNPs significantly correlated with BIO6). Twenty key SNPs and 15 key copy number variation regions (CNVRs) were found with genotype differentiation > 50% between the two groups of wild C. oleifera. Key SNPs in cis-regulatory elements might affect the expression of key genes associated with freezing tolerance, and they were also found within a CNVR suggesting interactions between them. Some key CNVRs in the exon regions were closely related to the differentially expressed genes under freezing stress. The findings suggest that rich SNPs and CNVRs in polyploid trees may contribute to the adaptive evolution to freezing stress.

AB  - Simple Summary Triclosan is widely used in cosmetics and hygiene products, including anti-bacterial hand sanitizers and disinfectants whose utilization has been greatly increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Since critical health effects have been demonstrated for this substance we tested its potential harmful action on ovarian cells collected from pigs, a valuable animal model. We demonstrated that Triclosan impairs cell function, thus suggesting an impairment of reproductive function. Triclosan is a chlorinated biphenolic with a broad spectrum of antiseptic activities used in cosmetics and hygiene products. Continuous exposure can lead to absorption and bioaccumulation of this substance with harmful health effects. In fact, previous studies have shown that Triclosan acts as an endocrine-disrupting chemical on reproductive organs, with consequent negative effects on reproductive physiology. Therefore, to assess potential adverse impacts on fertility, we tested Triclosan on swine granulosa cells, a model of endocrine reproductive cells. We examined its effects on the main features of granulosa cell functions such as cell growth (BrdU incorporation and ATP production) and steroidogenesis (17-beta estradiol and progesterone secretion). Moreover, since oxidant-antioxidant balance plays a pivotal role in follicular function, redox status markers (superoxide, hydrogen peroxide and nitric oxide production, enzymatic and non-enzymatic scavenging activity) were studied. Our results show that Triclosan significantly inhibits cell growth (p < 0.001), steroidogenesis (p < 0.001), superoxide and nitric oxide production (p < 0.001), while it increases (p < 0.05) enzymatic defense systems. Collectively, these data suggest a disruption of the main granulosa cell functions, i.e., proliferation and hormone production, as well as an imbalance in redox status. On these bases, we can speculate that Triclosan would impair granulosa cell functions, thus exerting negative effects on reproductive function. Further studies are needed to explore lower Triclosan concentrations and to unravel its mechanisms of action at gene level.

AB  - Background While it is known that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can improve nutrient acquisition and herbivore resistance in crops, the mechanisms by which AMF influence plant defense remain unknown. Plants respond to herbivory with a cascade of gene expression and phytochemical biosynthesis. Given that the production of defensive phytochemicals requires nutrients, a commonly invoked hypothesis is that the improvement to plant defense when grown with AMF is simply due to an increased availability of nutrients. An alternative hypothesis is that the AMF effect on herbivory is due to changes in plant defense gene expression that are not simply due to nutrient availability. In this study, we tested whether changes in plant defenses are regulated by nutritional provisioning alone or the response of plant to AMF associations. Maize plants grown with or without AMF and with one of three fertilizer treatments (standard, 2 x nitrogen, or 2 x phosphorous) were infested with fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda; FAW) for 72 h. We measured general plant characteristics (e.g. height, number of leaves), relative gene expression (rtPCR) of three defensive genes (lox3, mpi, and pr5), total plant N and P nutrient content, and change in FAW mass per plant. Results We found that AMF drove the defense response of maize by increasing the expression of mpi and pr5. Furthermore, while AMF increased the total phosphorous content of maize it had no impact on maize nitrogen. Fertilization alone did not alter upregulation of any of the 3 induced defense genes tested, suggesting the mechanism through which AMF upregulate defenses is not solely via increased N or P plant nutrition. Conclusion This work supports that maize defense may be optimized by AMF associations alone, reducing the need for artificial inputs when managing FAW.

AB  - High fluoride exposure was widely demonstrated to be related with brain memory impairment. Since the absorption of F- enters the body mainly through the gastrointestinal tract, studying the effects of excessive intake of fluoride on brain memory function in various gut microbiome states might have profound implications for the prevention of fluorosis because growing evidence revealed the significance of the "microbiota-gut-brain" axis (MGBA). In the present study, we aimed to illustrate the potential mechanism of gut microbiota on high fluoride exposure-induced hippocampal lesions and spatial memory dysfunction in mice by the various intestinal microecological environments, which were constructed by antibiotic treatment. Mice fed with normal (CG1 and Exp1 groups) or sodium-fluoride (CG2 and Exp2 groups; 24 mg/kg sodium fluoride per mouse) by gavage administration with or without antibiotic treatments, a combination of metronidazole (1 g/L) and ciprofloxacin (0.2 g/L) in drinking water. Mice gavaged with excessive sodium fluoride alone exhibited reduced weight gain, hippocampal tissue damages, spatial memory levels dysfunction, impaired intestinal permeability, decreased inflammatory cytokines expression and antioxidant capability in the hippocampal and ileal tissues. In contrast, antibiotic intervention significantly reversed these high fluoride exposure-induced hippocampal and ileal changes.16S rRNA high throughput sequencing found that ileal microbiota were dominated by abundant taxa, which is conducive to constructing microbial interaction networks and module communities, and identifying keystone species targeted by high fluoride exposure compared with colonic microbiome. In addition, the microbial community composition and assembly mechanism of ileal microbiome under the effects of antibiotics were suitable for revealing the characteristics of high fluoride environment. In the later analysis, Lactobacillus, Staphylococcus, Muribaculaceae and Robinsoniella were considered as the keystone species targeted by high fluoride-exposed mice based on the analysis of network node properties and niche overlap of ileal microbes. Spearman rank correlation demonstrated that these keystone species had significant effects on hippocampal memory levels and intestinal health, as well as microbial communities functions. Compared to previous researches, this study further revealed intestinal microbial coummunity mediated the underlying mechanism through antibiotic treatment against high fluoride-induce hippocampal spatial memory impairment.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the effect of adding calcium compounds to processed goat's milk, and on the properties of acid rennet goat's milk gels, which are a middle product obtained in the manufacture of acid rennet cheese. The properties of the gels directly affect the quality of acid rennet cheeses. The analysis of raw goat's milk was carried out, then acid rennet gels were produced with the addition of six different calcium compounds (chloride, citrate, bisglycinate, gluconate, lactate, and carbonate). The dynamics of milk fermentation were performed by monitoring the pH value of milk during acidification. The pH, syneresis, color, and texture profile were determined in the formulated acid rennet gels. An organoleptic evaluation was also performed. The study demonstrated that, not only calcium chloride, but also calcium citrate, gluconate, lactate, bisglycinate, and calcium carbonate could be used in the production of goat's milk acid rennet gels, or the middle product in the manufacture of acid rennet curd cheese from goat's milk. Notably, the addition of citrate, bisglycinate, and calcium carbonate in doses of 20 mg Ca 100 g(-1) most effectively reduced syneresis compared to the control sample by 4.76% (citrate), 7.85% (bisglycinate), and 10.28% (carbonate). The hardness of the control gels ranged from 2.35 N to 2.99 N. The addition of chloride, citrate, gluconate, lactate, and calcium carbonate to the milk improved the acid rennet gel's hardness. The addition of 20 mg Ca 100 g(-1) as gluconate increased the hardness the most (3.61 N). When increasing the calcium dosage in the form of all compounds, there was a tendency to increase the gel's springiness. The addition of chloride, citrate, and bisglycinate to milk did not result in a darkening of the gel's color. The addition of calcium compounds mostly reduced the intensity of goatish taste and odor. Calcium gluconate, in particular, reduced the goatish taste the most, a taste which is not always acceptable by the consumers.

AB  - The chemical composition, secondary metabolite concentration, digestibility parameters, and effect of polyethyleneglycol (PEG) on gas and methane production of plant material from four forage liana species: Clematis cirrhosa, Smilax aspera, Rubus ulmifolius and Hedera helix grazed by ruminants of Ain Khiar alder grove during the year were determined to assess their nutritive potential as well as their anti-methanogenic properties. C. cirrhosa and R. ulmifolius show the highest crude protein (CP) content (12.88-20.99%/kg DM), moderate NDF (32.78-45.9%/kg DM) and low ADL (5.11-12.97%/kg DM), making them the most digestible (48.06-65.04%). The incubated substrates of H. helix in autumn and winter had the lowest digestibility values (32.6 and 35.92%, respectively), given their high lignin contents (17.21 and 23.21%, respectively) and the effective nature of their tannins. The addition of PEG improved their gas production with increasing rates of 23.37% and 41.9%, respectively. This was not the case with C. cirrhosa in winter and spring for which PEG had a depressing effect on gas (- 4.42 and - 2.02%) and methane production (Algeria 37.23 and 33.3%), respectively. Based on the obtained results, the studied species confirm the excellent nutritive profiles that could guarantee a feeding resource throughout the year.

AB  - Molting is a basic physiological behavior of the Oriental river prawn (Macrobrachium nipponense), however, the gene expression patterns and immune mechanisms during the molting process of Oriental river prawn are un-clear. In the current study, the gene expression levels of the hepatopancreas of the Oriental river prawn at different molting stages (pre-molting, Prm; mid-molting, Mm; and post-molting, Pom) were detected by mRNA sequencing. A total of 1721, 551, and 1054 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between the Prm hepatopancreas (PrmHe) and Mm hepatopancreas (MmHe), MmHe and Pom hepatopancreas (PomHe) and PrmHe and PomHe, respectively. The results showed that a total of 1151 DEGs were annotated into 316 signaling pathways, and the significantly enriched immune-related pathways were "Lysosome", "Hippo signaling pathway", "Apoptosis", "Autophagy-animal", and "Endocytosis". The qRT-PCR verification results of 30 randomly selected DEGs were consistent with RNA-seq. The expression patterns of eight immune related genes in different molting stages of the Oriental river prawn were analyzed by qRT-PCR. The function of Caspase-1 (CASP1) was further investigated by bioinformatics, qRT-PCR, and RNAi analysis. CASP1 has two identical conserved domains: his-tidine active site and pentapeptide motif, and the expression of CASP1 is the highest in ovary. The expression levels of triosephosphate isomerase (TPI), Cathepsin B (CTSB) and Hexokinase (HXK) were evaluated after knockdown of CASP1. This research provides a valuable basis to improve our understanding the immune mechanisms of Oriental river prawns at different molting stages. The identification of immune-related genes is of great significance for enhancing the immunity of the Oriental river prawn, or other crustaceans, by transgenic methods in the future.

AB  - BackgroundMycoplasma hyorhinis is a prevalent respiratory pathogen in swine, causing significant economic loss to pig producers. There is growing evidence that respiratory pathogen infections have a large impact on intestinal microecology. To study the effect of M. hyorhinis infection on gut microbial composition and metabolome profile, pigs were infected with M. hyorhinis. Metagenomic sequencing analysis was performed of fecal samples and a liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis of gut digesta was made. ResultsPigs infected with M. hyorhinis had enriched Sutterella and Mailhella, and depleted Dechloromonas, Succinatimonas, Campylobacter, Blastocystis, Treponema, and Megasphaera. The pigs infected with M. hyorhinis also had greater abundances of bacterium_0_1xD8_71, Ruminococcus_sp__CAG_353, Firmicutes_bacterium_CAG_194, Firmicutes_bacterium_CAG_534, bacterium_1xD42_87, and lower abundances of Chlamydia_suis, Megasphaera_elsdenii, Treponema_porcinum, Bacteroides_sp__CAG_1060, Faecalibacterium_prausnitzii. Metabolomic analysis revealed that some lipids and lipid-like molecules increased in the small intestine, whereas most lipids and lipid-like molecule metabolites decreased in the large intestine. These altered metabolites induce changes in intestinal sphingolipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and thiamine metabolism. ConclusionThese findings demonstrate that infection with M. hyorhinis can alter the gut microbial composition and metabolite structure in pigs, which may further affect amino acid metabolism and lipid metabolism in the intestine.

AB  - Introduction and Objective. Bioaerosols exist in almost every environment and are known to be risk factors for a variety of diseases. Agricultural work involves high exposure to bioaerosols and its workplace concentrations affect the surrounding areas. The study evaluates bioaerosol concentrations in agricultural workplaces and residential areas according to farm type.
   Materials and method. In 2013-2015, a total of 381 samples were collected for endotoxin and microbial testing from three farm types: open field, greenhouse, and livestock facilities. Endotoxins were measured using a 37-mm glass fire filter connected to an air pump calibrated to 2 LPM. Microorganisms were measured using a gelatin filter and impaction (single-stage Andersen sampler).
   Results. The concentration of endotoxins and microorganisms at the livestock facilities was significantly higher than in the open fields and greenhouses (p<0.05). Among the livestock farms, the concentrations of endotoxins and gram-negative bacteria were highest at hog farms, and the concentrations of total bacteria and fungi were the highest in poultry houses. In both greenhouses and livestock facilities, the concentrations of bioaerosols were higher in the workplace than in a nearby residential area, and the difference in concentration was significantly greater in the case of livestock facilities.
   Conclusions. The concentrations of bioaerosols in agricultural workplaces and nearby residential areas were higher than in the control and general areas. Therefore, measures should be taken to prevent exposure to bioaerosols at agricultural workplaces and their vicinities.

AB  - The East Friesian sheep is a dairy breed known for its high fertility and high milk production and is currently one of the best dairy sheep breeds in the world. This breed is known to have a poor disease-resistant phenotype compared to Hu sheep. Gut microbiota and metabolites play a role in host disease resistance. The intestinal bacterial microbiota is essential for maintaining the health of sheep and ensuring their productive potential, and it may also help explain disease-resistant phenotypic differences related to breeds. However, the ileum microbiota and metabolite profiles of Hu sheep and East Friesian sheep have remained poorly characterized. The ileal is a significant organ in the intestinal tract, and most nutrients and minerals in food are absorbed through the small intestine. It is necessary to understand the composition of both species' ileal microbiota and metabolites using the same feeding conditions. Therefore, studying the differences in the ileal microorganisms between breeds is essential to decipher the mechanisms behind these differences and identify microorganisms that influence the disease-resistant phenotype drive of ruminants. Due to the poor disease-resistant phenotype in sheep during the weaning period, with diarrhea and other diseases most likely to occur, we selected dairy sheep that were just two months old and had recently been weaned. This study comprehensively examined differences between the ileal microbiota in a large cohort of two breeds of sheep, including six Hu sheep and six East Friesian sheep. Using 16S rRNA and non-targeted metabolomics analysis, we determined that the Hu sheep had more microorganisms, including Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Streptococcus, and Limmosilactobacillus, and more metabolites, including 2,7-Dihydroxy-5-methyl-1-naphthoic acid, Leu-Pro-Glu-Phe-Tyr, dodecanoic acid, Ala-Gln-Phe-Ile-Met, and Ala-Gln-Glu-Val-His, compared to the EF sheep group. Moreover, the Hu sheep were significantly enriched in amino acid biosynthesis, fatty acid metabolites, and bile secretion compared to the EF sheep groups, which may have been the main driver of the observed differences in disease-resistant phenotypes between the Hu sheep and East Friesian sheep. In addition, we hypothesized that there may be multiple beneficial microbes and metabolites that modulate the immune response and ultimately affect disease resistance. Therefore, these findings provide insights into the mechanisms underlying disease-resistant phenotype in sheep and may provide useful information for optimizing the composition of the ileal bacterial microbiota in sheep.

AB  - Antibiotic pollution in the environment caused by animal breeding has become a serious issue. The persistent release of antibiotics with animal waste may lead to antibiotic resistances in the environment, which poses a threat to human health. This study tries to provides a practical method for screening prioritized antibiotics via a comprehensive risk assessment and determination of their major sources, and put forward corresponding regulatory measures for animal industries. We investigated the occurrence and distribution of 20 antibiotics belonging to eight classes, spanning the areas of animal feed, drinking water, and animal feces on 59 animal farms in Shandong Province, China. The results showed that antibiotic contamination was prevalent in different environmental mediums (feed, feces, and drinking water) on these farms. Tetracyclines typically exhibited higher concentrations than the other classes in all samples, and the majority of antibiotics had greater concentrations in cattle feces than in pig- or chicken feces. For the antibiotic ecological risks in feces, doxycycline, tetracycline, and enrofloxacin exhibited much more toxic effects on terrestrial organisms (e.g., wheat, cucumber, and rice). Ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin, ofloxacin, and tetracycline levels in drinking water samples can lead to high risk of antibiotic resistance, while no antibiotic posed obvious risks to human health. Based on compressive risk assessments, 11 antibiotics were prioritized to control in the animal breeding environment. Based on the survey of feeds, drinking water and animal waste from the farm, roxithromycin in the feces mainly originated from the feeds, while most prioritized antibiotics, were from extra addition in the animal breeding process (including injection and other oral routes). The key point of local antibiotic management in animal farms should be adjusted from the feed factory to the extra addition of antibiotics in animal breeding processes.

AB  - The one-carbon metabolism (OCM) pathway provides purines and thymidine for synthesis of nucleic acids required for cell division, and S-adenosyl methionine for polyamine and creatine syntheses and the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. This study aimed to determine if serine hydroxymethyltransferase 2 (SHMT2), a key enzyme in the OCM pathway, is critical for ovine trophectoderm (oTr) cell function and conceptus development by inhibiting translation of SHMT2 mRNA using a morpholino antisense oligonucleotide (MAO). In vitro treatment of oTr cells with MAO-SHMT2 decreased expression of SHMT2 protein, which was accompanied by reduced proliferation (P = 0.053) and migration (P < 0.05) of those cells. Intrauterine injection of MAO-SHMT2 in ewes on Day 11 post-breeding tended to decrease the overall pregnancy rate (on Days 16 and 18) compared with MAO-control (3/10 vs. 7/10, P = 0.07). The three viable conceptuses (n = 2 on Day 16 and n = 1 on Day 18) recovered from MAO-SHMT2 ewes had only partial inhibition of SHMT2 mRNA translation. Conceptuses from the three pregnant MAO-SHMT2 ewes had similar levels of expression of mRNAs and proteins involved in OCM as compared with conceptuses from MAO-control ewes. These results indicate that knockdown of SHMT2 protein reduces proliferation and migration of oTr cells (in vitro) to decrease elongation of blastocysts from spherical to elongated forms. These in vitro effects suggest that increased embryonic deaths in ewes treated with MAO-SHMT2 are the result of decreased SHMT2-mediated trophectoderm cell proliferation and migration supporting a role for the OCM pathway in survival and development of ovine conceptuses.
   Inhibition of SHMT2 mRNA translation reduces proliferation and migration of ovine trophectoderm cells and increases embryonic mortality in sheep suggesting that one-carbon metabolism is critical for conceptus development.

AB  - Systematic study of the palm (Arecaceae) flora from the Leeward Antilles marked both Sabal antillensis and Sabal lougheediana as endemic to Curacao and Bonaire respectively. Although both species are emergent, obvious and charismatic elements of the Antillean flora, they were only described within the last decade. Sabal lougheediana is in demographic crisis as a result of constant ungulate pressure prohibiting seedling establishment, while S. antillensis is thriving as a result of careful management. Given the surprisingly recent discovery of these two species, and the severity of the conservation concern, genomic data can help inform whether these taxa are in fact well-circumscribed species, and help to guide further conservation actions. To investigate genomic diversity, we employed RADSeq data from samples throughout the range of both species. Results show significant genetic distance and fixation between the two taxa as currently circumscribed, as well as reduced genetic diversity and increased inbreeding in both species. Multivariate analysis of genetic distance and Bayesian clustering analysis both show clear and significant separation of the two taxa. Parallel assay of ex situ collections informs how future development of germplasm reserves can help support conservation of both species. We provide recommendations to help conserve these two unique and distinct species.

   Systematisch onderzoek van de palmflora (Arecaceae) van de Benedenwindse Antillen markeerde zowel Sabal antillensis als Sabal lougheediana als endemisch voor respectievelijk Curacao en Bonaire. Hoewel beide soorten aspect-bepalende, typische en charismatische elementen van de Antilliaanse flora zijn, zijn ze pas in de afgelopen tien jaar beschreven. Sabal lougheediana verkeert in een demografische crisis als gevolg van de voortdurende druk van grazers die de vestiging van zaailingen verhindert, terwijl S. antillensis gedijt als resultaat van zorgvuldig beheer. Gezien de verrassend recente ontdekking van deze twee soorten, en de ernst van de bezorgdheid over het behoud, kunnen genomische gegevens helpen bepalen of deze taxa in feite goed omschreven soorten zijn, en helpen om verdere natuurbehoudsmaatregelen op te zetten. Om de genomische diversiteit te onderzoeken, hebben we RADSeq-gegevens gebruikt van monsters uit het hele verspreidingsgebied van beide soorten. De resultaten laten een aanzienlijke genetische afstand en fixatie zien tussen de twee taxa zoals momenteel omschreven, evenals een verminderde genetische diversiteit en een toegenomen inteelt bij beide soorten. Multivariate analyse van genetische afstand en Bayesiaanse clusteranalyse laten beide een duidelijke en significante scheiding tussen de twee taxa zien. Parallelle tests van ex situ collecties geven aan hoe de toekomstige ontwikkeling van kiemplasmareserves het behoud van beide soorten kan helpen ondersteunen. We geven aanbevelingen om deze twee unieke en verschillende soorten te helpen behouden.

AB  - Simple Summary Serological tests that detect antibodies, especially indirect ELISAs, are the most common method to diagnose Maedi-visna virus (MVV) infections in small ruminants. However, due to the high genetic heterogeneity of the virus, commercial tests might not effectively detect infected animals in all populations. Bead-based multiplex immunoassays can detect multiple analytes simultaneously, thus enabling the detection of antibodies against several MVV antigens in the same assay. In Norway, there is a national aim to eliminate MVV from the sheep population and improving the serological test performance would strengthen the surveillance of the disease. In this study, we developed a bead-based multiplex immunoassay to detect antibodies against viral epitopes in MVV-infected sheep, including antigens based on the circulating viral strain in Norway. Thus, the assay is tailored for usage in the Norwegian sheep population. Although this work shows promising results, including repeatability, analytical sensitivity, and specificity, the diagnostic characteristics must be evaluated before the assay can be implemented in the Norwegian surveillance programme.Abstract The Maedi-visna virus (MVV) causes a persistent infection in small ruminants, and its high genetic heterogeneity affects the performance of diagnostic tests when used in different populations. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop a bead-based multiplex immunoassay tailored to detect antibodies against a Norwegian MVV strain. We used tissue samples from 14 PCR-positive sheep from a recent MVV outbreak in Norway to sequence the viral strain and produced recombinant antigens based on sequences from one animal. The assay included commercial TM-A and recombinant Norwegian p25, p16-25 and SU5 antigens. Cut-off values for each antigen were determined using receiver operating characteristic curves on 40 ELISA-negative and 67 ELISA-positive samples from the outbreak. The intraplate and interplate repeatability were investigated by testing a quadruplicate of five samples over three days, while the analytical sensitivity (aSe) and specificity (aSp) were measured in comparison to a commercial ELISA. The repeatability showed a coefficient of variation below 15% for most positive samples. The aSe was equal or higher for the multiplex assay than the ELISA, and the aSp of each antigen was 91.7, 93.3, 95.0 and 93.3% for p25, p16-25, SU5 and TM-A, respectively. The assay shows promising results; however, further evaluations of diagnostic characteristics are necessary before implementation in the Norwegian surveillance programme.

AB  - Laurus nobilis is an important Mediterranean tree and shrub native to Italy that is also commercially grown as spice and ornamental plant. Field surveys conducted since 2021 in Sicily (Italy) revealed that bay laurel plants in urban and private gardens and nurseries were severely affected by symptoms of stem blight and internal necrosis, which were associated with ambrosia beetle entry holes in the bark and internal wood galleries. The occurring ambrosia beetle was identified as Xylosandrus compactus, an invasive wood-boring pest previously reported from Sicily. Investigation of fungi from symptomatic tissues primarily resulted in the isolation of Thyridium-like colonies. The main symbiont of X. compactus, Ambrosiella xylebori, was also isolated from infested plants. Phylogenetic analyses of a combined matrix of ITS, LSU, act1, rpb2, tef1, and tub2 gene regions revealed that the isolated Thyridium-like colonies represent a new fungal species within the genus Thyridium. Based on both phylogeny and morphology, the new isolated fungus is described as Thyridium lauri sp. nov. Moreover, two recently described species, Phialemoniopsis hipposidericola and Phialemoniopsis xishuangbannaensis, are transferred to the genus Thyridium due to the confirmed synonymy of both genera, as supported by molecular phylogenies. Pathogenicity test conducted on potted plants demonstrated that T. lauri is pathogenic to bay laurel, causing internal necrosis and stem blight. The new species was consistently re-isolated from the symptomatic tissue beyond the inoculation point, thereby fulfilling Koch's postulates. This study represents the first report of a new pathogenic fungus, T. lauri, causing stem blight and internal necrosis of bay laurel plants and associated with infestation of the invasive ambrosia beetle X. compactus.

AB  - The influence of several types of organic waste materials, i.e. biochar, compost, manure of cow and sheep, and sewage sludge, composted on two types of soils with contrasting characteristics (Fluvisol and Vertisol) on the anionic composition of soil solution and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was studied. An increase in pH values after amelioration in both soils was found, which is more expressed on the Fluvisol. The nitrate content was found to be the lowest in biochar ameliorated soils. It was observed that after amendment of both soils with sewage sludge, the nitrogen content in the solution increased significantly. The addition of manure, compost and biochar did not cause an increase in nitrates, and values were below or at the limit of maximum permissible concentrations. Lower contents of sulphates and phosphates were also reported after soil amendment with all the ameliorants used. Significant correlations between physicochemical characteristics of the amended soils and the composition of the soil solutions were found.

AB  - The genome of the sheep scab mite, Psoroptes ovis, was analysed for the presence of neuropeptide and neurohormone precursors and their G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Many of these showed significant similarities to those known or predicted from other Acaridae and also insect species. Similarities to orthologous precursors and receptors from the sheep Ovis aries, host for P. ovis, were also evaluated. The roles of neuropeptides and neurohormones in the control of behavioural and physiological processes such as osmoregulation, reproduction, growth and development are discussed. The GPCRs for these neuropeptides and neurohormones offer potential targets for the development of next-generation acaricides. Modification of normal receptor function by new chemistries that either block or over-stimulate the GPCRs can result in the death of the mite or alter its normal development and reproductive ability thereby suppressing populations. This work provides the information required to select potential GPCR targets in P. ovis for future development of new acaricides.

AB  - The reproductive management of the buffalo species still faces several unresolved problems, which directly affect the productivity of the herd, one of them being the presence of repeat breeder females. Given this scenario, this study aimed to verify the developmental competence of oocytes obtained from repeat breeder females and submitted to parthenogenetic activation. In addition, embryo gene expression was compared to normally fertile females. Murrah buffaloes were divided into two groups: repeat breeder (RB, n = 8) and normally fertile or control (CR, n = 7). Cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were aspirated by transvaginal ovum pick-up from estrus synchronized females. The COCs were submitted to IVM for 24 h, and subsequently, the oocytes were activated using ionomycin, followed by 6-DMAP. Afterwards, the presumptive parthenotes were cultured for six or seven days in a microenvironment of 5 % CO2, 5 % O-2, and 90 % N-2 at 38.5 degrees C. The expression of OCT4, GLUT1, BCL2 and TFAM genes from blastocysts was evaluated. The overall COCs recovery rate was 70.9 % (190/268). The maturation (57.8 vs 71.1), cleavage (45.2 vs 62.2) and blastocyst (30.1 vs 45.9) rates did not differ (P > 0.05) between RB and CR females, respectively. Similarly, no significant difference (P > 0.05) was observed for the expression of studied genes in both RB and CR females. In conclusion, oocytes obtained from RB were as developmentally competent as those collected from CR females, with similar energy metabolism and in vitro development capacity. Thus, the low fertility rate of repeat breeder buffaloes, when compared to normal cyclic females, must be due to subsequent events to the blastocyst stage.

AB  - The green peach aphid, Myzus persicae(Sulzer) (Hemiptera: Aphididae), is an important pest of several worldwide crops. This study evaluated the effects of plant micronutrients (alpha-iron (Fe), zinc sulfate (Zn), copper sulfate (Cu), and manganese sulfate (Mn)) on digestive enzymes, intermediary metabolism, and antioxidant responses of M. persicae reared on bell pepper plants under greenhouse conditions. Results showed that M. persicae reared on Mn-treated plants had the digestive enzymes alpha-amylase, trypsin, chymotrypsin, and elastase inhibited. Moreover, the aphids fed on Mn-treated plants showed the highest activities of catalase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, superoxide dismutase, and peroxidase, and lower increase rate of malondialdehyde. These findings indicate that micronutrients can impact the aphid metabolism, which may aid control strategies against this insect pest. We raise the potential for beneficial use of foliar fertilizer application as a pest management tool that could be further evaluated on a production and economical scale, as well as with other insect pests.

AB  - Methane production characteristics of anaerobic co-digestion of pig manure (PM) and fermented liquid feed (FLF) were investigated in a continuous digester under mesophilic conditions. The experiment followed three phases. PM alone was digested in phase I. In phases II and III, PM and FLF were mixed in a ratio of 95:5 and 90:10 (% v/v), respectively. The specific methane yields (SMYs) during phases I, II, and III were 238, 278, and 326.8 mLCH(4)center dot gVS(-1)-added, respectively. It was due to the effect of balancing the feedstock carbon-to-nitrogen ratio by adding FLF. This improvement can also be attributed to the readily biodegradable compounds in the FLF. The higher SMY obtained in this study showed a positive synergistic effect in the anaerobic co-digestion of PM and FLF. The results also indicate that adding the FLF positively affected and maintained a constant pH level, avoiding volatile fatty acid accumulation and ammonia inhibition in the anaerobic digestion (AD). Thus, this study provides valuable information regarding the usage of unused or wasted FLF as a co-substrate for the practical AD of PM. The production of fermented liquid additives such as FLF to improve the methane production from the AD of PM is a potential novel alternative to food waste recycling in Japan, besides compost and animal feeding.

AB  - The transference of heavy metals from forage to feeding animals is a crucial animal welfare issue. In this article, the effects of using municipal solid waste compost in corn cultivation on animal's health were assessed. The study was run at the Soil and Water Research Institute of Iran and followed an incomplete strip block design composed of six treatments and three repeats. The treatments were control, with no fertilizer or municipal solid waste compost, multiple combinations of N, P, and K chemical fertilizers, and municipal solid waste compost which were used either once or twice a year. Mature corn plants (Single Cross 704) from the lowest collar were sampled during the end of summer 2019. Corn samples were examined for cadmium, lead, nickel, and zinc concentration. Using the Oracle Crystalball software, health risks were estimated for sheep, dairy cows, beef, broiler, and laying poultry. The highest exposure to cadmium, nickel, and zinc was observed in sheep feeding corn cultivated in T5 treatment, but the highest exposure to lead was observed in sheep fed with corn cultivated in T2 treatment. Cd, Pb, Ni, and Zn exposure and related risk indices were lower than the reported reference values. It can be concluded that the quality of fodder corn grown in the treatments in this study was within the safe range in terms of heavy metal content and did not threaten the health of the investigated animals.

AB  - Despite numerous published literature on the impacts of agriculture on water quality, knowledge gaps persist regarding which farming systems are of most concern for their impact on water quality, which would allow water resource planners to better target water management efforts. Seeking to understand how these relationships vary across different farming systems, we used data on water quality status in watersheds of an agricultural region in southern Portugal and overlaid it with a map of farming systems for the same region provided by a previous study. By intersecting both data layers, we characterized the areal shares of the farming systems in each watershed and inspected how these shares relate to water quality status using logistic regression. The results show that the impact of agriculture on water quality is primarily related to specific farming systems. We believe this type of information can be of significant interest to agricultural planners and policymakers interested in meeting water quality standards, and we conclude this study by suggesting innovative policy options based on payments to farmers operating selected farming systems as a cost-effective way to reconcile agricultural and environmental policy objectives.

AB  - Orchids are experiencing wide success in ornamental, medicinal, and food fields. The reason for their success is correlated with both their morphology and metabolomics, the latter linked to their taste and biological effects. Despite many orchids having already been the subject of chemotaxonomic works, some of them are still untapped, like the case of Orchis purpurea. O. purpurea is one of the most common species of the genus Orchis, present in hedgerows, verges, and light woodland, where it is one of the few herbaceous plants able to be unpleasant to herbivorous animals. Essential oil from roots, stems, leaves, and flowers were analyzed via GC/MS analyses, revealing the presence of 70 compounds, with a clear prevalence of coumarin. The high concentration of this metabolite may explain the resistance of O. purpurea to herbivores, being associated with appetite-suppressing properties and a bitter taste. Non-volatile fractions were analyzed via UHPLC-MS analysis revealing the presence of hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives, polyphenols, and glycosidic compounds, probably responsible for their color and fragrance. Taken together, the herein presented results shed light on both the defensive strategy and the chemotaxonomy of O. purpurea.

AB  - BackgroundEscherichia coli is an opportunistic pathogen which colonizes various host species. However, to what extent genetic lineages of E. coli are adapted or restricted to specific hosts and the genomic determinants of such adaptation or restriction is poorly understood.ResultsWe randomly sampled E. coli isolates from four countries (Germany, UK, Spain, and Vietnam), obtained from five host species (human, pig, cattle, chicken, and wild boar) over 16 years, from both healthy and diseased hosts, to construct a collection of 1198 whole-genome sequenced E. coli isolates. We identified associations between specific E. coli lineages and the host from which they were isolated. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified several E. coli genes that were associated with human, cattle, or chicken hosts, whereas no genes associated with the pig host could be found. In silico characterization of nine contiguous genes (collectively designated as nan-9) associated with the human host indicated that these genes are involved in the metabolism of sialic acids (Sia). In contrast, the previously described sialic acid regulon known as sialoregulon (i.e. nanRATEK-yhcH, nanXY, and nanCMS) was not associated with any host species. In vitro growth experiments with a Delta nan-9 E. coli mutant strain, using the sialic acids 5-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) as sole carbon source, showed impaired growth behaviour compared to the wild-type.ConclusionsThis study provides an extensive analysis of genetic determinants which may contribute to host specificity in E. coli. Our findings should inform risk analysis and epidemiological monitoring of (antimicrobial resistant) E. coli.

AB  - Wool, a natural fibre derived from sheep, can present a challenge to wool processing and manufacturing industries because of the variation in fibre traits. Genetic improvement offers one solution to this challenge, and having a better understanding of the genes that affect wool fibre traits is therefore important. Here, we describe ovine KRTAP19-3, a new member of the KAP19 gene family. Phylogenetic analysis revealed its relationship to other known KRTAP19 gene sequences, and an analysis of the nucleotide sequence variation in KRTAP19-3 from 288 sheep of a variety of breeds revealed six unique variant sequences. Among these variants, eleven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected, with six located in the coding region. Three of these coding region SNPs were non-synonymous and would result in amino acid changes. Associations were observed between the presence of specific sequence variants in Chinese Tan sheep and wool trait variation, particularly an increase in fibre diameter variability in the heterotypic hair fibres. These findings enhance our understanding of the genes that encode sheep wool proteins.

AB  - Anaerobic co-digestion was conducted on the solid residues after three-phase separation of kitchen waste (KWS) and waste-activated sludge (WAS), the synergistic effects and process performance were studied during co-digestion at different ratios of KWS to WAS. KWS and WAS mix ratios of 0:1, 1:4, 1:3, 1:2, 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1 and 1:0 (based on TS). The results showed that a ratio of KWS to WAS of 1:1 got a very high methane recovery with a methane yield of 310.45 +/- 30.05 mL/g VSadded. The highest concentration of free ammonia among all reaction systems was only 70.23 +/- 5.53 mg/L, which was not enough to produce ammonia inhibition in the anaerobic co-digestion system. However, when the KWS content exceeded 50%, methane inhibition and prolongation of the lag phase were observed due to the accumulation of volatile fatty acids (VFAs), and during the lag phase. Microbial community analysis showed that various bacterial groups involved in acid production and hydrolysis were mainly dominated by phylum Firmicutes, Chloroflexi, Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. Hydrogenotrophic methanogen was found to dominate all archaeal communities in the digesters. Co-digestion of KWS with WAS significantly increased the relative abundance of Methanobacterium compared with anaerobic digestion of SS alone.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Given the significant impact on both human and animal health of mosquito-borne flaviviruses, a better understanding of their transmission cycles, viewed as a complex multi pathogen-vector-host system is urgently required. Here, we use a spatial datamining framework, based on co-occurrence data that includes biotic niche variables to create models for Dengue, Yellow fever, West Nile Virus and St. Louis encephalitis in Mexico that predict: (i) which mosquito species are likely to be the most important vectors for a given pathogen; (ii) which species are most likely to be important from a multi-pathogenic viewpoint; and (iii) which mosquito and/or mammal assemblages are most likely to play an important role in the transmission cycles. Our predictions are consistent with known information about the dynamics of these mosquito-borne flaviviruses and predict new potential vectors. Our approach can improve disease surveillance efforts and generate useful information regarding public health and biodiversity conservation.
   Given the significant impact of mosquito-borne flaviviruses (MBFVs) on both human and animal health, predicting their dynamics and understanding their transmission cycle is of the utmost importance. Usually, predictions about the distribution of priority pathogens, such as Dengue, Yellow fever, West Nile Virus and St. Louis encephalitis, relate abiotic elements to simple biotic components, such as a single causal agent. Furthermore, focusing on single pathogens neglects the possibility of interactions and the existence of common elements in the transmission cycles of multiple pathogens. A necessary, but not sufficient, condition that a mosquito be a vector of a MBFV is that it co-occurs with hosts of the pathogen. We therefore use a recently developed modeling framework, based on co-occurrence data, to infer potential biotic interactions between those mosquito and mammal species which have previously been identified as vectors or confirmed positives of at least one of the considered MBFVs. We thus create models for predicting the relative importance of mosquito species as potential vectors for each pathogen, and also for all pathogens together, using the known vectors to validate the models. We infer that various mosquito species are likely to be significant vectors, even though they have not currently been identified as such, and are likely to harbor multiple pathogens, again validating the predictions with known results. Besides the above "niche-based" viewpoint we also consider an assemblage-based analysis, wherein we use a community-identification algorithm to identify those mosquito and/or mammal species that form assemblages by dint of their significant degree of co-occurrence. The most cohesive assemblage includes important primary vectors, such as A. aegypti, A. albopictus, C. quinquefasciatus, C. pipiens and mammals with abundant populations that are well-adapted to human environments, such as the white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), peccary (Tayassu pecari), opossum (Didelphis marsupialis) and bats (Artibeus lituratus and Sturnira lilium). Our results suggest that this assemblage has an important role in the transmission dynamics of this viral group viewed as a complex multi-pathogen-vector-host system. By including biotic risk factors our approach also modifies the geographical risk profiles of the spatial distribution of MBFVs in Mexico relative to a consideration of only abiotic niche variables.

AB  - Simple Summary The lambing trait is an important production trait in sheep, and the FecB gene is one of the major genes affecting sheep reproduction. In order to explore the molecular regulatory mechanisms affecting lambing number in sheep, we used RNA-seq technology to detect the thyroid transcircRNA recombinome expression patterns during the luteal and luteal phases in different FecB genotypes of small-tail Han sheep (STH), identified reproduction-related circRNAs in the thyroid gland of STH sheep, and performed bioinformatic analysis, RT-qPCR validation of these genes, and dual luciferase reporter gene experimental validation to predict their potential functions in repopulation and better reveal the molecular mechanisms of thyroid organization during reproduction in sheep.Abstract Litter size is an economically important trait in sheep, and it is a complex trait controlled by multiple genes in multiple organs. Among them, the regulation of lamb number trait by the thyroid gland is a very important part. However, the molecular mechanisms of the thyroid gland in sheep reproduction remain unclear. Here, RNA-seq was used to detect transcriptome expression patterns in the thyroid gland between follicular phase (FP) and luteal phase (LP) in FecB BB (MM) and FecB ++ (ww) STH sheep, respectively, and to identify differentially expressed circRNAs (DECs) associated with reproduction. Bioinformatic analysis of the source genes of these DECs revealed that they can be enriched in multiple signaling pathways involved in the reproductive process of animals. We found that the source genes of these DECs, such as GNAQ, VEGFC, MAPK1, STAT1, and HSD17B7, may play important roles in the reproductive process of animals. To better understand the function of these DECs, we constructed circRNA-miRNA co-expression networks. Dual luciferase reporter assays suggested that a ceRNA regulatory mechanism between circ_0003259-oar-miR-133-TXLNA and circ_0012128-oar-miR-370-3p-FGFR1 may hold. All of these DEC expression profiles in the thyroid gland provide a novel resource for elucidating the regulatory mechanisms underlying STH sheep prolificacy.

AB  - The use of fecal corticosteroid metabolites (FCMs) has proven to be well suited to evaluate adrenocortical activity, a major component of the stress response, particularly in wildlife. As with any tools, confounding factors and drawbacks must be carefully considered. Among them, sample preservation and storage are of particular importance, as they can affect stability of FCMs and lead to biased results and interpretations. Arguably, immediate freezing of fecal samples upon collection is the best practice to preserve FCM integrity, however, for logistical reasons, this condition is rarely feasible in the field. It is generally argued that temporary storage of samples at low above-zero temperature is an acceptable way of preserving samples in the field before freezing them for long-term storage. However, to our knowledge, there is no empirical study that demonstrates the stability of fecal metabolites in samples stored at +4 degrees C. In this study, we collected a fresh fecal sample from 20 captive roe deer, each of which was homogenized and split into three subsamples (60 subsamples in total) to investigate the effects on FCMs levels of temporary storage at +4 degrees C for 24 h and 48 h before freezing versus immediate freezing at -20 degrees C after feces collection. Compared to immediate freezing, mean FCMs levels decreased by 25% every 24 h when feces were stored at +4 degrees C before freezing. The variance of FCMs levels followed the same pattern, leading to a clear reduction in the ability to detect biological effects. Minimizing the storage time at +4 degrees C before freezing should therefore be seriously considered when establishing sampling and storage protocols for feces in the field for adequate hormonal profiling.

AB  - In the last decades, the intensive use of nitrogen fertilizers in annual and perennial crops has increased in Peru. These fertilizers are quickly available to plants by converting to nitrates, increasing crop yields. However, nitrogen fertilizers are very volatile and are also lost easily by leaching. This lost nitrogen (N) implies economic costs and leads to environmental problems such as eutrophication. Biochar, a new soil amendment, has been suggested as a solution to these problems; however, there has been little research on the subject in Peru. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of biochar application on corn yield and nitrogen balance in soils (Entisols with alluvial deposition) in San Ramon (Peru). Biochar was produced from green waste and pig manure. The research design considered five treatments: Control (T1), 7 t.ha(-1) of pig manure (T2), 17.5 t.ha(-1) of biochar (T3), 23 t.ha(-1) of biochar with pH adjustment (T4), and 17.5 t.ha(-1) of biochar with pH and C/N ratio adjustment (T5). The results showed that treatments T1 and T2 obtained the lowest corn yields, with an average production of 0.41 t.ha-1 and 2.45 t.ha-1, respectively. Treatment T5 produced the highest corn yield, reaching a production of 5.71 t.ha-1. A significant difference was only found in the yield of treatments T1 and T5 (p = 0.011). Nitrogen use efficiency percentages (NUE), defined as the percentage of applied N that was available to be absorbed by the crop or retained in the soil, were higher for treatments T3, T4, and T5 with 28, 28, and 56% efficiency, respectively, in comparison to treatments T1 and T2. Likewise, biochar treatments T3, T4, and T5 produced lower nitrogen losses compared to treatments T1 and T2. This research concluded that biochar-based amendments have positive effects on corn crop yield while limiting nitrogen loss.

AB  - Chronic social defeat has been found to be stressful and to affect many aspects of the brain and behaviors in males. However, relatively little is known about its effects on females. In the present study, we examined the effects of repeated social defeat on social approach and anxiety-like behaviors as well as the neuronal activation in the brain of sexually naive female Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus). Our data indicate that repeated social defeats for 20 days reduced social approach and social investigation, but increased risk assessment or vigilance to an unfamiliar conspecific. Such social defeat experience also increased anxiety-like behavior and reduced locomotor activity. Using ?FosB-immunoreactive (?FosB-ir) staining as a marker of neuronal activation in the brain, we found significant elevations by social defeat experience in the density of ?FosB-ir stained neurons in several brain regions, including the prelimbic (PL) and infralimbic (IL) subnuclei of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), CA1 subfields (CA1) of the hippocampus, central subnuclei of the amygdala (CeA), the para-ventricular nucleus (PVN), dorsomedial nucleus (DMH), and ventrolateral subdivision of the ventromedial nucleus (VMHvl) of the hypothalamus. As these brain regions have been implicated in social behaviors and stress responses, our data suggest that the specific patterns of neuronal activation in the brain may relate to the altered social and anxiety-like behaviors following chronic social defeat in female Mongolian gerbils.

AB  - This study aims to determine how different doses of phytase in diets including extruded soya and lupine seeds affect fatteners' performance, meat quality, bone mineralization, and fatty acid profile. Sixty pigs were divided into three treatment groups. The control group was offered a diet without phytase, whereas the Phy100 and Phy400 groups were provided with 100 g and 400 g of phytase per ton of their diet, respectively. The animals from both experimental groups were characterized by a significantly (p < 0.05) higher body weight gain and lower feed efficiency in the starter period than the control group. Unfortunately, their meat had lower (p < 0.05) fat content, gluteal muscle thickness, and water-holding capacity. In the meat, a higher phosphorus content (p < 0.05) was found, and in the bones, a higher calcium (for Phy400) content was found when phytase was added to the pigs' diet. The pigs from the Phy100 group tended to have higher mean backfat thickness and C18:2 n-6 content in their fat, but lower C22:5 n-3 content, than the other groups. A higher dosage of phytase is not necessary for the diets of fatteners with extruded full-fat soya and lupin seeds.

AB  - The updating of contextual memories is essential for survival in a changing environment. Accumulating data indicate that the dorsal CA1 area (dCA1) contributes to this process. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of contextual fear memory updating remain poorly understood. Postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) regulates the structure and function of glutamatergic synapses. Here, using dCA1-targeted genetic manipulations in vivo, combined with ex vivo 3D electron microscopy and electrophysiology, we identify a novel, synaptic mechanism that is induced during attenuation of contextual fear memories and involves phosphorylation of PSD-95 at Serine 73 in dCA1. Our data provide the proof that PSD-95-dependent synaptic plasticity in dCA1 is required for updating of contextual fear memory.

AB  - The objective was to evaluate the effects of intramuscular (i.m.) human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) administered on day 5 (D5) or day 7 (D7) after estrus (D0) on luteal structures (number, area, vascularization, and progesterone secretion) and pregnancy rates in estrus-induced dairy goats during the non-breeding season. Thirty-four Alpine goats received intravaginal sponges containing medroxyprogesterone acetate for 6 days and a single i.m. injection of 200 international units (IU) of equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG) plus 37.5 micrograms (mu g) of d-cloprostenol 24 hours before sponge removal. All exhibited estrus and were mated by fertile bucks. Goats were randomly assigned to hCG-5 (300 IU on D5; n = 12), hCG-7 (300 IU on D7; n = 11), or controls (n = 11). Transrectal ovarian ultrasonography and blood sampling were performed on D5, D7, D10, D13, D17, and D21, with pregnancy diagnosis on D60. hCG treatment did not affect pregnancy rates. Accessory corpora lutea (aCL) appeared in 66.6 % (hCG-5) and 90.9 % (hCG-7) (P > 0.05). Total luteal area in hCG-7 was greater (P <0.05) than in controls from D10 to D21. The mean original corpora lutea (oCL) area in hCG-7 was largest (P < 0.05) on D10. High-velocity Doppler area (HVDA) of aCL was greater (P < 0.05) in hCG-5 compared with hCG-7 on D13. Plasma progesterone (P4) concentrations were higher (P < 0.05) in hCG-7 than in controls from D10 to D21. Although hCG administered on D5 or D7 transiently enhanced luteal function and vascularization, it did not improve pregnancy outcomes in seasonally anovular dairy goats.

AB  - Larvae of Hydrotaea are facultative predators of larvae of flies commonly found in poultry farms, chicken and pig waste, and decaying carcasses. One species, the black dump fly, Hydrotaea aenescens (Wiedemann, 1830), coexists with the housefly Musca domestica (Linnaeus, 1758) in these environments and has been employed in the biological control of the housefly in the USA and Germany. To assess the predatory efficacy of H. aenescens larvae on M. domestica larvae, we conducted controlled laboratory experiments in which we selected larvae of different sizes of the larvae and the densities of both predator and prey. We set up the experiment using adult flies from a poultry farm and reared the larvae they produced in our laboratory. Our findings indicate that second- and third-instar H. aenescens larvae effectively suppressed populations of housefly larvae under laboratory conditions, especially when the latter was smaller or the same size as the former. Under these ideal experimental conditions, a single H. aenescens larva consumed up to 29 larvae of M. domestica, potentially leading to a complete eradication of the housefly population at predator-prey density levels of 1:1 and 1:4, but only when considering both the natural mortality rate of M. domestica larvae and the additional mortality caused by H. aenescens larvae. These results corroborate a pattern previously observed in other predatory larvae and have important implications for biological control and integrated pest management programs targeting M. domestica in poultry and swine farms across South America.

AB  - Pulmonary hypoplasia with anasarca, or hydrops fetalis, is characterized by stillbirth, diffuse oedema, and generalized lymph node hypoplasia. The enlarged fetus frequently causes dystocia. The disease has been reported in cattle and sheep as an inherited condition with a recessive mode of inheritance. This is the first report of the disease in Persian/Persian-cross sheep in Australia. Affected fetuses were reported from three flocks, and a total of eleven affected, eleven obligate carrier, and 188 related Persian/Persian-cross animals were available for analysis, as well as unrelated control animals. SNP genotyping revealed a region of homozygosity in affected animals on ovine chromosome six, which contained the functional candidate gene ADAMTS3. Whole genome sequencing of two affected fetuses and one obligate carrier ewe revealed a single nucleotide deletion, ENSOARG00000013204:g.87124344delC, located 3 bp downstream from a donor splice site region in the ADAMTS3 gene. Sanger sequencing of cDNA containing this variant further revealed that it is likely to introduce an early splice site in exon 14, resulting in a loss of 6 amino acids at the junction of exon 14 and intron 14/15. A genotyping assay was developed, and the ENSOARG00000013204:g.87124344delC segregated with disease in 209 animals, allowing for effective identification of carrier animals.

AB  - Hippo signaling pathway is a serine threonine kinase cascade that is evolutionary conserved with well -established roles in organ size control, development, tumorigenesis and immunity. As its core molecule, Yorkie also plays an important role against pathogen. In this study, we cloned and characterized a Yorkie ho-molog from Litopenaeus vannamei, designed as LvYKI, which has a 1650 bp open reading frame. It has the characterized domains of Yokie family, and displayed to be close to the insects and crustacean. Quantitative Real-time PCR showed that LvYKI had different regulatory mechanisms in different tissues. The transcriptional level of Lvyki was down-regulated in gill, while up-regulated in hepatopancreas post white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) infection. Moreover, the expression and phosphorylation of LvYKI was reduced upon WSSV infection, which indicated that LvYKI was involved in WSSV infection. Furthermore, RNAi was performed to evaluate the role of LvYKI in shrimp immune responses. Knocking down of Lvyki resulted in inhibition of the transcription of WSSV gene ie1 and vp28, and delayed mortality of shrimp post WSSV infection. Meanwhile, the apoptosis of hemocyte was increased as well. All results suggested that shrimp can promote apoptosis to resist WSSV infection mediated by down-regulation of LvYKI. In addition, it was found that LvYKI could interact with Lv beta-catenin, which cross -linked the Wnt and Hippo signaling pathway in innate immunity. Conclusively, our study provided clues that LvYKI plays an important role in the interaction between shrimp and virus. It will promote our understanding of the molecular mechanism in innate immunity.

AB  - The use of engineered nanomaterials (NMs) for agricultural applications is becoming increasingly interesting because NMs have been shown to promote crop yield, and also to some extent, protection against insect pests. However, we still lack evidence of the commonalties of such effects across different NMs and biological systems. For instance, although it has been shown that CeO2 NMs can promote yield in some crops, we still lack evidence for the cascading effects of Ce accumulation, via the roots, on plant physiology and plant-herbivore interaction. To address this gap, we studied the effect of soil-applied different concentrations of CeO2 NMs (0, 10, 50 and 100 mg kg(-1)) on tomato growth traits, changes in tomato leaf chemistry, and ultimately, on tomato plant resistance against the highly polyphagous Helicoverpa armigera caterpillars. The results showed that there was a strong dose-dependence for CeO2 NM addition to plant growth. Particularly, 50 mg kg(-1) CeO2 NM addition showed the highest effect on plant growth in the presence of herbivore, via increasing shoot biomass by 38.2% as compared to the control. Such an effect aboveground correlated well with the observed positive dose-dependent effect of CeO2 on different root functional traits that facilitate nutrient acquisition. Moreover, 10 and 50 mg kg(-1) CeO2 NM addition stimulated H. armigera caterpillar growth by 27.3% and 77.7%, respectively, while 100 mg kg(-1) inhibited caterpillar growth by 11%. Finally, we observed that particularly 100 mg kg(-1) CeO2 NMs significantly decreased leaf Si and Fe, but significantly increased plant nutrients (amino acids, soluble sugars) and chemical defense-related compounds (phenolics and flavonoids). Taken together, this study indicates that CeO2 NMs could increase plant growth and defensive chemistry, and in turn also affect resistance against pests in a dose-dependent manner. Therefore, establishing a sound application dosage is essential for promoting the environmentally-friendly application of NMs for simultaneously boosting crop yield and pest control in agricultural fields.

AB  - Reproductive inefficiencies, such as delayed age at first calving (AFC) and a prolonged calving interval (CI), hinder the productivity of Thai swamp buffaloes. This study aimed to improve the genetic evaluation of these traits by integrating genomic selection (GS) and genome-wide association studies (GWASs). Reproductive records (n = 1034) and genotypes (n = 474) from swamp buffaloes across Thailand were analyzed. Variance components were estimated using pedigree data, and genomic predictions were performed via weighted single-step genomic best linear unbiased prediction. AFC heritability was moderate (0.36 and 0.45), whereas CI heritability was low (0.051 and 0.043). The positive genetic correlation (rg = 0.495 and 0.517) between AFC and CI suggested potential for the simultaneous genetic improvement of both traits through selection. The WssGBLUP method showed greater effectiveness, with the prediction accuracy increasing by up to 41% for CI and 28% for AFC when compared to the ABLUP method. The GWAS revealed 20 associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on chromosomes 3, 4, 14, 15, and 25. Candidate genes COLEC10, TNFRSF11B, PDZRN4, and MACROD2 were linked to immune function, hormonal regulation, and reproductive tissue development. Pleiotropic SNPs affecting both traits were identified, indicating shared genetic control mechanisms. These findings support the application of tailored GS programs to improve reproduction in swamp buffaloes under tropical smallholder systems.

AB  - The population increase and the food demand increase the fight against climate change. Porcine production in Europe continues to increase, and Spain is the leading country in pig production. Manure management has a significant environmental impact that requires anaerobic digestion technologies for its mitigation. This technology helps produce biogas, a fuel that will reduce CO2 emissions. This study defines a distributed biogas generation model, determining the expected incomes from the development of this technology in small manure generation facilities (digestible organic waste). The development of this technology will contribute to reduce the demand for fossil energy and increase revenues by 22.7% regarding the expected revenues from the use of biogas for electricity generation.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Local tissue reactions after injection are known in animals and humans. This study analysed the local tissue reaction after injection of the so-called immunologic castration in pigs using magnetic resonance imaging to achieve insight into the reaction site. Long-lasting reactions, which can be traced to inflammatory reactions, were detected. Further studies are needed to evaluate the impact of these reactions on animal well-being and carcass quality.
   This study aimed at evaluating the local tissue reaction of an anti-GnRF product, which is used for the so called "immunocastration" in male pigs. A total of 34 pigs were injected two times (including a booster injection) with an anti-GnRF product. Injection was performed using the prescribed safety vaccinator. Injection sites were evaluated three times post injection using magnetic resonance imaging. Two examinations were performed after the first injection and one after the booster. The local tissue reaction was evaluated three-dimensionally by semi-automatic analyses, by linear measurements of injection depth and length, and by scoring the kind of tissue affected. Results showed a long-lasting reaction in affected muscle tissue. Therefore, needle length should be discussed, and an evaluation of the injection site after slaughter should be performed include behavioural scorings post injection to evaluate the impact on animal well-being and carcass quality.

AB  - Cryopreservation facilitates long-term semen storage and enables the exchange of genetic material among elite livestock over extensive distances. A decrease in sperm quality is an unavoidable outcome of the cryopreservation process. Prior research has established that incorporating cryoprotectants into the diluent can mitigate freeze-induced damage and enhance sperm quality. This study aims to assess the impact of Epimedium polysaccharide (EPS) on the cryopreservation of goat semen. Samples were obtained from six healthy goats following an initial examination. One portion of the semen was diluted with a base solution containing EPS for treatment purposes, whereas another was diluted without EPS, serving as the control. Results indicated that varying concentrations (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 mg/mL) of EPS in the diluent enhanced both physiological characteristics and antioxidant enzyme activities in cryopreserved goat sperm. Further analysis showed that the 3 mg/mL EPS concentration significantly improved sperm motility (52.10 %), plasma membrane integrity (57.01 %), tail plasma membrane integrity (52.37 %), acrosome integrity rate (52.45 %), and antioxidant enzyme activities relative to other groups (P < 0.05). Additionally, the inclusion of 3 mg/mL EPS substantially improved the sperm's fertilization capability. In conclusion, our experiments confirm that EPS supplementation significantly enhances sperm quality post-freezing, with 3 mg/mL identified as the optimal concentration.

AB  - In this study, rice winery wastewater (RWW) and molasses were anaerobically co-digested at an increasing organic loading rate (OLR). Both co-substrates with various concentrations and increased OLR (1.875 to 13 g COD L-1) have significantly stabilized the process in terms of COD removal rate and percent methane content in produced biogas. The highest COD removal rate 90.20 +/- 0.44 to 92.65 +/- 0.38% and maximum methane contents of 69.14 +/- 1.4% were observed at feeding OLR of 7 to 13 g and at 3.75 g COD L-1, respectively. However, only molasses at OLR 18.5 g COD/L.d negatively affected anaerobic digestion. The corresponding microbial changes were identified as the dominance of Methanosaetaceae over Methanobacteriaceae at various stages. However, a high abundance of Propionibacteriaceae at the final stage of the process might be responsible for digestion upset. Conclusively, the accumulation of rice winery wastewater as a co-substrate, even at a low concentration, could be a promising approach for a stable digestion process compared to mono-digestion of molasses.

AB  - Plant root-leaf communication signals are critical for plant defense. Numerous studies show that belowground organisms can alter systemically resistance traits in aboveground parts against herbivores. However, there are limited studies on root-knot nematode-aphid interaction. Moreover, the impact of nematode's initial density and infection time on plant defense is poorly understood. Here we aim to examine the induced defense responses by root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita against aboveground feeding aphid Sitobion avenae in wheat. Further, we investigated the influ-ence of the nematode infection density as well as the length of infection in these interactions. We tested the direct and indirect defense responses triggered by M. incognita against S. avenae as well as how the responses affect the preference of Harmonia axyridis. Plant volatiles and hormones were determined to explore plant defense mechanisms that mediate aboveground-belowground defense. The photosynthetic rate was tested to examine plant tolerance strategy. We found that, both low and high densities M. incognita root infection at 7 days post inoculation (dpi) reduced the feeding of the aphid S. avenae. Behavioral assay showed that H. axyridis preferred plants co-damaged by both M. incognita and S. avenae at 7 dpi. M. incognita infection induced the changes of jasmonic acid, salicylic acid and volatile content, which mediated plant response to S. avenae. Furthermore, photosynthetic rate in wheat increased at 5 dpi under 300 M. incognita or 1000 M. incognita infection. These results suggest that plant roots induced multiple defense strategies against foliar herbivores as damages increased. Our study provides evidence of a complex dynamic response of wheat aboveground defense against aphids in response to belowground nematode damage on a temporal scale.

AB  - Although the gut microbiota has been well reported to contribute to the pest insecticidal activity of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) toxin, the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. Here, bioassay, RNA-seq, and 16S rRNA sequencing were employed to explore the potential mechanism by which gut microbiota enhance the virulence of Bt maize to Mythimna separata. Two groups of neonate larvae were fed with the leaves of conventional maize (CK group) and insect-resistant transgenic maize (Bt group), respectively. The results indicated that body weight, body length, and survival rate of M. separata in the Bt group were significantly reduced. Additionally, the induced growth retardation further led to normal mating failure and fecundity deprivation of M. separata in Bt group. The 16S rRNA sequencing results indicated that exposure to insect-resistant transgenic maize significantly decreased the diversity of the bacterial community and increased the relative abundance of Enterobacter cloacae and Enterococcus mundtii by 153.02-folds and 2.08-folds, respectively. Reintroduction of these two bacteria significantly increased the sensitivity of M. separata to Bt toxin. Transcriptome results revealed that numerous genes related to Notch, Hippo, Wnt, amino acid synthesis, and fatty acid metabolism pathways were significantly down-regulated in the Bt group, whereas almost all Bt toxin receptor aminopeptidase N genes were up-regulated. This study revealed that exposure to insect-resistant transgenic maize reduced gut bacterial diversity and altered the gene expression of M. separata. Furthermore, E. cloacae and E. mundtii enhanced the susceptibility of M. separata to Bt toxin.

AB  - The role of foliar endophytes in modulating plant interactions with herbivores has been less investigated in belowground than aboveground environments. We studied how foliar Epichloe<spacing diaeresis> endophytes influence plant performance in the presence of root herbivores. We hypothesize that the endophyte-mediated increase in host performance in the context of root herbivory is due to the stimulation of plant growth in response to the herbivore attack (i.e., tolerance) and the presence of antiherbivore alkaloids in belowground tissues (i.e., resistance). We conducted a quantitative analysis of published results in relation to plant-Epichloe<spacing diaeresis>-root herbivore interactions and quantified the overall effects of endophytes on both biomass of plants in the presence/absence of root herbivores and performance of root herbivores. To gain further insights into plant-herbivore resistance, we assessed the in planta distribution of Epichloe<spacing diaeresis>-derived alkaloids and the responses of these compounds to the root herbivory. Endophytes increased plant growth in both presence/absence of root herbivores. Epichloe<spacing diaeresis> also reduced the herbivore performance, although the effect was dependent on the plant-endophyte association and herbivore type. Epichloe<spacing diaeresis>-derived alkaloids were generally less concentrated in belowground compared to aboveground plant tissues. However, the belowground:aboveground ratio for loline alkaloid concentrations was higher in plants in presence than absence of root herbivores, suggesting a local induction of resistance. Our results suggest that foliar Epichloe<spacing diaeresis> endophytes enhance plant tolerance to root herbivory by promoting plant growth and reducing root herbivore performance. The observed resistance may be partially explained by the action of Epichloe<spacing diaeresis>-derived alkaloids that are present in belowground tissues.

AB  - Growing evidence demonstrates that global change can modulate mercury (Hg) toxicity in marine organisms; however, the consensus on such effect is lacking. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the effects of global change stressors on Hg biotoxicity according to the IPCC projections (RCP 8.5) for 2100, including ocean acidification (-0.4 units), warming (+4 degrees C), and their combination (acidification-warming). The results indicated an overall aggravating effect (ln RR Delta = -0.219) of global change on Hg toxicity in marine organisms, while the effect varied with different stressors; namely, acidification potentially alleviates Hg biotoxicity (ln RR Delta = 0.117) while warming and acidification-warming have an aggravating effect (ln RR Delta = -0.328 and -0.097, respectively). Moreover, warming increases Hg toxicity in different trophic levels, i.e., primary producers (ln RR Delta = -0.198) < herbivores (ln RR Delta = -0.320) < carnivores (ln RR Delta = -0.379), implying increasing trends of Hg biomagnification through the food web. Notably, ocean hypoxia appears to boost Hg biotoxicity, although it was not considered in our meta-analysis because of the small sample size. Given the persistent global change and combined effects of these stressors in marine environments, multigeneration and multistressor research is urgently needed to fully disclose the impacts of global change on Hg pollution and its risk.

AB  - This study aimed to analyze the amino acid profile, with a particular focus on the nutritional value of the protein of the longissimus lumborum (LL) and the semimembranosus (SM) muscles of deer originating from three feeding grounds: forest (FFG); conventional (CFG) grounds; organic farm (OFG). This is the first time that deer from an organic farm feeding ground have been included in this study. The muscles were collected from 36 deer carcasses with equal proportions of sex and 31 months of age. This study demonstrated significantly higher essential amino acid (EAA) and non-essential amino acid (NEAA) contents in the muscles of deer from the FFG and CFG compared to the OFG. However, the EAA-to-NEAA ratio was significantly higher for the muscles of deer from the OFG. The muscles of the FFG and CFG deer were characterized by a higher concentration of lysine as well as acidic and tasty amino acids compared to the OFG deer, with the muscles of the latter exhibiting a higher percentage of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA). The results obtained can be used professionally by nutrition specialists in preventive and therapeutic diets and breeders to make decisions about farm location and deer feeding strategies.<br />

AB  - Cystatins are natural inhibitors of lysosomal cysteine proteases, including cathepsins B, L, H, and S. Cystatin C (CSTC) is a member of the type 2 cystatin family and is an essential biomarker in the prognosis of several dis-eases. Emerging evidence suggests the immune regulatory roles of CSTC in antigen presentation, the release of different inflammatory mediators, and apoptosis in various pathophysiologies. In this study, the 390-bp cystatin C (HaCSTC) cDNA from big-belly seahorse (Hippocampus abdominalis) was cloned and characterized by screening the pre-established cDNA library. Based on similarities in sequence, HaCSTC is a homolog of the teleost type 2 cystatin family with putative catalytic cystatin domains, signal peptides, and disulfide bonds. HaCSTC transcripts were ubiquitously expressed in all tested big-belly seahorse tissues, with the highest expression in ovaries. Im-mune challenge with lipopolysaccharides, polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid, Edwardsiella tarda, and Streptococcus iniae caused significant upregulation in HaCSTC transcript levels. Using a pMAL-c5X expression vector, the 14.29-kDa protein of recombinant HaCSTC (rHaCSTC) was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3), and its protease inhibitory activity against papain cysteine protease was determined with the aid of a protease substrate. Papain was competitively blocked by rHaCSTC in a dose-dependent manner. In response to viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) infection, HaCSTC overexpression strongly decreased the expression of VHSV tran-scripts, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and pro-apoptotic genes; while increasing the expression of anti-apoptotic genes in fathead minnow (FHM) cells. Furthermore, HaCSTC overexpression protected VHSV-infected FHM cells against VHSV-induced apoptosis and increased cell viability. Our findings imply the profound role of HaCSTC against pathogen infections by modulating fish immune responses.

AB  - Simple Summary Lamb fattening on pasture needs to address consumer demands for the extensive production of animal products with high animal welfare standards and also reduce management load. Therefore, breeding programs should focus on adequate growth and fattening performance in pasture-based production environments. In practice, progeny testing to evaluate fattening performance is commonly performed indoors. This does not represent the actual production environment, which is on pasture in many farms. In this simulation study, different scenarios with varying progeny testing schemes for fattening traits were simulated. The results revealed that a higher number of available phenotypes generally increased the accuracy of breeding value estimation. The highest genetic gain was generated in the scenario with both station and field progeny testing. As the simulation design is highly flexible, the methodology used is applicable in other sheep populations after input data modification. Translating these results into practice could improve the conservation of traditional pasture-based sheep farming in terms of environmental and social factors and increase the income of sheep breeders by improving lamb growth.Abstract Strong differences between the selection (indoor fattening) and production environment (pasture fattening) are expected to reduce genetic gain due to possible genotype-by-environment interactions (G x E). To investigate how to adapt a sheep breeding program to a pasture-based production environment, different scenarios were simulated for the German Merino sheep population using the R package Modular Breeding Program Simulator (MoBPS). All relevant selection steps and a multivariate pedigree-based BLUP breeding value estimation were included. The reference scenario included progeny testing at stations to evaluate the fattening performance and carcass traits. It was compared to alternative scenarios varying in the progeny testing scheme for fattening traits (station and/or field). The total merit index (TMI) set pasture-based lamb fattening as a breeding goal, i.e., field fattening traits were weighted. Regarding the TMI, the scenario with progeny testing both in the field and on station led to a significant increase in genetic gain compared with the reference scenario. Regarding fattening traits, genetic gain was significantly increased in the alternative scenarios in which field progeny testing was performed. In the presence of G x E, the study showed that the selection environment should match the production environment (pasture) to avoid losses in genetic gain. As most breeding goals also contain traits not recordable in field testing, the combination of both field and station testing is required to maximize genetic gain.

AB  - Simple Summary Our previous study showed that low protein (LP) diets can save protein sources and reduce nitrogen excretion without significantly impacting the growth performance of growing-finishing pigs. In the current study, sodium dichloroacetate (DCA) was used to explore whether it could work like a metabolic modulator to improve glucose and lipid oxidation in pigs fed with an LP diet, whilst glucose (GLUC) was used to evaluate if it could act as pyruvate, which is a metabolic fuel. In particular, we investigated the effects of LP diets supplemented with DCA and GLUC on metabolic responses and intestinal microbiota of finishing pigs. Our findings showed that DCA and GLUC supplementation improved the hepatic lipid metabolism but had limited effects on improving colonic microbiota profile of finishing pigs. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of low-protein (LP) diets supplemented with sodium dichloroacetate (DCA) and glucose (GLUC) on metabolic markers and intestinal microbiota of finishing pigs. A total of 80 crossbred growing barrows were allocated randomly to one of the five treatments, including the normal protein level diet (CON), the LP diets, LP with 120 mg/kg DCA (LP + DCA) or 1.8% glucose (LP + GLUC), and LP with 120 mg/kg DCA and 1.8% glucose (LP + DCA + GLUC). The LP diet increased the plasma HDL, triglyceride, and cholesterol concentrations and reduced the bile acid, urea nitrogen, albumin, and total protein concentrations compared to the CON diet (p < 0.05). The LP + DCA + GLUC diet reduced the plasma VLDL, triglyceride, and cholesterol concentrations and increased the bile acid concentration compared with the LP diet (p < 0.05). Pigs fed the LP + DCA and LP + GLUC diets showed reduced 3-Hydroxy-3-Methylglutaryl-CoA Reductase content and increased Cytochrome P450 Family 7 Subfamily A Member 1 activity of liver compared that of the CON diet (p < 0.05). Moreover, the LP diets with or without DCA and GLUC supplementation increased the relative abundance of colonic microbiota related to carbohydrate fermentation in finishing pigs. In conclusion, 120 mg/kg DCA or 1.8% GLUC supplementation in an LP diet modulated the hepatic lipid metabolism of pigs, while the DCA along with GLUC supplementation likely improved the lipid metabolism by stimulating bile acid secretion.

AB  - Simple Summary The sharing of social and ecological information is vitally important for group-living animals, especially among cognitively advanced species (e.g., primates, cetaceans and elephants) that can acquire detailed knowledge over their long lifetimes. In our study, we compared the ability of elephants from two very different populations to assess the threat associated with different numbers of roaring lions. The population in Amboseli (Kenya) consists of stable family groups and experiences relatively low levels of human disturbance, while the population in Pilanesberg (South Africa) was founded in the early 1980's from young and often unrelated orphan elephants. We broadcast lion roars to families of elephants in both these populations and recorded how they responded to differing levels of threat (one versus three lions). The Amboseli population successfully increased their defensive bunching behaviour to the greater threat associated with three lions, whereas the Pilanesberg elephants appeared unable to make the same distinction. Our findings indicate that profound disruption experienced early in life and the lack of older adults to learn from has impaired the ability of the Pilanesberg elephants to make accurate assessments of predatory threat. We suggest that, in addition to population size, conservation practitioners need to consider the crucial role of social structure and knowledge transmission in these highly social and long-lived species. The transmission of reliable information between individuals is crucial for group-living animals. This is particularly the case for cognitively advanced mammals with overlapping generations that acquire detailed social and ecological knowledge over long lifetimes. Here, we directly compare the ecological knowledge of elephants from two populations, with radically different developmental histories, to test whether profound social disruption affects their ability to assess predatory threat. Matriarchs (<= 50 years of age) and their family groups received playbacks of three lions versus a single lion roaring. The family groups in the natural Amboseli population (Kenya) reliably assessed the greater predatory threat presented by three lions roaring versus one. However, in the socially disrupted Pilanesberg population (South Africa), no fine-scale distinctions were made between the numbers of roaring lions. Our results suggest that the removal of older and more experienced individuals in highly social species, such as elephants, is likely to impact the acquisition of ecological knowledge by younger group members, particularly through the lack of opportunity for social learning and cultural transmission of knowledge. This is likely to be exacerbated by the trauma experienced by juvenile elephants that witnessed the culling of family members and were translocated to new reserves. With increasing levels of anthropogenic disturbance, it is important that conservation practitioners consider the crucial role that population structure and knowledge transfer plays in the functioning and resilience of highly social and long-lived species.

AB  - The southern hairy-nosed wombat (Lasiorhinus latifrons) is a large, nocturnal, herbivorous, burrowing marsupial, endemic to the semi-arid and arid regions of southern Australia. The active burrow of L. latifrons is used as the primary feature in population estimations. Therefore, accurate identification of an active burrow is vital, especially when other burrow-like structures exist. Entrance attributes such as width, height, the length and angle of the path leading to the entrance, and signs of wombat activity are indistinguishable between the different structures, making differentiation between them impossible without inspecting the structure beyond the entrance. Structures leading from entrances were identified in the field as possible burrows, blinds, and go-throughs. An unmanned aerial vehicle provided accurate images from immediately above 12 active wombat warren systems in the mid-north of South Australia, to support ground-truthing for mapping and verification of these structures. Active possible burrows (APB) were found to occur in proportionally lower numbers than the active non-burrow structures (ANBS) of blinds and go-throughs, varying in proportion from as high as 1:2 to as low as 1:11 (APB:ANBS). Defining an active burrow and other tunnels leading from an entrance increases accuracy in burrow identification used in population estimations, while recognising the existence of additional architectural features is vital to understanding the functional potential of L. latifrons as an ecosystem engineer.

AB  - Cystatins are a diverse group of cysteine protease inhibitors widely present among various organisms. Beyond their protease inhibitor function, cystatins play a crucial role in diverse pathophysiological conditions in animals, including neurodegenerative disorders, tumor progression, inflammatory diseases, and immune response. However, the role of cystatins in immunity against viral and bacterial infections in fish remains to be elucidated. In this study, the cystatin B from big-belly seahorse, Hippocampus abdominalis, designated as HaCSTB, was identified and characterized. HaCSTB shared the highest homology with type 1 cystatin family members of teleosts and had three cystatin catalytic domains with no signal peptides or disulfide bonds. HaCSTB transcripts were mainly expressed in peripheral blood cells (PBCs), followed by the testis and pouch of healthy big-belly seahorses. Immune challenge with lipopolysaccharides (LPS), polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C), and Streptococcus iniae induced upregulation of relative HaCSTB mRNA expression in PBCs. Subcellular localization analysis revealed the distribution of HaCSTB in the cytosol, mitochondria, and nuclei of fathead minnow cells (FHM). Recombinant HaCSTB (rHaCSTB) exhibited potent in vitro inhibitory activity against papain, a cysteine protease, in a concentration-, pH-, and temperature-dependent manner. Overexpression of HaCSTB in viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV)-susceptible FHM cells increased cell viability and reduced VHSV-induced apoptosis. Collectively, these results suggest that HaCSTB might engage in the teleostean immune protection against bacteria and viruses.

AB  - Selenium (Se) is an important trace element to maintain the body's dynamic balance. Lack of Se can cause inflammation. Studies have shown that inflammation often leads to disorders of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, but the mechanism by which Se deficiency causes inflammation of the porcine adrenal glands is still unclear. In order to study the effect of Se deficiency on the adrenal glands of pigs, we obtained Se-deficient pig adrenal glands through a low-Se diet. The results of mass spectrometry showed that the Se content in the Se-deficient group was only one-tenth of the control group. We detected the expression of the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and downstream factors by qRT-PCR and Western blotting, and found that the lack of Se affected the TLR4/NF-kappa B pathway. It is known that miR-155-3p, miR-30d-R_1, and miR-146b have all been verified for targeting relationship with TLR4. We confirmed by qRT-PCR that miR-30d-R_1 decreased most significantly in the Se-deficient pig model. Then we tested 25 selenoproteins and some indicators of oxidative stress. It is confirmed that Se deficiency reduces the antioxidant capacity and induces oxidative stress in pig adrenal tissue. In short, a diet lacking Se induces oxidative stress in pig adrenal tissues and leads to inflammation through the miR-30d-R_1/TLR4 pathway. This study provides a reference for the prevention of adrenal inflammation in pigs from a nutritional point of view.

AB  - Simple Summary The association of the risk factors, serum constituents related to abortion and calving rates were investigated. Multiparous buffaloes were less likely to abort and more likely to calving than primiparous. Dry buffaloes had lesser odds of abortion and were six times more likely to give birth than those lactating. Conversely, the sex of the fetus had no impact. In aborted animals, serum glucose and copper were higher, whereas urea, uric acid, total proteins, total cholesterol, phosphorus, magnesium and iron were lower than in normal pregnancy. This emphasizes that risk factors and serum constituents associated with abortion aid to construct suitable preventive measures to raise reproductive performance. The aim of the present study was to investigate risk factors, serum minerals, and metabolites associated with non-infectious abortion and calving rates of Egyptian buffaloes. Data were obtained from 364 pregnant buffaloes of different ages and parities over 7 years from 2014 to 2020. Body condition score (BCS) was a risk factor regarding abortion and calving; the thinnest buffaloes were more likely to abort and less likely to calving than those with body energy reserves. In comparison with the spring season, aborting probability decreased 49.7% the odds ratio (OR = 0.503), while the chance of calving increased 72.1% (OR = 1.721) during winter. The parity was another significant factor related to abortion and calving rates; multiparous buffaloes were less likely to abort and more likely to calving than primiparous. Dry buffaloes had 88.2% (OR = 0.118) lesser odds of abortion and six times (OR = 6.012) more likely to give birth than those lactating. The sex of the fetus was not a risk factor regarding abortion or calving. Other variables significantly associated with abortion rate were glucose and copper in the sera of aborted buffaloes were significantly higher (p < 0.05), and those of urea, uric acid, total protein, total cholesterol, phosphorus, magnesium and iron were significantly (p < 0.05) lower than a normal pregnancy. In conclusion, the present results emphasize that the identification of the risk factors, serum minerals and metabolites associated with fetus abortion of Egyptian buffalo may provide useful information, which assists to construct suitable preventive measures to raise reproductive performance.

AB  - Simple Summary We proposed a target detection algorithm based on the channel attention mechanism SENet, the GeLU activation function and layer normalized ShallowSE. We refined and simplified the PANet part and the YOLO Head part in YOLOv4 to obtain the Custom_YOLO target detection module. We designed a 3D coordinate regression algorithm for three fully connected networks in order to predict the goats' coordinates. We combined the improved YOLOv4 target detection algorithm and coordinate regression algorithm to achieve goat localization.Abstract In order to achieve goat localization to help prevent goats from wandering, we proposed an efficient target localization method based on machine vision. Albas velvet goats from a farm in Ertok Banner, Ordos City, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China, were the main objects of study. First, we proposed detecting the goats using a shallow convolutional neural network, ShallowSE, with the channel attention mechanism SENet, the GeLU activation function and layer normalization. Second, we designed three fully connected coordinate regression network models to predict the spatial coordinates of the goats. Finally, the target detection algorithm and the coordinate regression algorithm were combined to localize the flock. We experimentally confirmed the proposed method using our dataset. The proposed algorithm obtained a good detection accuracy and successful localization rate compared to other popular algorithms. The overall number of parameters in the target detection algorithm model was only 4.5 M. The average detection accuracy reached 95.89% and the detection time was only 8.5 ms. The average localization error of the group localization algorithm was only 0.94 m and the localization time was 0.21 s. In conclusion, the method achieved fast and accurate localization, which helped to rationalize the use of grassland resources and to promote the sustainable development of rangelands.

AB  - The studies conducted so far indicate a negative effect of dioxins on the structure of the alveolar bone and teeth, especially in the developmental period in rats. The research aimed to analyze the indirect effect of dioxins contained in the body of female rats on the structure of the dental organ in their offspring in the neonatal period and to determine the possibility of reducing potential dioxin disorders of the structure of hard tissues in the offspring of intoxicated mothers by simultaneous administration of vitamin E or acetylsalicylic acid (ASA). Another goal of the research was to determine the level of magnesium, calcium and phosphorus contained in bone tissue as indicators of the mineralization process of hard tissues in rats, in the case of using 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and acetylsalicylic acid or oc-tocopherol. The experiment was carried out on eight female rats of the Buffalo strain divided into four groups. From the offspring of eight females, the mandibles were removed from the mandibular joints, and then, after the removal of soft tissues, they were prepared for individual tests. Selected morphological, chemical and physical parameters of the teeth of the offspring of female rats from the experimental groups were analyzed. The analysis showed the effect of vitamin E and ASA on the content of Mg, Ca and P. In combination with TCDD, vitamin E and ASA, they positively inhibit the inflammatory process, preventing the leaching of Ca and Mg from the bones. ASA counteracted this phenomenon much more effectively than vitamin E. Detailed analysis of the tooth morphology showed that the molars' crowns exhibit shape disturbances under the influence of TCDD. Individual nodules in teeth T1, T2, T3 did not fuse, and the roots showed signs of hypertrophy. The study confirmed the negative effect of TCDD on tooth development. Teeth arising early in development are the most sensitive to the disorders, while the later ones are less exposed to the toxic effects of TCDD transmitted by the mother.

AB  - Katjang goat meat has the potential to be used for emulsified meat product production but the suitable starch type to be applied as the filler is unknown. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of various. starches on the quality characteristic of Katjang goat meat emulsion. Katjang goat meat emulsion was prepared by incorporating various starches viz., tapioca starch (TS), sago starch (SS), and wheat starch (WS), as filler by replacing lean meat. The developed emulsion samples were evaluated for physiochemical, proximate, colour, texture, and gel strength. The addition of TS into meat emulsion results in the most stable emulsion as exhibited by the lowest total expressible fluid (%TEF), expressible fat (%EFAT), and cooking loss. There was no significant (p-0.05) difference for the pH, water holding capacity (WHC), texture profile analysis (TPA), and colour values of all the samples. The incorporation of SS in the formulation decreased (p<0.05) the shear force and work of shearing. In conclusion, the incorporation of TS was found optimum to formulate goat meat emulsion with better quality characteristics.

AB  - Elaeophora (Nematoda: Onchocercidae), a filarial nematode infecting the blood vessels of ruminants and horses, is transmitted by tabanid flies. Elaeophora elaphi was previously detected in wild sika deer in Wakayama Prefecture, Japan in 2009; however, detailed information on this species is scarce. In 2023, 26 Elaeophora worms were collected from the hepatic vasculature of eight deer in Nara, Mie, Kyoto and Gifu Prefectures of Japan and analyzed. Species identification was performed by morphological and genetic analyses. Additionally, multi-gene analysis of seven genes was performed to determine their taxonomic position within the family Onchocercidae. The specimens were identified as E. elaphi based on their morphological characteristics. Analyses of 18S rRNA and cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 genes revealed no variations, indicating that species belonged to the same lineage. Multi-gene analysis revealed that the species belonged to the subfamily Onchocercinae, showing a close relationship with the tick-borne filarial nematodes of the genera Monanema, Acanthocheilonema, Litomosoides, Cruorifilaria, Yatesia, and Cercopithifilaria. This study demonstrated the widespread distribution of E. elaphi in Japan and provided insights into its genetic relationship with other onchocercid species. Further research is necessary to determine the ecological and epidemiological implications of this parasite.

AB  - The aims of this study were to determine the changes in the capillary area density in relation to fetal development, to determine immunoexpression of angiogenic factors and to compare their mRNA expression throughout pig gestation. Samples were collected from the maternal-chorioallantoic interface at days 40, 77, 85 and 114 of pregnancy for immunohistochemistry analysis and the measurement of mRNA expression of VEGFA, ANGPT1, ANGPT2, FGF2 and its receptors KDR, TEK, FGFR1, FGFR2 respectively. Morphometric measurement of blood vessels was performed. We found a significant increase in capillary area density throughout gestation (P < 0.05). On the maternal side, at day 77, we observed a significant increase in the number of vessels from small vascular areas (P < 0.05) and the vascular area was significantly higher on day 85 (P < 0.05). On the fetal side, the number of vessels and the vascular area increased between days 40 and 77 (P < 0.05) and between days 77 and 114 (P < 0.05), respectively. Immunohistochemical findings revealed intense VEGFA staining and a trend for increased expression towards the end of gestation (P < 0.05). We also demonstrated a high VEGFA, FGF2, FGFR1, ANGPT1 and ANGPT2 mRNA expression at day 77 (P < 0.05). In conclusion, our findings suggest that an active angiogenesis would be present even until late-middle gestation at day 77 of pregnancy with the predominance of angiogenic stimulation by VEGFA/KDR, FGF2/FGFR1 and a balance between ANGPT1 and ANGPT2/TEK.
   Lay summary
   Critical moments occur at different stages of placental formation in pigs, where the expression of angiogenic factors, that is, molecules that stimulate the formation of blood vessels must be adequate to promote their development. This exchange is necessary to cover the increasing nutritional demands of fetuses in continuous development. Determining the changes in the area of capillary density in relation to fetal development and the expression of angiogenic factors throughout pregnancy in pigs could contribute to understanding the causes of fetal loss. Placental samples were obtained at gestational days 40, 77, 85 and 114 (n = 7, 10, 7 and 5, respectively). We found that the capillary area density increases accompanying fetal growth with advancing gestation and an increase in capillary area density in late-middle gestation, around day 77, is due to the expansion in the number of small blood vessels on the maternal side. The present findings suggest that an intense angiogenesis would be present even until late-middle gestation at day 77 of pregnancy, with the predominance of angiogenic stimulation by specific molecules that promote this process.

AB  - Simple Summary Mastitis can be considered one of the costliest diseases of the dairy Mediterranean Buffalo. Early detection of the disease is thus of great importance to farmers, to reduce or prevent production losses. The measurement of electrical conductivity (EC) of milk is a relatively simple and inexpensive technique, and it has been studied as a routine method for the diagnosis of mastitis in dairy farm. Limited information is currently available on the relationships among EC, production traits and somatic cells count in Italian Mediterranean Buffalo. Hence, the aim of this study was to investigate those correlations using data collected at a commercial Italian buffalo farm. We can conclude that in buffalo, as in other species, there is a strong relationship between EC and somatic cells. Furthermore, we observed that, if the objective is to have an additional and informative parameter for early detection of mastitis, frequent EC recording, possibly performed over a longer period of time, is more effective than recording EC only a few times. Even if our results are encouraging, further studies are needed, in order to validate them, especially if the objective is the development of udder disease prediction models. The measurement of milk electrical conductivity (EC) is a relatively simple and inexpensive technique that has been evaluated as a routine method for the diagnosis of mastitis in dairy farms. The aim of this study was to obtain further knowledge on relationships between EC, production traits and somatic cell count (SCC) in Italian Mediterranean Buffalo. The original dataset included 5411 records collected from 808 buffalo cows. Two mixed models were used to evaluate both the effect of EC on MY, PP and FP and EC at test-day, and the effect of EC on somatic cell score (SCS) by using five different parameters (EC_param), namely: EC collected at the official milk recording test day (EC_day(0)), EC collected 3 days before official milk recording (EC_day(3)), and three statistics calculated from EC collected 1, 3 and 5 days before each test-day, respectively. All effects included in the model were significant for all traits, with the only exception of the effect of EC nested within parity for FP. The relationship between EC and SCS was always positive, but of different magnitude according to the parity. The regression of EC on SCS at test-day using different EC parameters was always significant except when the regression parameter was the slope obtained from a linear regression of EC collected over the 5-day period. Moreover, in order to evaluate how well the different models fit the data, three parameters were used: the Average Information Criteria (AIC), the marginal R-2 and the conditional R-2. According to AIC and to both the Marginal and Conditional R-2, the best results were obtained when the regression parameter was the mean EC estimated over the 5-day period.

AB  - Oral ingestion of probiotics is a promising approach to relieving inflammatory disease through regulating the gut microbiota. A newly discovered strain, Lactobacillus rhamnosus CY12 (LCY12), obtained from cattle-yak milk, displayed numerous probiotic properties. These included enhanced viability in low pH and bile environments, adhesion capabilities, and potent antimicrobial effects. The research aimed to explore the beneficial impacts of the novel LCY12 strain on colitis in mice induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) and to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms. The results of the study showed that administration of LCY12 effectively helped to reduce the negative effects of DSS-induced body weight loss, disease activity index score, colon length shortening, loss of goblet cells, and overall histopathological scores in the intestines. Simultaneously, LCY12 administration significantly alleviated intestinal inflammation and safeguarded intestinal barrier integrity by enhancing IL-10 levels, while dampening IL-6, IL-1 beta, and TNF-alpha production. Additionally, LCY12 boosted the presence of tight junction proteins. Furthermore, LCY12 hindered the TLR4/MyD88/NF-kappa B signaling pathway by downregulating TLR4 and MyD88 expression, inactivating phosphorylated I kappa B alpha, and preventing translocation of NF-kappa B p65 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. The LCY12 also increased specific intestinal microbial communities and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production. Altogether, LCY12 oral administration alleviated colitis induced with DSS in mice by improving intestinal barrier function and regulating inflammatory cytokines, SCFA production, and intestinal microbiota.

AB  - The seminal plasma (SP) is the liquid component of semen that facilitates sperm transport through the female genital tract. SP modulates the activity of the ovary, oviductal environment and uterine function during the periovulatory and early pregnancy period. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted in the oviduct (oEVs) and uterus (uEVs) have been shown to influence the expression of endometrial genes that regulate fertilization and early embryo development. In some species, semen is composed of well-separated fractions that vary in concentration of spermatozoa and SP composition and volume. This study aimed to investigate the impact of different accumulative fractions of the porcine ejaculate (F1, composed of the sperm-rich fraction, SRF; F2, composed of F1 plus the intermediate fraction; F3, composed of F2 plus the post-SRF) on oEVs and uEVs protein cargo. Six days after the onset of estrus, we determined the oEVs and uEVs size and protein concentration in pregnant sows by artificial insemination (AI-sows) and in non-inseminated sows as control (C-sows). We also identified the main proteins in oEVs and uEVs, in AI-F1, AI-F2, AI-F3, and C-sows. Our results indicated that although the size of EVs is similar between AI- and C-sows, the protein concentration of both oEVs and uEVs was significantly lower in AI-sows (p < 0.05). Proteomic analysis identified 38 unique proteins in oEVs from AI-sows, mainly involved in protein stabilization, glycolytic and carbohydrate processes. The uEVs from AI-sows showed the presence of 43 unique proteins, including already-known fertility-related proteins (EZR, HSPAA901, PDS). We also demonstrated that the protein composition of oEVs and uEVs differed depending on the seminal fraction(s) inseminated (F1, F2, or F3). In conclusion, we found specific protein cargo in oEVs and uEVs according to the type of semen fraction the sow was inseminated with and whose functions these specific EVs proteins are closely associated with reproductive processes.

AB  - Research has demonstrated that certain microRNAs (miRNAs) play a pivotal role in governing milk protein synthesis in mice and dairy cows. However, there remains a limited understanding of specific miRNAs that regulate milk protein synthesis in buffalo. While our previous transcriptome data identified miR-29c and miR-106b as potential regulators influencing buffalo milk protein synthesis, the precise mechanism by which they modulate this process remains elusive. To address this gap, we conducted overexpression and knockdown experiments in this study. Our findings reveal that miR-29c and miR-106b exhibit inhibitory effects on the mRNA levels of CSN2 and CSN3 genes, along with diminishing beta-casein production, within buffalo mammary epithelial cells (BuMECs). Furthermore, these miRNAs exert regulatory effects on the transcription and phosphorylation states of pivotal components within the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and JAK2-STAT5 signaling pathways. Employing the luciferase reporter system and qPCR, we confirmed the PTHLH gene as a shared target of miR-29c and miR-106b. Notably, they collaboratively regulate PTHLH gene expression. Our previous investigation highlighted the role of the PTHLH gene in augmenting milk protein production within BuMECs, achieved via stimulation of the mTOR and JAK2-STAT5 signaling cascades. Consequently, the inhibitory effect of miR-29c and miR-106b on buffalo milk protein synthesis is attributed to their coregulation of PTHLH. These findings emphasize the significance of miR-29c and miR-106b as essential regulators of milk protein synthesis, shedding light on the underlying mechanism governing milk production in buffalo.

AB  - Organic fertilizers are an important source of nutrients for improving farmland fertility. To explore high-yield, efficient and green production technology for oilseed flax in dryland agricultural areas, a field split plot experiment was conducted in the semi-arid area of the Loess Plateau in northwest China from April to August in 2020 and 2021. The study compared and analyzed the effects of different nutrient sources and their application rates on water consumption characteristics, grain yield and water use efficiency of oilseed flax. The main plots were fertilizer types (sheep manure, chicken manure and chemical fertilizer), while the subplots were fertilizer application rates (sheep manure: S1-12,500 kg & BULL;hm(-2) and S2-25,000 kg & BULL;hm(-2); chicken manure: C1-5800 kg & BULL;hm(-2) and C2-11,600 kg & BULL;hm(-2); chemical fertilizer: F1-N 112.5 kg & BULL;hm(-2), P 75 kg & BULL;hm(-2), K 67.5 kg & BULL;hm(-2) and F2-N 225 kg & BULL;hm(-2), P2O5 150 kg & BULL;hm(-2), K2O 135 kg & BULL;hm(-2)). The results showed that compared with chemical fertilizers, organic fertilizers significantly increased the soil water storage capacity of the 0-160 cm soil layer during the whole growth period of oilseed flax and significantly reduced water consumption. During two growing seasons, the application of 25,000 kg & BULL;hm(-2) sheep manure significantly reduced water consumption during the seedling-bud period and green fruit period-maturity period of oilseed flax by 16.13% and 23.19% compared with CK, respectively. Thousand-grain weight, yield and water use efficiency were significantly increased by 14.70%, 48.32% and 61.29%, respectively. These results indicate that the application of 25,000 kg & BULL;hm(-2) sheep manure can significantly increase soil water storage capacity of the 0-160 cm soil layer, reduce water consumption during the whole growth period of oilseed flax and thus improve grain yield and water use efficiency of oilseed flax. It is a suitable fertilization technology for the high-yield, efficient and green production of oilseed flax in the semi-arid areas of northwest Loess Plateau.

AB  - The flowering of tea plant Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze consumes large amounts of water and nutrients and negatively affects the growth of tea plant. The effects of plant growth regulators, including ethephon, alpha-naphthalene acetic acid, salicylic acid, chlormequat, and paclobutrazol, were investigated on the abscission of flower buds and flowers on the tea plant. The occurrence of anthracnose Gloeosporium theae-sinesis Miyake and tea green leafhopper Empoasca onukii Matsuda on the tea plant were also investigated after exogenous application of these chemicals. Ethephon (at 800, 1200, and 1600 mg l(-1)), paclobutrazol (at 150, 300, and 600 mg l(-1)), and chlormequat (at 300 and 600 mg l(-1)) significantly promoted the abscission of flower buds and flowers and finally reduced the number of tea flowers in the tea plantations. These three compounds had almost no effect on the number of tea shoots. Moreover, paclobutrazol and chlormequat also suppressed the occurrence of anthracnose on the tea plant. Paclobutrazol and chlormequat induced the high catalase and peroxidase activities in the tea plant. In addition, the photosynthetic characteristics and biochemical components such as tea polyphenols in the tea plant leaves treated with plant growth regulators decreased significantly. There was a certain correlation between effects of ethephon and paclobutrazol on flower abscission and the expression of ACS and ETR. Overall, plant growth regulators could effectively reduce tea flowers and suppress anthracnose on the tea plant.

AB  - The pathogenic fungus Cercospora infecting plants causes high degree symptomatic disease in several important crops including tea (Camellia sinensis). Genetic diversity studies on plant pathogens are essential to tackle plant diseases, hence in the proposed study, Cercospora theae isolated from different regions was characterized using the molecular tool like RFLP of the rDNA regions amplified using ITS primers. Protein profiling for all the isolates was also done by optimizing the protein extraction using sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), urea and Trichloro-acetic acid (TCA) protocols. Genetic relatedness with the identical size of molecular weight among the three C. theae isolates of different regions was studied from the 5.8S rDNA-ITS amplified regions. Digestion of the amplified regions with seven specific endonucleases exposed the same banding pattern among the isolates. The sequence data from the three isolates showed maximum homology with the Genbank sequence of Cercospora spp. (HQ450006, JQ754039, JQ753964, JN942274, JN942272, FJ460222 and EU581822). Further, an optimized protocol for protein profiling of C. theae was determined to extract the majority of the proteins. The results also revealed that the most suitable protocol for studying the proteomics of C. theae was the SDS extraction method.

AB  - Orf is an important zoonotic disease caused by the Orf virus (ORFV) which can cause contagious pustular dermatitis in goats and sheep. Orf is widespread in most sheep-raising countries in the world, causing huge economic losses. Although diagnostic methods for ORFV infection already exist, it is still necessary to develop a time-saving, labor-saving, specific, low-cost and visual diagnostic method for rapid detection of ORFV in the field and application in grassroots laboratories. This study establishes a DNA extraction-free, real-time, visual recombinase-aided amplification (RAA) method for the rapid detection of ORFV. This method is specific to ORFV and does not cross-react with other common DNA viruses. The detection limits of the real-time RAA and visual judgment of the RAA assay at 95% probability were 13 and 21 copies per reaction for ORFV, respectively. Compared with qPCR, the sensitivity and specificity of the real-time RAA assay were 100%, and those of the visual RAA assay were 92.31% and 100.0%, respectively. The DNA extraction-free visual detection method of RAA established in this study can meet the needs of rapid onsite detection and grassroots laboratories and has important reference value and significance for the early diagnosis of diseased animals.

AB  - T follicular helper (Tfh) cells provide help to germinal center B cells for affinity maturation, class switch and memory formation. Despite these important functions, this subset has not been studied in detail in pigs due to a lack of species-specific antibodies. We investigated putative Tfh cells from lymphoid tissues and blood of healthy pigs by using cross-reactive antibodies for inducible T-cell costimulator (ICOS) and B-cell lymphoma 6 (Bcl-6). In lymph nodes, we identified a CD4(+) T cell population with an ICOS(+)Bcl-6(+)CD8 alpha(+) phenotype, reminiscent of human and murine germinal center Tfh cells. Within blood-derived CD4(+) T cells, sorted ICOSh- iCD25(-) and ICOS(dim)CD25(dim) cells were able to induce the differentiation of CD21(+)IgM(+) B cells into Ig-secreting plasmablasts. Compared to naive CD4(+) T cells, these two phenotypes were 3-to 7-fold enriched for cells expressing the Tfh-related transcripts CD28, CD40LG, IL6R and MAF, as identified by single-cell RNA sequencing. These results provide a first characterization of Tfh cells in swine and confirm their ability to provide B-cell help.

AB  - BACKGROUND Glandular trichomes are essential in plants' defence against pests however, the mechanisms of action are not completely understood. While there is considerable evidence of feeding and movement impairment by trichomes, the effect on other traits is less clear. We combined laboratory and greenhouse experiments with molecular analysis to understand how glandular trichomes affect the behavior, population growth, and the expression of biomarkers involved in detoxification, primary metabolism, and developmental pathways of the aphid Macrosiphum euphorbiae. We used two isogenic tomato lines that differ in the presence of type IV glandular trichomes and production of acylsucroses; i.e.,Solanum lycopersicum cv. 'Moneymaker' and an introgressed line from Solanum pimpinellifolium (with trichomes type IV).
   RESULTS Type IV glandular trichomes affected host selection and aphid proliferation with aphids avoiding, and showing impaired multiplication on the genotype with trichomes. The exposure to type IV glandular trichomes resulted in the overexpression of detoxication markers (i.e., Hsp70, Hsp17, Hsp10); the repression of the energetic metabolism (GAPDH), and the activation of the ecdysone pathway; all these, underlying the key adaptations and metabolic trade-offs in aphids exposed to glandular trichomes.
   CONCLUSION Our results demonstrate the detrimental effect of glandular trichomes (type IV) on the aphid and put forward their mode of action. Given the prevalence of glandular trichomes in wild and cultivated Solanaceae; and of the investigated molecular biomarkers in insects in general, our results provide relevant mechanisms to understand the effect of trichomes not only on herbivorous insects but also on other trophic levels.

AB  - As a class of synthetic sulfur drugs, sulfonamides (SAs) have been used to treat diseases and promote organism growth. Different concentrations of SAs have been detected in the water environment, which has threatened the ecological environment. In this study, the contamination of 9 SAs in water, sediments, and 8 fish species from the Hangbu-Fengle River, China, were analyzed using UPLC-MS/MS. The total SA concentrations in surface water, sediments, and fish were ND-5.064 ng/L, ND-5.052 ng/g dry weight (d.w.), and ND-1.42 ng/g wet weight (w.w.), respectively. The major compounds were sulfadiazine (SDZ), sulfamerazine (SMZ), and sulfamethoxazole (SMX) in water and fish. The SA levels of in fish from different habitat preferences revealed a spatial difference, with the order of demersal species > pelagic species. Moreover, the SA concentrations were affected by trophic guilds, indicating their decrease in the order of piscivorous fish > omnivorous fish > planktivorous fish > herbivorous fish. The obtained bioaccumulation factors showed that SMZ and SMX have strong bioenrichments in Ophiocephalus argus Cantor and Pelteobagrus fulvidraco. The risk assessment indicated that SAs did not pose significant health threats to the organisms. This research is the first report of SA contamination in the Hangbu-Fenle River, which can provide an important scientific basis for their pollution prevention and ecological risk assessment in the aquatic environment.

AB  - While plants produce complex cocktails of chemical defences with different targets and efficacies, the biochemical effects of phytotoxin ingestion are often poorly understood. Here, we examine the physiological and metabolic effects of the ingestion of glucosinolates (GSLs), the frontline chemical defenses of brassicas (crucifers), on the generalist herbivore Helicoverpa armigera. We focus on kale and cabbage, two crops with similar foliar GSL concentrations but strikingly different GSL compositions. We observed that larval growth and development were well correlated with the nutritional properties of the insect diets, with low protein contents appearing to exacerbate the negative effects of GSLs on growth, pupation and adult eclosion, parameters that were all delayed upon exposure to GSLs. The different GSLs were metabolized similarly by the insect, indicating that the costs of detoxification via conjugation to glutathione (GSH) were similar on the two plant diets. Nevertheless, larval GSH contents, as well as some major nutritional markers (larval protein, free amino acids, and fat), were differentially affected by the different GSL profiles in the two crops. Therefore, the interplay between GSL and the nitrogen/sulfur nutritional availability of different brassicas strongly influences the effectiveness of these chemical defenses against this generalist herbivore.

AB  - Most inflammatory dermatophytoses in humans are caused by zoophilic and geophilic dermatophytes. Knowledge of the epidemiology of these fungi in animals facilitates the prevention of dermatophytosis of animal origin in humans. We studied the prevalence of dermatophyte species in domestic animals in Switzerland and examined the effectiveness of direct mycological examination (DME) for their detection compared to mycological cultures. In total, 3515 hair and skin samples, collected between 2008 and 2022 by practicing veterinarians, were subjected to direct fluorescence microscopy and fungal culture. Overall, 611 dermatophytes were isolated, of which 547 (89.5%) were from DME-positive samples. Cats and dogs were the main reservoirs of Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Microsporum canis, whereas Trichophyton benhamiae was predominantly found in guinea pigs. Cultures with M. canis significantly (p < 0.001) outnumbered those with T. mentagrophytes in DME-negative samples (19.3% versus 6.8%), possibly because M. canis can be asymptomatic in cats and dogs, unlike T. mentagrophytes, which is always infectious. Our data confirm DME as a reliable, quick, and easy method to identify the presence of dermatophytes in animals. A positive DME in an animal hair or skin sample should alert people in contact with the animal to the risk of contracting dermatophytosis.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) in the long term is often accompanied by mental and neurological disorders. Glucocorticoids, which regulate the physiological response of the body to acute and chronic stress, may be associated with long-term changes in the hippocampus and long-term behavioral consequences of TBI. It is well known that the level of cortisol in humans and corticosterone (CS) in rats varies widely during the daily cycle and affects stress reactivity. We analyzed if the time of the day when lateral fluid percussion (LFP) brain injury has been applied affects the development of immediate posttraumatic seizures and CS level as a marker of stress-reactivity. Surgery and LFP application were carried out from 9:00 to 22:00. The animals were sacrificed on days 1, 3, 7 and 14 after TBI from 10:00 to 12:00, which corresponded to a low daily CS level in rats. For the first time we have shown that the time of LFP application is a significant factor affecting CS level elevation in the acute period of TBI: the earlier LFP was associated with the higher CS level in decapitation blood (r = -0.56, p = 0.0004). In addition, the duration of tonic seizures and the representation of tonic seizures and jumps were higher when LFP was applied in the morning hours compared with the evening hours. Thus, the time of TBI is an essential factor of GCs elevation after trauma and may affect the development of posttraumatic long-term consequences.

AB  - Melatonin is an intracellular antioxidant of sperm membrane that protects the cells from lipid peroxidation. Yet, its role as an antioxidant on semen quality of buffalo bulls is still obscure. The present study was undertaken to assess the effect of exogenous melatonin implant (18 mg/50 kg bodyweight) on post-thaw sperm characteristics, oxidative stress, endocrinological profiles and fertility of buffalo bulls. Six apparently healthy breeding Murrah buffalo bulls were randomly selected at bull farm, Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University for the present study and divided into two groups viz. control (n = 3) and melatonin implanted group (n = 3). A total of 120 ejaculates were collected from bulls of both groups (n = 60 each) throughout the study period. Most beneficial effects of melatonin implants were observed during post-implantation period. The percentages of post-thaw sperm total and progressive motility, viability and mitochondrial membrane potential were higher (p < .05) in melatonin implanted buffalo bulls compared to controls during post-implantation period. Following melatonin implantation, MDA production in post-thaw semen was lower (p < .05) in melatonin implanted group than in control group. Plasma melatonin and testosterone concentrations were higher (p < .05) in buffalo bulls implanted with melatonin as compared to their control counterparts. No differences (p > .05) in plasma LH concentrations were observed in both groups. First service pregnancy rate was 43.3% using semen of melatonin implanted bulls and 30.0% with semen of controls (p > .05). Thus, melatonin was able to protect sperm membrane against oxidative damage and improve post-thaw semen quality, thereby resulting in higher fertilizing potential of spermatozoa.

AB  - Diversified strategies to incorporate healthier lipids in processed meat products are being developed. Alternative fat sources to replace animal fat associated with the reduction of fat content are some of the methods used to obtain healthier meat products well recognized by consumers. In order to create a healthier product that can also be consumed in the Halal and Kosher consumer markets, an experimental study was developed to assess the effects of replacing the pork fat (4%) with the same amount of hydrogel emulsion incorporating olive oil or sunflower oil. Three burgers were randomly selected from each lot manufactured and analyzed in triplicate. Burgers were physicochemical analyzed for pH, water activity, composition, fatty acid profile, color, yield, texture, oxidative stability, and volatile compounds and compared according to the fat source. Burgers with hydrogel emulsions can be considered reduced-fat meat products with a healthier fatty acid profile than pork fat burgers. The use of hydrogel emulsions did not negatively affect the quality characteristics assessed in the product and improved the oxidative stability during the storage of cooked burgers. By the characteristics and formulations evaluated, the replacement of pork fat with olive oil hydrogel emulsion proved to be the most effective strategy for obtaining a healthier goat meat product.

AB  - The study undertook to assess the effect of the method for stunning pigs, housed under equal conditions and transported to meat processing plants over similar distances, on the value of quality characteristics of pork. The experimental animals were divided into two groups that were subjected to a different stunning method, i.e. using electric current (Group I) and a high CO2 concentration (Group II). During the bleeding, blood samples were collected from pigs to determine the cortisol concentration, and 45 minutes after slaughter, the pH value was assessed. After cooling the carcasses, meat samples were collected from the lumbar section of the musculus longissimus dorsi muscle for laboratory assessment. The most important quality characteristics, namely water-holding capacity, drip loss, thermal drip, and tenderness, were assessed. Additionally, sensory assessment of the meat was carried out. The basic chemical composition of meat was also determined. The study results indicate certain relationships between the meat quality and the selected fattener stunning method. It is worth emphasising that a more favourable colour of meat, lower drip loss, thermal drip, and better texture of meat were found in the group of pigs subjected to gas stunning (P<0.05; P<0.01). The assessment of pigs' stress based on the blood cortisol concentration did not clearly indicate any of the stunning methods as the one inducing more stress. The differences obtained in this regard were not confirmed as statistically significant. Considering the impossibility of completely eliminating animals' stress at the pre-slaughter stage, it is important to follow appropriate procedures while maintaining proper animal welfare conditions.

AB  - Genome editing is recognized as a powerful tool in agriculture and research, enhancing our understanding of genetic function, diseases, and productivity. However, its progress in buffaloes has lagged behind other mammals due to several challenges, including long gestational periods, single pregnancies, and high raising costs. In this study, we aimed to generate MSTN-edited buffaloes, known for their distinctive double-muscling phenotype, as a proof of concept. To meet our goal, we used somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) and zygotic electroporation (CRISPR-EP) technique. For this, we firstly identified the best transfection method for introduction of RNP complex into fibroblast which was further used for SCNT. For this, we compared the transfection, cleavage efficiency and cell viability of nucleofection and lipofection in adult fibroblasts. The cleavage, transfection efficiency and cell viability of nucleofection group was found to be significantly (P <= 0.05) higher than lipofection group. Four MSTN edited colony were generated using nucleofection, out of which three colonies was found to be biallelic and one was monoallelic. Further, we compared the efficacy, embryonic developmental potential and subsequent pregnancy outcome of SCNT and zygotic electroporation. The blastocyst rate of electroporated group was found to be significantly (P <= 0.05) higher than SCNT group. However, the zygotic electroporation group resulted into two pregnancies which were confirmed to be MSTN edited. Since, the zygotic electroporation does not require complex micromanipulation techniques associated with SCNT, it has potential for facilitating the genetic modification in large livestock such as buffaloes. The present study lays the basis for inducing genetic alternation with practical or biological significance.

AB  - Oocyte quality can affect mammal fertilization rate, early embryonic development, pregnancy maintenance, and fetal development. Oxidative stress induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) is one of the most important causes of poor oocyte maturation in vitro. To reduce the degree of cellular damage caused by ROS, supplementation with the antioxidant N-Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) serves as an effective pathway to alleviate glutathione (GSH) depletion during oxidative stress. This study investigated the effects of NAC supplementation during in vitro maturation of goat oocytes and explored the molecular mechanisms of maturation by transcriptome sequencing of MII oocytes. The results showed that 1.5 mM NAC significantly increased the rates of oocyte maturation and cumulus cell expansion and improved the subsequent development of embryos. During the subsequent culture parthenogenetically activated embryos, 1.5 mM NAC significantly increased the division rate of oocytes and blastocyst rate. It also reduced the accumulation of ROS, increased the level of GSH, alleviated oxidative stress, and enhanced the antioxidant capacity and cell metabolic activity. Transcriptome sequencing results revealed that NAC treatment significantly increased the expression of SIRT1, GGCT, and MITF genes related to the cellular antioxidant system, as well as the IDH3G gene related to energy metabolism, and decreased the expression CASP8, FOS, and MMP1 genes related to apoptosis and cell invasion, as well as the CCL2. and CXCL8 genes related to the inflammatory response. In conclusion, the findings suggest that NAC supplementation significantly reduces oxidative stress, improves antioxidant capacity and metabolic activity, promotes oocyte maturation, and improves oocyte quality.

AB  - The use of the ultrafast pulse is the current trend in laser processing many materials, including diamonds. Recently, the orientation of the irradiated crystal face was shown to play a crucial role in the diamond to graphite transition process. Here, we develop this approach and explore the nanostructure of the sp(2) phase, and the structural perfection of the graphite produced. The single pulse of the third harmonic of a Ti:sapphire laser (100 fs, 266 nm) was used to study the process of producing highly oriented graphite (HOG) layers on the (111) surface of a diamond monocrystal. The laser fluence dependence on ablated crater depth was analyzed, and three different regimes of laser-induced diamond graphitization are discussed, namely: nonablative graphitization, customary ablative graphitization, and bulk graphitization. The structure of the graphitized material was investigated by confocal Raman spectroscopy. A clear correlation was found between laser ablation regimes and sp(2) phase structure. The main types of structural defects that disrupt the HOG formation both at low and high laser fluencies were determined by Raman spectroscopy. The patterns revealed give optimal laser fluence for the production of perfect graphite spots on the diamond surface.

AB  - Circulating levels of nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs) are elevated in some females, which can impair oocyte maturation and embryo development, and may alter the phenotype of the progeny. However, the effects of NEFAs on human embryo development are not clear due to ethical limitations. Thus, we used pig as the model to investigate the impacts of NEFAs on oocyte and embryo due to their similar reproductive and metabolic physiologies to humans. In this study, porcine cumulus-oocyte complexes were in vitro maturated under a pathologically high concentration of NEFAs (468 mu M palmitic acid, 194 mu M stearic acid, and 534 mu M oleic acid) with the presence of granulosa cell monolayer, in contrast to control without NEFAs. The mature oocytes were fertilized to produce embryos for further analysis of the transcriptome and DNA methylation patterns. The elevated level of NEFAs decreased the blastocyst rate and delayed the blastocyst development. Ingenuity pathway analysis showed that the most affected gene pathways were related mainly to cell activities, metabolism, and inflammation. These findings indicated that oocytes exposed to the exogenous high level of NEFAs during in vitro maturation resulted in altered gene expression and DNA methylation of early embryos, which have detrimental impacts on blastocyst quality.

AB  - 1. Species exhibit a range of specialisation in diet and other niche axes, with specialists typically thought to be more efficient in resource use but more vulnerable to extinction than generalists. Among herbivorous insects, dietary specialists seem more likely to lack acceptable host plants during the insect's feeding stage, owing to fluctuations in host-plant abundance or phenology. Like other herbivores, bee species vary in host breadth from pollen specialisation (oligolecty) to generalisation (polylecty). 2. Several studies have shown greater interannual variation in flowering phenology for earlier-flowering plants than later-flowering plants, suggesting that early-season bees may experience substantial year-to-year variation in the floral taxa available to them. 3. It was therefore reasoned that, among bees, early phenology could be a more viable strategy for generalists, which can use resources from multiple floral taxa, than for specialists. Consequently, it was expected that the median dates of collection of adult specimens to be earlier for generalist species than for specialists. To test this, phenology data and pollen diet information on 67 North American species of the bee genus Osmia was obtained. 4. Controlling for latitude and phylogeny, it was found that dietary generalisation is associated with significantly earlier phenology, with generalists active, on average, 11-14 days earlier than specialists. 5. This result is consistent with the generalist strategy being more viable than the specialist strategy for species active in early spring, suggesting that dietary specialisation may constrain the evolution of bee phenology-or vice versa.

AB  - We used the questionnaire method to collect initial data on the presence, characteristics, and attacks on wildlife by free-roaming dogs from 364 employees in professional services for hunting and game man-agement in Serbia. The results showed that more than 80% of participants frequently saw free-roaming dogs in their hunting grounds. Most of the participants saw medium-sized dogs (63%) in groups of more than 5 animals (53%). Forty-three percent of respondents believed that free/roaming dogs belonged to the category of abandoned dogs. Participants noted that the population of free-roaming dogs has increased in the last 5 years in hunting grounds. The smallest share of participants (60%) who noticed an increase in the number of free-roaming dogs was from mountainous hunting grounds ( P < 0.5). More than 50% of participants believed that the number of deadly attacks by free-roaming dogs on wildlife has increased in the last 5 years. Roe deer were the most common victims of dog attacks. Lethal methods of controlling the populations of free-roaming dogs were not accepted by participants. Considering the almost identi-cal traditions of the Balkan peoples regarding the treatment of dogs, we consider this study especially important for the region.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Insect-plant interactions are less well studied than other types of herbivory on islands, precluding a comprehensive understanding of the evolutionary ecology of these interactions. Declines in native island plants and insects call for urgent attention to characterize these species' interactions for their conservation and to better understand evolution in these unique, insular ecosystems. In Hawai'i, the Kamehameha butterfly (Vanessa tameamea) is one of only two native butterflies, and larvae are specialists on native urticaceous plants. Using a no-choice bioassay, we investigated performance of V. tameamea reared from egg hatching through eclosion on four native urticaceous host plants, Boehmeria grandis, Pipturus albidus, Touchardia latifolia, and Touchardia oahuensis, and one exotic urticaceous species, Cecropia obtusifolia. Performance varied significantly among the plant diets, with V. tameamea performing best on P. albidus and T. oahuensis among the performance metrics of survival, pupal and adult body mass, and development time. Larval responses to the exotic host plant C. obtusifolia varied among populations, with O'ahu caterpillars successfully completing development on it, but Hawai'i Island caterpillars rejecting it completely, suggesting a geographic mosaic for this novel species interaction. Characterization of a suite of nutritive and defensive plant traits revealed significant variability among plant species, but patterns did not align well with V. tameamea performance rankings, making it difficult to identify key drivers of host plant quality. Future work examining additional plant traits under natural conditions would provide new insights, contributing critical ecological information to conserve this charismatic island species.
   The endemic Hawaiian Kamehameha butterfly is a specialist on Urticaceous host plants. Yet, caterpillar performance varies significantly among 4 native and 1 non-native host plant. Potential defense and nutritive traits also vary among host plant species, but are not consistent with performance rankings, highlighting this as future research need.image

AB  - Understanding somatic mutations and structural variations in domestic pigs (Sus scrofa domestica) is critical due to their increasing importance as model organisms in biomedical research. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis through whole-genome sequencing of skin, organs, and blood samples. By examining two pig pedigrees, we investigated the inheritance and sharedness of structural variants among fathers, mothers, and offsprings. Utilizing single-cell clonal expansion techniques, we observed significant variations in the number of somatic mutations across different tissues. An in-house developed pipeline enabled precise filtering and analysis of these mutations, resulting in the construction of individual phylogenetic trees for two pigs. These trees explored the developmental relationships between different tissues, revealing insights into clonal expansions from various anatomical locations. This study enhances the understanding of pig genomes, affirming their increasing value in clinical and genomic research, and provides a foundation for future studies in other animals, paralleling previous studies in mice and humans. This approach not only deepens our understanding of mammalian genomic variations but also strengthens the role of pigs as a crucial model in human health and disease research.

AB  - Psyllids feed exclusively on plant sap, which is an unbalanced diet for herbivores due to its low nitrogen content. Therefore, the plant-psyllid-natural enemy interactions can be strongly shaped by the bottom-up forces of N fertilization. Pear psylla Cacopsylla chinensis is a notorious pest in East Asian countries, inflicting devastating damage to pear trees and fruits. However, the bottom-up effects of nitrogen fertilizer on C. chinensis and the mechanisms remain unexplored. Here, we evaluated the performance of C. chinensis larvae over the N application range of 0-1500 mg/kg. The feeding activity and body weight of C. chinensis increased and the developmental duration of C. chinensis decreased significantly when N application increased. Our results indicated that nitrogen application enhanced psyllid fitness on host plant. By analyzing pear leaf metabolites, we found that only ferulic acid increased with the increase of nitrogen fertilizer concentration among phenolics assessed. Exogenously application of ferulic acid accelerated the development of psyllid nymphs. We also found that the concentration of both essential and non-essential amino acids increased significantly when N supply increased, which provided C. chinensis with increased nutrients for their development. The expression levels of several C. chinensis genes in the amino acids synthesis pathway decreased significantly after nitrogen application, indicating that C. chinensis can adjust its amino acid synthesis levels based on its diet. We demonstrated that the enhanced fitness of psyllids under nitrogen supply stems from altered host chemical traits and nutritional quality. The manipulation of nitrogen fertilization has a high potential for use in psyllid IPM programs by reducing psyllid performance.

AB  - Background Based on our previous research conducted on cinnamaldehyde (CA) exhibiting its ability to improve the growth performance of fattening pigs and the adipogenesis induction model of C2C12 cells constructed in our laboratory, we explored the effects of CA on the generation and development of lipid droplets (LDs) in adipogenic differentiated C2C12 cells. Methods and results C2C12 cells were treated with either 0.4 mM or 0.8 mM CA. BODIPY staining and triglyceride measurements were conducted to observe the morphology of LDs, and Western blotting was used to measure the expression of their metabolism-related proteins. The results showed that the average number of LDs in the CA treatment groups was more than the control group (P < 0.05), whereas the average LD size and triglyceride content decreased (P < 0.05). Compared with the control group, the expression levels of fusion-related genes in the LDs of the CA treatment group significantly decreased, while decomposition-related genes and autophagy-related genes in the LDs in C2C12 cells significantly increased (P < 0.01). Conclusion Cinnamaldehyde promoted the decomposition and autophagy of lipid droplets in C2C12 cells and inhibited the fusion of lipid droplets.

AB  - Ammonia is an acknowledged environment pollutant in atmosphere with irritating smell. Previous studies have shown that excessive ammonia has toxic effects on farm animals and humans. However, the detail toxicity mechanism of ammonia to pigs is still unknown so far. In order to clarify the mechanism of ammonia toxicity, we established a porcine exogenous ammonia poisoning model and assessed the effects of ammonia on the gut-brain axis by transcriptome sequencing, histological observation and chemical analysis. Our results showed that after 30 d of ammonia exposure, 578 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 407 DEGs were obtained in the hypothalamus and jejunum, respectively. These DEGs were enriched into Gene Ontology terms associated with inflammation, oxidative metabolism, apoptosis, and the highly expressed genes among these DEGs were verified by real-time quantitative PCR. The content of glutathione and the activities of glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase were significantly decreased, while malondialdehyde content was increased after ammonia exposure. Corticotropin releasing factor, substance P, 5-hydroxytryptamine and ghrelin contents in serum elevated significantly. Furthermore, pathologic observation in the ammonia group revealed infiltration of lymphocytes in the hypothalamus and significant decrease of jejunal epithelial cells. Our results indicated that ammonia exposure mediated changes in transcriptional profiles, pathological damage, oxidative stress and braingut peptide of the pig jejunum and hypothalamus, and induced the imbalance of the brain-gut axis through the "oxidative stress-inflammation-apoptosis" interaction network. Our study not only provides a new perspective for the toxicity assessment of ammonia, but also enriches the toxicology mechanism of ammonia.

AB  - Considering the long-lasting effects of ayahuasca on the brain and emotional processing, the objective of this study was to evaluate the behavioural and neurobiological effects of repeated ayahuasca administration in an animal model of exploratory behaviour related to novel-environment anxiety. Male Wistar rats received water, 120, 240, 480 or 3600 mg/kg of resuspended freeze-dried ayahuasca by gavage once a day for 30 days; there was also a non-manipulated homecage group. One hour after the last administration, animals were placed individ-ually in the open field for 20 min. We analysed the weight gain, the behavioural response through a stochastic analysis, and c-Fos immunoreactive levels in the hippocampus, amygdala, pre-frontal and barrel field cortex. Ayahuasca at 120 mg/kg increased ambulation, and at 3600 mg/kg decreased vertical exploration and reduced weight gain. Aya3600 had higher c-Fos expression in regions of the hippocampus and infralimbic cortex than homecage, water or aya120 groups. Water-receiving animals had less c-Fos expression in the anterior basolateral amygdala than others groups. Our results show different behavioural effects of ayahuasca: a stimulant-like effect in small doses, and decreased activity in extreme high-dose, probably due to adverse effects. Higher activation of areas involved in emotional processing and the serotonergic pathway adds to the neurobiological literature on repeated/chronic ingestion of ayahuasca. Our data do not support an anxiolytic effect of repeated ayahuasca related to exploring new anxiogenic-environment but suggest that low ayahuasca doses should be further studied. The absence of severe impairment and behavioural syntax alteration reinforce ayahuasca safety.

AB  - Simple Summary Utilizing computer vision technology to automate the measurement of pig carcass traits is of significant importance for genetic selection in breeding and enhancing the economic efficiency. However, currently, there is limited research, both domestically and internationally, on the measurement of pig carcass traits. This study proposes an automated system for measuring carcass traits using deep learning methods. The system aims to standardize and accelerate the acquisition of carcass traits from large groups of subjects. This approach seeks to uncover numerous micro-effect variant loci that have not yet been explored through large-sample GWAS analyses.Abstract Pig carcass traits are among the most economically significant characteristics and are crucial for genetic selection in breeding and enhancing the economic efficiency. Standardized and automated carcass phenotyping can greatly enhance the measurement efficiency and accuracy, thereby facilitating the selection and breeding of superior pig carcasses. In this study, we utilized phenotypic images and data from 3912 pigs to propose a deep learning-based approach for the automated determination of pig carcass phenotypic traits. Using the YOLOv8 algorithm, our carcass length determination model achieves an average accuracy of 99% on the test set. Additionally, our backfat segmentation model, YOLOV8n-seg, demonstrates robust segmentation performance, with a Mean IoU of 89.10. An analysis of the data distribution comparing manual and model-derived measurements revealed that differences in the carcass straight length are primarily concentrated between -2 cm and 4 cm, while differences in the carcass diagonal length are concentrated between -3 cm and 2 cm. To validate the method, we compared model measurements with manually obtained data, achieving coefficients of determination (R2) of 0.9164 for the carcass straight length, 0.9325 for the carcass diagonal length, and 0.7137 for the backfat thickness, indicating high reliability. Our findings provide valuable insights into automating carcass phenotype determination and grading in pig production.

AB  - The eukaryotic microbiome of "lower" termites is highly stable and host-specific. This is due to the mutually obligate nature of the symbiosis and the direct inheritance of protists by proctodeal trophallaxis. However, vertical transmission is occasionally imperfect, resulting in daughter colonies that lack one or more of the expected protist species. This phenomenon could conceivably lead to regional differences in protist community composition within a host species. Here, we have characterized the protist symbiont community of Heterotermes tenuis (Hagen) (Blattodea: Rhinotermitidae) from samples spanning South and Central America. Using light microscopy, single cell isolation, and amplicon sequencing, we report eight species-level protist phylotypes belonging to four genera in the phylum Parabasalia. The diversity and distribution of each phylotype's 18S rRNA amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) mostly did not correlate with geographical or host genetic distances according to Mantel tests, consistent with the lack of correlation we observed between host genetic and geographical distances. However, the ASV distances of Holomastigotoides Ht3 were significantly correlated with geography while those of Holomastigotoides Ht1 were significantly correlated with host phylogeny. These results suggest mechanisms by which termite-associated protist species may diversify independently of each other and of their hosts, shedding light on the coevolutionary dynamics of this important symbiosis.

AB  - There is little knowledge about the carcass potential of Turkish native goat breeds raised under different rearing conditions. It is necessary to compare the carcass characteristics of these breeds to minimize the effect of the rearing conditions. Therefore, this study aims to compare the growth, slaughter, and carcass characteristics of male kids at weaning age to eliminate the impact of rearing conditions. Kids born to Angora (n = 6), Hair (n = 6), Honamli (n = 6), and Kilis (n = 6) Turkish native goat breeds, ranging in age from 2-3 years, were slaughtered at 90 days of weaning age and carcass characteristics were determined immediately. There were differences (p < 0.05) among breeds in terms of birth weight (BW) and daily weight gain (DWG) from birth to weaning age. Honamli kids had higher BW and DWG than those of other breeds (p < 0.05). Similarly, carcass weights (hot-cold) and yields (hot-cold) of Honamli kids were higher compared to kids born to other breeds (p < 0.05). Additionally, Honamli and Hair kids had higher longissimus-dorsi (LD), and semitendinosus (ST) muscle weights compared to Kilis and Angora kids. Interestingly, Kilis kids had lower BW and DWG than those of other breeds (p < 0.05). There were significant differences (p < 0.05) among breeds in terms of non-carcass parts and organ weights. Positive correlations were calculated between cross-sectional area and weight (r = 0.793; p < 0.01), length and weight (r = 0.723; p < 0.01), and depth and weight (r = 0.698; p < 0.01) in LD muscle of all kids. A similar correlation trend was calculated for the ST muscle (cross-sectional area and weight; r = 0.699; p < 0.01, length and weight; r = 0.751; p < 0.01, and depth and weight; r = 0.528; p < 0.05) in all kids. In conclusion, the present study results showed that Honamli kids could be used for fattening material due to their good carcass quality compared to other native breeds.

AB  - Ammonia (NH3) emissions deriving from the management of livestock manure have a significant environmental impact, and therefore it is important to reduce them. Among the available options, the process of NH3 stripping is promising to remove NH3 from manures and digestates recovering it as a mineral fertilizer (e.g., ammonium sulfate) that is more widely adoptable on farms. The traditional stripping process takes place in batches; however, in this study, a continuous process was evaluated using a lab scale plant in which four reactors were used in series with different hydraulic retention times (HRTs) of 12 or 20 days. The NH3 recovery of each reactor was studied for the liquid fraction of pig slurry, dairy cattle slurry and digestate, applying simple headspace aeration. For 20 days of HRT, totals of 92%, 83% and 67% of NH3 were stripped from the digestate, pig slurry and dairy cattle slurry, respectively. For 12 days of HRT, total NH3 recoveries were 83%, 60% and 41% for the digestate, pig slurry and dairy cattle slurry, respectively. The inlet NH3 concentration and inlet total alkalinity had a positive and negative effect, respectively, on the specific NH3 removal rate for each reactor. Stripping NH3 on farm scale can abate NH3 emissions in response to the environmental concerns of European policies.

AB  - Pancreatic ribonuclease (RNase1), a digestive enzyme produced by the pancreas, is associated with the functional adaptation of dietary habits and is regarded as an attractive model system for studies of molecular evolution. In this study, we identified 218 functional genes and 48 pseudogenes from 114 species that span all four Cetartiodactyla lineages: two herbivorous lineages (Ruminantia and Tylopoda) and two non-herbivorous lineages (Cetancodonta and Suoidea). Multiple RNase1 genes were detected in all species of the two herbivorous lineages, and phylogenetic and genomic location analyses demonstrated that independent gene duplication events occurred in Ruminantia and Tylopoda. In Ruminantia, the gene duplication events occurred in the ancestral branches of the lineage in the Middle Eocene, a time of increasing climatic seasonality during which Ruminantia rapidly radiated. In contrast, only a single RNase1 gene was observed in the species of the two non-herbivorous lineages (Cetancodonta and Suoidea), suggesting that the previous Cetacea-specific loss hypothesis should be rejected. Moreover, the duplicated genes of RNase1 in the two herbivorous lineages (Ruminantia and Tylopoda) may have undergone functional divergence. In combination with the temporal coincidence between gene replication and the enhanced climatic seasonality during the Middle Eocene, this functional divergence suggests that RNase1 gene duplication was beneficial for Ruminantia to use the limited quantities of sparse fibrous vegetation and adapt to seasonal changes in climate. In summary, the findings indicate a complex and intriguing evolutionary pattern of RNase1 in Cetartiodactyla and demonstrate the molecular mechanisms by which organisms adapt to the environment.

AB  - The aim was to investigate the possible effects of different lunar phases at birth on the pre-pubertal changes in the body weights, blood parameters and hormonal profile of male goats. Based on the birth date, 33 male Nubian kids (3 months of age) were selected to represent the new (NL), full (FL) and old (OL) phases of the lunar cycle. The FL group exhibited the signs of puberty earlier than the NL and OL groups (P=0.011). At the age of puberty, bucks in the FL group had significantly higher ejaculate volume (P=0.010), sperm cell concentration (P=0.004), mass motility (P=0.016) and the percentage of live spermatozoa (P=0.008) as compared to the NL and OL groups. Additionally, male goats in the FL group showed significantly higher serum testosterone levels at week 25, 26, 27 and 28 of age compared with the NL and OL groups (P=0.002, 0.013, 0.038 and 0.004, respectively). In conclusion, the growing males in the FL group reached the puberty earlier than the NL and OL groups. Moreover, this study may help to maximize the semen quality and develop more effective AI strategies in the modern goat production systems.

AB  - As part of the European Green Deal, the EU has recognised that there is a need to increase organic farming as well as improve animal welfare standards. The PIGLOW app was developed with these goals in mind and allows free-range and organic pig farmers to perform welfare assessments (WAs) of their pigs. The results of each WA contain automated feedback and benchmarking information. The objective of this two-year longitudinal study was to determine whether regular use of the app helps farmers improve pig welfare. Farmers (n = 12) were asked to perform 6 WAs for finisher pigs with the app. At the beginning and end of the study, a researcher visited each farm and performed a detailed WA to determine the welfare status of the pigs at both moments. Farmers (n = 11) also filled out surveys about their opinions on pig welfare and the PIGLOW app. The welfare results did not support that the use of the PIGLOW app had an overall effect on pig welfare, but suggested a positive effect on some specific welfare aspects. Farmers indicated that they found the app easy to use and found most of its elements very useful. However, when asked about the specific influence of the app on their opinions on pig welfare and the welfare of their pigs, they indicated that the app only had small effects. Responses suggested that the app could likely be more useful to new farmers who still have more to learn about animal welfare.

AB  - An experimental study was conducted to test the effectiveness of olfactory repellents (ORE) as a mitigation measure to reduce ungulate-vehicle collisions (UVC). In the first phase, an extensive field survey was undertaken while employing the Before-After Control-Impact (BACI) study design. On the basis of ungulate mortality, 134 road sections were monitored on foot along both roadsides once a week. The monitoring lasted fourteen weeks per year in both 2021 (Before period) and 2022 (After period). In the after period, 2022, ORE were applied within the impact segments. The second phase consisted of data verification and statistical analysis. The data revealed a decrease in UVC of 68%. The confidence interval of this estimate suggested, however, a great deal of uncertainty about the true value. Therefore, the data were pooled, and the Bayesian inference was applied. On the level of moderate evidence, ORE decreased the number of UVC by at least 43% and at most 60%. We also observed that the ORE effect was more pronounced in the first seven weeks after installation than in the following seven weeks, suggesting ungulate habituation to ORE. We have therefore concluded that for a short period (ideally corresponding to UVC peaks) ORE could be considered an effective safety measure for secondary roads.

AB  - Simple Summary Precision feeding considers the difference in amino acid requirements among pigs and over time by providing daily tailored diets. This practice allows improving environmental and economic performances. Future systems should focus on maximizing nutrient use efficiency to move towards "green" pig production. This study explored a new method of providing amino acids to maximize their use, mainly focusing on understanding variations in the protein metabolism response among individuals to minimize variation in growth response. This study showed that even pigs fed the same amino acid level might use these nutrients differently, especially in protein deposition. Logically, pigs with the greatest protein deposition are the ones that use amino acids the most efficiently, thus exhibiting the lowest nitrogen excretion. This study helped identify some of the factors affecting the efficiency of nitrogen use in pigs. By improving the understanding of pigs' nutrient response, pig production can become more resource-efficient. This study aimed to measure protein deposition (PD) in pigs fed with daily tailored diets where either dietary lysine (Lys) or threonine (Thr) were provided at independent levels (ignoring an ideal ratio). A total of 95 growing pigs (35 kg body weight (BW)) with electronic ear tags granting them access to automatic feeders were randomly assigned to treatments. The setup was an unbalanced 2 x 5 factorial arrangement with Lys and Thr provided at five levels (i.e., 60%, 80%, 100%, 120%, and 140% of the estimated individual requirements of Lys and Thr), resulting in 25 treatments for 21 days. The observed PD variation to Lys and Thr provisions was large, with Lys and Thr intake explaining only 11% of the variation. Cluster analysis discriminated pigs with low (167 g/d, n = 16), medium (191 g/d, n = 38), and high (213 g/d, n = 37) PD, but with a similar amino acid intake. Differences in PD were associated with differences in nutrient efficiency of utilization. Providing Lys and Thr in a factorial mode, ignoring an ideal ratio, did not decrease the variability in PD. Future research efforts should focus on identifying and investigating the sources of interindividual variability-a necessary step before final recommendations can be made for AA in precision-fed pigs.

AB  - The use of aqueous film forming foams (AFFFs) as fire retardants is an critical point-source for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) pollution into the aquatic environment. This study investigated PFASs pollution in the surface waters and biota (shellfish and fish) of Galveston Bay, following AFFFs use to extinguish a petrochemical fire (March 17th to 20th, 2019) of oil storage tanks at the International Terminals Company (ITC) in Deer Park (Houston, TX). The levels of up to twelve EPA priority PFASs were measured in surface waters and biota from March-November 2019. PFASs levels in surface waters showed mean total levels in March and April 2019 to be from 4x to similar to 300x higher than those measured in the following months. PFOS (perfluorooctanesulfonic acid) was the most abundant homolog measured at >= 66% of total PFASs. Maximal PFOS levels exceeded the State of Texas' water regulatory limit of 0.6 mu g L-1 in 3% of the samples analyzed in March and April 2019. PFOS was also the most prominent homolog (>= 66% of total PFASs) measured in eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica), red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus), gafftopsail catfish (Bagremarinus), and spotted seatrout (Cynoscion nebulosus). A statistically significant elevation of PFOS body-burdens was measured in oysters and spotted seatrout in April and May 2019, respectively. A Hazard Ratio calculation for seafood safety suggests an advisory of 1-2 meals per week for gafftopsail catfish and red drum, and 2 meals perweek for spotted seatrout to be protective for human exposure to PFOS. The levels in oysters indicated no immediate concerns for the dietary exposure of humans. Our results highlight a need for continual monitoring to assess the long-term fate and seafood advisories for PFASs. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - With the increasing production of cow manure (CM) and the continuing decrease in the demand for manure compost, CM management has become an urgent and challenging task in Korea. In most cattle farms in Korea, CM mixed with bedding materials is left in pens exposed to the open air for several months before treatment, which makes CM an unsuitable feedstock for anaerobic digestion. This study examined the co-digestion of aged CM with a mixture of food waste and pig manure as the base substrate to assess the possibility of treating and valorizing CM using spare capacity in existing anaerobic digesters dealing with other wastes. The duplicate digesters initially fed with the base substrate were subjected to the addition of increasing amounts of CM (3-10% in the feed, w/v) over nine months. Co-feeding CM up to 5% in the feed (w/v) did not compromise the methanogenic degradation of the substrates, but adding more CM led to a significant performance deterioration likely related to the buildup of inhibitory free ammonia and H2S. Adding CM substantially influenced the digester microbial communities, especially methanogenic communities, and induced a dominance shift from aceticlastic Methanothrix to hydrogenotrophic methanogens as the CM fraction increased. The overall results suggest that the CM fraction should not exceed 5% in the feed (w/v) for its stable treatment with the base substrate in the experimental digesters. Although further studies are needed, anaerobic treatment using spare capacity in existing digesters can be a useful strategy for the management of aged CM.

AB  - Organic inputs as a substitution for, or addition to, chemical fertilizers can potentially mitigate N losses. However, it is not well known how their effects on N leaching and runoff depend on application approaches. We conducted a global meta-analysis of 129 studies to compare the effects of organic inputs on N export via leaching and runoff. We compared three application approaches: chemical fertilizer N substituted by organic fertilizer with: 1) equal amounts of total N or, 2) equal amounts of mineral N and 3) additional organic fertilizer N on top of chemical fertilizer. The meta-analysis showed that organic inputs reduced overall N leaching and runoff by 15% and 29%, respectively, without compromising crop yield, and that this effect was significantly influenced by the application approach taken. Organic substitution of chemical fertilizer N with equal amounts of total N decreased both leaching and runoff by more than 30% and hardly affected crop yield. Substitution with equal amounts of mineral N generally increased crop yield by 6% but also increased N leaching by 21%. Organic inputs in addition to chemical fertilizer N did not affect leaching and runoff. The differences between application approaches were reinforced with increased treatment duration. The loss ratios of leaching and runoff were 14% and 4.5%, respectively, from chemical fertilizer, and 9.2% and 2.6%, respectively, from organic fertilizer. The optimal substitution rates differed between leaching (40-60%) and runoff (60-100%) when substitution was based on equal amounts of total N. We conclude that substitution of chemical for organic fertilizer at equal amounts of total N is most effective in reducing N export via leaching and runoff without compromising crop production.

AB  - Till now, the lack of research regard to root exudates is still serious in the restoration process of desertification alpine meadow in the eastern Tibetan plateau, although recovery of desertification land resulted from overgrazing and climate change is known to be shaped by the rhizosphere. Therefore, we measured root carbon (C) exudate rates of Kengyilia rigidula (Keng) S. L. Chen., Rhodiola kirilowii (Regel) Maxim., Elymus nutans Griseb., Hippophae rhamnoides L. and Salix cupularis Rehd. by sampling root exudates in situ in a desertification alpine meadow, as well as determined the volatile components using GC-MS. The results showed that 1) Root C exudate rates were as follows: R. kirilowii > K. rigidula > E. nutans > S. cupularis > H. rhamnoides, and R. kirilowii was significantly higher than H. rhamnoides (p < 0.05). 2) Common volatile substances of the five plants mainly contained hydrocarbons (above 13.16%), esters (above 11.83%) and phenols (above 6.27%), and the relative amounts of hydrocarbons and phenols were the highest in R. kirilowii respectively, while esters were the highest in S. cupularis among the five plant species. Thereinto, 2-hydroxy-1-(hydroxymethyl) ethyl ester was the highest content in R. kirilowii while 2,4-di-tert-butyl phenol was the highest content in S. cupularis. 3) As the specific allelochemical components of herbs and shrubs, heptadecane was the highest content in R. kirilowii among the three herb species while pentacosane was relatively high content in S. cupularis between the two shrubs, and the relative amount of palmitic acid in R. kirilowii was about twice that in H. rhamnoides and S. cupularis, accounting for 1.64%. Collectively, our results suggest that S. cupularis and R. kirilowii should be regarded as the better choice of pioneer plant species to be applied to ecological restoration of desertification alpine meadow.

AB  - BackgroundDespite decades of epidemiological theory making relatively simple assumptions about host movements, it is increasingly clear that non-random movements drastically affect disease transmission. To better predict transmission risk, theory is needed that quantifies the contributions of both fine-scale host space use and non-independent, correlated host movements to epidemiological dynamics.MethodsWe developed and applied new theory that quantifies relative contributions of fine-scale space use and non-independent host movements to spatio-temporal transmission risk. Our theory decomposes pairwise spatio-temporal transmission risk into two components: (i) spatial overlap of hosts-a classic metric of spatial transmission risk - and (ii) pairwise correlations in space use - a component of transmission risk that is almost universally ignored. Using analytical results, simulations, and empirical movement data, we ask: under what ecological and epidemiological conditions do non-independent movements substantially alter spatio-temporal transmission risk compared to spatial overlap?ResultsUsing theory and simulation, we found that for directly transmitted pathogens even weak pairwise correlations in space use among hosts can increase contact and transmission risk by orders of magnitude compared to independent host movements. In contrast, non-independent movements had reduced importance for transmission risk for indirectly transmitted pathogens. Furthermore, we found that if the scale of pathogen transmission is smaller than the scale where host social decisions occur, host movements can be highly correlated but this correlation matters little for transmission. We applied our theory to GPS movement data from white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). Our approach predicted highly seasonally varying contributions of the spatial and social drivers of transmission risk - with social interactions augmenting transmission risk between hosts by greater than a factor of 10 in some cases, despite similar degrees of spatial overlap. Moreover, social interactions could lead to a distinct shift in the predicted locations of transmission hotspots, compared to joint space use.ConclusionsOur theory provides clear expectations for when non-independent movements alter spatio-temporal transmission risk, showing that correlated movements can reshape epidemiological landscapes, creating transmission hotspots whose magnitude and location are not necessarily predictable from spatial overlap.

AB  - In recent decades, the groundwater contaminated by mineral development and metal smelting has seriously polluted natural grasslands, resulting in heavy metal residues in soils and forages exceeding the standard, especially copper (Cu) and cadmium (Cd). After animals intake contaminated forages, heavy metals may accumulate in animal tissues and threaten human health through the food chain. Previous studies found that molybdenum (Mo) fertilizer from ammonium molybdate or potassium molybdate could alleviate the decrease of antioxidant capacity caused by heavy metal poisoning, but the application of nano-Mo fertilizer in sheep is still lacking. To investigate the effects of nano-Mo fertilizer on Cu metabolism of grazing Chinese Merino sheep (Junken Type) on natural pastures under Cu and Cd stress, fertilizing experiment was carried out in the Bayanbulak Grassland in the northwest of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China. A total of 24 hm(2) fenced grassland contaminated by heavy metals was randomly divided into four groups (3 replications/group and 2 hm(2)/replication). The experimental groups were applied 0 g Mo, 100 g Mo, 200 g Mo, and 300 g Mo per hectare for the control group, group I, group II, and group III, respectively, through foliar spraying fertilization. A total of 72 Chinese Merino sheep (1 year old, 43.8 +/- 2.3 kg) grazing on polluted natural grasslands, with 18 sheep per group, were randomly assigned to the experimental pastures for 30 days. The results showed that the Mo content in soil in group II and group III nwas higher than that in the control group (P < 0.05); the Cd content in soil in group II and group III was lower than that in the control group (P < 0.05), and the Cu content in soil in fertilized pastures was lower than that in the control group (P < 0.05). The Mo content in herbage in fertilized pastures was higher than that in the control group (P < 0.05), and the content of Cu in herbage in fertilized pastures was lower than that in the control group (P < 0.05). The contents of iron (Fe) and Mo in blood and liver of grazing animals from fertilized pastures were higher than that in the control group (P < 0.05). The Cd content in blood of grazing animals in group II and group III was lower than that in the control group (P < 0.05). The Cu content in blood and liver of grazing animals in fertilized pastures was lower than that in the control group (P < 0.05). The content of selenium (Se) in blood of grazing animals in group II and group III was higher than that in the control group (P < 0.05). The levels of blood including hemoglobin (Hb), erythrocyte count (RBC), and packed cell volume (PCV) in group II and group III were higher than that in the control group (P < 0.05). The white blood cell (RBC) count in group II and group III was lower than that in the control group (P < 0.05). The activities of serum superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), catalase (CAT), and ceruloplasmin (Cp) in group II and group III were higher than that in the control group (P < 0.05). The content of malondialdehyde (MDA) in group II and group III was lower than that in the control group (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the application of nano-Mo fertilizer on Cu- and Cd-contaminated grasslands changed the contents of mineral elements in soil, forage, and blood of grazing sheep, improved the antioxidant capacity, affected the Cu metabolism of grazing Chinese Merino sheep caused by Cu and Cd pollutions, and alleviated the toxic damage of heavy metal pollutions.

AB  - Pre-anesthetic treatment directly affects dose of induction agents that may result in least complication due to low anesthesia intake. The study was designed to investigate the effects of detomidine and midazolam on induction dose and quality of propofol and ketamine anesthesia in goats. Twelve female goats were randomly divided into six groups comprising two animals each. Control group (A) received (Normal saline+ propofol @4.20 +/- 0.10 mg/kg). While, group B received (detomidinegl 15 mu g/kg+ propofol), C received (detomidine@ 15 mu g/kg+ ketamine), D received (midazolam@0.25mg/kg+ propofol), E received (midazolam @ 0.25mg/kg+ ketamine) and group F received combination of all (detomidine @7 mu g/kg+ midazolam @ 0.12mg/kg+ propofol+ ketamine) The degree of sedation and analgesia, induction dose, % age reduction in induction dose, anesthesia quality and clinico-physiological parameters were evaluated. Detomidine-midazolam when administered combined, followed by induction with combination of propofol-ketamine caused deep sedation and analgesia, maximum % age reduction in induction dose and increased duration of anesthesia that differed significantly (p <= 0.05) from control and other treatment groups. Detomidine and midazolam when administered alone, followed by induction with propofol and ketamine caused mild sedation and analgesia, marked % age reduction in induction dose and increased duration of anesthesia that differed non significantly (p>0.05) from each other. The significant (p <= 0.05) changes in heart rate & respiratory rate and non-significant (p>0.05) changes in rectal temperature were noticed in all groups. It is concluded that the combination of detomidine-midazolam-propofol-ketamine was found to be safe and economical for short surgical procedures in goat.

AB  - Wetlands are amongst the world's most effective natural carbon sinks, and also have the potential to emit large quantities of stored carbon back into the atmosphere if disturbed. In the Murray-Darling Basin, high consumptive demand for water has led to widespread wetland loss and degradation. Remaining wetlands are commonly under additional pressure from grazing and trampling by feral herbivores or livestock and unseasonal flooding in summer to meet peak irrigation demand. Here, during a summer flood in Barmah National Park, we compared soil carbon and nitrogen and carbon emissions within, and outside of, a feral herbivore exclusion plot. The sustained global warming potential from the whole wetland (i.e., both within- and outside of the exclusion plot), totalled from both carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and methane (CH 4 ) emissions, averaged 132.27 +/- 9.88 g CO 2 -e m -2 d -1 , an estimated 28- to 89-fold higher than the global average for natural wetlands. The high warming potential of the wetland was driven strongly by CH 4 emissions, which made up over 90% of total CO 2 -equivalents, with CO 2 contributing < 10%. We expect these values represent peak CH 4 emissions from the site due to high water and soil temperatures, and low water levels, at the time of sampling. Soil carbon and nitrogen did not differ significantly within and outside of the exclusion plot, but surface soil samples indicated recent condition improvement in the absence of feral herbivores. We suggest that an emissions avoidance incentive could be developed around unseasonal, summer watering of forested floodplains where flood timing can be controlled.

AB  - A co-culture assay with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs) was used to study whether selected angiogenesis inhibitors were able to inhibit differentiation and network formation of HUVECs in vitro. The effect of the inhibitors was determined by the morphology and the calculated percentage area covered by HUVECs. Neutralizing VEGF with avastin and polyclonal goat anti-VEGF antibody and inhibiting VEGFR2 with sorafenib and vatalanib resulted in the formation of HUVEC clusters of variable sizes as a result of inhibited EC differentiation. Furthermore, numerous inhibitors of the VEGF signaling pathways were tested for their effect on the growth and differentiation of HUVECs. The effects of these inhibitors did not reveal a cluster morphology, either individually or when combined to block VEGFR2 downstream pathways. Only the addition of N-methyl-p-bromolevamisole revealed a similar morphology as when targeting VEGF and VEGFR2, meaning it may have an inhibitory influence directly on VEGFR signaling. Additionally, several nuclear receptor ligands and miscellaneous compounds that might affect EC growth and differentiation were tested, but only dexamethasone gave rise to cluster formation similarly to VEGF-neutralizing compounds. These results point to a link between angiogenesis, HUVEC differentiation and glucocorticoid receptor activation.

AB  - A recent paper by Bownes et al. (2017, Radiocarbon 59(5): 1275-1294) used the Bayesian modelling software package FRUITS (Fernandes et al. 2014, PLoS ONE 9(2): e87436) to argue that Neolithic individuals from Carding Mill Bay on the west coast of Scotland obtained up to ca. 21% dietary protein from marine sources. This is in contrast to previous interpretations of the same isotopic (613C and 615N) data, which concluded that these individuals showed little if any use of marine resources (Schulting and Richards 2002, European Journal of Archaeology 5(2): 147-189). Resolving this discrepancy is important for our understanding of the nature of the Mesolithic-Neolithic transition not only on the west coast of Scotland, but along all of Atlantic Europe, since similar isotopic results to those obtained at Carding Mill Bay are widespread throughout the Neolithic and indeed later periods. We suggest that greater caution needs to be excercised in the interpretation of the output of Bayesian palaeodietary modelling, which can be very useful heuristically, but should not always be taken at face value. Given the large number of parameters employed in such models (diet isotopic values and nutrient concentrations, trophic level and tissue fractionations, etc.) and the uncertainty involved in almost all of them, a wide range of outcomes are possible, as we demonstrate in this paper. We reaffirm the overwhelmingly terrestrial nature of diet at Carding Mill Bay both through FRUITS modelling and through the new application of compound-specific 613C analysis of single amino acids of humans and fauna from the site.

AB  - The plant-pest interaction and its mechanisms are a novel research direction for pest control. They provide molecular targets for developing new pesticides and targeted control measures to control insect herbivores. Glucosinolate is a large family of secondary substances found in cruciferous plants that are harmful to herbivorous insects. Specialist herbivores have developed specific anti-defense genes and detoxifying mechanisms against glucosinolate from the host plant, but how generalist herbivores respond to glucosinolate at the molecular level is unknown. In this study, we investigated the effects of different glucosinolate concentrations on the growth and development of Helicoverpa armigera. Moreover, the expression of sulfatase genes (HaSulfs) was also checked following exposure to glucosinolate concentrations. The developmental duration of larvae and pre-pupa of H. armigera was significantly increased by 14.79-25.03% after feeding glucosinolate compared to the control. Quantitative Real-Time PCR (RT-qPCR) was carried out to analyze the expression of HaSulf family genes in the midgut of fifth instar larvae of H. armigera. The results showed that the upregulated expression patterns of HaSulf family genes were diversified after feeding at different concentrations. The expression level of HaSulf was detected with the HaSulf antibody. Only the glucosinolate-fed larvae had a visible target band and were mainly distributed in the midgut wall. Taken together, glucosinolate can significantly affect the growth and development of H. armigera larvae. It can induce the expression of HaSulf in the midgut of H. armigera at gene and protein levels. This study could be useful to understand the development of plant-derived insecticides resistance in H. armigera.

AB  - Diceraeus melacanthus Dallas, (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) is a polyphagous stink bug that has been reported to be an important pest in maize and soybean. Control of this herbivore in crops is achieved using insecticides. Use of companion plants to control and manage herbivores in crop areas has been proposed, but there are still few systems that have been deployed to growers. Trap crops work by attracting herbivores, removing them from target plants, or/and attracting their natural enemies. Observations in our laboratory revealed that female D. melacanthus oviposit in Cajanus cajan L. Millsp (Fabaceae) pods. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate whether C. cajan plants have potential for use as trap crops for D. melacanthus. In the current study, we evaluated the oviposition behaviour of D. melacanthus and its preference for different substrates, such as cotton bolls, C. cajan, Glycine max L. Merril (Fabaceae) and Phaseolus vulgaris L. (Fabaceae) pods; their behavioural response to constitutive volatiles emitted by C. cajan plants at different phenological stages; and the effect of non-volatile compounds of C. cajan pod on oviposition preference. The results revealed that D. melacanthus females prefer to oviposit on C. cajan pods, cotton bolls rubbed on C. cajan pods or cotton bolls treated with quercetin over cotton bolls and P. vulgaris pods. D. melacanthus females recognize and are attracted by volatiles of reproductive C. cajan plants. In addition to the preference for ovipositing, the offspring of D. melacanthus does not survive on C. cajan pods. Our results suggest that C. cajan plants have the potential to be evaluated as a trap crop for D. melacanthus.

AB  - Previous studies have revealed cellular heterogeneity in intervertebral discs (IVDs). However, the cellular and molecular alteration patterns of cell populations during degenerative progression remain to be fully elucidated. To illustrate the cellular and molecular alteration of cell populations in intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD), we perform single cell RNA sequencing on cells from four anatomic sites of healthy and degenerative goat IVDs. EGLN3(+) StressCs, TGFBR3(+) HomCs and GPRC5A(+) RegCs exhibit the characteristics associated with resistance to stress, maintaining homeostasis and repairing, respectively. The frequencies and signatures of these cell clusters fluctuate with IDD. Notably, the chondrogenic differentiation programme of PROCR+ progenitor cells is altered by IDD, while notochord cells turn to stemness exhaustion. In addition, we characterise CAV1(+) endothelial cells that communicate with chondrocytes through multiple signalling pathways in degenerative IVDs. Our comprehensive analysis identifies the variability of key cell clusters and critical regulatory networks responding to IDD, which will facilitate in-depth investigation of therapeutic strategies for IDD.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of dietary addition of lactic acid and glutamine, and their interactions, on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, digestive enzyme activity, intestinal barrier functions, microflora, and expressions of intestinal development-related genes of weaning piglets. Ninety-six 24-day-old weaning piglets (Duroc x Landrace x Yorkshire, weaned at 21 +/- 1 d and fed the basal diet for a 3 d adaptation period) with initial body weight of 7.24 +/- 0.09 kg were randomly assigned to one of four dietary treatments with six replicates per treatment and four pigs per replicate in a 2 x 2 factorial treatment arrangements: (1) CON (a 2-period basal diet; control), (2) LS (supplemented with 2% lactic acid), (3) GS (supplemented with 1% glutamine), and (4) LGS (supplemented with 2% lactic acid and 1% glutamine). The study lasted for 28 d. On days 25-28, fresh fecal samples were collected to evaluate apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of nutrients. After 28 d, one weaning pig per pen was euthanized, and physiological samples obtained. Results showed that the supplementation of lactic acid improved the ADFI of the pigs (p < 0.05), while the pigs fed the glutamine diet had a greater ADFI and higher G/F (p < 0.05), and there were significant interactive effects between lactic acid and glutamine on the ADFI and G/F of the pigs (p < 0.05). The ATTD of CP and ash for pigs fed with lactic acid was significantly enhanced, and pigs fed the glutamine diet had greater ATTD of CP and ash (p < 0.05), while there were significant interactive effects between lactic acid and glutamine on the ATTD of CP and ash of the pigs (p < 0.05). Pigs fed with lactic acid exhibited greater activity of alpha-amylase and lipase (p < 0.05); moreover, the activity of lipase in the pigs showed a significant interactive effect between lactic acid and glutamine (p < 0.05). There was a greater villus height and villus height to crypt depth ratio in pigs fed with lactic acid (p < 0.05), and the villus height to crypt depth ratio of pigs fed with glutamine was greater (p < 0.05). There were greater GLUT2, IGF-1, TGF-beta 2, OCLN, and ZO-1 mRNA levels in pigs fed with lactic acid (p < 0.05), and the supplementation of glutamine increased SGLT1, GLUT2, PepT1, IGF-1, IGF-1R, TGF beta-2, GLP-2, and OCLN mRNA levels (p < 0.05), Additionally, expressions of SGLT1, GLUT2, PepT1, IGF-1, IGF-1R, TGF beta-2, GLP-2, CLDN-2, OCLN, and ZO-1 mRNA levels of pigs showed a positive interactive effect between lactic acid and glutamine (p < 0.05). Supplementation of lactic acid significantly increased the populations of Bifidobacterium in cecal digesta, Lactobacillus in colonic digesta, and the content of butyric acid in colonic digesta (p < 0.05). In addition, there were significant interactive effects between lactic acid and glutamine on populations of Bifidobacterium in cecal digesta, Lactobacillus in colonic digesta, and the content of acetic acid, butyric acid, and total VFAs in cecal digesta of the pigs (p < 0.05). Collectively, the current results indicate that dietary supplementation with lactic acid and glutamine had a positive synergistic effect on weaning pigs, which could improve growth performance through promoting the development of the small intestine, increasing digestive and barrier function, and regulating the balance of microflora in pigs, and which might be a potential feeding additive ensemble to enhance the health and growth of weaning piglets in the post-antibiotic era.

AB  - Co-pyrolysis is a potentially effective method for both biomass waste management and multi-functional biocharbased product design. It involves the thermochemical decomposition of biomass waste under anoxic conditions, which can reduce the cost of disposal and produce biochar with beneficial properties. Herein, this study aimed to investigate the properties and environmental applications of biochar from single-and mixed-feedstocks of wheat straw, rice husk, pig manure, and oyster shell at 450 celcius, respectively. A pot experiment with Chinese cabbage was carried out to compare the effects of biochars with limestone on soil Cd and Pb immobilization at two harvest periods. The results indicated that co-pyrolysis of various biomasses exhibited synthetic effects on promoting the calorific value of syngas and enhancing the quality of produced biochar. The pot experiment revealed a significant promotion on soil pH, soil organic matter, cation exchange capacity, and soluble Ca, which consequently reduced Cd and Pb availability. In contrast with limestone treatment, soil amendment with single biomass-derived and co-pyrolysis-derived (COPB) biochars had a significant positive impact on soil fertility and microbial biomass. Application of COPB at a 0.5% dosage consistently and most effectively enhanced the shoot biomass, increased leaf Vitamin C content but reduced leaf content of nitrate and heavy metals in both harvests. Using COPB for soil remediation would be financially visible due to the enhancement of crop yield. Therefore, this study proposes a strategy for targeted enhancement of the functions of biochar derived from co-pyrolysis of selected biomass waste for soil remediation and agricultural production.

AB  - 1. The light climate at high latitudes, in particular the extended twilight of winter and the reduced diel variation in light level in midsummer and midwinter, potentially constrains visual function and the synchronisation of temporal organisation in polar species. 2. In this paper, we describe the temporal pattern and variation in the spectral composition and brightness of skylight (daylight, twilight, moonlight, starlight, airglow and aurorae) at high latitudes and review photoreception of reindeer/caribou (Rangifer tarandus; 'Rangifer') which is one of the few polar resident species for which data are available. 3. Experimental data indicate that the rods of Rangifer may be stimulated by levels of ambient light lower than those occurring during astronomical twilight (solar angle <-18 degrees). 4. Several features of the eyes of Rangifer contribute to their visual capability under extended twilight. These include transmission of UV through the optical media, which enables the animals to exploit the shorter wavelengths characteristic of twilight, and a shift in the peak spectral reflectance of the tapetum lucidum (TL) from around 640 nm in summer to around 450 nm in winter, which increases retinal illumination at short wavelengths. 5. Enhanced sensitivity to short wavelengths is likely to enhance the contrast of some objects and hence the ability of Rangifer to discriminate forage plants and to detect other animals (conspecifics or predators) against a snowy background under low illuminance. 6. There is, nevertheless, currently no evidence of any specific boreal adaptation in their visual system: (i) The eyes of Rangifer, and by inference the area of the dilated pupil, are no larger than expected based on the allometry of eye size in ruminants. (ii) There is no evidence of a change in the spectral sensitivity of photoreceptors associated with detection of UVa. (iii) Transmission of UV through the anterior eye is not unique to Rangifer. (iv) The blue shift in the reflectance of the winter TL appears to be a passive response to prolonged dilation of the pupil and there is no a priori reason not to predict the same response in other large ungulates exposed to low light levels. (v) There is no conclusive evidence of a seasonal shift in absolute retinal sensitivity in Rangifer. (vi) Weak circadian organisation in Rangifer has tentatively been linked to mutations within the circadian molecular clockwork but it remains unclear to what extent this represents a specific adaptation to high latitude.

AB  - BackgroundAlcohol use disorder (AUD) is a major problem of our society and is often characterized and worsened by relapse. Prolonged alcohol exposure leads to numerous biochemical alterations that, upon cessation of alcohol intake, cause an array of immediate and lasting withdrawal symptoms. Acute withdrawal and neuroinflammation can be harmful in themselves, and lasting withdrawal symptoms contribute to relapse. Here, we conducted an initial feasibility study assessing several behavioral and neurochemical factors in female C3H/HeNRj (C3H) and C57BL/6JRj (B6) mice to determine which strain showed the clearest alcohol withdrawal symptoms during long-term abstinence and neurochemical alterations following re-exposure. MethodsFemale C3H and B6 mice (n = 12 per group/strain) were intermittently exposed to alcohol-containing or control liquid diets for 3 weeks. Acute and prolonged withdrawal symptoms were assessed over a period of 3 weeks using a battery of behavioral test, comprised of alcohol self-administration, anhedonia, hyperalgesia, anxiety-like and depressive-like disturbances. Brain inflammation was measured by multiplex cytokine assay. Monoamine levels in the hippocampus and striatum, as well as exploratory analyses of cations levels in the cerebellum, were assessed by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). ResultsBoth C3H and B6 alcohol-exposed mice displayed decreased saccharin intake or preference and higher stress levels assessed by ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) recordings. B6 but not C3H alcohol-exposed mice also exhibited a slower decline of alcohol oral self-administration (OSA), hyperalgesia, elevated brain TNF-alpha and elevated serotonin turnover. ConclusionOur findings highlight the suitability of the B6 strain to study the behavioral and neurochemical alterations caused by alcohol withdrawal and the potential efficacy of experimental treatments, not only in early detoxification, but also in prolonged abstinence. The feasibility of these assays is important because long-lasting withdrawal symptoms are often the main cause of relapse in alcohol-dependent patients.

AB  - This study aims to evaluate the effects of ageing time (0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 weeks) and of two different ageing techniques (dry and wet ageing) on the rheological, colorimetric, oxidative, volatile, and sensory attributes of meat (hind limbs) sourced from culled Rossa Mediterranea breed goats. Twenty-four goats were involved in the trial. The hind limbs were divided in the two experimental groups: the right ones were subjected to dry ageing and the left ones to wet ageing. Dry-aged (DA) meat showed higher water-holding capacity (WHC) and lower cooking loss (CL) after ageing compared to wet aged (WA) meat (p < 0.05). Among the colorimetric parameters, only lightness showed to be affected by ageing time, decreasing at week 4 (p < 0.05), with lower values in DA then WA (p < 0.05). Warner Bratzler shear force (WBSF) decreased at week 1 of DA and at week 2 of WA (p < 0.05), with no further changes probably due to the water loss during ageing. Hexanal was the most produced volatile compound, with higher amount in DA meat from 1 to 3 weeks of ageing (p < 0.01) The first two weeks of dry ageing led to an enhancement in sensory and instrumental tenderness, along with an improvement in flavour, characterised by a heightened release of aldehydes and ketones. However, it is noteworthy that beyond this initial phase, dry ageing has led to a substantial decline in the overall quality.

AB  - The amyloid plaque niche is a pivotal hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we employ two high -resolution spatial transcriptomics (ST) platforms, CosMx and Spatial Enhanced Resolution Omics-sequencing (Stereo-seq), to characterize the transcriptomic alterations, cellular compositions, and signaling perturbations in the amyloid plaque niche in an AD mouse model. We discover heterogeneity in the cellular composition of plaque niches, marked by an increase in microglial accumulation. We profile the transcriptomic alterations of glial cells in the vicinity of plaques and conclude that the microglial response to plaques is consistent across different brain regions, while the astrocytic response is more heterogeneous. Meanwhile, as the microglial density of plaque niches increases, astrocytes acquire a more neurotoxic phenotype and play a key role in inducing GABAergic signaling and decreasing glutamatergic signaling in hippocampal neurons. We thus show that the accumulation of microglia around hippocampal plaques disrupts astrocytic signaling, in turn inducing an imbalance in neuronal synaptic signaling.

AB  - Silicon (Si) uptake is generally beneficial for plants that need protection from insect herbivores. In pursue of mechanisms involved in Si-mediated defense, we comprehensively explored the impact of Si on several defensive and metabolic traits in rice exposed to simulated and real herbivory of Mythimna loreyi Duponchel larvae. Hydroponic experiments showed that Si-deprived rice supplemented with Si 72 h prior to insect infestation were similarly resistant to larvae as plants continuously grown in Si-containing media. Both Si and herbivory altered primary metabolism in rice, including the levels of several sugars, amino acids, and organic acids. While the accumulation of sugars was generally positively correlated with Si presence, multiple amino acids showed a negative correlation trend with Si supplementation. The levels of secondary metabolites, including isopentylamine, p-coumaroylputrescine and feruloylputrescine, were typically higher in the leaves of Si-supplemented plants exposed to herbivory stress compared to Si-deprived plants. In addition, simulated herbivory treatment in Si-supplemented plants induced more volatile emissions relative to Si-deprived plants, which was consistent with the increased transcripts of key genes involved in volatile biosynthesis. In ecological interactions, Si alone did not affect the oviposition choice of M. loreyi but gravid females showed a significant preference for simulated herbivory-treated/Si-deprived compared to Si-supplemented plants. Our data suggest that apart from mechanical defense, Si may affect rice metabolism in multiple ways that might enhance/modulate defense responses of rice under herbivory stress.

AB  - In this study, the content changes of multiple trace heavy metals (HMs) in food waste using a new rapid hightemperature aerobic fermentation (RTAF) technology and their relationships with different physicochemical factors were researched. The results indicated that the content of HMs in the decomposed products met the industry standards for organic fertilizers (NY/T525-2021, China). Physicochemical factors played an important role in controlling the changes in HM content. The component evolution of dissolved organic matter was studied, and its influences on the transformation of HM speciation showed that the RTAF process converted proteins into humus-like substances. Redundancy analysis revealed that the main factors driving the speciation transformation of HMs were tyrosine-like substances or microbial-derived humus (C3), molecular weight of dissolved organic matter (SUVA254) and humification degree (E250/E365). The increase in humification degree contributed to passivating HMs. The correlation network analysis results showed that the exchangeable HMs (Exc-HMs) were related to Lactobacillus and Pediococcu. Additionally, the cytoskeleton, coenzyme transport and metabolic function of microorganisms affected the Exc-HM content. These research results can provide a scientific basis for the prevention and control of HM pollution during the treatment of food waste.

AB  - Simple Summary The condition of oxidative stress is initiated by an imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants; subsequent interactions within the organism amplify this condition, leading to harmful effects on cell components. Anthocyanins, recognized for their antioxidant properties, play a significant role in producing various compounds, including polyphenols. The increased replacement of purple Napier grass silage has led to significant differences in lactose levels, the somatic cell count, glutathione S-transferase, the total antioxidant capacity, superoxide dismutase, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical, and the composition of anthocyanins. Consuming feed enriched with these bioactive compounds naturally and effectively maintains a healthy antioxidant balance. Additionally, this approach not only improves animal performance, but also ensures the safety of certain animal products which are intended for human consumption.Abstract Oxidative stress resulting from an imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants can cause damage to certain cellular components. Purple Napier grass, a semi-dwarf variety, is characterized by its purple leaves and contains anthocyanins, which provide it with antioxidant properties. This study examined the effects of feeding purple Napier grass ("Prince") silage to lactating dairy goats on blood antioxidant activity, milk yield, and milk quality. Eighteen female Saanen crossbred goats, weighing 52.34 +/- 2.86 kg and producing milk for 14 +/- 2 days, were systematically divided into three groups based on their lactation period in the previous cycle as follows: early, mid, and late lactation. In a randomized complete block design (RCBD), treatments were randomly allocated to six animals in each block. The dairy goats were fed a total mixed ration (TMR) consisting of the three following treatments: control (100% Napier Pakchong 1 grass silage), 50% (a 50% replacement of the control with purple Napier grass silage), and 100% (100% purple Napier grass silage). The results show that goats who were fed a diet including 100% purple Napier grass silage showed higher levels of certain milk contents, especially with regard to lactose, when compared to those who were fed a control diet, as well as a diet with a 50% replacement of purple Napier grass silage. The somatic cell count (SCC) of these goats was reduced. In terms of antioxidant activity, dairy goats who were fed 100% purple Napier grass silage showed higher levels of enzymes in both plasma and milk, including glutathione s-transferase, total antioxidant capacity, superoxide dismutase, and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical, compared to the control group and the 50% replacement group. The plasma and milk of these goats showed lower levels of malondialdehyde. The dairy goats who were fed a 100% purple Napier grass silage diet showed higher concentrations of anthocyanins, including C3G, P3G, Peo3G, M3G, Cya, Pel, and total anthocyanins in milk, when compared to the control group and the 50% replacement group. The increased replacement of purple Napier grass silage led to significant differences in lactose levels, somatic cell count, glutathione S-transferase, total antioxidant capacity, superoxide dismutase, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical, and the composition of anthocyanins. This study provides evidence to support the use of purple Napier grass silage as a beneficial source of roughage for lactating dairy goats.

AB  - Pastureland maintenance is seen as a land-based measure to reduce dependency on feed concentrates and mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from livestock production in the EU, while providing other ecosystems services. This paper assesses potential market-mediated impacts, including global Land Use Change (LUC) and GHG emissions, from increased subsidies to pasture-based livestock production in the EU. A tax recycling strategy (TRS) is simulated against a baseline up to 2030 under the shared socioeconomic pathway 2 (SSP2). This implies a budget-neutral increase in the level of pasture subsidies in individual Member States, as land subsidies for other cropping activities decrease. We employ the computable general equilibrium (CGE) model GTAP in its recursivedynamic version, GTAP-RDEM, extended with the Multi-Regional Input-Output (MRIO) database FABIO to disaggregate agri-food sectors from 21 to 31. This approach allows considering price- and income-dependent feedbacks when assessing long-run changes in the global economy, improving the sectoral resolution relative to GTAP v10. The policy increases pastureland areas and cattle production in almost all EU Member States, whereas cropland and crop production decrease, causing significant changes across EU agri-food markets. Crop prices increase, leading to the reduced output of intensive animal production sectors, mainly pig and poultry. Cropland areas decrease and most EU countries increase imports of grain, oilseeds, and cakes, essentially soybean cake from Brazil and North America. While GHG emissions decrease in those EU countries where pasturelands expand mainly at the cost of croplands, GHG emissions increase in those countries where pastureland expansion comes with forest loss. As a result, net GHG emissions increase in the EU-27 in 2030 (+2.49 Mt CO2-eq). Emissions from LUC in major non-EU grain- and oilseed-exporting countries increase, e.g., by 102.52 Mt CO2-eq in Brazil and by 129.17 Mt CO2-eq in North America. The simulated policy shows that promoting extensive livestock per se does not meet the objectives of the Common Agricultural Policy and the EU Green Deal. The TRS should be complemented with policies to foster crop diversification and promote the use of domestic feed sources (e.g., legumes) to effectively ensure feed self-sufficiency and that extensive cattle production in the EU does not lead to deforestation in carbon-rich countries.

AB  - Holley Shelter is a Middle (MSA) and Later Stone Age (LSA) site in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. The rock shelter is located at the intersection of three ecosystems, in a strip of the Savanna Biome between the Grassland and Indian Ocean Coastal Belt Biomes. Initial excavations in the 1950s by Gordon Cramb yielded large amounts of unifacial points and splintered pieces, as well as organic remains associated with MSA occupations. Our comparative techno-typological evaluation of this material in 2015 suggested the occupations may date to early MIS 3. We then initiated new excavations at the site using modern field methods and controlled sampling for lithic and organic material. Following the initial round of interdisciplinary analysis, we herein report the first absolute ages for Holley Shelter, a detailed technological analysis of new lithic material from the uppermost MSA layers at the site, and a preliminary study of the associated faunal remains. A set of 12 C-14 dates place these occupations within a constricted chronological period dated to similar to 36,000-34,000 cal. BP that overlaps with the so-called 'final MSA'. The hornfels-dominated lithic assemblages are characterized by diverse core technologies oriented toward the production of laminar products, which include bladelets and abundant splintered pieces. The zooarchaeological analysis documents an emphasis on open grasslands that provided the bulk of the animal prey exploited by the inhabitants of the shelter, with a preference for medium-sized antelopes. Three bone retouchers, a rare occurrence in southern African MSA contexts, were identified in the faunal assemblage. The archaeological deposits at Holley Shelter reflect short-term, potentially seasonal, and specialized occupations that could be influenced by its ecological position. The archaeological material exhibits marked discrepancies with other well-dated final MSA assemblages such as those from Sibhudu, Umbeli Belli, Sibebe and Border Cave. This illustrates considerable variability and a complex spatio-temporal patterning of behavioral adaptations and cultural traditions at the end of the MSA in southern Africa.

AB  - The Aesculus genus has several species, most notably Aesculus hippocastanum, with reported cytotoxic and venotonic effects. The angiogenic effect from A. hippocastanum is of interest given the current limitations of antiangiogenic therapeutics. Aesculus glabra (Willdenow), known as the Ohio Buckeye Tree is a species native to North America with reported medicinal use by the Native Americans. Previous phytochemical studies have focused on the seed and leaf contents of the glabra species, with most of them reporting cytotoxic activity. In this study, we assessed preliminary anti-angiogenic activity and toxicity of isolated compounds from the bark of A. glabra utilizing a zebrafish (Danio rerio) model. Procyanidin A2 and epicatechin, two pure isolates, were tested using zebrafish and gave an anti-angiogenic response, suggesting an underlying mechanism involved in vascular development.

AB  - Recent developments in insect science and technology and integrated pest management (IPM) are laying a concrete path for transition from the dreaded chemical-based pest management to biological and biorational-based methods. Herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) play an important role in host plant-herbivore-natural enemy interactions and have the potential to enhance the effectiveness of biological and biorational-based controls for integrated pest management (IPM). Synthetic HIPV blends can potentially improve the foraging behavior of predators by attracting them. This study was conducted to explore the emission of plant volatiles under infestation by cotton aphids, Aphis gossypii Glover, and their influence on attraction response of predatory six-spotted ladybird beetle, Cheilomenes sexmaculata (Fab.). Cotton leaf extracts were analyzed by gas chromatography coupled mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and the response of C. sexmaculata to the various extracts was assessed with a Y-tube olfactometer. By comparing the volatile profile of aphid-infested leaf extract with that of uninfested leaf extract, three compounds, namely 3-carene, pentadecane, and alpha-linolenic acid, were identified as aphid-induced HIPVs. However, the abundance of the other three compounds, heptane, 3-hexenal, and alpha-copaene significantly increased upon aphid infestation. At a concentration of 5%, aphid-infested leaf extract had the greatest effect on both female (85.9 +/- 7.6%) and male (80.9 +/- 6.4%) beetles. These results confirmed that HIPVs induced by aphids in cotton could attract C. sexmaculata beetles. Future tests need to be conducted to determine which compounds could be exploited as attractants for C. sexmaculata.

AB  - In his article, Grossmann argues that, in the context of human cooperative caregiving, heightened fearfulness in children and human sensitivity to fear in others are adaptive traits.

AB  - Simple Summary
   The surplus of crude glycerin and the rising cost of feedstuffs have encouraged the nutritional valorization of this by-product as an interesting alternative ingredient in pig feed. We tested the addition of 2.5 and 5% glycerin to pelleted piglet diets to assess the effects on growth performance and digestibility of weaned piglets and to determine the serum concentrations of hormones related to energy metabolism and feed intake. Crude glycerin was included as a replacement for sheep sweet whey and wheat in pre-starter and starter diets, respectively. Growth data and fecal samples were collected at the end of each feeding phase. At the end of the study, blood samples were taken to analyze insulin and ghrelin concentrations. Over the whole period, our results showed that the average daily gain and the feed conversion ratio were not affected negatively by the dietary glycerin inclusion. There were also no differences between dietary treatments in terms of blood metabolites measured while the digestibility coefficients of dry and organic matter improved as glycerin increased. Therefore, crude glycerin could be used as an energy source to replace sweet whey and wheat and be added to pre-starter and starter diets.
   The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the inclusion of crude glycerin in post-weaning diets for piglets on growth performance and digestibility. The study was carried out with a total of 360 piglets over a 39 day period. Animals were blocked by body weight (7.7 +/- 0.86 kg) and allotted randomly to one of three dietary treatments containing 0, 2.5 or 5% glycerin (G0, G2.5 and G5, respectively). Considering the whole period, glycerin did not affect the average daily gain. However, the average daily feed intake (ADFI) and the feed conversion ratio (FCR) tended to decrease or decreased linearly as the amount of glycerin increased, respectively (p = 0.060 and p = 0.039). The apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of dry and organic matter (DM, OM) increased linearly with increasing glycerin in both periods (p <= 0.05). At the end of the study, there were no differences between treatments for any of the hormones measured. In conclusion, the FCR and digestibility of DM and OM were improved although the ADFI tended to be lower when glycerin was included at 5%. Consequently, crude glycerin could be used as an alternative ingredient to partially replace sweet whey and wheat in post-weaning diets.

AB  - This work presents a novel approach to rainfall-runoff modeling. We incorporate GAN-based data compaction into a spatial-attention-enhanced transductive long short-term memory (TLSTM) network. The GAN component reduces data dimensions while retaining essential features. This compaction enables the TLSTM to capture complex temporal dependencies in rainfall-runoff patterns more effectively. When tested on the CAMELS dataset, the model significantly outperforms benchmark LSTM-based models. For 8-day runoff forecasts, our model achieves an NSE of 0.536, compared to 0.326 from the closest competitor. The integration of GAN-based feature extraction with spatial attention mechanisms improves predictive accuracy, particularly for peak-flow events. This method offers a powerful solution for addressing current challenges in water resource management and disaster planning under extreme climate conditions.

AB  - The mutualism of ants and extrafloral nectary-bearing plants is known to reduce rates of herbivory. However, ants may have negative impacts on other mutualisms such as pollination, constituting an indirect cost of a facultative mutualism. For instance, when foraging on or close to reproductive plant parts ants might attack pollinators or inhibit their visits. We tested the hypothesis that ants on EFN-bearing plants may negatively influence pollinator behavior, ultimately reducing plant fitness (fruit set). The study was done in a reserve at Brazilian savannah using the EFN-bearing plant Banisteriopsis malifolia (Malpighiaceae). The experimental manipulation was carried out with four groups: control (free visitation of ants), without ants (ant-free branches), artificial ants (isolated branches with artificial ants on flowers) and plastic circles (isolated branches with plastic circles on flowers). We made observations on flower visitors and their interactions, and measured fruit formation as a proxy for plant fitness. Our results showed that pollinators hesitated to visit flowers with artificial ants, negatively affecting pollination, but did not hesitate to visit flowers with plastic circles, suggesting that they recognize the specific morphology of the ants. Pollinators spent more time per flower on the ant-free branches, and the fruiting rate was lower in the group with artificial ants. Our results confirm an indirect cost in this facultative mutualism, where the balance between these negative and positive effects of ants on EFN-bearing plants are not well known.

AB  - The sheep breeding industry forms a substantial proportion of the agriculture sector in the Republic of Kazakhstan and ensuring its sustainable functioning should be implemented in a number of national documents, which can be considered as the basis for increasing the level of national food security. This can be achieved not only by increasing livestock numbers, but also by conducting research that will reduce the incidence of disease in livestock. The novelty of the study is determined by the fact that in the extension study of autopsy of sheep affected by diseases, an analysis of factors that increase the incidence of melaphagosis was carried out. Almaty and Jambyl regions were selected as objects of research. The main effects of classical and innovative drugs that reduce the melophagosis incidence are presented. The analysis of the seasonal level of morbidity and the age composition of sheep herds was carried out. It has been determined that the treatment and prevention of melophagosis can be performed on the basis of a combination of 2 and 5 drugs, both chemically active and biogenic. The practical significance of the study suggests the possibility of a considerable reduction in the level of parasitic invasions in the steppe conditions of Kazakhstan and stabilisation of the produced level of sheep breeding.

AB  - Common disadvantages of modern synthetic vascular prostheses are thrombogenicity and lack of biomechanical compatibility with the prothesized vessel. To elucidate the role of these factors in the prosthesis integration, prostheses specimens were made by the electrospinning from the known materials: polycaprolactone, polyurethane and a mixture of fluorine-containing synthetic rubber FKM-26 with fluoroplastic F-26. The germination of the prostheses was compared with standard e-PTFE prosthesis in the pigs infrarenal aorta. The elastic properties of prostheses were studied by elastometry under the physiological range of loads. The thrombogenicity of the materials was determined by the number of platelets adhered to material surface exposed to native blood. The patency of the prostheses was checked by aortography. The germination of prostheses was assessed in the histological examination. It was shown that, with this set of materials, biomechanical compatibility turned out to be a more important factor of integration than the material thrombogenicity.

AB  - DNA metabarcoding has become a powerful technique for identifying the species present in a bulk environmental sample. The application of DNA metabarcoding to wildlife diet analysis is a particularly promising tool for exploring trophic interactions. The extent to which molecular approaches agree with traditional approaches, and how this varies with the quality of field-collected scats, is unknown. Here, we compare diets from wolf scats profiled using both mechanical sorting and metabarcoding of amplified vertebrate DNA sequences. Our objectives were to (1) compare findings from mechanical sorting and metabarcoding as a method of diet profiling and (2) use results to better understand diets of wolves on Prince of Wales Island, a population of conservation concern. We predicted metabarcoding would reveal both higher diversity of prey and identify rare species that are overlooked with mechanical sorting. We found that there was substantial overlap in the diets revealed using both methods, indicating that deer, beaver, and black bear were the primary prey species, but metabarcoding revealed a more diverse diet with greater occurrence of rare species. However, there was a large discrepancy in the occurrence of beaver in scats (52% and 25% from mechanical sorting and metabarcoding, respectively) explained by the high rate of false positives with mechanical sorting methods. While the number of wolf sequence reads for fresh scats was nearly eight times higher than in degraded scats, neither the number of prey sequence reads nor the quantity of DNA to be sequenced varied between fresh and degraded scats suggesting that metabarcoding is sensitive enough to determine prey assemblages in degraded scats. Even using scats from extremely wet conditions hostile to DNA preservation, we found that metabarcoding was more effective than mechanical sorting in describing diet.

AB  - Simple Summary An outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease from a pig population vaccinated with a mismatched strain raises a question about how effective a mismatched foot and mouth vaccine could be against the transmission of another strain of the virus. Simulation models using daily clinical case data from the farm indicated that, although the vaccine reduced viral shedding, it failed to prevent the development of clinical signs. With caveats, this study suggests that using unmatched vaccines could alter the disease dynamics of another strain and, in turn, may confound the outbreak in a vaccinated population. It is, therefore, important to test for antigenic matching between circulating strains and the vaccine pool.Abstract In December 2014, a novel foot and mouth disease (FMD) virus was introduced to a pig farm in South Korea, despite the animals being vaccinated. A marginal antigenic matching between the novel and vaccine strains potentially led to the infection of the vaccinated animals. To understand the impact of using an FMD vaccine on the transmission dynamics of an unmatched field strain, simulation models were employed using daily reported data on clinical cases from the farm. The results of this study indicated that immunisation with the FMD vaccine reduced the shedding of the novel FMD virus in pigs. However, there was no evidence to suggest that the immunisation had a significant effect in reducing the development of clinical signs. These findings highlight that the use of an unmatched FMD vaccine can confound the outbreak by altering the disease dynamics of the novel virus. Based on this study, we emphasise the importance of continuous testing to ensure antigenic matching between the circulating strains and the vaccine pool.

AB  - Staphylococcus aureus infections pose a potential threat to livestock production and public health. A novel strategy is needed to control S. aureus infections due to its adaptive evolution to antibiotics. Autophagy plays a key role in degrading bacteria for innate immune cells. In order to promote S. aureus clearance via Toll-like receptor (TLR)-induced autophagy pathway, the domain fusion TLR2-4 with the extracellular domain of TLR2, specific recognizing S. aureus, and transmembrane and intracellular domains of TLR4 is assembled, then the goat expressing TLR2-4 is generated. TLR2-4 substantially augments the removal of S. aureus within macrophages by elevating autophagy level. Phosphorylated JNK and ERK1/2 promote LC3-puncta in TLR2-4 macrophages during S. aureus-induced autophagy via MyD88 mediated the TAK1 signaling cascade. Meantime, the TRIF-dependent TBK1-TFEB-OPTN signaling is involved in TLR2-4-triggered autophagy after S. aureus challenge. Moreover, the transcript of ATG5 and ATG12 is significantly increased via cAMP-PKA-NF-kappa B signaling, which facilitates S. aureus-induced autophagy in TLR2-4 macrophages. Overall, the novel receptor TLR2-4 enhances the autophagy-dependent clearance of S. aureus in macrophages via TAK1/TBK1-JNK/ERK, TBK1-TFEB-OPTN, and cAMP-PKA-NF-kappa B-ATGs signaling pathways, which provide an alternative approach for resistant against S. aureus infection.

AB  - Species interactions are frequently context-specific. Climate fluctuations can inflict stress on individuals, inducing plasticity in their behavior or changes in resource allocation. Obligate mutualisms may be particularly sensitive to such fluctuations if they affect the quantity, quality, or timing of investments between partners. In the obligate mutualism between Pseudomyrmex ants and swollen-thorn acacias (Vachellia collinsii), the ants defend their host plant in exchange for domatia, extrafloral nectar, and protein-rich Beltian bodies. Ant reward size is known to vary temporally and according to the identity of the associated ant partner, with better-quality defenders (P. spinicola and P. simulans) receiving relatively more plant resources than non-defending ants. We studied how an El Ni & ntilde;o-related drought impacted the investments of acacias in their ant colonies. Hence, we resampled acacias that were previously measured for ant rewards during a neutral El Ni & ntilde;o Southern Oscillation period again during El Ni & ntilde;o 2023. We predicted that water limitations would reduce the resources available for allocation toward ant colonies and that acacias hosting obligate-nesting Pseudomyrmex would show a greater decrease in ant rewards compared to plants associated with non-defending ants (Crematogaster sp.). Unexpectedly, we found that acacias allocated more resources to ant rewards in 2023, irrespective of the ant partner. Heightened herbivore pressure, increased light availability, decreased precipitation, or a combination of these factors could explain why acacias invested more in mutualism with ants. Though the long-term consequences of these climate fluctuations remain unknown, this work highlights the plasticity of coevolved mutualistic interactions in the face of global change.

AB  - This study examined the impact of cyclicity (with or without cycle corpus luteum; CL) on oocyte quality and embryonic development in buffaloes. We collected oocytes from the ovaries of slaughtered buffaloes (N = 158 cyclic; n = 316 ovaries and N = 177 acyclic; n = 353 ovaries). Blood progesterone concentration and number of oocytes per ovary were higher in cyclic buffaloes. Cyclic buffalo ovaries produce higher oocytes with I + II and fewer III + IV grades. Oocytes from cyclic buffaloes had a higher maturation rate based on cumulus expansion, cleavage rate and embryo development to the 8-cell, morula and blastocyst stages than acyclic buffaloes. In conclusion, oocytes recovered from the ovaries of the cyclic buffaloes showed improved oocyte competence and subsequent in vitro blastocyst development.

AB  - Simple Summary Nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) molecular markers were used to investigate the genetic variation in two native Lithuanian sheep breeds, compare them with the imported and theoretically close by origin Skudde sheep and establish the historical patterns of genetic relatedness to British, Central European and Nordic sheep breeds included in the SheepHapMap study. The results increase knowledge of and support for historical data on the importance of two local Lithuanian sheep breeds' conservation and suggest the Skudde origin is less directly linked to the geographical area of modern-day Lithuania. In Lithuania, there are two recognised native sheep breeds: old native Lithuanian Coarsewooled and Lithuanian Blackface. In addition, in 2005, primitive Heidschnucke-type Skudde sheep were imported to Lithuania and were argued to possibly represent a lost Lithuanian sheep type. The aim of the study was to investigate the genetic variation in the two Lithuanian native sheep breeds, compare them with the imported Skudde sheep and establish the historical patterns of admixture and the genetic relatedness of Lithuanian sheep to British, Central European and Nordic sheep breeds included in the SheepHapMap study. In total, 72 individuals, representing two Lithuanian native and imported Skudde sheep breeds, were genotyped using a Neogen 12K Illumina Infinium chip. The population analysis was carried out by model-based clustering, principal component analysis and neighbour net analysis, and showed similar patterns for the Lithuanian sheep populations. Lithuanian Coarsewooled and Skudde in Lithuania have unique divergence and possibly some shared ancestry, while the Lithuanian Blackface conforms to a modern synthetic breed. The study clearly showed that the Coarsewooled and the Skudde breeds are distinct from each other. Historical data strongly suggest that the Coarsewooled breed represents a local breed, while the Skudde origin is less directly linked to the geographical area of modern-day Lithuania. Within the modern-day Lithuanian context, the Lithuanian Coarsewooled sheep is very important historical sheep type for conservation.

AB  - The objective of this study was to assess the resting values of the physiological oxidative stress exhibited by lambs and kids reared in Greece, and the potential correlations between redox biomarker levels in blood and other tissues (liver, diaphragm, quadriceps, psoas major muscle). For this purpose, lambs and kids at different developmental stages (d.s.) were used. The latter corresponded to four live weight categories (LWC), each representing 25%, 35%, 70% and 100% of mature body weight. In each of the above tissues, the levels of five common redox biomarkers were determined: glutathione (GSH), catalase (CAT), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), thiobarbituric reactive substances (TBARS), and protein carbonyls (CARBS). The results revealed that lambs and kids belonging to the 35% LWC had weaker endogenous antioxidant pools, while animals in the 70% and 100% LWC had elevated intrinsic antioxidant defense systems. Blood redox biomarkers were associated with the respective ones measured in the diaphragm, liver, quadriceps, and psoas major of both species. Importantly, TBARS levels in blood of animals in the 25% and 100% LWC are correlated with the TBARS levels in all other tissues tested. Blood antioxidant parameters might be used as potential biomarkers to predict the antioxidant status of tissues that affect meat quality. The latter would facilitate quality assessment prior to slaughter, allowing for timely nutritional interventions that can improve meat products.

AB  - Simple Summary Niche widths and individual specialization were studied based on the isotopic signals, but using the innovative and non-lethal approach. We analyzed four different body tissues with different isotopic half-lives, and revealed crucial results on trophic interactions of fish. We assume that the observed trends will occur in other food webs with similar trophic positions. For example, the apex predator status of ectotherms is linked to the individual size, not to the species. In addition, thanks to the consideration of the site trophic state (total phosphorus content), which has been little studied in relation to niche width, we observed a significant impact on the individual specialization of species in higher trophic positions. Thus, eutrophication can significantly change the foraging behavior.Intra-species variability in isotopic niches, specifically isotopic total niche width (ITNW), isotopic individual niche width (IINW), and isotopic individual specialization (IIS), was studied using an innovative approach without sacrificing the vertebrates. Stable isotopes (d(13)C, d(15)N) in four body tissues differing in isotopic half-life were analyzed from four freshwater fish species representing different trophic positions. ITNW was widest for the apex predator (European catfish) and narrowest for the obligate predator (Northern pike). IINW exhibited a polynomial trend for the European catfish, Northern pike, and Eurasian perch (mesopredator), decreasing with body mass and increasing again after exceeding a certain species-dependent body mass threshold. Thus, for ectotherms, apex predator status is linked rather to its size than to the species. In herbivores (rudd), IINW increased with body mass. The IIS of predators negatively correlated with site trophic state. Therefore, eutrophication can significantly change the foraging behavior of certain species. We assume that the observed trends will occur in other species at similar trophic positions in either aquatic or terrestrial systems. For confirmation, we recommend conducting a similar study on other species in different habitats.

AB  - The present study aimed to explore the toxic effects of excessive dietary Mn in livers and cerebrums of Jianzhou Da'er goat (Capra hircus). Three-month old goats were assigned into three groups: control group, fed on basal diet; Mn I group, fed on the basal diet mixed with MnCl2 (2.5 g/kg); Mn II group, fed on the basal diet mixed with MnCl2 (5 g/kg). Compared with the control group, the activities of serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and the concentrations of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in Mn I and Mn II groups were significantly increased, but the concentrations of IgG in Mn I and Mn II groups were significantly decreased (p < 0.05). The activities of superoxide dismutase (T-SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx), and the concentrations of glutathione (GSH) in Mn I and Mn II groups were significantly decreased, whereas the concentrations of malondialdehyde (MDA) in Mn I and Mn II groups were significantly increased in livers and cerebrums (p < 0.05). Moreover, the hepatocytes necrosed, inflammatory cells infiltrated, chromatin concentrated, mitochondrial cristae reduced in Mn I and Mn II groups. The nerve cells necrosed, blood vessels congested, inflammatory cells infiltrated, mitochondrial electron density and mitochondrial cristae decreased, and vacuolization increased in Mn I and Mn II groups. Furthermore, the mRNA expressions of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), tumor necrosis factor receptor type 1 (TNFR1), fas-associated protein via a death domain (FADD), Bcl2-associated X (Bax), cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase 3, 8, 9 (Caspase-3, 8, 9) in Mn I and Mn II groups were significantly increased (p < 0.05), but the mRNA expressions of B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) in Mn I and Mn II groups were significantly decreased (p < 0.05) in livers. The mRNA expressions of Bcl-2, Bax, Caspase-3, 9, 7, 12 in Mn I and Mn II groups were significantly increased (p < 0.05), however, the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax in Mn I and Mn II groups was significantly decreased (p < 0.05) in cerebrums. In summary, our results provided new insights for better understanding the mechanisms of Mn toxicity in Capra hircus.

AB  - Technologies capable of noninvasively sampling different locations in the gut upstream of the colon will enable new insights into the role of organ-specific microbiomes on human health. Herein, an ingestible pill for the sampling of gut lumen based on one of the earliest hydraulic machines known as an Archimedes screw is reported. The design contains twisted wires as Archimedes screw driven by a motor, wirelessly activated using a magnet. The sampling performance of the screw-pump pill is characterized using realistic in vitro models and validated in vitro using E. coli expressing different fluorescent proteins. The use of the Archimedes screw enables the pill to sample the dense GI environment. The pill is also tested ex vivo in the pig intestine and in vivo in pigs. Herein, the results show that the bacterial populations recovered from the pill's chamber closely resemble the targeted bacterial population of the microenvironment to which the pill is exposed. Such ingestible devices have the potential to revolutionize the understanding of the spatial diversity of the gut microbiome and its response to medical conditions and treatments.

AB  - Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection severely affects the swine industry each year. Although the host mechanisms against PRRSV infection have been identified in key target tissues through whole transcriptome sequencing, specific molecular regulators have not been elucidated. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) expression is highly specific and could thus be used to effectively identify PRRSV-specific candidates. Here, we identified novel lncRNAs in lungs, bronchial lymph nodes, and tonsils after PRRSV infection and constructed phenotype-based integrative co-expression networks using time-series differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs and mRNAs. After the analyses, a total of 309 lncRNA-mRNA interactions were identified. During early host innate signalling, interferon-inducible and interferon genes were positively regulated by specific lncRNA. Moreover, T-cell receptor genes in lung adaptive immune signalling were negatively regulated by specific lncRNA. Collectively, our findings provide insights into the genome-wide lncRNA-mRNA interactions and dy-namic regulation of lncRNA-mediated mechanisms against PRRSV infection.

AB  - Knowing a species' area requirements is fundamental for species conservation. For the nominate subspecies of the White-backed Woodpecker Dendrocopos leucotos, a species of high conservation concern in Europe, estimates of the seasonal and year-round area requirements based on telemetry are missing. In the present study, we radio-tracked adult White-backed Woodpeckers in Central Europe and investigated bi-monthly home-range sizes based on three home-range estimators in relation to season, sex, body weight, and year. Home-range size of 49 radio-tracked individuals varied depending on the used home-range estimator, with minimum convex polygons (MCP) and autocorrelated kernel density estimation (AKDE) producing 1.6-1.8 and 2-3.3 times larger seasonal home ranges than traditional kernel density estimation (KDE). Moreover, home-range sizes varied between seasons. Home ranges were smallest in February/March (predicted median home-range sizes ranged from 35 ha with KDE to 88 ha with AKDE) and April/May (KDE: 30 ha, AKDE: 55 ha) and larger during the rest of the year (KDE: 48-67 ha, AKDE: 136-184 ha). The mean home-range size of six individuals tracked in all seasons (calculated with all locations per individual) was 116 ha with KDE, 304 ha with MCP and 350 ha with AKDE. Our results highlight the importance of considering the full annual cycle when addressing area requirements of White-backed Woodpeckers and likely also of other species. Furthermore, our study shows that using multiple methods for home-range estimation may be useful to obtain results that are both comparable with those of other studies and capture the range in which the true home-range size is likely to be. For the conservation of the White-backed Woodpecker, we conclude that at least 116-350 ha of forest should be present for a pair.
   Saisonale Ver & auml;nderungen in der Aktionsraumgr & ouml;sse des Weissr & uuml;ckenspechtsDie Raumanspr & uuml;che einer Art zu kennen, ist f & uuml;r den Artenschutz wichtig. F & uuml;r die Nominatform des Weissr & uuml;ckenspechts Dendrocopos leucotos, eine Art von hoher Naturschutzrelevanz in Europa, gibt es bisher keine Sch & auml;tzungen der saisonalen und ganzj & auml;hrigen Aktionsraumgr & ouml;ssen basierend auf Telemetriedaten. In der vorliegenden Studie haben wir adulte Weissr & uuml;ckenspechte in Mitteleuropa mittels Radiotelemetrie lokalisiert und die zweimonatlichen Aktionsraumgr & ouml;ssen anhand von drei Aktionsraum-Sch & auml;tzmethoden in Abh & auml;ngigkeit von Saison, Geschlecht, K & ouml;rpergewicht und Jahr untersucht. Die Aktionsraumgr & ouml;sse von 49 besenderten Individuen variierte je nach verwendeter Methode, wobei die Minimum-Convex-Polygon-Methode (MCP) und die Autocorrelated-Kernel-Density-Estimation-Methode (AKDE) saisonale Aktionsr & auml;ume erzeugten, die 1,6 bis 1,8 bzw. 2 bis 3,3 Mal gr & ouml;sser waren als bei der traditionellen Kernel-Density-Estimation-Methode (KDE). Zudem variierten die Aktionsraumgr & ouml;ssen zwischen den Saisons. Die kleinsten Aktionsr & auml;ume wurden im Februar/M & auml;rz (die Medianwerte der vorhergesagten Aktionsraumgr & ouml;ssen reichten von 35 ha mit KDE bis 88 ha mit AKDE) und April/Mai (KDE: 30 ha, AKDE: 55 ha) festgestellt, w & auml;hrend sie den Rest des Jahres & uuml;ber gr & ouml;sser waren (KDE: 48-67 ha, AKDE: 136-184 ha). Die mittlere Aktionsraumgr & ouml;sse von sechs Individuen, die & uuml;ber alle Saisons hinweg verfolgt wurden (berechnet mit allen Lokalisationen pro Individuum), betrug 116 ha mit KDE, 304 ha mit MCP und 350 ha mit AKDE. Unsere Ergebnisse zeigen, dass es bei der Ermittlung der Raumanspr & uuml;che des Weissr & uuml;ckenspechts und wahrscheinlich auch anderer Arten wichtig ist, den gesamten Jahreszyklus zu ber & uuml;cksichtigen. Dar & uuml;ber hinaus zeigt unsere Studie, dass die Verwendung mehrerer Methoden zur Sch & auml;tzung der Aktionsr & auml;ume n & uuml;tzlich sein kann, um Ergebnisse zu erhalten, die sowohl mit denen anderer Studien vergleichbar sind als auch den Bereich abdecken, in dem die tats & auml;chliche Aktionsraumgr & ouml;sse wahrscheinlich liegt. F & uuml;r den Schutz des Weissr & uuml;ckenspechts schlussfolgern wir, dass mindestens 116 bis 350 ha Wald f & uuml;r ein Brutpaar vorhanden sein sollten.

AB  - Bycatch of common dolphin (Delphinus delphis) in commercial trawl fisheries in the Bay of Biscay (NE Atlantic) is of concern and its mitigation a priority. Active acoustic deterrent devices (pingers) attached to fishing gear seem to be promising for bycatch mitigation, as they have demonstrated to effectively reduce cetacean bycatch in some set-net fisheries. However, the low occurrence of common dolphin bycatch in many trawl fisheries, coupled with the extensive amount of time needed to monitor them, makes it difficult to prove the effectiveness of pingers. Remote electronic monitoring (REM) systems in fisheries can substantially increase onboard observation, providing access to extensive databases to comprehensively address bycatch mitigation studies. In this study, the effectiveness of DDD & REG;03H Dolphin Dissuasive Device (hereinafter DDD pingers) to reduce common dolphin bycatch was evaluated in a demersal pair trawler in FAO Division 27.8.c. In 195 fishing days, one of the vessels in the pair operated with a set of DDD pingers whereas the other operated without them, and the bycatch of common dolphin was monitored through the REM system. In total, 660 fishing hauls were conducted of which 223 hauls had the DDDs attached. The results showed that the DDDs reduced common dolphin bycatch by more than 90%, with both bycatch frequency and the number of individuals bycaught per haul being significantly lower. The results also showed that common dolphin bycatch in this fishery is related to factors such as the fishing zone and depth, whereas the type of net deployed, time of day and haul duration were found to not significantly affect the bycatch of this species.

AB  - The synthesis of 1,8-naphthyridine derivatives fused with other heterocycles, such as chromenes and quinolines, as well as their behaviour as topoisomerase I inhibitors is studied. The preparation is carried out through a direct and simple process as an intramolecular [4 + 2] cycloaddition reaction between functionalized aldimines, ob-tained by the condensation of 2-aminopyridine and unsaturated aldehydes, and olefins. In particular, while no clear inhibitory activity is observed for chromeno[4,3-b] [1,8]naphthyridine fused heterocycles, a very different result is observed for quinolino[4,3-b][1,8]naphthyridine derivatives. Experimental assays indicated that qui-nolino[4,3-b] [1,8]naphthyridines inhibited the topoisomerase I enzymatic reaction behaving like a poison, as occurs with the natural TopI inhibitor, camptothecin. Furthermore, the cytotoxic effect on cell lines derived from human lung adenocarcinoma (A549), human ovarian carcinoma (SKOV3), and on non-cancerous lung fibroblasts cell line (MRC5) was also screened.

AB  - Background and Aims The Greater Cape Floristic Region is one of the world's biodiversity hotspots and is considered poor in polyploids. To test this assumption, ploidy variation was investigated in a widespread Cape shrub, Dicerothamnus rhinocerotis (renosterbos, Asteraceae). The aim was to elucidate the cytotype distribution and population composition across the species range, and to assess differences in morphology, environmental niches and genetics. Methods Ploidy level and genome size were determined via flow cytometry and cytotype assignment was confirmed by chromosome counting. Restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) analyses were used to infer genetic relationships. Cytotype climatic and environmental niches were compared using a range of environmental layers and a soil model, while morphological differences were examined using multivariate methods. Key Results The survey of 171 populations and 2370 individuals showed that the species comprises diploid and tetraploid cytotypes, no intermediates and only 16.8 % of mixed populations. Mean 2C values were 1.80-2.06 pg for diploids and 3.48-3.80 pg for tetraploids, with very similar monoploid genome sizes. Intra-cytotype variation showed a significant positive correlation with altitude and longitude in both cytotypes and with latitude in diploids. Although niches of both cytotypes were highly equivalent and similar, their optima and breadth were shifted due to differences mainly in isothermality and available water capacity. Morphometric analyses showed significant differences in the leaves and corolla traits, the number of florets per capitulum, and cypsela dimensions between the two cytotypes. Genetic analyses revealed four groups, three of them including both cytotypes. Conclusions Dicerothamnus rhinocerotis includes two distinct cytotypes that are genetically similar. While tetraploids arise several times independently within different genetic groups, morphological and ecological differences are evident between cytotypes. Our results open up new avenues for questions regarding the importance of ploidy in the megadiverse Cape flora, and exemplify the need for population-based studies focused on ploidy variation.

AB  - In response to stresses, plants are capable of communicating their physiological status to other individuals in the community using several chemical cues. Nearby receivers then ad-just their own homeostasis to increase resilience. The majority of studies to date have con-centrated on the communication of abiotic stressors (e.g., salinity or drought) or herbivory. Less attention has been paid to the role of communication during microbial infections and almost nothing has focused on viruses. Here we investigated the effect that the prevalence of a turnip mosaic virus in a community of Arabidopsis thaliana has on the severity of symptoms developed in a group of receivers. First, we looked at the influence of two factors on the kinetics of symptom progression in the receivers, namely the prevalence of infection among emitters and the growth stage of the receiver plants at inoculation. We found that young receiver plants developed milder symptoms than older ones, and that high infection prevalence resulted in slower disease progression in receivers. Second, we tested the pos-sibility that jasmonates could act as chemical signaling cues. To do this, we examined the kinetics of symptom progression in jasmonate-insensitive and wild-type plants. The results showed that the protective effect vanished in the mutant plants. Third, we investigated the possibility that root communication could also be relevant. We found that the kinetics of symptom progression across receivers was further slowed down in an age-dependent man-ner when plants were planted in the same pot. Together, these preliminary findings point to a potential function for disease prevalence in plant communities in regulating the severity of symptoms, this effect being mediated by some volatile organic compounds.

AB  - This study explored the daylight performance, thermal comfort, and energy-saving level of enclosed-courtyard rural residences with covered roofs in a cold IIA region of China. Using daylight autonomy (DA), annual mean value of PMV (AUM(PMV)), and total energy consumption of heating, cooling and lighting (E-hcl) in a performance evaluation index, a courtyard roof was optimized in a multi-objective fashion and analyzed for its effect on residential performance. This was achieved through field investigation and mapping, setting the prototype building model in the Rhino platform, and carrying out the iterative optimization design of the roof with a Ladybug tool component. The results show that appropriate roof form can significantly improve daylight performance, thermal comfort, and energy savings. Compared to the open-courtyard rural residence prototype model, the spatial daylight autonomy (sDA) of a flat-skylight-enclosed-courtyard residence decreased by only 0.94%, and AUM(PMV) improved significantly from -0.774 to 0.87. The E-hcl decreased by 19.7%, and compared with setting a large area of flat skylights on the roof, a reasonable clerestory window roof can achieve better residence performance.

AB  - Simple Summary The development of secondary hair follicles in goat kids determines cashmere quality in adults; however, this requires theoretical support. After a follow-up trial, we found that the development of secondary hair follicles in kids is complete at 5-6 months of age. FGF2, 21 and BMP7 may promote the growth of secondary hair follicles; and the optimal period for secondary hair follicle regulation is from birth to 5-6 months of age. In addition, hair follicle traits at 6 months of age can be used as an index for the breeding selection of cashmere goats. The objectives of this trial were to study the growth and development of hair follicles and cashmere traits in cashmere goats and to provide a theoretical basis for the regulation of secondary hair follicle development and the scientific breeding selection of cashmere goats. Twelve single-fetal female kids were selected as research objects. A long-term tracking plan was created to regularly determine their growth performance, cashmere performance, and hair follicle traits. The results showed no significant difference in live weight after the first and second combing. The cashmere yield and unit yield of the first combing were significantly higher than those of the second combing (p < 0.05). Sections of hair follicles showed that the primary hair follicles are almost fully developed by 1 month, and the secondary hair follicles are fully developed by 5-6 months after birth. The primary hair follicle density (PFD) and secondary hair follicle density (SFD) were highest at birth and decreased within 1 month; and SFD was stable at 5-6 months of age. The change of MSFD took a maximum time of 2 to 3 months. The S:P increase reached its peak at 6 months. BMP4 expression increased with time. FGF2, FGF21 and BMP7 were higher at 3 months old than at the other two-time points. In conclusion, this study determined the total development time of primary and secondary hair follicles from morphology and speculated that FGF2, FGF21, and BMP7 may play a regulatory role in developing secondary hair follicles. Therefore, the period from birth to 6 months of age was the best time to regulate secondary hair follicle development in cashmere goats kids. The traits of the hair follicle and cashmere at 6 months of age could be breeding selection indicators for cashmere goats.

AB  - Long non-coding RNA play an importantr role in the differentiation of chondrocytes. This study aims to explore the role of long non-coding RNA in the transcriptional regulation of Notch4. In previous studies, it has been found that Notch signal can be used as the downstream of TGF-beta signal to affect the proliferation and differentiation of deer antler chondrocytes, but the specific mechanism remains unclear. Here we found that lncRNA27785.1 was involved in the regulation of TGF-beta/ Smad3 signal and Notch4 gene. The overexpression lncRNA27785.1 can negatively regulate the expression of Notch4 to inhibit cell proliferation and differentiation, while interference with lncRNA27785.1 can promote the expression of Notch4 gene to promote the proliferation and differentiation of chondrocytes. Subsequently, through luciferase experiment and CHIP experiment, we found that lncRNA27785.1 is regulated by Smad3 transcription, and Smad3 inhibited the expression of lncRNA27785.1. In addition, activated TGF-beta signaling can reduce the inhibitory effect of lncRNA27785.1 on Notch4 signaling. In summary, we found that lncRNA27785.1 and TGF-beta/Smad3 play an important role in Notch4 signaling. Our findings provided evidence to explain how TGF-beta signaling regulate the Notch signaling pathway to influence chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation by a specific lncRNA27785.1.

AB  - During cryopreservation, a substantial portion of spermatozoa undergoes apoptosis due to cryoinjury, resulting in decreased fertility. Boar spermatozoa are highly sensitive to temperature, with low temperature triggering reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, leading to oxidative stress and apoptosis. Sulforaphane (SFN), a potent natural compound found in cruciferous vegetables, is efficacious in mitigating oxidative stress. We here supplemented different SFN concentrations (0, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 mu M) into the freezing extender to explore its effect on boar sperm during cryopreservation and determine the optimal SFN concentration. Supplementation of 5 mu M SFN exhibited the highest sperm motility, motion performance, plasma membrane integrity, acrosome integrity, and antioxidant properties (total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) and antioxidant enzyme activity) after freezing and thawing. Then, RT group, C group and C + SFN group were established to explore the effect of SFN on the cryopreservation-induced sperm apoptosis level and fertilizing capacity of post-thawed sperms. SFN effectively rescued the apoptosis and fertilizing capacity of post-thawed sperms. Mechanistically, SFN activated the redox-sensitive nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2/NFE2L2) by promoting adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation. This activation improved antioxidant defenses, ultimately improving cryoinjury in boar spermatozoa. In summary, SFN suppressed cryopreservationinduced apoptosis of spermatozoa by activating antioxidant defenses and the AMPK/NFE2L2 signaling pathway. These findings suggest a novel approach for augmenting the cryoprotective efficiency and spermatozoa fertility after cryopreservation.

AB  - Premise: Polyploidy is a widespread mutational process in angiosperms that may alter population performance of not only plants but also their interacting species. Yet, knowledge of whether polyploidy affects plant-herbivore dynamics is scarce. Here, we tested whether aphid herbivores exhibit preference for diploid or neopolyploid plants, whether polyploidy impacts plant and herbivore performance, and whether these interactions depend on the plant genetic background. Methods; Using independently synthesized neotetraploid strains paired with their diploid progenitors of greater duckweed (Spirodela polyrhiza), we evaluated the effect of neopolyploidy on duckweed's interaction with the water-lily aphid (Rhopalosiphum nymphaeae). Using paired-choice experiments, we evaluated feeding preference of the herbivore. We then evaluated the consequences of polyploidy on aphid and plant performance by measuring population growth over multiple generations. Results: Aphids preferred neopolyploids when plants were provided at equal abundances but not at equal surface areas, suggesting the role of plant population surface area in driving this preference. Additionally, neopolyploidy increased aphid population performance, but this result was dependent on the plant's genetic lineage. Lastly, the impact of herbivory on neopolyploid vs. diploid duckweed varied greatly with genetic lineage, where neopolyploids appeared to be variably tolerant compared to diploids, sometimes mirroring the effect on herbivore performance. Conclusions: By experimentally testing the impacts of polyploidy on trophic species interactions, we showed that polyploidization can impact the preference and performance of herbivores on their plant hosts. These results have significant implications for the establishment and persistence of plants and herbivores in the face of plant polyploidy.

AB  - Airborne sound signals function as key mediators of mate-choice, aggression and other social interactions in a wide range of vertebrate and invertebrate animals. Calling animals produce more than sound, however. When displaying on or near a solid substrate, such as vegetation or soil, they also unavoidably excite substrate vibrations because of the physics of sound production and of acoustic propagation, and these vibrations can propagate to receivers. Despite their near ubiquity, these vibrational signal components have received very little research attention and in vertebrates it is unknown whether they are relevant to mate-choice, an important driver of evolutionary divergence. Here, we show that female redeyed treefrogs are more than twice as likely to choose a male mating call when airborne sound is paired with its corresponding substrate vibrations. Furthermore, males of the same species are more aggressive towards and display a greater range of aggressive behaviors in response to bimodal (sound and vibration) versus unimodal (sound or vibration alone) calls. In aggressive contexts, at least, air- and substrate-borne signal components function nonredundantly. These results are a clear demonstration that vibrations produced by a calling animal can function together with airborne sound to markedly enhance the function of a signal. If this phenomenon proves widespread, this finding has the potential to substantially influence our understanding of the function and evolution of acoustic signals.

AB  - Previous reports have shown an association between a Western high-fat diet (HFD) and poor cognitive performance. So far, there are no reports of whether a mild HFD can affect rabbit learning and hippocampal metabolic profile. This study was designed to explore whether feeding a mild HFD (5 % lard and 5 % soy oil) for 20 weeks affected eyeblink discrimination and discrimination reversal learning and hippocampal metabolic profiles. After 20 weeks on the HFD or a normal control diet, all rabbits received one day of adaptation, 20 daily sessions of two-tone discrimination (1-kHz CS + followed by air puff and 8-kHz CS- not followed by air puff), a rest day, and then 40 daily sessions of discrimination reversal (8-kHz CS + and 1-kHz CS-). Compared to rabbits fed a regular chow diet, rabbits fed a mild HFD showed better discrimination evidenced by higher responding to CS+, lower responding to CS-, and a larger discrimination index (CS+ - CS-). Widely targeted metabolomics analysis identified 1805 metabolites in the hippocampus, and significant HFD-induced changes in 162 and 165 differential metabolites in males and females, respectively. These included glycerophospholipids and fatty acyls. KEGG enrichment analysis showed glycerophospholipid metabolism (ko00564) was significantly enriched in the HFD group notably lysophosphatidylethanolamine and lysophosphatidylcholine. In summary, our data show a longterm mild HFD facilitated discrimination learning in rabbits without inducing a metabolic syndrome, and altered the hippocampal metabolic profile, which may affect neuronal cell membrane lipids and behavioral performance.

AB  - Simple Summary Wildlife roadkill is a global problem. Devices that produce bright lights and loud noises are claimed to be effective deterrents, but there is no scientific evidence that they actually prevent collisions between vehicles and wildlife. A recent trial in Australia installed a light and sound system, marketed as a 'virtual fence', and tested it on bare-nosed wombats (Vombatus ursinus). The study concluded that the system was minimally effective but promising. We detected a number of conceptual and procedural flaws in that study. When we re-analysed their data, we found absolutely no evidence for the effect of the virtual fence on the roadkills of wombats. The roadkill of wildlife is a global problem. Much has been written about deterring wildlife from roads, but, as of yet, there is no empirical support for deterrents based on visual and/or auditory signals. A recent paper entitled 'Can virtual fences reduce wombat road mortalities?'reported the results of a roadkill mitigation trial. The authors installed a 'virtual fence' system produced by iPTE Traffic Solutions Ltd. (Graz, Austria) and evaluated its effectiveness for reducing roadkills of bare-nosed wombats (Vombatus ursinus) in southern Australia. The authors recorded roadkills in a simple Before-After-Control-Impact design but did not conduct any formal statistical analysis. They also measured three contextual variables (vegetation, wombat burrows, and vehicle velocity) but did not link these to the occurrence of roadkills in space and time. The authors concluded that the iPTE virtual fence system was 'minimally effective', yet 'appears promising'. Our analysis of their data, using standard inferential statistics, showed no effect of the virtual fence on roadkills whatsoever. We conclude that the iPTE system was not effective for mitigating the roadkills of bare-nosed wombats.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Increasingly, sheep breeders are using artificial insemination to produce lambs, so finding methods that preserve ram sperm can be useful. OBJECTIVE: To determine the protective effects of different concentrations of laminarin on ram sperm motility, viability, abnormalities, membrane, and DNA integrity, superoxide dismutase enzyme (SOD) activity, and malondialdehyde (MDA) production after freeze-thawing. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The ejaculates of four rams were collected and stored at 35 degrees C. Semen samples were diluted with a tris-base extender containing 100, 200, 400, and 800 mu g/mL of laminarin and a control extender containing no laminarin, then frozen in liquid nitrogen after 4 h in the refrigerator. RESULTS: In the treatment of frozenthawed spermatozoa with 800 mu g/mL laminarin, motility, viability, membrane integrity, and DNA integrity were significantly higher than in the control. In spermatozoa that were exposed to 800 mu g/mL laminarin after thawing, MDA production was significantly lower than in the control group. The percentage of abnormal spermatozoa in 800 mu g/mL laminarin was significantly lower than that in the control. CONCLUSION: The addition of 800 mu g/mL laminarin to the freezing extender increases motility, viability, SOD activity, and plasma membrane integrity, while reducing abnormality and MDA production in freeze-thawed ram semen.

AB  - Cold exposure influences liver metabolism, thereby affecting energy homeostasis. However, the gene regulatory network of the liver after cold exposure remains poorly understood. In this study, we found that 24 h cold exposure (COLD, 6 degrees C) increased plasma glucose (GLU) levels, while reducing plasma non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) and triglyceride (TG) levels compared to the room temperature (RT, 25 degrees C) group. Cold exposure increased hepatic glycogen content and decreased hepatic lipid content in the livers of newborn goats. We conducted RNA-seq analysis on the livers of newborn goats in both the RT and cold exposure groups. A total of 1600 genes were identified as differentially expressed genes (DEGs), of which 555 genes were up-regulated and 1045 genes were down-regulated in the cold exposure group compared with the RT group. Cold exposure increased the expression of genes involved in glycolysis, glycogen synthesis, and fatty acid degradation pathways. These results can provide a reference for hepatic lipid and glycogen metabolism in newborn goats after cold exposure.

AB  - The production of soybean meal (SBM) can be linked to various issues related to the environment (e.g., deforestation, water waste, and transportation costs), and reducing its inclusion in pig diets by using alternative protein sources, such as insect meal, is an important challenge for nutritionists. This study aimed to compare the productive performance, dietary digestible energy (DE), nutrient digestibility, and some blood indices of growing Danube White pigs fed graded levels of Black Soldier fly (Hermetia illucens L.) larvae meal (BSFLM) at 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 g/kg of diets, in replacement of SBM for 38 days, from 119 to 157 d old. Each diet was fed to eight pigs in individual boxes following randomization. Pigs grew according to breeders' recommendations and did not have any clinical health problems. Replacing SBM did not change (p > 0.05) the pigs' growth performance and DE, as only dietary fat digestibility increased in a linear fashion (p < 0.001), possibly due to the high BSFLM, i.e., the high-fat inclusion rate. There was a simultaneous rise in some oxidative damage indicators and an increase in antioxidant status, thus suggesting that further research involving longer feeding periods is needed to identify a potential time sequence of events. Overall, BSFLM is a promising ingredient in pig nutrition.

AB  - During surgery, the use of a high -frequency electric knife produces smoke, which can be harmful to the health of indoor medical staff and patients. The quantity and particle size distribution of smoke particles produced by different tissues may vary. Understanding the release characteristics of these smoke particles is necessary to clarify their impact on the surgical environment and to seek effective smoke control methods. A previous comparative analysis of human and pig tissues revealed that they share similar water and fat compositions in certain anatomical regions. In this study, we investigated the emission characteristics of smoke particles from various tissues of pigs (skeletal muscle, liver, kidney, skin, and subcutaneous fat) under different operating powers of an electric knife. We measured the indoor particle number concentration (particle concentration), and estimated the PM2.5 mass concentration (PM2.5 concentration), particle size distribution, and emission rate of the smoke particles. The study obtained the particle emission rates of different tissues under different electric knife operating powers, results of which showed that (1) during the operation of the electric knife, mainly small particles below 1 mu m are produced. Among them, particles of 0.3 mu m were the most abundant, with a particle concentration level of up to 109 particles/m3, accounting for 85.17-97.64% of the total particle number, and as the particle size increased, the particle concentration and percentage decreased significantly. (2) The water and fat compositions of different tissues influenced the indoor particle concentration and emission rate of the smoke emitted by the electric knife. Among different tissues, subcutaneous fat tissue had the lowest particle concentration and emission rate. (3) The electric knife operating power mainly affected particles below 1 mu m, and except for kidney tissue, the indoor concentration and emission rate of these particle sizes were positively correlated with the power. The experimental results can provide data reference for the use of high -frequency electric knives in surgeries involving different human tissues in the operating room.

AB  - This study explored the initial step to develop of a potential biopesticide for controlling Nacobbus aberrans (J2) using spores of the nematophagous fungus Arthrobotrys oligospora (Ao) mixed with sterile sheep faeces. One strain of Ao (50-80) of the National Centre of Disciplinary Research in Animal Health and Innocuity (INIFAP) collection was used. The assay was performed using plastic glasses. Three experimental groups were established as follows: (1) negative Control (only N. aberrans J2) (without fungi); (2) positive control (pesticide), with 5 mL (0.131 g) of Cabofuran ((R) Furadan 350 L) per glass; (3) fungus Ao, 300,000 spores as a total amount. Treatment with Ao spores reduced the N. aberrans (J2) population by 94.7%, whereas the pesticide, reduced the population by 94.5% in relation to the control group (P <= 0.05). A mixture of sterile sheep faeces containing Ao spores reduces the population of N. aberrans, a pathogenic nematode affecting the health and production of economically important crops.

Regulatory Mechanisms in Biosystems, 14(1), 70-76. doi:10.15421/022311 The nematodoses are considered the most numerous group of cosmopolitan diseases among animal and human parasitoses. The representatives of the genus Trichuris attract special attention as pathogens of nematodoses. Their high fecundity, resistance to the influence of environmental factors and the ability to disperse create a serious ecological hazard and the risk of new outbreaks of infestation. The aim of the research was to establish the ovicidal efficiency of modern disinfectants on the embryogenesis of eggs of Trichuris skrjabini nematodes isolated from sheep. In laboratory conditions, two preparations were tested, DZPT-2 (mixture of glutaraldehyde, sodium dodecyl sulfate, essential oil) and Dixclor (mixture of sodium bisulfate, sodium chlorite, sodium percarbonate) at different concentrations and times of exposure. We established that DZPT-2 disinfectant showed a high level of ovicidal efficiency (97.5-100%) against T. skrjabini eggs at 4.5% concentration during exposure for 6-12 h and 5.0% concentration during exposure for 3-12 h. Dixclor showed a high level of ovicidal efficiency (100%) against Trichuris eggs at a concentration of 0.24% for exposures of 12 and 24 hours. Decreasing the concentration of disinfectants reduced the level of their ovicidal efficiency and led to the development of a greater number of viable eggs of T. skrjabini. Degenerative changes in the test cultures of T. skrjabini eggs caused by the tested disinfectants were characterized by the appearance and accumulation of air bubbles under the egg shell, the cessation of embryonic development at the bean-like embryo stage, loosening and resorption of the embryo inside the eggs, thinning and destruction of their shell, deformation of the eggs, and swelling of the egg plugs. Such destructive changes in eggs in experimental test cultures were also confirmed by the indicators of their morphometric parameters. Under the influence of DZPT-2 and Dixclor on the 54th day of cultivation, the length of the eggs was lower by 3.9%, and their width was greater by 4.8-5.1% compared to similar indicators in the control test culture. The obtained results allow one to recommend the tested disinfectants in defined and effective concentrations and exposures for effective control and prevention of trichurosis on livestock farms.

AB  - The Russian olive (Elaeagnus angustifolia), which functions as a "dead-end trap tree" for the Asian long-horned beetle (Anoplophora glabripennis) in mixed plantations, can successfully attract Asian long-horned beetles for oviposition and subsequently kill the eggs by gum. This study aimed to investigate gum secretion differences by comparing molecular and metabolic features across three conditions-an oviposition scar, a mechanical scar, and a healthy branch-using high-performance liquid chromatography and high-throughput RNA sequencing methods. Our findings indicated that the gum mass secreted by an oviposition scar was 1.65 times greater than that secreted by a mechanical scar. Significant differences in gene expression and metabolism were observed among the three comparison groups. A Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes annotation and enrichment analysis showed that an oviposition scar significantly affected starch and sucrose metabolism, leading to the discovery of 52 differentially expressed genes and 7 differentially accumulated metabolites. A network interaction analysis of differentially expressed metabolites and genes showed that EaSUS1, EaYfcE1, and EaPGM1 regulate sucrose, uridine diphosphate glucose, alpha-D-glucose-1P, and D-glucose-6P. Although the polysaccharide content in the OSs was 2.22 times higher than that in the MSs, the sucrose content was lower. The results indicated that the Asian long-horned beetle causes Russian olive sucrose degradation and D-glucose-6P formation. Therefore, we hypothesized that damage caused by the Asian long-horned beetle could enhance tree gum secretions through hydrolyzed sucrose and stimulate the Russian olive's specific immune response. Our study focused on the first pair of a dead-end trap tree and an invasive borer pest in forestry, potentially offering valuable insights into the ecological self-regulation of Asian long-horned beetle outbreaks.

AB  - Soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.) is a primary source of oil and vegetable protein worldwide. Cotton bollworm (CBW), Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) is a polyphagous pest on most important agricultural crops, including soybean, which tends to cause severe economic losses. To determine the most effective and significant traits responsible for soybean yield changes attributable to H. armigera damage on pods, an experiment was conducted on nine soybean cultivars from different maturity groups under natural infestation of H. armigera. The experiment was carried out at two sowing dates (15 May and 28 May) using a randomized complete block design with three replications for two years at the Research Farm of Moghan region, Ardabil Province, Iran. Insect-damage-related traits and trichome density as the factors affecting soybean tolerance against H. armigera were evaluated and data were subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA), clustering, and backward stepwise regression analyses. Based on the two-year average, 15 May showed higher biological and grain yield under both damaged and non-damaged conditions than 28 May sowing date. Kaspian cultivar due to its lower pod damage and higher grain yield, besides lower biological and grain yield reduction percentage than the other high-yielded cultivars, was recommended for the situations with high populations of H. armigera. Based on the results of backward stepwise regression for grain yield of damaged plants, trichome density of the soybean leaves and damaged pod percentage explained more than 75% of the variation in grain yield of damaged plants among the cultivars. Based on the results, leaf trichome density could be used in soybean genotype or cultivar selection for resistance against H. armigera.

AB  - Vocalization is a widespread social behavior in vertebrates that can affect fitness in the wild. Although many vocal behaviors are highly conserved, heritable features of specific vocalization types can vary both within and between species, raising the questions of why and how some vocal behaviors evolve. Here, using new computational tools to automatically detect and cluster vocalizations into distinct acoustic categories, we compare pup isolation calls across neonatal development in eight taxa of deer mice (genus Peromyscus) and compare them with laboratory mice (C57BL6/J strain) and free-living, wild house mice (Mus musculus domesticus). Whereas both Peromyscus and Mus pups produce ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs), Peromy-scus pups also produce a second call type with acoustic features, temporal rhythms, and developmental tra-jectories that are distinct from those of USVs. In deer mice, these lower frequency "cries"are predominantly emitted in postnatal days one through nine, whereas USVs are primarily made after day 9. Using playback assays, we show that cries result in a more rapid approach by Peromyscus mothers than USVs, suggesting a role for cries in eliciting parental care early in neonatal development. Using a genetic cross between two sister species of deer mice exhibiting large, innate differences in the acoustic structure of cries and USVs, we find that variation in vocalization rate, duration, and pitch displays different degrees of genetic dominance and that cry and USV features can be uncoupled in second-generation hybrids. Taken together, this work shows that vocal behavior can evolve quickly between closely related rodent species in which vocalization types, likely serving distinct functions in communication, are controlled by distinct genetic loci.

AB  - Neuromedin S (NMS) is a neuroregulatory substance and has many important roles in regulating physiological functions in animal cells, while their specific functions and mechanisms in Leydig cells (LCs) of the testis remain unclear. The current study aims to investigate the role and potential mechanisms of NMS and its receptors in regulating steroidogenesis and proliferation in goat LCs. We found that NMS and its receptors were mainly expressed in LCs of goat testes at different ages (1-day-old, 3-month-old, and 9-month-old), and the highest expressions detected at age three months. NMS addition significantly enhanced the testosterone secretion, STAR, CYP11A1, 3BHSD, and CYP17A1 expressions, cell proliferation, and PCNA expression in vitro cultured goat LCs. Mechanistically, NMS addition increased G1/S cell population, the expressions of CCND1, CDK4 and CDK6, the activities of SOD2 and CAT, and enhanced the mitochondrial fusion, the production of ATP, and mitochondrial membrane potential, while inhibited cellular ROS production, and maintained a low ubiquitination level of mitochondrial proteins. Notably, these effects of NMS addition on goat LCs were suppressed by co-treatment with NMUR2 knockdown. Therefore, these data suggest that activating NMUR2 with NMS enhances testosterone production and cell proliferation in goat LCs through modulating mitochondrial morphology, function, and autophagy. These findings may provide a novel view of the regulatory mechanisms involved in male sexual maturation.

AB  - BACKGROUNDPlant growth and development benefit from the contribution of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR), which have a positive effect on plants by breaking down organic matter and synthesizing growth hormones. In addition, PGPR can stimulate plants to produce secondary metabolites, thereby enhancing its defense against pathogens and pests. To study the effects of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens 8421 (HN11) on the promotion and induction of defense against pests in cowpea, the effects and mechanisms were determined on the basis of phenotypic traits and changes in the levels of defense enzymes and phytohormones in cowpea after application of HN11.RESULTSThe results showed that HN11 effectively colonized the cowpea root system, and at 15 days, 107 CFU mL-1 HN11 significantly improved cowpea agronomic traits and root morphology, especially promoting an increase in nodule weight (47.6%). Furthermore, when challenged by Spodoptera litura larvae, plants inoculated with HN11 exhibited significantly less damage and displayed a greater ability to recover their growth. It was found that HN11 treatment increased both defense enzyme activities and phytohormone levels in cowpea. Notably, HN11 indirectly affected the induced defense against S. litura by promoting plant growth and enhancing tolerance.CONCLUSIONSThis study opens up new avenues for biological control using PGPR, which is of far-reaching significance for enhancing crop yields, reducing chemical pesticide dependence, and preserving the ecological environment.

AB  - Lentil cultivation is often hampered by aphid population outspreads with detrimental impacts to crop development and production, challenging food safety and agriculture sustainability. The pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum) is a significant threat to lentil in the temperate zone rainfed systems. A set of management practices including resilient cultivars and application of insecticides have effectively controlled aphid infestation. However, the plant defense against insect pests is scantily dissected and limited to the individual components including antibiosis, antixenosis and tolerance that constitute a combination of plant stress responses. Utilizing a lentil germplasm collection, we assessed the antixenosis and aphid tolerance mechanisms in association to important morphological parameters. Physiological parameters including relative water content (RWC) measured at 24h and 48h post-aphid infestation revealed genotype-specific responses. The contents of key plant hormones including salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA), abscisic acid (ABA) and indoleacetic acid (IAA) implicated in defense signal-transduction pathways were also determined in lentil accessions after aphid herbivory infestation. In parallel, the expression of hallmark defense genes governed by SA- and JA-signaling pathways at 24h and 48h post aphid herbivory revealed significant differentiation patterns among the accessions. An interplay of hormone crosstalk is unveiled that possibly governs defense responses and aphid resistance. Besides the metabolomic profiling of accessions under aphid herbivory indicated the indispensable role of key secondary metabolites accumulation such as flavonoids, alkaloids, phenolics and fatty acids as a front line of plant defense and a potential integration of hormone signaling pathways in metabolome reprogramming. Overall, the study presents a panorama of distinct lentil responses to aphids and a critical view of the molecular mechanisms implicated in lentil insect defense to further our insight and advance crop protection and breeding approaches in a climate changing environment.

AB  - Cadmium (Cd) concentrations in cacao beans from Latin America often exceed limits for trading. A better understanding of the mechanisms of Cd accumulation in Theobroma cacao L. trees is necessary to advance mitigation strategies. Recent studies on a high Cd accumulating cultivar of cacao revealed that calcium oxalate (CaOx) crystals were involved in Cd accumulation in the branches. The purpose of this study was to quantify soluble and crystalline oxalate in cacao compartments, to characterize their morphology and distribution in the tissues, and to evaluate the relationship between CaOx and Cd total concentrations in each plant compartment. Two representative cultivars from Latin America (CCN-51 and Nacional) were studied. CCN-51 trees grew on soils with low and high total Cd contents (0.120 +/- 0.002 and 2.59 +/- 0.48 mg kg(-)(1), respectively), and Nacional trees grew on soils with low Cd content (0.188 +/- 0.005 mg kg(-)(1)). Oxalate was present in all organs of the two cultivars. In mature leaves, oxalate content exceeded the limit of 5% per dry weight used to define extreme oxalate accumulators. The crystalline form predominated in branches and mature leaves (82-92%), whereas the soluble form predominated in nibs (67-82%). Calcium oxalate crystal size varied from <1 mu m (generally agglomerated as crystal sand) to a few tens of mu m (faceted crystals). Log CaOx and Cd concentrations were positively correlated in branches (R-2 = 0.77, p = 0.002) and roots (R-2 = 0.71, p = 0.005), whereas in nibs, the oxalate content was almost constant among conditions. The possible roles of CaOx crystals in the cacao plant, including Ca regulation, protection against herbivory, tissue stiffening and Cd detoxification are discussed.

AB  - Climate warming is causing asynchronies between animal phenology and environments. Mismatched traits, such as coat color change mismatched with snow, can decrease survival. However, coat change does not serve a singular adaptive benefit of camouflage, and alternate coat change functions may confer advantages that supersede mismatch costs. We found that mismatch reduced, rather than increased, autumn mortality risk of snowshoe hares in Yukon by 86.5% when mismatch occurred. We suggest that the increased coat insulation and lower metabolic rates of winter-acclimatized hares confer energetic advantages to white mismatched hares that reduce their mortality risk. We found that white mismatched hares forage 17-77 min less per day than matched brown hares between 0 & DEG;C and -10 & DEG;C, thus lowering their predation risk and increasing survival. We found no effect of mismatch on spring mortality risk, during which mismatch occurred at warmer temperatures, suggesting a potential temperature limit at which the costs of conspicuousness outweigh energetic benefits.

AB  - This study hypothesized that long-term fertilization alters the pore structure and aggregate stability in upland red soil. A long-term fertilization experiment in Qiyang, Hunan, was conducted with three treatments: no fertilization (CK), nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium fertilization (NPK), and nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium combined with pig manure (NPKOM). X-ray computed tomography (CT) scanning technology was used to assess three-dimensional pore structures at both the soil column (50 mm diameter and 50 mm height) and aggregate scales (diameter 3-5 mm), alongside the evaluation of the soil's physical and chemical properties. Results showed that the soil organic carbon content (SOC) increased by 44.8% in NPK and 112.5% in NPKOM compared to CK. NPKOM improved the aggregate stability by 51.6%, whereas NPK had no significant effect. At the soil column scale, NPK increased the total porosity by 13.7% but reduced larger pores (>0.06 mm), whereas NPKOM decreased the total porosity by 7.8% and increased larger pores. At the aggregate scale, NPKOM increased the porosity for pores >0.098 mm by 7.6 times compared to CK and 9.5 times compared to NPK. In conclusion, long-term NPKOM significantly enhances the SOC and aggregate stability and promotes larger pore formation, unlike NPK, which mainly increases SOC but does not improve the soil structure.

AB  - A small isolated population of the snow sheep (Ovis nivicola Eschscholtz 1829) inhabits the Kodar Mountain Ridge, Zabaikalsky krai, Russia, being listed in the Red Data Book of Russia since 2020. The Kodar Mountain Ridge is the southwesternmost part of the modern distribution range of the snow sheep. The present study aimed at revealing the modern population structure of bighorn sheep in the Kodar Ridge using camera traps for the monitoring of two subpopulations as an example. We collected photo and video material in JulySeptember 2019 and July-September 2020, when the animals were sedentary on summer pastures. The average group size in summer was low: 2.4-3.5 (females with young) and 1.1-1.8 (males). In summer, the maximum group size was 6 (males) or 8 (females with young). Adult males and females with juveniles were slightly separated spatially in summer (not more than a few km). The fertility rate was high (about 100%). The total annual survival in the first year varied in two different study areas. In total, in all areas, the proportion of adult females amounted to about 30%, being 30% for lambs, 15% for yearlings, and 26% for males (including 6% for 6-year old or older ones). The low proportion of old males and some traces of hunting indicated that, at least until recently, the population had experienced certain poaching pressure. Because the study area on the left bank of Sredniy Sakukan River included important summer habitats of the snow sheep, it can be proposed for inclusion in the protected area of the Kodar National Park.

AB  - Despite growing concerns over mercury (Hg) accumulation in birds in recent decades, little is known about Hg exposure in nocturnal migratory birds. Here, total mercury (THg) and methylmercury (MeHg) were detected in the feathers of nocturnal migratory birds (n = 286, belonging to 46 species) passing through Mount Ailao in Southwest China. The stable isotope ratios of carbon (delta 13C) and nitrogen (delta 15N) were also determined to clarify the effects of trophic position, foraging guild, and foraging behavior on Hg bioaccumulation. Our results show that the THg and MeHg concentrations varied by two orders of magnitude among all nocturnal migratory birds investigated, with the lowest values (THg: 0.056 mg kg -1; MeHg: 0.038 mg kg -1) in the Asian koel (Eudynamys scolopaceus) and the highest (THg: 12 mg kg -1; MeHg: 7.8 mg kg -1) in the hair-crested drongo (Dicrurus hot-tentottus). Waterbirds showed higher delta 15N values and higher THg and MeHg concentrations than songbirds, and the Hg concentrations in piscivorous species were significantly higher than those in herbivores, omnivores, and insectivores. Significant effects of foraging guilds (Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA, p < 0.001) and foraging behaviors (Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA, p < 0.001) on the Hg concentrations in migratory bird feathers were detected. A risk assessment indicated that approximately 7.0% of individuals were at moderate (2.4-5.0 mg kg -1) to high (>5.0 mg kg -1) risk of Hg exposure, and were therefore vulnerable to adverse physiological and behavioral effects. A long-term monitoring campaign during the migratory period is highly recommended to better understand the bioaccumulation of Hg in these nocturnal migratory bird populations over time.

AB  - Aim of study: To enhance the viability of goat farms in Mediterranean mountain areas, studies have proposed strategies to improve the marketing of their animal products. The primary aim of this work was to provide an overview of the commercial traits and antioxidant composition of milk produced on Payoya farms. A second aim was to assess the relationships between the antioxidant capacity (TAC) and the hygiene-sanitary parameters in milk. Area of study: Sierra de Grazalema Natural Park (Southern Spain). Material and methods: The commercial traits (total solids, fat, protein, lactose, bacterial and somatic cell counts) and TAC of milk were determined monthly throughout the year. Milk samples were collected from sixteen Payoya farms under grazing-based management systems classified into three clusters (Low-productivity grazing farms; More intensive grazing farms; High-productivity grazing farms). Main results: No significant differences were found between clusters in the milk quality. Principal changes were observed in the milk composition in different months due to the variation in the lactation stage and differences in feeding regimens. The negative correlation between the TAC and the somatic cell count contributes to the important role of antioxidants in maintaining optimal udder health. Vitamin A could be involved in this antioxidant mechanism due to the positive correlation between the TAC and retinol determined in a previous study. Research highlights: The information generated on the quality of goat milk would contribute to establishing the records of the traceability system to guarantee that the animal products obtained are of the Payoya native breed.

AB  - Simple Summary Zinc is an essential mineral supplemented to human and pig diets as inorganic (inorganic salts) or organic (bound to an organic compound) sources. Some studies reported that pigs fed diets with organic zinc sources respond better to stress conditions than those fed diets with inorganic sources. In this study, we identified genes in the small intestine that may explain those differences. We fed finisher pigs with diets containing organic or inorganic zinc sources for 32 days and conducted gene expression analysis of intestinal ileum samples. The organic Zn source induced lesser level of pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 18 (IL18), but greater Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) gene expression than inorganic Zn, suggesting that an organic Zn source may improve the condition and immune response of animals under stress by modulating gene expression in the intestine. We also explored if intestinal epithelial cells, which are in direct contact with diet components, are the main cells showing these changes. We exposed intestinal organoids or epithelial "mini-guts" to zinc sources in vitro. Organoids showed changes related to Zn supplementations but did not reproduce the changes of immune-related genes observed in the animal samples, indicating cells other than epithelial are affected by Zn sources. Animals receiving Zinc (Zn) dietary supplementation with organic sources respond better to stress than inorganic Zn sources supplementation. The study aimed to identify the effect of different Zn sources on intestinal epithelial gene expression. In total, 45 pigs (9 per treatment) (77.5 & PLUSMN; 2.5 kg weight) were fed for 32 days, a corn-soybean meal diet without supplemented Zn (ZnR) or supplemented with 50 and 100 ppm of inorganic ZnCl2 (Zn50 and Zn100), and amino acid-bound organic Zn sources (LQ50 and LQ100). Gene expression changes form RNA-seq in ileum tissues of ZnR revealed changes associated with Zn insufficiency. Comparing organic with inorganic Zn sources by one-way ANOVA, pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 18 (IL18) was downregulated (p = 0.03) and Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) upregulated (p = 0.02). To determine the role of epithelial cells in response to dietary Zn, swine intestinal organoids (enteroids) were exposed to Zn restriction, ZnCl2 or LQ-Zn. In enteroids, ZIP4 expression decreased with added Zn compared with Zn-restriction (p = 0.006) but Zn sources did not affect (p > 0.05) IL18 or TLR2 expression. These results suggest that organic Zn may stimulate TLR2 signaling possibly affecting immune response, while decreasing the proinflammatory cytokine IL18 expression in non-epithelial cells of intestinal mucosa.

AB  - Even though sewage sludge (SS) contains a high level of pollutants, it is rich in essential plant nutrients and has the potential to enhance soil fertility. However, the SS must be further treated through pre-composting plus vermicomposting to make it safe for use on food crops. More research and data are needed to determine how different carbon-to-nitrogen ratios (C/N) affect the feasibility and quality of composting vs vermicomposting of SS. Therefore, in this study we comprehensively evaluated the feasibility and end-product quality of compost and vermicompost produced from SS under different C/N ratios. SS was mixed with pelletized wheat straw (PWS) at various proportions to produce C/N ratios of 6:1, 18:1, 28:1, and 38:1, then pre-composted for 14 days followed by vermicomposting using the earthworm Eisenia andrei for 120 days. Agrochemical properties were measured at 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 days. Results revealed significantly higher levels of agrochemicals in vermicompost compared to compost, including total potassium (37-88%) and magnesium (4.3-12%), nitrate nitrogen (71-98%), available potassium (53-88%), available phosphorus (79%), available magnesium (54-453%), available boron (48-303%), and available copper (2.5-82%). However, lower levels of ammonium nitrogen by (59-85%), available iron (2.3-51.3%), available manganese (29.7-52.2%), available zinc (10.5-29.8%), total carbon (0.75-4.5%), and total nitrogen (1.6-22.2%) were measured. Comparison of the various C/N ratios, showed that vermicompost with an 18:1 C/N ratio outperformed compost and demonstrated the highest earthworm population (165 pieces/kg). Thus, vermicomposting SS at an 18:1 C/N ratio is strongly recommended as a sustainable technology for producing high-quality vermicompost from SS.

AB  - Simple Summary Due to their natural origin and a wide range of positive effects on the body, herbs and spices are currently becoming commonly used as a nonantibiotic component of pig rations. There is research evidence to confirm health-promoting effects of milk thistle on humans and animals. The greatest effects are seen for the liver, i.e., protection from toxins and regeneration. The aim of the study was to determine the effect of adding milk thistle seeds on the quality of edible internal organs from the fatteners, which are used in food production as offal. We suggest that our study shows room for improvement of offal quality and may have a positive impact on consumer awareness in the context of offal consumption. The aim of the study was to determine the effect of milk thistle supplementation of fattener pig feeds on physical and chemical properties of pork offal. The experiments were conducted on 60 fatteners (group C-control (30 pigs) and group E-experimental (30 pigs)). The experimental group was supplemented with ground milk thistle (Silybum marianum) at 7 g/kg feed. The offal (tongues, kidneys, hearts, lungs and livers) was analyzed for weight, pH, WHC, water, protein, fat, energy value, fatty acid profile and content of major and trace elements. The present study shows that milk thistle added to fattener pig diets increased pH45 and pH24 values in most of the analyzed offal and significantly (p <= 0.01) decreased the weight of heart and lungs and increased the weight of liver and kidneys. Hearts, lungs and kidneys of the experimental group contained more fat and the liver less, than the same offal of the control group. As regards the content of elements, the dietary supplement most often had an effect on the heart and lungs. In general, milk thistle supplemented in fattener diets had modified the physical parameters and chemical composition of the analyzed products.

AB  - We applied a previously published livestock foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) model to estimate host connectivity using a transmission kernel based on contact tracing and measured subsequent to an animal movement ban in the 2001 United Kingdom epidemic. Connectivity within county-level farm landscapes were evaluated by considering the transmission kernel, host species composition, farm-level susceptibility, farm-level transmissibility, and distances between farms. The objectives were to (1) determine the impact of connectivity of the initially infected farm on the size of FMD outbreaks in four counties of differing connectivity; (2) compare FMD spread in counties that have different mean farm connectivity levels over all farms in the county; and (3) determine how connectivity relationships affect an example control measure. We used a spatially explicit stochastic model to simulate FMD outbreaks on livestock farm operations in four UK counties. Nine farms were selected for seeding infection, with each representing a different level of farm connectivity, measured by the sum of transmission rates between itself and all other farms. In each simulated outbreak, one farm was seeded with infection. In addition to the culling of infected premises within 24 h of being reported, as implemented in the FMD model, control of epidemic spread was implemented by culling farms within 1 and 3 km radii around infected premises. Increased levels of connectivity of the initially infected farm had a significant incremental effect on the epidemic length and the number of farms, cattle, and sheep lost. However, at higher levels of farm connectivity, these incremental effects were observed to plateau. Results showed significant variation in the level of overall farm connectivity between the counties, and counties with higher overall farm connectivity experienced increased simulated losses. Connectivity of the initially infected farm and mean connectivity among all farms in a county were strongly associated with effects of cull size, with disease control more effective at lower levels of farm connectivity. Host connectivity provides early information on the host-pathogen landscape and could be used as an assessment tool for predicting epidemic risks, as well as enabling preemptive control strategies to limit the size of disease outbreaks.

AB  - Using locally accessible organic materials as fertilizers in hydroponics can represent a sustainable alternative to the synthetic mineral fertilizers typically used. This study aimed at developing a simple bioponic method using chicken or goat manure on lettuce (Lactuca sativa var. Lucrecia) in the nutrient film technique, requiring few inputs. The first experiment compared nutrient solutions made from chicken or goat droppings and mineral fertilizers in terms of physico-chemical parameters, plant yields, and shoot mineral content. Organic solutions were produced in two main stages before being used on plants: (1) a simple manure maceration in water to produce stock solution, followed by (2) an aerobic digestion of the filtrated and diluted stock solution according to the total mineral nitrogen (TMN). The second experiment compared different concentrations of chicken manure stock solution (60, 80, 100, or 120 mg/L TMN) to a control mineral solution. In the first experiment, both organic treatments resulted in yields significantly lower than those of the control, probably due to nitrogen scarcity. In the second experiment, all organic treatments resulted in wet and dry shoot masses similar to those obtained with the inorganic control treatment. Produce quality was also improved, with lower shoot nitrate content. Important nitrogen losses occurred in the organic solutions during aerobic digestion, particularly in the goat treatment and in the highly concentrated treatments in stock solution during the 2nd experiment (similar to 50-65% TMN losses). This was probably caused by the presence of residual organic matter, which resulted in excessive microbial development. It can be concluded that chicken and goat manure are suitable fertilizers for lettuce hydroponic production using this method; however, further research should be carried out to improve mineralization during digestion steps.

AB  - Plant response to individual biotic stresses depends on its physiological state when the challenge is perceived. Optimal conditions for infestation of the spider mite Tetranychus urticae are associated with high temperatures and scarce precipitation. Here, we analyze the impact of previous interactions with the hemibiotrophic bacteria Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 or the necrotroph Dickeya dadantii 3937 on Arabidopsis thaliana plants under mite optimal conditions. Our results showed that both bacterial strains inoculated at adverse low humidity conditions induced the expression of JA-related genes in the plant even when disease symptoms are not observed. This effect was more evident when heat-inactivated bacteria were used, but a significant reduction in mite leaf damage was only detected when plants were previously inoculated with the heat-inactivated hemibiotroph bacteria. These results indicate that bacterial interaction compromises the plant response to subsequent herbivore stress, even under suboptimal conditions for bacterial multiplication.

AB  - This study presents an in vitro model using Caco-2 cells that can mimic the bioadhesion properties of the human intestinal epithelium, aiming to reduce the use of animal tissues, in line with the 3Rs principle-replacement, reduction, and refinement. Specifically, a texture analyzer was used to assess the bioadhesive strength of hydrogels (i.e., alginate (Alg), chitosan (Chit), and gelatin (Gel)) under various applied forces (20-200 mN) and contact times (120-420 s). The results demonstrate that the in vitro model effectively predicts the bioadhesive strength of the tested hydrogels to ex vivo tissues (i.e., from mice, sheep, and pigs), including the effects of applied force and contact time. Also provided is an analysis of the effect of microvilli morphology on bioadhesion where an inverse relationship was observed between microvilli linear density and bioadhesion strength, explaining the variability in results across animal models. This Caco-2-based model offers a practical, accessible, and cost-effective alternative to current ex vivo methods used for measuring bioadhesion fracture strength. It can be integrated into standardized testing protocols, providing a more ethical and scientifically robust approach to advancing bioadhesive drug delivery system research.

AB  - Simple Summary Aggressive behavior in pigs after mixing is an issue of animal welfare. This trial was conducted to evaluate the impact of the dopamine receptor (DR) D2 gene on aggressive behavior in pigs. We found that the core promoter region of the DRD2 gene is located in -2212~-1127 bp. A single-nucleotide polymorphism, rs1110730503, for the DRD2 gene is associated with aggressive behavior in pigs and influences the binding of the transcriptional factor interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 2. The transcriptional factor IRF1 upregulates the expression of the DRD2 gene; however, IRF2 downregulates the gene's expression. IRF1 and IRF2 are functionally antagonistic to each other. Aggressive behavior in pigs is impacted by the DRD2 gene and its expression. These results provide insight into the genetics and neurophysiology of aggressive behavior in pigs. Aggressive behavior has negative effects on animal welfare and growth performance in pigs. The dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) has a critical neuromodulator role in the dopamine signal pathway within the brain to control behavior. A functional single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs1110730503, in the promoter region of the porcine DRD2 gene was identified, which affects aggressive behavior in pigs. A chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was used to identify the interactions between interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) and IRF2 with the DRD2 gene. The overexpression or knockdown of these two transcription factors in porcine kidney-15 (PK15) and porcine neuronal cells (PNCs) indicate that the binding of IRF1 to DRD2 promotes the transcription of the DRD2 gene, but the binding of IRF2 to the DRD2 gene inhibits its transcription. Furthermore, IRF1 and IRF2 are functionally antagonistic to each other. The downregulation of DRD2 or upregulation of IRF2 increased the apoptosis rate of porcine neuroglial cells. Taken together, we found that transcriptional factors IRF1 and IRF2 have vital roles in regulating the transcription of the DRD2 gene, and rs1110730503 (-915A/T) is a functional SNP that influences IRF2 binding to the promoter of the DRD2 gene. These findings will provide further insight towards controlling aggressive behavior in pigs.

AB  - The highly unique zigzag-shaped stem phenotype in tea plants boasts significant ornamental value and is exceptionally rare. To investigate the genetic mechanism behind this trait, we developed BC1 artificial hybrid populations. Our genetic analysis revealed the zigzag-shaped trait as a qualitative trait. Utilizing whole-genome resequencing, we constructed a high-density genetic map from the BC1 population, incorporating 5,250 SNP markers across 15 linkage groups, covering 3,328.51 cM with an average marker interval distance of 0.68 cM. A quantitative trait locus (QTL) for the zigzag-shaped trait was identified on chromosome 4, within a 61.2 to 97.2 Mb range, accounting for a phenotypic variation explained (PVE) value of 13.62%. Within this QTL, six candidate genes were pinpointed. To better understand their roles, we analyzed gene expression in various tissues and individuals with erect and zigzag-shaped stems. The results implicated CsXTH (CSS0035625) and CsCIPK14 (CSS0044366) as potential key contributors to the zigzag-shaped stem formation. These discoveries lay a robust foundation for future functional genetic mapping and tea plant genetic enhancement.

AB  - Simple Summary Flavonoids are plant phenolic compounds whose biological activities include participation in plant responses to various stresses of biological and environmental origins, including protection against insect herbivore attack. We were interested in whether the specific flavonoids detected in soybean leaves have the potential to discourage the pea aphid from infesting other leguminous plants, peas in particular. We immersed the pea leaves in ethanolic solutions of the flavonoids apigenin, daidzein, genistein and kaempferol, offered them to the pea aphids and observed their behavior when they probed plant tissues with their piercing-sucking mouthparts. We discovered that aphids readily probed the pea leaves whether they were treated with flavonoids or not. However, later on, the behavior of the aphids changed depending on the flavonoid applied. Apigenin, daidzein and kaempferol caused a decrease in the intensity of plant sap ingestion. In addition, daidzein and kaempferol made the finding of sap-transporting vessels more difficult for aphids. In contrast, genistein did not affect the pea aphids' feeding activity. Our findings provide the plant breeders and plant protection services with information on what direction their efforts should take to protect leguminous plants against aphids in a sustainable and environmentally friendly way. Flavonoids detected in soybean Glycine max (L.) Merr. (Fabaceae) cause various alterations in the metabolism, behavior, and development of insect herbivores. The pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) poses potential threat to soybeans, but the effect of individual flavonoids on its feeding-associated behavior is relatively unknown. We monitored probing behavior (stylet penetration activities) of A. pisum on its preferred host plant, Pisum sativum L. untreated (control) and treated with 0.1% ethanolic solutions of flavonoids apigenin, daidzein, genistein, and kaempferol. We applied the electrical penetration graph (electropenetrography, EPG) technique, which visualizes the movements of aphid stylets within plant tissues. None of the applied flavonoids affected the propensity to probe the plants by A. pisum. However, apigenin enhanced the duration of probes in non-phloem tissues, which caused an increase in the frequency and duration of stylet mechanics derailment and xylem sap ingestion but limited the ingestion of phloem sap. Daidzein caused a delay in reaching phloem vessels and limited sap ingestion. Kaempferol caused a reduction in the frequency and duration of the phloem phase. Genistein did not affect aphid probing behavior. Our findings provide information for selective breeding programs of resistant plant cultivars to A. pisum.

AB  - Migratory birds may have a vital role in the spread of antimicrobial resistance across habitats and regions, but empirical data remain scarce. We investigated differences in the gut microbiome composition and the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in faeces from four migratory waterbirds wintering in South-West Spain that differ in their habitat use. The white stork Ciconia ciconia and lesser black-backed gull Carus Justus are omnivorous and opportunistic birds that use highly anthropogenic habitats such as landfills and urban areas. The greylag goose Anser anser and common crane Grus grus are herbivores and use more natural habitats. Fresh faeces from 15 individuals of each species were analysed to assess the composition of bacterial communities using 16S rRNA amplicon-targeted sequencing, and to quantify the abundance of the Class I integron integrase gene (intl1) as well as genes encoding resistance to sulfonamides (sul1), beta-lactams (bla(TEM), bla(KPC). and bla(NDM)), tetracyclines (tetW), fluoroquinolones (qnrS), and colistin (mcr-1) using qPCR. Bacterial communities in gull faeces were the richest and most diverse. Beta diversity analysis showed segregation in faecal communities between bird spedes, but those from storks and gulls were the most similar, these being the species that regularly feed in landfills. Potential bacterial pathogens identified in faeces differed significantly between bird species, with higher relative abundance in gulls. Faeces from birds that feed in landfills (stork and gull) contained a significantly higher abundance of ARGs (sul1, bla(TEM), and tetW). Genes conferring resistance to last resort antibiotics such as carbapenems (bla(KPC)) and colistin (mcr-1) were only observed in faeces from gulls. These results show that these bird species are reservoirs of antimicrobial resistant bacteria and suggest that waterbirds may disseminate antibiotic resistance across environments (e.g., from landfills to ricefields or water supplies), and thus constitute a risk for their further spread to wildlife and humans.

AB  - The white-lipped peccary (WLP; Tayassu pecari) and the collared peccary (CP; Pecari tajacu) are social ungulates of huge ecological and economic importance. We determined the habitat occupancy for peccaries in a rural community bordering the Calakmul Biosphere Reserve in Campeche, Mexico. Twenty-eight stratified sampling points were randomly placed in the study area during a rainy and a dry season, where the presence of both peccary species was measured in relation to three ecological variables (habitat type, presence of natural predators, and water availability) and one anthropogenic variable (hunting). Ten sampling points were established with camera traps (total days/camera traps = 2268), and 18 sampling points were plots of 20 m(2) to detect feces and/or footprints. To assess the relationship between both species' presence and the selected variables, models of habitat occupancy were constructed using a binary matrix of detection/non-detection using the PRESENCE program. For WLP and CP, the respective estimated occupancy probabilities were 30 and 40% in the rainy season and 88 and 44% in the dry season. Our results suggest that occupancy by WLP is affected by habitat type and predators in the rainy season and by water availability and hunting in the dry season. Conversely, for CP, occupancy is affected by water availability and hunting in the rainy season, and by habitat type and predators in the dry season. Thus, hunting negatively affects the way that WLP occupy specific habitats, such as floodplain forest and medium sub-deciduous forest, particularly during periods of water scarcity when the species is more vulnerable to hunting.

AB  - Manure from pig farming has an agronomic value and it is often used for fertilization. However, as manure has unbalanced amounts of nutrients such as N and C, it contributes to increased emissions of N2O to the atmosphere. This study evaluated N2O emissions in soil with treated with pig slurry (PS) and swine manure compost (SMC). The study was conducted from 2018 to 2019 in an experiment, in southern Brazil. The system was minimal tillage with black oat and corn. The treatments were control, swine manure compost + mineral fertilization (SMC + MF) and pig slurry + mineral fertilization (PS + MF). The measurements of N2O fluxes were carried out throughout the crop cycle with static chambers. Cumulative emission values, as well as crop yield and emission values per ton produced were compared with one another by the LSD test (p < 0.05). In general, the largest fluxes of N2O were found in soil fertilized with PS + MF. There were intense emission peaks after PS application. Cumulative annual emissions of N2O differed among treatments. Values ranged from 0.62 to 3.15 kg ha(-1) N2O-N in control and PS + MF soil, respectively, representing a relative increase of 508%. The soil with SMC + MF showed a similar behavior to the control, with a cumulative annual emission of 0.65 kg ha(-1) N2O-N. The soil with SMC helped to significantly reduce N2O emissions in 4.8 times compared to the one with PS. This result highlights the use of compost as an alternative strategy to slurry to reduce N2O emissions.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Due to climate change and pests as result of maize monoculture, the need of diversification of crop rotation forces researchers to look for alternative grains for animal nutrition. Furthermore, grain fermentation may increase the nutritional value of feed and, simultaneously, decrease costs of feed conservation because the necessity for grain drying and associated energy costs are reduced. In this context, the cultivation and integration of early harvested and fermented sorghum grain in pig diets might be an interesting strategy for the substitution of maize. Therefore, we tested the nutritional value of three varieties of fermented sorghum grains with gradual differences in total dry matter, in a Latin-Square experiment comprising growing pigs. Results indicated there is a potential for improving the nutrient digestibility of sorghum-based pig diets by using early harvested and fermented whole sorghum grain with lower dry matter concentration. Especially the need for inorganic phosphorus supplementation and, hence, the fecal phosphorus emissions were significantly reduced.
   This study investigated the effects of sorghum ensiled as whole grains with different dry matter concentrations on the apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of energy, crude nutrients and minerals in growing pigs. Whole grain sorghum batches with varying dry matter (DM) concentrations of 701 (S1), 738 (S2) and 809 g kg(-1) (S3) due to different dates of harvest from the same arable plot, were stored in air-tight kegs (6 L) for 6 months to ensure complete fermentation. Subsequently, 9 crossbred barrows (34.6 +/- 1.8 kg; (Duroc x Landrace) x Pietrain)) were used in a 3 x 3 Latin square feeding experiment. Diets were based on the respective sorghum grain silage and were supplemented with additional amino acids, minerals and vitamins to meet or exceed published feeding recommendations for growing pigs. The ATTD of gross energy, dry matter, organic matter, nitrogen-free extracts, and crude ash were higher in S1 compared to S3 treatments (p <= 0.05), while S2 was intermediate. Pigs fed S1 showed significantly higher ATTD of phosphorus (P) compared to all other groups while ATTD of calcium was unaffected irrespective of the feeding regime. In conclusion, growing pigs used whole grain sorghum fermented with a DM concentration of 701 g kg(-1) (S1) most efficiently. In particular, the addition of inorganic P could have been reduced by 0.39 g kg(-1) DM when using this silage compared to the variant with the highest DM value (809 g kg(-1)).

AB  - Simple Summary Litter size is an important trait affecting reproductive capacity and breeding economics in meat sheep. Consequently, revealing its molecular mechanism helps us understand multiple lambs from the genetic perspective. In this study, we provide a genome-wide expression profile of circular RNAs (circRNAs) expression in Hanper sheep, which is a new breed of meat sheep raised by cross and self-group breeding for 15 years. In this study, ovarian circular RNAs and miRNAs associated with high and low fertility Hanper sheep are identified during the follicular and luteal phases of the estrous cycle, and their potential biological functions are predicted through Gene Ontology (GO), KEGG, GSEA, STEM, WGCNA analysis. Litter size is a considerable quality that determines the production efficiency of mutton sheep. Therefore, revealing the molecular regulation of high and low fertility may aid the breeding process to develop new varieties of mutton sheep. CircRNAs are the important factors regulating follicular development, but their mechanism role in the regulation of litter size in Hanper sheep is not clear. In the present study, ovarian tissues from the follicular (F) or luteal phase (L) of Hanper sheep that were either consecutive monotocous (M) or polytocous were collected. Then, we performed transcriptome sequencing to screen for differentially expressed circRNAs (DE-circRNAs) and elucidate their function. In total, 4256 circRNA derived from 2184 host genes were identified in which 183 (146 were upregulated, while 37 were downregulated) were differentially expressed in monotocous sheep in the follicular phase versus polytocous sheep in the follicular phase (MF vs. PF). Moreover, 34 circRNAs (14 were upregulated, while 20 were downregulated) were differentially expressed in monotocous sheep in the luteal phase versus polytocous sheep in the luteal sheep (ML vs. PL). This was achieved through DE-circRNAs function enrichment annotation analysis by GESA, GO, and KEGG, which function through the EGF-EGFR-RAS-JNK, TGF-beta and thyroid hormone signaling pathway to affect the litter size of Hanper sheep in MF vs. PF and ML vs. PL. STEM results showed that MAPK signaling pathways play a key role in MF vs. PF and ML vs. PL. Through WGCNA analysis, AKT3 was a core gene in MF vs. PF and ML vs. PL. Moreover, competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network analysis revealed the target binding sites for miRNA such as oar-miR-27a, oar-miR-16b, oar-miR-200a/b/c, oar-miR-181a, oar-miR-10a/b, and oar-miR-432 in the identified DE-cirRNAs.

AB  - Simple Summary Modern pig production seeks to achieve favorable growth results while paying close attention to animal welfare and the quality of the pork, as well as maximizing the use of feed grown on the farm. Sustainability farming can be a production system that meets these tasks. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of high shares of different grain types (barley, rye, or triticale) in the diet of growing-finishing pigs on growth performance, carcass characteristics, meat quality, and fatty acid profile in meat and fat. The 100-day experiment involved 72 pigs assigned into three groups differing in the main base component of the feed mixture: I-barley, II-triticale, III-rye. The obtained results showed quite differentiated influence of the kind of grain as a base in feeding on the production results and meat quality. The use of triticale or barley may provide better growth efficiency of pigs, better nutrient digestibility, and more beneficial fatty acids profile in respect of the health-promoting value of meat, when compared with feeding pigs with rye. Meat of pigs fed with high rye shared feed mixture characterized of lower cholesterol content, better water holding capacity, and higher saturated fatty acids profile, wherein the later one indicated better resistance to oxidation during storage and longer meat shelf life. The rye may be more beneficial for the production of long-matured or traditional meat products. The effect of high level of barley, triticale, or rye as base of complete mixtures for growing-finishing pigs on growth performance, carcass traits, meat quality, and fatty acid profile in meat and backfat was investigated. The 100-day experiment involved 72 pigs, assigned into three groups (24 animals each). Pigs of each group were kept in six pens (two gilts and two barrows per pen). Diets offered to pigs differed in the proportion of cereals as the leading ingredients in the mixture formulation: I-barley, II-triticale, III-rye. The results showed diversified grain influence on the production results and meat quality. Triticale- and barley-based diets ensured better weight gain and lower carcass fatness than rye (p <= 0.05). The basic nutrients digestibility of mixtures containing triticale was comparable to that containing barley and higher than that of rye (p <= 0.05). The meat and backfat of pigs receiving diet with triticale or barley was characterized by more favorable fatty acids profile in respect to the health-promoting indicators (atherogenicity and thrombogenicity indexes; hypocholesterolemic/hypercholesterolemic ratio). The cholesterol level in various tissues was the lowest in pigs fed with rye diet, and their meat characterized by better water holding capacity and more SFA. Higher fat saturation indicate better resistance to oxidation during storage and longer meat shelf life. It seems that the supplementation of triticale to diet may improve the growth efficiency of pigs and the health-promoting value of meat, while the supplementation of rye may be better for the production of traditional or long-matured meat products.

AB  - The rarity of isolated sphenoid sinus disease (ISSD) and the specificity of pediatric populations meant that a separate analysis was required in this study. This study aimed to present and discuss the results of an analysis of clinical manifestations, radiological findings and surgical methods based on a large series of exclusively pediatric patients. The study group covered 28 surgically treated children (aged 5.5-17.5 years). The medical data were retrospectively analyzed and meticulously discussed with regards to presenting signs and symptoms, radiographic findings, surgical approaches, complications, post-op care, histopathological results and follow-ups. The dominant symptom was a persistent headache (78%). Four children presented visual symptoms, diplopia in two cases, visual acuity disturbances in one case and both of these symptoms in one patient. Sixteen children presented chronic isolated rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps, six suffered from mucocele and one presented chronic sphenoiditis with sphenochoanal polyp. Four patients turned out to exhibit neoplastic lesions and developmental bony abnormality was diagnosed in one case. No fungal etiology was revealed. The transnasal approach was used in 86% of patients. A transseptal approach with concurrent septoplasty was used in four patients. The patient with visual acuity disturbances completely recovered after the surgery. All children with visual symptoms reported improvement in the vision immediately after surgery. No postoperative complications were observed. Fungal etiology was extremely rare in the pediatric population with ISSD. The surgical treatment should be a minimally invasive procedure regarding a limited range of the pathology in ISSD. Emergency surgery should be performed if ISSD produces any visual loss.

AB  - Cultivation altitude is a comprehensive environmental factor that significantly affects tea quality. To gain a deeper understanding of the effect of cultivation altitude on tea metabolites, a widely targeted metabolomic method based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) was used to analyze tea samples derived from three altitudes (86 m, 256 m, and 880 m) of two cultivars, 'Mingke 1' (MK) and 'Fuyun 6' (FY). The results showed that distinct groups of tea samples from different altitudes and cultivars were observed based on PCA. A total of 64 and 56 altitude-related differential metabolites were identified in MK and FY, respectively. Among them, 16 compounds were consistent in both cultivars and were clustered in the metabolic pathways for flavonoid (11 compounds), amino acid (3), and fatty acid (2). The content of all flavonoids and one amino acid (L-aspartic acid) gradually decreased with increasing altitude; on the contrary, the others showed an opposite trend. Furthermore, we identified 57 differential metabolites between two cultivars. Two specific compounds (8-C-hexosyl chrysoeriol O-hexoside and pelargonidin 3-O-beta-D-glucoside) were exclusively found in MK, while one compound (4-hydroxybenzoic acid) was present only in FY. These findings offer insight into the metabolic responses of tea plants to different altitudes, providing further understanding on the influence of the environment on tea plants.

AB  - This study was conducted to determine temperament and maternal care classes, CYP17 gene polymor-phisms, and cortisol status of a group of Norduz ewes. Additionally, the relationships between these fac-tors, their effects on lambs survival and growth characteristics were investigated. A total of 72 ewes were subjected to arena and isolation box tests to determine their temperament classes. The distance the ewe retreated from the lamb during tagging was utilized to assess ewe maternal care classes. Ewes were genotyped for CYP17 628 SNP. Blood samples were collected between lambing and weaning to measure cortisol concentrations of ewes. The survival and growth data for the lambs of these ewes were recorded until weaning. Two temperament (low reactive and high reactive) and 2 maternal care classes (strong and moderate) were present. Two CYP 17 SNP 628 alleles (A and G) and 3 genotypes (AA, AG, and GG) were identified. For the distribution of CYP17 genotype frequencies within the population, the temperament or maternal care classes were not different (P > 0.05). The temperament of ewes did not affect mater-nal care in our flock. Positive partial correlations between cortisol and total cross, distance to stimulus, and sniffing were determined (P < 0.05). CYP17 genotype was an effective factor for some behavioral traits (i.e., total cross) and cortisol release (P < 0.001). Neither temperament (P = 0.636) nor maternal care classes (P = 0.985) differed with cortisol concentrations. CYP17 genotype, cortisol status, tempera-ment or maternal care class of ewes did not affect birth or weaning weight of their lambs (P > 0.05). Although there was no significant relationship among CYP17 genotype, maternal care, and lamb survival and growth, the effect of CYP17 genotype on some behavioral traits and cortisol release was found to be significant. Further studies with larger animal populations are required to elucidate the possible use of CYP17 SNP 628 genotypes as genetic markers for temperament classification. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The illegal poaching of lions for their body parts poses a severe threat to lion populations across Africa. Poaching accounts for 35% of all human-caused lion deaths, with 51% attributed to retaliatory killings following livestock predation. In nearly half of the retaliatory killings, lion body parts are removed, suggesting that high demand for lion body parts may fuel killings attributed to human-lion conflict. Trafficked items are often confiscated in transit or destination countries far from their country of origin. DNA from lion parts may in some cases be the only available means for examining their geographic origins. In this paper, we present the Lion Localizer, a full-stack software tool that houses a comprehensive database of lion mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences sourced from previously published studies. The database covers 146 localities from across the African continent and India, providing information on the potential provenance of seized lion body parts. Lion mtDNA sequences of 350 or 1,140 bp corresponding to the cytochrome b region can be generated from lion products and queried against the Lion Localizer database. Using the query sequence, the Lion Localizer generates a listing of exact or partial matches, which are displayed on an interactive map of Africa. This allows for the rapid identification of potential regions and localities where lions have been or are presently being targeted by poachers. By examining the potential provenance of lion samples, the Lion Localizer serves as a valuable resource in the fight against lion poaching. The software is available at https://lionlocalizer.org.

AB  - The safety and quality of animal feed are often unknown concerning the content of fungi and mycotoxins. Animal feed may be infested with fungi, leading to contamination with mycotoxins, which pose a potential risk to human and animal health. Currently, the feeding of pigs is mainly based on cereals and soy as protein components. In order to reduce the cost of feed production, other protein sources are used in addition to soy. To assess the health of pig feeds containing guar meal in their composition, a study was conducted to evaluate the presence of toxigenic fungi (culture and qPCR method) and mycotoxins (HPLC). Eight complete feeds produced on the farm containing locally produced feed materials including soybean meal and guar meal as protein components were investigated. The results of the mycobiome analysis showed that the tested feed mixtures were characterised by a high diversity of fungi, with saprophytic species clearly dominating. The qPCR analysis confirmed the presence of Fusarium and P. verrucosum fungi in the mixtures. Chemical tests of mycotoxin content confirmed the presence of Fusarium mycotoxins: DON, 3-AcDON, ZEA, T2 and OTA. Barley grain and guar meal were responsible for the contamination of the feed with the toxins DON, 3-AcDON, ZEA and OTA, while in the case of the T2 toxins, wheat grain and to a lesser extent the premix were responsible. The above correlations were confirmed by a correlation analysis that took into account the different levels of the feed components. Overall, it should be emphasised that the feeds were contaminated with mycotoxins to a low degree, which confirms their high quality. The storage conditions favoured the development of saprotrophic mycoflora and prevented the development of toxigenic species.

AB  - In this study, we report the first identification of Paraconiothyrium brasiliense and Querciphoma minuta causing stem cankers on previously unreported tree host species. P. brasiliense and Q. minuta were isolated for the first time from Carpinus betulus, Fagus sylvatica, and Aesculus hippocastanum. Additionally, P. brasiliense was newly isolated from Ulmus spp. and Platanus x hispanica, while Q. minuta was also found for the first time on Acer platanoides. These trees originate from different cities in Germany, located in different geographical regions. Fungal isolates were initially grouped by morphotyping based on visually recognizable culture characteristics. The taxonomy of these fungi was verified by sequencing with multiple primers, including ITSu1/4, and LSU/LR6. The pathogenicity of each fungus was confirmed using Koch's postulates on the corresponding host trees. P. brasiliense and Q. minuta are opportunistic pathogens on several plant species, but this is the first report of their pathogenic activity on the corresponding urban trees, confirmed through stem inoculations with fungal agar plugs. This report indicates the emergence of fungal pathogens causing stem necrosis on tree hosts that have not previously been reported.

AB  - Epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate (EGCG) is an important ingredient that indicates tea quality and has healthcare functions. Magnesium nutrition can improve the quality and yield of tea plants, but its regulatory role in the biosynthesis of EGCG in tea plants has not been clarified. Herein, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the metabolomics and transcriptomics of the shoots of 'Huangdan' at five magnesium concentrations: L1-L5 (0, 0.15, 0.45, 0.6, and 0.9 mmol/L mg2+, respectively). The results showed that the EGCG content of tea shoots treated with low magnesium concentrations was higher compared to those treated with high magnesium concentrations. The contents of related metabolites such as p-coumaric acid and cyanide in the EGCG synthesis pathway increased in the L4 and L5 treatment groups, while those of dihydroquercetin, dinnamic acid, and epicatechin increased significantly in the L2 and L3 treatment groups. Under the influence of magnesium treatment, the biosynthesis of EGCG was affected by a series of structural genes: CsPAL (HD.01G0005520), HD.02G0024350), Cs4CL (HD.15G0008250, HD.13G0010220), CsDFR (HD.04G0026220), CsANS(HD.12G0016700) with CsaroDE (HD.03G0002480)-positive regulation, and CsPAL (HD.13G0009900, HD.06G0008610), CsC4H (HD.06G0017130), Cs4CL (HD.02G0027390, HD.04G0003270), CsCHS (HD.10G0022640), CsCHI (HD.01G0011100), CsF3 ' H (HD.15G0015490), CsF3 ' 5 ' H (HD.13G0004300), CsANS (HD.07G0023630), and Csaro B (HD.01G0028400) with CsSCPL (HD.01G0041070)-negative regulation. Transcription factors MYB 44 and WRKY 17 may play a key role in EGCG biosynthesis, which is significantly induced by magnesium nutrition in tea tree shoots. This study elucidates the effect of magnesium nutrition on EGCG biosynthesis in tea plants and provides key candidate transcription factors to provide a reference for further research on high-EGCG tea varieties to improve tea quality.

AB  - Total mixed ration silage has been used as a strategy to optimize the use of dry and wet feed in ruminant feeding. Another promising technique is silage reallocation, which allows producers to divide the ensiled material in large silos into smaller units that can be easily transported and marketed. Thus, this study aimed to improve food preservation through the development of total mixed rations (TMRs) based on relocated sorghum silage (RSS) and cactus pear for sheep diets. A completely randomized design was used with five treatments (0, 15, 25, 30, and 35% RSS inclusion on a dry matter basis) and five replicates. Ninety days after ensiling, the silos were opened. The fermentation characteristics, nutritional aspects, aerobic stability, and microbial populations of TMR silages were evaluated. The inclusion of RSS showed a quadratic effect on pH, density, permeability, lactic acid bacteria and yeast counts, and total carbohydrates (p < 0.05). It reduced gas and effluent losses, porosity, ammonia nitrogen, buffer capacity, ash, crude protein, ether extract, and non-fibrous carbohydrates (p < 0.05) while increasing dry matter, neutral and acid detergent fiber, hemicellulose, and cellulose contents (p < 0.05). There was an interaction effect between the levels of RSS inclusion and exposure times to air on CO2 and dry matter content (p < 0.05). Regarding carbohydrate fractionation, there was a reduction in fraction A + B1 (non-fibrous carbohydrates) and an increase in fractions B2 (fibrous carbohydrates from the cell wall and of slow ruminal availability, susceptible to the effects of the passage rate) and C (indigestible neutral detergent fiber) (p < 0.05). For protein fractionation, a quadratic effect was observed for fractions A (non-protein nitrogen) and C (insoluble protein, indigestible in the rumen and intestine), an increase in fraction B1 (soluble protein rapidly degraded in the rumen) + B2 (insoluble protein with intermediate degradation rate in the rumen), and a reduction in fraction B3 (insoluble protein with slow degradation rate in the rumen) (p < 0.05) as RSS levels increased. Under the experimental conditions, it is recommended to include up to 30% RSS in the total mixed ration silage to improve microbiological characteristics, reduce gas and effluent losses, and increase dry matter recovery and nutritional aspects of silage when associated with cactus pear.

AB  - The present paper describes the effect of glycyrrhizic acid contained in licorice roots on the quality of pork produced. The study uses advanced research methods as ion-exchange chromatography, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, drying of an average sample of muscle, and pressing method. The paper set out to investigate the effect of glycyrrhizic acid on the pig meat quality after deworming. Of particular concern is the animal body restoration after deworming that results in metabolic disorders. The nutrient content of meat reduces, the output of bones and tendons rises. This is the first report on the use of glycyrrhizic acid to increase the meat quality of pigs after deworming. The findings from this study indicated higher pork quality resulted from a favorable effect of GA on the chemical and amino acid composition of meat. The resulting data demonstrated that glycyrrhizic acid in the piglets' diet had a beneficial effect on the biochemical processes in their body. The main scientific provisions of this paper and its findings have several practical implications for veterinary specialists. They can also be recommended for the educational process. Another possible implication is the development of new drugs, methods, and treatment plans.

AB  - Social insects live in closely related family groups but face risks of intrusion and infection by pathogenic and parasitic microbes. To cope with the microbes invading their nests and feeding sites, social insects produce various types of antimicrobial substances. Subterranean termites occupy microbe-rich decaying wood and soil at high density, expanding their nest area by exploring and feeding on wood outward from the royal chamber (room for kings and queens). Although antimicrobial agents have been identified in many termite species, few studies have investigated those used by foraging workers in decaying wood under development, which is richer in microbes than the well-sterilized royal chamber and its surroundings. Here, we report that phenylacetic acid, an antifungal aromatic compound, is secreted by foraging workers of the Japanese subterranean termite Reticulitermes speratus. The compound was detected by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of ethyl acetate extracts of shelter papers infested with the workers, and antimicrobial tests demonstrated that it inhibits the germination and/or mycelial growth of the entomopathogenic fungi (Metarhizium anisopliae and Beauveria bassiana) and the termite egg-mimicking fungus Athelia termitophila. Our study provides new insights into the antimicrobial defense mechanisms of termites, including by combining different types of antimicrobial substances secreted by different castes, and thus the survival strategy of entomopathogenic and parasitic fungi in termite nests.

AB  - Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a transmissible and fatal prion disease that affects cervids. While both oral and nasal routes of exposure to prions cause disease, the spatial and temporal details of how prions enter the central nervous system (CNS) are unknown. Carotid bodies (CBs) are structures that are exposed to blood-borne prions and are densely innervated by nerves that are directly connected to brainstem nuclei, known to be early sites of prion neuroinvasion. All CBs examined contained mast cells expressing the prion protein which is consistent with these cells playing a role in neuroinvasion following prionemia.

AB  - Field experiments have demonstrated that wheat mixtures differ in their ability to regulate aphid populations. To further investigate the effectiveness of wheat mixtures (Triticum aestivum and Triticum turgidum) in controlling aphids, we conducted both laboratory and greenhouse experiments. Specifically, we assessed the associational resistance of two wheat mixtures (Florence-Aurora with Forment, Florence-Aurora with Montcada), and their respective monocultures, in different stages of the aphid host selection process. We analysed aphid acceptance rate, population growth, and load under different wheat treatments. Additionally, we characterised wheat aboveground biomass and nitrogen content as important functional traits for aphid resistant. Aphid acceptance decreased in plants of cv. Forment when exposed to volatiles from undamaged Florence-Aurora plants, whereas the other tested combinations tested had no effect. Aphids performed differently in the two mixtures: Florence-Aurora mixed with Forment significantly reduced aphid population growth and load compared to the monocultures, whereas the combination of Florence-Aurora with Montcada wheat had no effect on aphid performance. The plant-plant interactions also modified the analysed traits. Nitrogen content of Florence-Aurora wheat plants was reduced when mixed with Forment wheat, which may explain the lower aphid load observed in plants of cv. Florence-Aurora when mixed with plants of cv. Forment. However, mixing wheats with similar aboveground biomass resulted in an increase in the average biomass of plants of both cultivars which could have led to a higher aphid population. The data supports the idea of right neighbour, as the benefits of wheat mixtures for aphid control were determined by the identity of the combined plants (or species). Finally, our results suggest that associating wheats with different traits may promote facilitative interactions, which in turn enhances associational resistance, whereas the combination of wheats with similar traits may result in competitive interactions that may hinder aphid control benefits.

AB  - The evaluation of wild boar density in a hunting district can be performed by accurate drive counts of boars within the drive areas assigned to each hunting team. Because a complete driving of all the areas is prohibitive, only a subset is driven in a hunting occasion. Results are highly dependent on the subjective choice of these areas. In this study, an objective design-based approach is considered in which areas to be driven are randomly selected one per team in accordance with the one-per-stratum sampling scheme. Because the areas assigned to hunting teams are likely to be close to each other, the one-per-stratum sampling is likely to achieve samples of evenly spread areas. Then, the subsequent step is to choose the selection criterion for the areas and the estimation criterion for exploiting or not the information provided by area sizes. To this purpose, three sampling strategies are considered, together with methods to estimate their precision. These strategies are checked and compared by means of a simulation study performed on artificial populations constructed from the list of drive areas settled in the Province of Massa-Carrara (Italy) and partitioned among 39 hunting teams. Results from artificial populations give clear insights about the most suitable strategy to be used. Drive counts performed in this province in two hunting occasions during 2019 within 39 areas selected by one-per-stratum sampling are adopted as case studies.

AB  - Simple Summary In order to manage important transformations affecting a steppe area, it is necessary to analyze the existing pastoral system by evaluating the sustainability of its subsystems of production. For this reason, in this study, a tool for the evaluation of the sustainability of livestock production in a steppe area was used to identify the most sustainable systems among the various ways that livestock are managed and produced. The study was conducted in the region ranked first in terms of sheep production. Using a grid for evaluating the sustainability of livestock systems in steppe regions, the impact of each system on the environment (environmental, economic, and social) was examined, and the results showed that the feed system was unbalanced, with high pressure on steppe rangelands. Nevertheless, multiple ways of improving these systems emerged from the analysis, such as encouraging the production of fodder and its association with livestock on new spatial, temporal, regional, and national levels. In order to manage important transformations affecting a steppe area, it is necessary to analyze the existing pastoral system by evaluating the sustainability of its subsystems of production. For this reason, in this study, a tool for the evaluation of the sustainability of livestock production in the steppe area was used in order to identify the most sustainable systems. The study was conducted using a survey of 87 livestock farmers (production units) in the region ranked first in terms of sheep production. Principal component analysis (PCA) enabled us to identify two production systems: (i) the pastoral production system, characterized by the mobility of livestock and its high dependence on concentrated feed; (ii) the agropastoral system, combining fodder and livestock production, which is sedentary and semi-extensive. Using a grid for evaluating the sustainability of livestock systems in steppe regions, the impact of each system on the environment (environmental, economic, and social) was examined, and the results showed that the feed system was unbalanced, with high pressure on steppe rangelands.

AB  - Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze var. assamica (Miang tea) is widely distributed in northern Thailand due to its traditional and industrial attributes, including black tea and Miang production. In this study, two Pestalotioid taxa associated with C. sinensis leaf spots were collected in Mae Taeng district, Chiang Mai Province, Thailand. Species delineation was based on the evidence from morphological and multi-locus phylogenies using ITS, tub2 and tef1-alpha . Neopestalotiopsis saprophytica is herein reported as a new record on Camellia sinensis , while Pseudopestalotiopsis chinensis is recorded as a new geographical record from Thailand. The findings of this research have the potential to offer fresh insights into the two previously documented species within the existing fungal community associated with C. sinensis in Thailand. This, in turn, could enhance our comprehension of their interactions with the host plant in the times ahead.

AB  - In the aim to reach low or net zero emissions energy systems by 2050, the transition toward more sustainable energy carriers seems crucial. H-2 is gradually gaining attention as a promising alternative solution for future energy supply. The main purpose of this study is to investigate the sustainability of H-2 generated from sheep tallow. To this end, a combination of life cycle assessment and Emergy analysis was applied. Different impact categories, following ReCiPe method, cumulative energy demand were calculated for the evaluation of the system environmental performances. Emergy comprehensively evaluated H-2 production sustainability, through a set of indicators such as transformity, environmental loading ratio, percentage of renewability, Emergy yield ratio, Emergy investment ratio and Emergy sustainability index. The life cycle assessment results show that the thermal energy is the main contributor to the selected environmental impact categories. The net energy ratio of the system is approximately 2.5. Therefore, the H-2 system presents a net energy gain. Emergy indices indicate that H-2 transformity is higher than that of many other energy carriers. Also, the environmental loading ratio calculated is 17.26, indicating that the activities of the process increase the pressure on the environment. The environmental sustainability index is estimated to be 0.06 which shows that the investigated system is unsustainable from an emergetic point of view.

AB  - The floral microbiome is of significant relevance to plant reproduction and crop productivity. While plant genotype is key to floral microbiome assembly, whether and how genotypic variation in floral traits and plant-level mutualistic and antagonistic interactions at the rhizosphere and phyllosphere influence the microbiome in the anthosphere remain little known. Using a factorial field experiment that manipulated biotic interactions belowground (mycorrhizae treatments) and aboveground (herbivory treatments) in three strawberry genotypes, we assessed how genotypic variation in flower abundance and size and plant-level biotic interactions influence the bidirectional relationships between floral volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and the floral microbiome using structural equation modeling. We found that plant genotype played a stronger role, overall, in shaping the floral microbiome than biotic interactions with mycorrhizae and herbivores. Genotypic variation in flower abundance and size influenced the emission of floral VOCs, especially terpenes (e.g. alpha- and beta-pinene, ocimene isomers) and benzenoids (e.g. p-anisaldehyde, benzaldehyde), which in turn affected floral bacterial and fungal communities. While the effects of biotic interactions on floral traits including VOCs were weak, mycorrhizae treatments (mycorrhizae and herbivory mycorrhizae) affected the fungal community composition in flowers. These findings improve our understanding of the mechanisms by which plant genotype influences floral microbiome assembly and provide the first evidence that biotic interactions in the rhizosphere and phyllosphere can influence the floral microbiome, and offer important insights into agricultural microbiomes.

AB  - Simple Summary: Dietary cellulase was found to be an important nutrient, and solid-state fermentation could improve the nutritional value of feed. To study the effects of multi-bacteria solid-state fermented diets and dietary crude fiber levels on finishing pigs, a total of 36 pigs were divided into four treatments: (1) pigs fed a basal diet containing 7.00% CF (HF), (2) pigs fed a basal multi-bacteria fermentation diet containing 7.00% CF (HFM), (3) pigs fed a basal diet containing 2.52% CF (LF), and (4) piglets fed a basal multi-bacteria fermentation diet containing 2.52% CF (LFM). The growth performance, nutrient digestibility and digestion amount, serum biochemical index, and fecal microflora were evaluated. Multi-bacteria solid-state fermentation had a positive effect on the nutrient digestion and serum biochemical indicators, which was contrary to high-fiber diets. Both high-fiber diets and multi-bacteria solid-state fermentation could optimize intestinal flora in finishing pigs.
   This study aimed to investigate the effects of multi-bacteria solid-state fermented diets with different crude fiber (CF) levels on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, and microbial flora of finishing pigs. The multi-bacteria solid-state fermented diets were made up of Lactobacillus amylovorus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, and Candida utilis. According to a 2 (factors) x 2 (levels) design, with the two factors being multi-bacteria solid-state fermentation (fed non-fermented diet or multi-bacteria fermentation) or CF levels (fed a basal diet containing 2.52% CF or 7.00% CF), a total of 36 finishing pigs (70.80 +/- 5.75 kg) were divided into 4 treatments with 9 barrows per group: (1) pigs fed a diet containing 7.00% CF (HF), (2) pigs fed a multi-bacteria fermentation diet containing 7.00% CF (HFM), (3) pigs fed a diet containing 2.52% CF (LF), and (4) piglets fed a multi-bacteria fermentation diet containing 2.52% CF (LFM). This experiment lasted 28 days. The multi-bacteria solid-state fermented diet increased the backfat thickness (p < 0.05) and apparent total tract nutrient digestibility (ATTD) of CF, neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), crude protein (CP), 8 amino acids (Trp, Asp, Gly, Cys, Val, Met, Ile, and Leu), total essential amino acids (EAA), total non-essential amino acids (NEEA), and total amino acids (TAA) (p < 0.05). Multi-bacteria solid-state fermented diet increased serum concentrations of HDL-c, ABL, TP, and GLU, the serum enzyme activities of GSH-Px, T-AOC, SOD, and CAT (p < 0.05), the relative abundance of Lactobacillus, Oscillospira, and Coprococcus (p < 0.05), and the abundance of YAMINSYN3-PWY, PWY-7013, GOLPDLCAT-PWY, ARGORNPROST-PWY, and PWY-5022 pathways (p < 0.05). The multi-bacteria solid-state fermented diet reduced the digestion amount of CF, NDF, and ADF (p < 0.05), the serum concentrations of TC, TG, LDL-c, BUN, and MDA (p < 0.05), the relative abundance of Streptococcaceae (p < 0.05), and the abundance of PWY-6470, PWY0-862, HSERMETANA-PWY, LACTOSECAT-PWY, MET-SAM-PWY, PWY-6700, PWY-5347, PWY0-1061, and LACTOSECAT-PWY pathways (p < 0.05). The high-fiber diet increased average daily feed intake (p < 0.05), the serum concentrations of TC, TG, LDL-c, BUN, and MDA (p < 0.05), the relative abundance of Clostridiaceae_Clostridium and Coprococcus (p < 0.05), and the abundance of TCA-GLYOX-BYPASS, GLYCOLYSIS-TCA-GLYOX-BYPASS, and PWY-6906 pathways (p < 0.05). The high-fiber diet reduced chest circumference (p < 0.05) and ATTD of ether extract (EE), CF, NDF, ADF, Ca, CP, 18 amino acids (Trp, Thr, Val, Met, Ile, Leu, Phe, Lys, His, Arg Asp, Ser, Glu, Gly, Ala, Cys, Tyr, and Pro), EAA, NEAA, and TAA (p < 0.05). The high-fiber diet also reduced the serum concentrations of HDL-c, TP, ABL, and GLU, the serum enzyme activities of T-AOC, GSH-Px, SOD, and CAT (p < 0.05), and the relative abundance of Akkermansia and Oscillospira (p < 0.05). There was no significant effect of the interaction between multi-bacteria fermentation and dietary CF levels, except on the digestion amount of CF (p < 0.05). The 7.00% CF had a negative effect on the digestion of nutrients, but multi-bacteria solid-state fermentation diets could relieve this negative effect and increase backfat thickness. High-fiber diets and multi-bacteria solid-state fermentation improved the diversity and abundance of fecal microorganisms in finishing pigs.

AB  - Simple Summary The spread of helminths resistant to the most common classes of anthelmintic drugs in sheep and the presence of drug residues in the environment has prompted research to find sustainable alternative solutions for gastrointestinal nematodes control. This study reports the results of in vivo studies on the efficacy of an aqueous Punica granatum-based macerate, used in southern Italy for the control of gastrointestinal nematodes in sheep. The anthelmintic efficacy was evaluated in parallel in sheep infected with gastrointestinal nematodes, using, as a positive control, the treatment with Ivermectin and Albendazole. The results of the study show a good anthelmintic efficacy, suggesting the use of this ethnoveterinary macerate as an alternative and sustainable therapeutical remedy for the helminthiasis control in the sheep. Parasites, in particular, gastrointestinal nematodes (GINs) represent one of the main burdens affecting small ruminant farming and pose a serious threat to their health, welfare, productivity, and reproduction. The correct management of animals and the correct use of anthelmintic drugs are the pillars of the GIN control programs for small ruminants. However, globally due to the indiscriminate use of synthetic anthelmintics, there is a significant increase in anthelmintic resistance phenomena to one or more classes of drugs. Even if such a problem never represented a serious threat in southern Italy because of the favourable environmental conditions and because of the good farm management, the phenomenon is actually showing a steep increasing trend and requires alternative treatment measures and constant monitoring. The use of phytotherapies is considered a valuable alternative approach for GIN control in small ruminants and could help with reducing the amount of synthetic drugs used and the forthcoming anthelmintic resistance. From this perspective, the Calabria territory offers a wide number of plants with anthelmintic efficacy that could be helpful for this purpose. The aim of this study was to evaluate the anthelmintic efficacy of aqueous pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) macerate compared to the treatment with Ivermectin and Albendazole in sheep naturally infected with GINs. The pomegranate macerate derives from the ethnoveterinary knowledge of the Calabria region, Southern Italy. The anthelmintic efficacy was evaluated according to the faecal egg count reduction test (FECRt) using the FLOTAC techniques in two sheep farms in Southern Italy. The FECR was calculated from individual samples using the formula FECR = 100 x (1 - [T2/C2]). The treatment with Albendazole in the first farm showed an efficacy of 99.8% after 14 days and 94.8% after 21 days, while the treatment with Ivermectin in the second farm showed an efficacy of 99.9% after 14 days and 96.5% after 21 days of treatment. The pomegranate macerate, in both farms, showed a value of efficacy of around 50% from day 7 to day 21 after the treatment. Previous studies highlighted the presence of gallic acid as the main component in the pomegranate macerate, and its efficacy in nematode control has been as well previously demonstrated in other plant extracts. This in vivo study demonstrated the unequivocal efficacy of plant macerate in easily reducing 50% of the number of GIN eggs in sheep faeces. These results, obtained without the use of synthetic anthelmintics, indicate the use of green veterinary pharmacology as a sustainable alternative to the use of synthetic drugs to reduce the increase in drug resistance phenomena and the environmental impact.

AB  - Exhibitions, where animals of various species are kept close to each other, are increasingly used in zoos and live collections. Such co-housing may not be suitable for some species: the presence of a large predator may cause stress to smaller heterospecifics (for example, potential prey) and even when the enclosures have no direct intersections and are merely close together. We evaluated the effects of a potentially dangerous predator on the welfare of typical potential prey/competitors kept in close proximity to this predator. Amur wildcats and caracals were kept one at a time in enclosures next to lynx. Stress level was assessed by analysing the dynamics of glucocorticoids (cortisol's metabolites) using non-invasive methods. The results showed that the presence of a predator in a neighbouring enclosure with an Amur wildcat did not change their cortisol concentrations significantly. However, hormone levels in animals kept at some distance from the lynx were twice as high as when they were in close proximity to the predator. Unlike Amur wildcats, caracals were more sensitive to the presence of a heterospecific. For Amur wildcats the presence of shelters in enclosures and the absence of direct lynxes' pursuit may have been sufficient to reduce the negative impact of a large predator.

AB  - Wool fineness affects the quality of wool, and some studies have identified about forty candidate genes that affect sheep wool fineness, but these genes often reveal only a certain proportion of the variation in wool thickness. We further explore additional genes associated with the fineness of sheep wool. Whole-genome resequencing of eight sheep breeds was performed to reveal selection signals associated with wool fineness, including four coarse wool and four fine/semi-fine wool sheep breeds. Multiple methods to reveal selection signals (Fst and theta pi Ratio and XP-EHH) were applied for sheep wool fineness traits. In total, 269 and 319 genes were annotated in the fine wool (F vs. C) group and the coarse wool (C vs. F) group, such as LGR4, PIK3CA, and SEMA3C and NFIB, OPHN1, and THADA. In F vs. C, 269 genes were enriched in 15 significant GO Terms (p < 0.05) and 38 significant KEGG Pathways (p < 0.05), such as protein localization to plasma membrane (GO: 0072659) and Inositol phosphate metabolism (oas 00562). In C vs. F, 319 genes were enriched in 21 GO Terms (p < 0.05) and 16 KEGG Pathways (p < 0.05), such as negative regulation of focal adhesion assembly (GO: 0051895) and Axon guidance (oas 04360). Our study has uncovered genomic information pertaining to significant traits in sheep and has identified valuable candidate genes. This will pave the way for subsequent investigations into related traits.

AB  - Subsea pipelines, operating in high-pressure and high-salinity conditions, face ongoing risks of leakage. Pipeline leaks can pollute the marine environment and, in severe cases, cause safety incidents, endangering human lives and property. Regular integrity inspections of subsea pipelines are critical to prevent corrosion-related leaks. This study develops a magnetic flux leakage (MFL)-based pig for detecting corrosion in subsea pipelines. Using a three-dimensional finite element model, this study analyzes the effects of defect geometry, lift-off distance, and operating speed on MFL signals. It proposes a defect estimation method based on axial peak-to-valley values and radial peak spacing, with inversion accuracy validated against simulation results. This study establishes a theoretical and practical framework for subsea pipeline integrity management, providing an effective solution for corrosion monitoring.

AB  - Intestinal injury is often accompanied by epithelial barrier dysfunction, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. Previous research studies have demonstrated that small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) from animal milk play a crucial role in regulating intestinal injury. Nonetheless, there has been limited research on the impact of goat milk sEVs on intestinal damage. This study aims to explore the functional differences between proteins in colostrum-derived sEVs (CME) and mature milk-derived sEVs (MME) from goat and elucidate their effects and mechanisms on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced injury in IEC-6. Proteomic analysis revealed that both CME and MME are rich in various bioactive proteins that have regulatory effects on cell damage. CME and MME significantly improved LPS-induced IEC-6 barrier dysfunction and oxidative stress. Additionally, CME and MME alleviated LPS-induced IEC-6 proliferation inhibition and apoptosis. Notably, CME exhibited a more significant improvement effect. RNA-Seq analysis indicated that CME ameliorates IEC-6 injury by inhibiting multiple genes and signaling pathways associated with cell damage, particularly the MAPK signaling pathway. In summary, goat milk-derived sEVs improve LPS-induced IEC-6 injury by targeting the MAPK signaling pathway, significantly restoring the intestinal epithelial barrier function, reducing oxidative stress, and alleviating apoptosis. These findings offer scientific evidence supporting the potential application of goat milk-derived sEVs as protective agents against intestinal injury.

AB  - Industrial crop cultivation on marginal agricultural land limits indirect land-use change effects that pose a threat to food security. This review compiles results from 91 published crop-specific field trial datasets spanning 12 relevant industrial crops and discusses their suitability for cultivation on unfavorable soil types (USTs). It was shown that the perennial species Miscanthus (Miscanthus Andersson) and reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea L.) performed well on USTs with both high clay and/or high sand contents. Information on stoniness (particles sizes > 2 mm), where mentioned, was limited. It was found to have only a small impact on biological yield potential, though it was not possible to assess the impact on mechanization as would be used at a commercial scale. For soils with extreme clay or sand contents, half of the crops showed moderate suitability. The large yield variations within and between crops revealed large knowledge gaps in the combined effects of crop type and agronomy on USTs. Therefore, more field trials are needed on diverse USTs in different climates with better equipment and more consistent measurements to improve the accuracy of potential yield predictions spatially and temporally. Additionally, larger trials are needed to optimize cultivation and harvesting.

AB  - High-level policy debates surrounding elephant management often dominate global conservation headlines, yet realities for people living with wildlife are not adequately incorporated into policymaking or evident in related discourse.(1,2) Human health and livelihoods can be severely impacted by wildlife and indirectly by policy outcomes.(3) In landscapes where growing human and elephant (Loxodonta spp. and Elephas maximus) populations compete over limited resources, human-elephant conflict causes crop loss, human injury and death, and retaliatory killing of wildlife.(4-6) Across Africa, these problems may be increasingly compounded by climate change, which intensifies resource competition and food insecurity.(6-9) Here, we examine how human-wildlife impacts interact with climate change and household food insecurity across the Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area, the world's largest terrestrial transboundary conservation area, spanning five African nations. We use hierarchical Bayesian statistical models to analyze multi-country household data together with longitudinal satellite-based climate measures relevant to rainfed agriculture. We find that crop depredation by wildlife, primarily elephants, impacts 58% of sampled households annually and is associated with significant increases in food insecurity. These wildlife impacts compound effects of changing climate on food insecurity, most notably observed as a 5-day shortening of the rainy season per 10 years across the data record (1981-2018). To advance sustainability goals, global conservation policy must better integrate empirical evidence on the challenges of human-wildlife coexistence into longer term strategies at transboundary scales, specifically in the context of climate change.3,9-11

AB  - While the response of Arabidopsis thaliana to drought, herbivory or fungal infection has been well-examined, the consequences of exposure to a series of such (a)biotic stresses are not well studied. This work reports on the genetic mechanisms underlying the Arabidopsis response to single osmotic stress, and to combinatorial stress, either fungal infection using Botrytis cinerea or herbivory using Pieris rapae caterpillars followed by an osmotic stress treatment. Several small-effect genetic loci associated with rosette dry weight (DW), rosette water content (WC), and the projected rosette leaf area in response to combinatorial stress were mapped using univariate and multi-environment genome-wide association approaches. A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associated with DROUGHT-INDUCED 19 (DI19) was identified by both approaches, supporting its potential involvement in the response to combinatorial stress. Several SNPs were found to be in linkage disequilibrium with known stress-responsive genes such as PEROXIDASE 34 (PRX34), BASIC LEUCINE ZIPPER 25 (bZIP25), RESISTANCE METHYLATED GENE 1 (RMG1) and WHITE RUST RESISTANCE 4 (WRR4). An antagonistic effect between biotic and osmotic stress was found for prx34 and arf4 mutants, which suggests PRX34 and ARF4 play an important role in the response to the combinatorial stress.

AB  - Intraguild (IG) predation (IGP) appears to offer multiple benefits for IG-predators from the viewpoints of predation and resource competition. Similarly, herbivores may also gain benefits such as resource monopoly and utilization in the form of food through IGP. We examined IGP among the larvae of two species of herbivorous beetles in eastern Japan belonging to the family Scarabaeidae: the increasing invasive species Anomala albopilosa and the decreasing endemic species A. cuprea. Regardless of species, older larvae preyed on younger larvae; however, third-instar larvae did not kill each other but performed vibratory behavior as a warning. These results show that IGP does not explain the mechanism of decreasing A. cuprea populations, which is contrary to our initial expectations because A. cuprea emerge earlier than A. albopilosa in the field and older larvae of A. cuprea are expected to exhibit IGP toward younger larvae of A. albopilosa. To the best of our knowledge, this study is one of the few case studies proposing the occurrence of IGP as an interspecific interaction among herbivores.

AB  - The primary aim of this study was to explore the effect of silymarin (SM) and selenium-yeast (SY) on antioxidant status, lipid peroxidation and metabolic hormones in Barbari goat during heat stress. Thirty-two Barbari goats (age: 7.2 +/- 0.8 months; weight: 10.5 +/- 0.9 kg) were randomly divided into four groups as Group I (CON; n = 8); Group II (SM600; n = 8); Group III (SeY; n = 8) and Group IV (SM600 + SeY; n = 8). Heat stress, oxidative stress, antioxidant status, lipid profile, lipid peroxidation, and metabolic hormones were evaluated. Maximum and minimum ambient temperature (AT), relative humidity (RH), and temperature humidity index (THI) values showed severe heat stress during the experimental period. The mean values of total antioxidant activity (TAA) were found significantly (P < 0.05) higher and thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) was found significantly (P < 0.05) lower in treatment groups as compared to the control group. The mean level of SOD, CAT, and GSHPx was significantly (P < 0.05) increased in SM and SY-supplemented group than the control group. Supplementation significantly (P < 0.05) influenced the lipid profile in the animals. There was an increased level of HDL cholesterol and a decreased level of total cholesterol and triglycerides in the supplemented group. Plasma cortisol level was found significantly (P < 0.05) lower and T3 and T4 levels were higher in the supplemented group as compared to the control group. The results of this study indicated that supplementation of SM and SY reduces oxidative and metabolic stress, and lipid peroxidation and also improves the antioxidant status in heat-stressed Barbari goats.

AB  - Land development has impacted natural landforms extensively, causing a decline in resources and negative consequences to elephant populations, habitats, and gene flow. Often, elephants seek to fulfill basic needs by wandering into nearby human communities, which leads to human-elephant conflict (HEC), a serious threat to conserving this endangered species. Understanding elephant space use and connectivity among their habitats can offset barriers to ecological flow among fragmented populations. We focused on the Keonjhar Forest Division in Eastern India, where HEC has resulted in the deaths of ~300 people and several hundred elephants, and damaged ~4100 houses and ~12,700 acres of cropland between 2001 and 2018. Our objectives were to (1) analyze elephant space use based on their occupancy; (2) map connectivity by considering the land structure and HEC occurrences; (3) assess the quality of mapped connectivity and identify potential bottlenecks. We found that (1) the study area has the potential to sustain a significant elephant population by providing safe connectivity; (2) variables like forests, precipitation, rural built-up areas, cropland, and transportation networks were responsible for predicting elephant presence (0.407, SE = 0.098); (3) five habitat cores, interconnected by seven corridors were identified, of which three habitat cores were vital for maintaining connectivity; (4) landscape features, such as cropland, rural built-up, mining, and transportation networks created bottlenecks that could funnel elephant movement. Our findings also indicate that overlooking HEC in connectivity assessments could lead to overestimation of functionality. The study outcomes can be utilized as a preliminary tool for decision making and early planning during development projects.

AB  - Home range size estimation is an important basis for developing effective conservation strategies and provides important insights into the study of animal behavior and spatial ecology. We analyze home range variations and the fitfulness of estimation methods on Chinese gorals (Naemorhedus griseus) living at a cliff landscape with GPS tracking data. We report annual, seasonal, and monthly home range sizes of five female Chinese gorals tracked from February 2015 to September 2018. We found variations existed in 95% seasonal home range sizes among estimation methods. We recommend that the alpha-LoCoH model be used in home range estimations, as this model appeared to more accurately reflect animal locations within the steep cliff habitat in our study area. Furthermore, more animals should be GPS tracked to ensure the validity of any interpretation concerning their home range size in a rugged habitat. This study was the first conducting home-range GPS tracking of Chinese gorals in their northern distribution range. Additionally, our findings provided previously unknown information regarding the home range traits of this endangered species, and they may contribute to the development of effective conservation strategies.

AB  - The evolution and maintenance of symbiotic systems remains a fascinating puzzle. While the coevolutionary dynamics of bipartite (host-symbiont) systems are well-studied, the dynamics of more complex systems have only recently garnered attention with increasing technological advances. We model a tripartite system inspired by the marine symbiotic relationship between the alga Bryopsis sp., its intracellular defensive bacterial symbiont "Candidatus Endobryopsis kahalalidifaciens," which produces a toxin that protects the alga against fish herbivores, and the sea-slug Elysia rufescens (), which is not deterred by the toxin. We disentangle the role of selection on different actors within this system by investigating evolutionary scenarios where defense evolves as (i) a host-controlled trait that reduces algal reproductive ability; (ii) a symbiont-controlled trait that impacts symbiont transmission; and (iii) a trait jointly controlled by both host and symbiont. Optimal investment in defensive toxins varies based on the characteristics of the host, symbiont, and sea slug; and evolutionary trajectories are modulated by trade-off shape, i.e., a strongly decelerating trade-off between defense and symbiont transmission can drive symbiont diversification via evolutionary branching. Increasing slug herbivory reduces host investment in defense to favor reproduction, while symbiont investment in defense first declines and then increases as host density declines to the degree that horizontal symbiont transmission is no longer beneficial. Increasing vertical transmission selects for reduced defense by the host when it evolves as a jointly controlled trait, as a result of investment by the symbiont. Our theoretical exploration of the evolution of defensive symbiosis in scenarios involving interactions with multiple herbivores provides a first window into the origin and maintenance of the Bryopsis sp. system, and adds another piece to the puzzle of the evolution of symbiotic systems.
   This study delves into a tripartite marine symbiosis between the algal host Bryopsis sp., and its protective bacterium Ca. Endobryopsis kahalalidifaciens, and the sea slug Elysia rufescens which feeds on bacterium-carrying algae. The bacterium produces defensive toxins that protect the algae from a range of herbivores. We developed a host-symbiont-herbivore model to study how this defensive relationship evolves in the presence of sea slugs which are not deterred by the toxins. We assumed that producing more toxins for the algal host means fewer resources for its reproduction, while for the bacterium, it means reduced ability to spread to new hosts. We discovered that the alga and bacterium's investment in toxin production is influenced by the strength of such defense costs, the magnitude of herbivory by sea slugs and other environmental factors. As such, when producing toxins becomes too costly, both alga and bacterium reduce their investment in defense. However, under certain conditions, multiple bacterium populations that have different levels of defense can coexist. This research highlights the evolution and maintenance of complex symbiotic relationships, offering insights into how organisms work together to survive in the face of multiple threats.

AB  - Diverse animal taxa are capable of rapidly modifying vocalizations to mitigate interference from environmental noise. Echolocating bats, for example, must frequently perform sonar tasks in the presence of interfering sounds. Numerous studies have documented sound production flexibility in echolocating bats; however, it remains unknown whether noise-induced vocal modifications (NIVMs) mitigate interference effects on echoes or calls. In this study, we leverage echo level compensation behavior of echolocating bats to answer this question. Using a microphone array, we recorded echolocation calls of Hipposideros pratti trained to approach and land on a perch in the laboratory under quiet and noise conditions. We found that H. pratti exhibited echo level compensation behavior during approaching flights, which depended critically on distance to the landing perch. Broadcast noise delayed and affected the rate of echo level compensation in H. pratti. Moreover, H. pratti increased vocalization amplitude, i.e., exhibited the Lombard effect, while also adjusting call duration and bandwidth with increasing noise levels. Quantitative analyses of the data show that H. pratti relies on echo feedback, not vocal feedback, to adjust signals in the presence of noise. These findings provide compelling evidence that NIVMs in echolocating animals and non-echolocating animals operate through different mechanisms.

AB  - Florivory and floral larceny are very common antagonistic interactions in nature. Florivory can be especially harmful to species with polymorphisms because it may hinder the transfer of pollen in one of the floral morphs. Flower size is one of the floral signals that can influence the attraction of these antagonists. In addition, little is known about the effects of florivory on other antagonistic interactions. Thus, the objective of this study was to investigate the natural patterns of florivory and the relationship between florivory and robbery in the attraction of larcenists in the species Senna rugosa. All flowers damaged by florivores were collected for measurement of natural patterns of florivory with aid of the ImageJ software. Florivory were simulated by holes in the base of the petals and photographs and focal observations were made to assess the effect of flower area and florivory on the attraction of floral larcenists. Smaller flowers had higher florivory rates. In larger flowers, the inner part of the corolla and the anthers had a greater probability of suffering florivory. Although the damage caused by florivory occurred discontinuously regardless of flower size, larger flowers presented continuous marks of florivory more frequently than smaller ones. Larcenists visited flowers regardless of flower size or damaged parts. Thus, flower size and florivory are not determinant factors for the attraction of floral larcenists in enantiostylous S. rugosa.

AB  - Ewes bear scent glands located near the udder which smelly secretion is interesting to newly-born lambs searching a teat to suck on. This glands' secretion - inguinal wax (IW) - was found to be reactogenic to lambs before they initiate suckling from the dam. The present study aimed to further assess whether IW odor affects two vital aspects of newborn lambs' behaviour: orienting and engaging suckling. First, forty-six lambs were tested in two-choice odor tests contrasting i) own mother's Inguinal Wax (IW-M) vs. unfamiliar mother's Inguinal Wax (IW-nM), ii) IW-M vs. control and iii) IW-nM vs. control, to measure their differential orientation to maternal IW odor presented against either IW from another dam or a control. Second, a bottle-feeding test (n = 41 lambs) assessed lambs' elicitation of suckling from IW-odorized vs. control bottles. Relative to the control, IW odor enhanced lambs' orientation during the two-choice odor test, but without differentiation of maternal IW from non-maternal IW. Otherwise, lambs did not engage more suckling on a bottle when odorized with maternal IW relative to a control bottle. Some aspects of lambs' responses were differentiated by sex, but this effect was independent on odor condition. In sum, this preliminary study indicates that ovine IW is somehow inherently attractive to lambs before they associate it with suckling.

AB  - Adequate sleep during the developmental stage can promote learning and memory functions because synaptic protein synthesis at primed synapses during sleep profoundly affects neurological function. The Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway affects neuroplasticity in the hippocampus during the development of the central nervous system. In this study, the changes in synaptic morphology and function induced by sleep deprivation and the potential therapeutic effect of a Shh agonist (SAG) on these changes were investigated in adolescent mice. Adolescent mice were subjected to sleep deprivation for 20 hrs (2 pm to 10 am the next day) and were free to sleep for the remaining 4 hrs per day for 10 consecutive days. Sleep-deprived mice were injected with SAG (10 mg/kg body weight, i.p.) or saline (i.p.) every day 5 min before the onset of the 20 h sleep deprivation period. Chronic sleep deprivation impaired recognition and spatial memory, decreased the number of dendritic spines and mEPSCs of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, decreased the postsynaptic density, and reduced Shh and glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 (Gli1) expression. SAG significantly protected against sleep deprivation -induced memory dysfunction, increased the CA1 pyramidal neuronal dendritic spine number and mEPSC fre-quency, and increased Gli1 expression. In conclusion, sleep deprivation induces memory impairment in adolescent mice, and SAG treatment prevents this impairment, probably by enhancing synaptic function in the hippocampal CA1 region.

AB  - Y The combined application of organic materials and chemical fertilizers is an effective approach for improving crop productivity and soil quality. Purple soil is characterized by low N, P, and organic C contents that influence crop productivity. However, the optimal organic materials that can be used to improve purple soil quality and crop yields remain to be clarified. Here, we conducted a 13-year field experiment (from 2007 to 2019) in Sichuan Province, China, intending to assess the long-term influence of various combinations of organic materials and chemical fertilizers on soil enzymatic activities, microbial communities, and crop yields. Treatments included chemical fertilizer alone (NPK), NPK plus returned straw (NPKS), NPK plus pig manure (NPKM), NPK plus fungal residue (NPKF), and NPK plus green manure (Vicia villosa Rothvar.) (NPKG). Results showed that NPKM and NPKF treatments significantly increased the average yields of maize (7.9 and 6.4%, respectively) and wheat (15.7 and 12.9%, respectively) relative to NPK treatment. The highest sustainable yield index value of maize and wheat was observed in NPKF treatment. The long-term application of fungal residue (NPKF) significantly increased soil organic C and available P contents, relative to NPK.NPKS and NPKG treatments, and soil organic C content increased from 6.95 to 9.12 +/- 1.06 g kg(-1) and available P content from 6.87 to 12.26 +/- 2.23 mg kg(-1). Relative to NPK treatment, NPKF treatment significantly enhanced soil microbial biomasses (C, N, and P) and soil C-, N- and P-cycling enzyme activities but significantly decreased soil pH. The soil enzyme index following NPKF treatment was significantly higher relative to other treatments and was 208.6% higher than NPK treatment. Additionally, relative to NPK treatment, NPKF treatment altered soil microbial community structure, and significantly increased the rate of G(+)/G(-) and cy19/18:1 omega 7c. Soil microbial biomasses N, Nitrate N, and available P were the main factors regulating the change of microbial community in purple soil. We, therefore, conclude that NPKF treatment is an effective fertilization strategy for improving purple soil quality and crop yields.

AB  - Accurate information on population structure is essential for effective fisheries management. Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) in the North Atlantic is managed as four separate offshore stocks. We use Multivariate Autoregressive State-Space (MARSS) models to assess population structure by means of abundance and biomass trends in four regions (Norwegian Sea, Iceland, Southeast Greenland, and Northwest Atlantic) where three offshore stocks are recognized: (1) Baffin Bay-Davis Strait (Northwest Atlantic stock), (2) Southeast Greenland and Iceland (West Nordic stock (WNS)), and (3) the Barents and Norwegian Seas (Northeast Arctic stock). We formulated model alternatives, using bottom trawl survey data from each region for 1996-2019, to evaluate support for different population structures. Abundance and biomass observations from each region were linked to growth rate parameters in MARSS models and the impact of climate (North Atlantic Oscillation Index) and fishing (commercial catches) on stock dynamics was investigated. Top models identified the Northwest Atlantic as an independent population. Best-fit models treated Greenland halibut in the WNS as two independent populations (east and west), with potential connections between eastern Iceland and the western Barents Sea. These results suggest a mismatch between current stock perception and management boundaries in the Northeast Atlantic.

AB  - Global demand for meat is increasing with the world's population growth, which leads to the expansion of global pig breeding. For farming enterprises, the production efficiency is important. In the process of pig breeding, pig behavior will reflect some pieces of information such as health, welfare, and growth status, which indirectly impacts the production efficiency of farming enterprises. Therefore, the detection of daily pig behaviors is essential. With the development of sensing and artificial intelligence technologies, various information perception technologies have been used in pig behavior detection. This paper provides a comprehensive review of recent advances in information perception technology for pig behavior detection. The merits and demerits of different information perception technologies for pig target perception and behavior detection were analyzed first. Then different detection systems for pig behavior were compared. Subsequently, the public datasets for pig behavior were innovatively summarized. Based on these findings, this study identifies key challenges that persist in the application of information perception technologies for pig behavior detection. These challenges include the limited data dimensionality when using a single sensing modality, the difficulty of accurately perceiving individual behavioral information in group housing conditions, the uneven research focus across different types of behaviors, the limited variety and scale of publicly available pig behavior datasets, and the heavy reliance on manual data annotation. To address these issues, future research should integrate multiple sensing modalities to enrich data quality and dimensionality, develop target extraction and behavior detection models that balance accuracy with computational complexity, broaden the scope of studied behaviors to include those previously overlooked, construct more diverse and sufficiently large datasets, and adopt semi-supervised or unsupervised strategies for data annotation. This work will facilitate large-scale commercial applications of pig behavior detection and will lay a critical foundation for welfare-oriented pig farming.

   Dolphins are one of the best adapted aquatic mammalians in captivity. While these animals can reproduce naturally in aquaria, many aspects related to their reproduction are still unknown. Their behavior, sociability with humans and ability to learn make dolphins ideal subjects for investigating their reproduction features for conservation programs aimed at this aquatic species and others. It is known that dolphins use a multi-male mating strategy, in which sperm competition could play a fundamental role. This study aims to characterize the shape and dimensions of dolphin sperm from two mature males and putatively classifies them into subpopulations. Moreover, the influence of sex hormone levels (testosterone) and refrigeration (temperature and storage period) with sperm dimension was evaluated. The results indicated that sperm dimensions and shape differed between the two males studied and that the sperm of both males could be classified into two subpopulations depending on their dimensions. Moreover, both testosterone levels and refrigeration were seen to influence sperm dimensions. This investigation provides new insights into sperm competition in dolphin species, and the results could be extrapolated to other endangered aquatic mammalian species.
   Bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) males follow many reproductive strategies to ensure their paternity. However, little is known about the sperm traits, including morphometric features, that contribute to their reproductive success. Our aim was to study dolphin sperm morphometry (a total of 13 parameters) in two adult males to evaluate (i) presumptive sperm subpopulations, (ii) the correlation of sperm morphometry with testosterone levels and (iii) the effect of refrigerated storage on the sperm morphometry. Sperm populations were classified into four principal components (PCs) based on morphometry (>94% of cumulative variance). The PCs clustered into two different sperm subpopulations, which differed between males. Furthermore, the levels of serum testosterone were positively correlated with the length of the midpiece but negatively correlated with head width and the principal piece, flagellum and total sperm lengths. Most of the sperm morphometric parameters changed during the storage period (day 1 vs. day 7), but only the principal piece length was affected by the storage temperature (5 degrees C vs. 15 degrees C). This is the first study to identify dolphin sperm subpopulations based on morphometry and the influence of serum testosterone and refrigeration on sperm morphometry.

AB  - Simple Summary</p>
   Cashmere goats in Tibet are adapted to a high altitude, cold climate, high solar radiation, and hypoxia. The aim of the present study was to compare the morphology of the secondary hair follicles and immunostaining of hair follicle regulatory proteins in Tibetan cashmere goats from a high altitude and low temperature (Rikaze) to goats from a lower altitude and comparatively warm temperature (Huan). We conclude that, at the same time of the year, the secondary hair follicles were at different development stages. HIF-1a protein immunostaining in the inner root sheath (IRS) and hair shaft (HS) was higher than the immunostaining in the outer root sheath (ORS). In contrast, immunostaining for HIF-2a protein in the ORS and IRS was higher than that present in the HS. Immunostaining for HIF-3a protein was higher in the ORS than the IRS while HOXC13 protein immunostaining was higher in the ORS than the IRS and HS. Immunostaining in secondary hair follicles for HIF-1a, HIF-2a, and HSP27 protein in the cashmere goats living in Rikaze was significantly higher than that in the secondary hair follicles of cashmere goats from Huan. In contrast, HOX13 protein immunostaining was significantly higher in cashmere goats from Huan than from Rikaze. These results are useful in understanding how altitude and temperature influence secondary hair follicle development.</p>
   This experiment compared secondary hair follicles (SFs) in Tibetan cashmere goats from two different steppes that were at different altitudes and had different temperatures. Twenty-four 2-year-old goats were studied. Twelve goats were from Rikaze in Tibet which is at an altitude of above 5000 m with an average temperature of 0 & DEG;C. The other 12 studied goats were from Huan County of Gansu Province which is around 2000 m above sea level with an average temperature of 9.2 & DEG;C. The structural features of SFs were assessed using light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The presence of HIF-1a, HIF-2a, HIF-3a, HSP27, and HOXC13 proteins was studied using immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. Light and electron microscopy revealed that the SFs of the Tibetan cashmere goats that lived in the Rikaze Steppe were in the proanagen stage in May. However, the SFs of the goats from the lower warmer Huan County were in the anagen stage at the same time. Immunohistochemistry revealed intense immunostaining for HIF-1a protein in the inner root sheath (IRS) and hair shaft (HS); immunostaining against HIF-2a in the outer root sheath (ORS) and IRS; HIF-3a protein immunostaining in the ORS; HSP27 immunostaining in the ORS, IRS, and HS; and HOXC13 immunostaining in the ORS and HS. HIF-1a protein expression in the IRS and HS was higher than the expression in the ORS (p < 0.05) while the expression of HIF-2a protein was higher in the ORS and IRS than the HS (p < 0.05). The expression of HIF-3a protein was higher in the ORS than in the IRS (p < 0.05). Expression of HOXC13 protein was higher in the ORS than in the IRS and HS (p < 0.05). Immunostaining of HIF-1a, HIF-2a, and HSP27 protein was significantly higher in SFs from cashmere goats from Rikaze than in goats from Huan (p < 0.05). In contrast, HOX13 protein immunostaining was significantly higher in cashmere goats from Huan than from Rikaze (p < 0.05). Significant differences were observed in the SFs of cashmere goats from two locations that differ in altitude and temperature. This suggests the differences in the secondary hair follicles could be due to the hypoxia and lower temperatures experienced by the goats in Rikaze.& nbsp;These results are useful in understanding how altitude and temperature influence SF development. Hair produced by the SFs are used for down fiber. Therefore, understanding of the factors that influence SF development will allow the production and harvest of these valuable fibers to be maximized.</p>

AB  - The Serengeti National Park and the Ngorongoro National Park are well-known for their migratory herds of large herbivores. These migrations are suggested to be due to different nutritional needs of the large herbivores over the year. The nutritional needs of the large herbivores are fulfilled by the different nutrient content of the grassland biomass. Soil nutrient availability is at least partly controlling the nutrient content of the grassland biomass despite plant-specific nutrient uptake mechanisms. Despite lot of data existing on the nutrient content of the grassland biomass in this area, less is known about the nutrient availability of the soils, especially for the transect from the Ngorongoro crater via the Ngorongoro Conservation area to the centre of the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania. Here we present a dataset on the availability of carbon, nitrogen, magnesium, aluminium, silicon, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, manganese and iron in the soils along this transect at 16 sampling points. Our data clearly show that the nutrient availability in the soils along this transect strongly differs with higher values of aluminium, silicon, potassium and calcium near the border of Serengeti National Park. These differences in soil nutrient availability might be the reason for different nutrient content in grassland biomass in certain areas, hence potentially affecting the migration of the herds of large herbivores as found by other studies. As our dataset is not comprehensive, we call for collection and analysis of more samples and also soil profile analysis in this area as our dataset is limited.

AB  - Background: Pig slurry can negatively impact on the environmental, animal, and human health. Knowing the relationship between the organic and inorganic loads, pathogens, and toxicity allows identifying the main parameters to be removed or treated before final disposal. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationships between the physicochemical properties, microbiological, and parasitological content, ecotoxicological effects, and biochemical methane potential (BMP) of pig slurries. Methods: Ten pig slurry samples at two production stages were characterized and a BMP test at two substrate/inoculum (S/I) ratios was conducted to compare the methane yields. Results: We found high content of Cu, Zn, quaternary ammonium, pathogenic microorganisms (E. coli and Salmonella), and parasites (Trichuris and Trichostrongylus). Toxicity on lettuce, radish, and Daphnia was observed with a slurry concentration greater than 1.35%. Positive correlations were found between toxicity on Daphnia and chemical oxygen demand (COD), sulfate, Zn, and Cu, as well as between phytotoxicity and COD, NH4, Na, K, and conductivity. The lowest S/I ratio showed 13% more methane yield. It was associated with high removals of COD and volatile fatty acids. Conclusions: We recommend using a low S/I ratio to treat pig slurry as it improves the efficiency of the anaerobic process.

AB  - Polyploidy, the expression of more than two sets of chromosomes, is common in plants, and is thought to influence plant trait expression and drive plant species evolution. The degree to which polyploidy influences interactions among physiological processes such as growth and defense in natural populations through its effect on phenotypic variability is poorly understood. We link broad plant genotypic features (including polyploidy) to phenotypic expression of growth and chemical defense in natural populations of quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) to examine patterns in resource allocation that might drive growth-defense tradeoffs. Quaking aspen are capable of rapid growth, and are also a primary food plant for a large range of herbivores, including insects and ungulates. While often diploid, aspen can exhibit polyploidy as triploid clones. We tested for the effect of genotype, cytotype (ploidy level, divided between diploids and triploids), and ramet age on relationships between growth and leaf chemistry across natural aspen clones in northern Utah. Substantial genotype variability in growth and leaf chemistry occurred across both cytotypes. Phenolic glycosides, but not condensed tannins, were negatively related to growth. Ramet age was also negatively related to growth. Phenolic glycosides were negatively related to condensed tannins, but only for the diploid clones. Triploid clones exhibited similar to 20% higher levels of phenolic glycosides than diploids. Growth in quaking aspen was likely sacrificed for the production of phenolic glycosides. Our study underscores the importance of considering polyploidy, genetic variability, and ramet age in understanding growthdefense tradeoffs in natural populations of clonal organisms, such as quaking aspen.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of melatonin (MLT), reduced glutathione (GSH) and vitamin E (Vit. E) or their combinations on semen cryopreservation of Mediterranean buffalo. The quality parameters such as viability, abnormality rate, motility, structural integrity and the antioxidant capacity of frozen-thawed sperm were evaluated. The efficiency of frozen-thawed sperms in performing their functions was further analyzed by in vitro fertilization (IVF). In those separately supplemented groups, 0.2 mg/mL MLT, 0.2 mM GSH and 0.4 mg/mL Vit. E had the best effect on antioxidant capacity, kinetics and morphology, respectively. In addition, the cleavage, blastocyst and hatching blastocyst rates of IVF embryos were higher in 0.2 mg/mL MLT, 0.2 mM GSH, 0.2 and 0.4 mg/mL Vit. E groups than the blank control. Among the three combination groups, the kinetics and structure integrity of frozen-thawed sperms, cleavage, blastocyst and hatching blastocyst rates of IVF embryos were higher in 0.4 mg/mL Vit. E plus 0.2 mg/mL MLT group than the blank control group, revealed that this combination had comprehensive protection on frozen-thawed sperm of Mediterranean buffalo. These results support to develop special semen freezing extender containing an optimal choice of MLT, GSH and Vit. E, and to enhance the efficiency of frozen-thawed sperm of Mediterranean buffalo for IVF.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Concern has been expressed in many parts of the world that community relations in rural areas are breaking down, making issues such as rural environmental degradation harder to resolve without external regulation. Guanxi is a specific Chinese idiom for characterizing social networks, as a broad term to represent existing relations among people, which can be loosely translated as ''relationship''. Based on a case study of an underdeveloped mountainous area of Southern China, this paper examined the problem from the perspective of guanxi, and explored the impacts of internal group differentiation catalyzed by pig farming pollution and the subsequent influences on the distribution of costs and benefits of different shareholders. It was found that the guanxi in the village were changed from blood relationship centered to economic interest centered. This disparity exerts a significant influence on the distribution of costs and benefits of pollution control and exacerbates environmental inequalities. This means that pig farmers dominated the narrative of pig farming pollution, while the ordinary villagers chose to suffer without protesting, which hinders the advancement of pollution control, and pig farmers took the benefits of weak pollution control and managed to transfer the external cost to others, while others became direct victims. The paper concludes that the rich become richer and the poor become poorer in both economic and environmental perspectives. It is strongly suggested that guanxi should be integrated into the consideration and decision-making process of rural environmental governance in order to guarantee the efficiency and efficacy of its implementation.

AB  - In order to further reveal the special characteristics of energy metabolism and the characteristics of energy requirements of fattening pigs grown in low-temperature environments, this study used a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial array of treatments, which harnessed two temperatures (low-temperature, LT group: 10 degrees C; normal-temperature, NT group: 20 degrees C), two feed energy levels (normal-energy, NE group: 14.02 MJ/kg metabolic energy; high-energy, HE group: 15.14 MJ/kg metabolic energy), and two feed energy sources (LF group: low fat, HF group: high fat). Thirty-two Songliao black fattening pigs with an initial body weight of 85.48 +/- 2.31 kg were completely randomized into eight treatment groups, with four replicates in each treatment group and one pig in each replicate. The pigs were placed in a respiratory metabolic chamber for a 6-day trial. There was one pig per respiratory metabolic chamber in a single cage. The results showed that the average daily weight gain in the normal-temperature, high-energy, and high-fat groups was higher than that of the low-temperature, normal-energy, and low-fat groups (p < 0.05). The fat deposition rate, protein oxidation, and fat oxidation of the high-fat group were higher than those of the low-fat group (p < 0.05). The energy digestibility, protein digestibility, and fat digestibility in the high-fat group were higher than those in the normal-energy group (p < 0.05). The fat digestibility and energy deposition rate in the high-fat group were higher than those in the low-fat group (p < 0.05). The respiratory quotient in the high-energy group was lower than that in the normal-energy group (p < 0.05), and the respiratory quotient in the high-fat group was lower than that in the low-fat group (p < 0.05). There was an interaction between temperature and energy sources in terms of the respiratory quotient, fat oxidation, blood urea nitrogen content, and glucose content (p < 0.05). Appropriately increasing the energy level of the diet and improving the energy structure of the feed (increasing the level of fats and oils) will benefit Songliao black fattening pigs by increasing their energy use efficiency and at the same time reducing greenhouse gas CO2 emissions, and these changes are more pronounced in cold environments.

AB  - Azolla is a substitute compost that has the potential to enhance nutrient cycling in agricultural systems for sustainable development. In this study, four experiments were conducted to compare the Department of Agriculture (DOA, Thailand)'s methodology for determining the suitable type and rate of animal manure and the optimal light intensity for the growth and yield of Azolla (Azolla microphylla). The results revealed that applying 100% pig manure gave the highest yield of Azolla compared to the other manures. However, there was no discernible (p > 0.05) difference in yield across the various doses (20.16, 30.16, and 40.16 gN m(-2)) of pig manure treatments, for which the minimal pig manure dosage of 20.16 gN m(-2) was chosen. For further experimentation in the optimal light intensity, the 40% shading gave the highest yield of Azolla compared to no shading or 20 and 60% shading (p <= 0.01). When compared with the DOA Thailand methodology (1.27 kg m(-2) of cow manure and covered with a size 32 mesh net), the findings indicated that the modified method (20.16 gN m(-2) of pig manure + 40% shading) gave a 16% greater Azolla yield than that under the DOA Thailand methodology. The current finding method can produce a monthly fresh biomass of A. microphylla of 40.7 t ha(-1) year(-1) with higher contents of total N (4.92%) and lower C:N ratio (<= 10:1) that could release minerals relatively rapidly. Its use can be encouraged by farmers to produce their own ecofriendly biofertilizer or soil amendment for sustainable agriculture.

AB  - The most critical stage of pregnancy is embryo implantation, which relies on the synchronized developmental capacity of the embryo and uterine receptivity to implantation. In early pregnancy, conceptus and uterus release several factors enabling successful implantation and placentation. Molecules involved in embryo-maternal crosstalk include, but are not limited to, hormones, growth factors, and cytokines. The discovery of microRNAs (small non-coding RNAs regulating gene expression) has revolutionized our understanding of many biological processes, including pregnancy. To date, numerous miRNAs have been detected in different species during pregnancy, both at the endometrial and embryonic sites. Thus, microRNAs are considered important regulators of early pregnancy events. Here, we report miR-26a-5p and miR-125b-5p effects on human and pig trophoblast cell function. Both microRNAs change the level of several genes and proteins important for proper embryo development. Moreover, miR-26a-5p stimulates porcine trophoblast proliferation and has a negative impact on its affinity to laminin. However, miR-125b-5p decreases porcine trophoblast cell migration. Our studies suggest that miR-26a-5p and miR-125b-5p can affect early pregnancy functions by regulating genes and processes important for proper conceptuses' development and progression through the implantation process.
   miR-26a-5p and miR-125b-5p impact early pregnancy functions by regulating genes and cellular processes important for proper embryo-maternal interactions.

AB  - To optimize the swine wastewater (SWW) treatment, this study investigated different hydraulic retention times (HRTs) for microalgae cultivation. For this purpose, five pilot-scale reactors operated in semi-continuous flow, with HRTs equal to 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 days were evaluated in terms of SWW polishing and biomass production. The effluent treatment was discussed accompanied by principal component analysis, which allowed identification of causes of variance in the data set, ideal for studies with real effluent and influenced by environmental conditions. All reactors show satisfactory removals of N-NH4+ (91.6-95.3%), COD (15.8-39.9%), DO increment (in average 7.5 mg O-2/L) and, only the longest HRT (21 days) was able to remove Ps (21%). The results obtained indicated that a consortium of microalgae and bacteria was developed for all the tested HRTs. On the other hand, HRT = 12 days provided a healthier culture of photosynthesizing organisms (chl-a/VSS = 3.04%). Carbohydrates (20.8-31.3%) and proteins (2.7-16.2%) were the compounds of commercial interest in the highest proportion in the biomass of all reactors, with contents comparable to that of terrestrial crops. Thus, it was suggested a valorization route of these compounds of high added value to return to pig farming, where the nutrients were intended to supplement the swine feed and clarified water for cleaning the pig stalls. Thus, in the circular economy context, this research contributes to water footprint reduction and the sustainability of the pig farming production chain. The economic and environmental analysis of the route is suggested to enable its implementation on a large scale, as well as further technical feasibility research (reactor types, exposure to external environment, evaluation of pathogen removal and animal feed supplementation from SWW microalgae biomass).

AB  - The host specificity of Fusarium oxysporum (Fox) formae speciales has been reported to be linked to effector proteins known as Secreted in Xylem (SIX). These genes are associated with the non-autonomous mobile element miniature impala (mimp), normally distributed on the accessory chromosomes. The pattern of mimp associated with effector genes has been used to predict candidate effector profiles which characterize Fox formae speciales. In this study, we demonstrate the pathogenicity of strains Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. radicis-lycopersici (Forl) ZUM2407 and Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. radicis-cucumerinum (Forc) V03-2g in a common host plant (cucumber) and compare their genomes. The Forl ZUM2407 genome lacks SIX genes and their homologs, in contrast to Forc V03-2g. We predicted the total number of mimp elements in the genome of Forl ZUM2407 to be three-fold less than that of Forc V03-2g (10 and 36 copies, respectively). The mimp distribution pattern in Forl ZUM2407 was completely different from that present in Forc V03-2g. Candidate effector profile analysis did not predict that Forl ZUM2407 was able to infect cucumber plants like Forc V03-2g. Therefore, we assume that Forl ZUM2407 has a different type of genome organization associated with pathogenicity, whose effector profile cannot be described using the mimp-based approach.

AB  - Sea level rise contributions from the Pine Island Glacier (PIG) are strongly modulated by the backstress that its floating extension - Pine Island Ice Shelf (PIIS) - exerts on the adjoining grounded ice. The front of PIIS has recently retreated significantly via calving, and satellite and theoretical analyses have suggested further retreat is inevitable. As well as inducing an instantaneous increase in ice flow, retreat of the PIIS front may result in increased ocean melting, by relaxing the topographic barrier to warm ocean water that is currently provided by a prominent seabed ridge. Recently published research (Bradley and others, 2022a) has shown that PIIS may exhibit a strong melting response to calving, with melting close to the PIG grounding line always increasing with ice front retreat. Here, we summarise this research and, additionally, place the results in a glaciological context by comparing the impact of melt-induced and ice-dynamical changes in the ice shelf thinning rate. We find that while PIG is expected to experience rapid acceleration in response to further ice front retreat, the mean instantaneous thinning response is set primarily by changes in melting, rather than ice dynamics. Overall, further ice front retreat is expected to lead to enhanced ice-shelf thinning, with potentially detrimental consequences for ice shelf stability.

AB  - In this study, we explored the effects of dietary acorn on the meat quality and transcriptome profile of finishing Yuxi pigs. A total of 90 pigs (99.60 +/- 1.63 kg) were randomly assigned to three groups: the control group fed a commercial diet (CN), and two treatment groups fed 100 (AC1) and 300 (AC2) g/kg of acorns, respectively. Each group contained five replicates with six pigs per replicate. After a 120-day treatment period, the AC2 group showed significantly higher pH24h, a*, intramuscular fat, and umami amino acid and significantly lower L*, cooking loss, and shear force than the CN group (p < 0.05). Further, the AC2 group showed significantly increased glycogen, ATP, and ADP, creatine kinase activity, and myofiber density and significantly decreased glycolytic potential, lactic acid, and lactate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, phosphofructokinase muscle, and pyruvate kinase activities (p < 0.05). The mRNA levels of MYH7, MYH2, and MYH1 were significantly upregulated in the AC2 group (p < 0.05). A transcriptome analysis further revealed significant differences in gene expression patterns between the AC2 and CN groups. These findings suggest that dietary acorns at 300 g/kg improve pork quality by inducing the conversion of myofiber types and regulating glycolysis.

AB  - lncRNA (long non-coding RNA) has been confirmed to be associated with growth, development, cell proliferation, and other biological processes. This study explored the potential role and dynamic change process of lncRNAs and related ceRNA (competitive endogenous RNA) networks in skeletal muscle development of the Yangtze River Delta White (YDW) goat, and to analyze the differences in muscle fiber characteristics and meat quality levels of goats at different growth stages. In this study, we compared the expression profiles of lncRNAs in the M. Longissimus dorsi of the YDW goats at different stages of growth and development by RNA sequencing. The results revealed that, in terms of muscle fiber characteristics, muscle fiber diameter and muscle fiber area were significantly larger in 6-month-old and 10-month-old goats than those in 2-month-old goats (p < 0.01). In terms of muscle quality, a* and b* values of 6-month-old goats were significantly higher than those of 2-month-old goats (p < 0.01). Additionally, the a*, b*, and L* values of 6-month-old goats were significantly higher than those of 10-month-old goats (p < 0.01). The pH at 45 min post-mortem (pH45min) in 10-month-old goats was significantly higher than that in 2-month-old goats (p = 0.006). However, the pH at 24 h post-mortem (pH24h) in 10-month-old goats was significantly lower than that in both 2-month-old and 6-month-old goats (p < 0.01). Shear force increased gradually with age (p < 0.05), while there was no significant difference in drip loss among the different age groups (p > 0.05). Among the identified lncRNA expression profiles, a total of 3073 lncRNAs were found, including 2676 known lncRNAs and 397 novel lncRNAs. Of these, 110, 93, and 99 lncRNAs were specifically expressed in 2-month-old, 6-month-old, and 10-month-old goats, respectively. The lncRNA target gene enrichment analysis showed that they were mainly involved in actin binding, the actin cytoskeleton, the myocardin complex, as well as the AMPK, FoxO, and GnRH signaling pathways. When constructing the lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA ceRNA network, it was found that the ceRNA networks centered on chi-miR-758 and chi-miR-127-5p were involved in muscle development across all three periods, suggesting that they may play an important role in goat muscle growth and development.

AB  - Plants produce a range of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that mediate vital ecological interactions between herbivorous insects, their natural enemies, plants, and soil dwelling organisms including arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). The composition, quantity, and quality of the emitted VOCs can vary and is influenced by numerous factors such as plant species, variety (cultivar), plant developmental stage, root colonization by soil microbes, as well as the insect developmental stage, and level of specialization of the attacking herbivore. Understanding factors shaping VOC emissions is important and can be leveraged to enhance plant health and pest resistance. In this greenhouse study, we evaluated the influence of plant variety, mycorrhizal colonization, herbivory, and their interactions on the composition of emitted volatiles in tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum L.). Four tomato varieties from two breeding histories (two heirlooms and two hybrids), were used. Tomato plants were inoculated with a commercial inoculum blend consisting of four species of AMF. Plants were also subjected to herbivory by Manduca sexta (Lepidoptera: Sphingidae L.) five weeks after transplanting. Headspace volatiles were collected from inoculated and non-inoculated plants with and without herbivores using solid phase-microextraction. Volatile profiles consisted of 21 different volatiles in detectable quantities. These included monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and alkane hydrocarbons. We documented a strong plant variety effect on VOC emissions. AMF colonization and herbivory suppressed VOC emissions. Plant biomass was improved by colonization of AMF. Our results show that mycorrhization, herbivory and plant variety can alter tomato plant VOC emissions and further shape volatile-mediated insect and plant interactions.

AB  - Studies have shown that animal manures have a promoting effect in improving anaerobic digestion (AD). In this study, swine manure, chicken manure, and cattle manure (named in order SM, CM, and BM groups) were selected as co-digestion substrates of molasses vinasse (MV). The AD performance of three combinations was compared at the same organic loading rate (OLR) of different ratios (manure SCOD: MV SCOD of 1:1, 1:3, 1:5, 1:7, 1:9, stage I), and at the same ratio with increased OLR (ratio of 1:7, stage II) conditions. In stage I, all groups worked well for the 1:7 ratio, with CM performing better than the other groups. As the ratio increased to 1:9, the AD performances of all groups obviously decreased, while the BM group was more stable, with a soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) removal rate 11.7% higher than for the SM group and 12.2% for CM group. In stage II, the SCOD removal efficiency of the CM group was the best and reached 70.9 +/- 0.4%. The microbial community analyses indicated that the hydrogenotrophic methanogen Methanobacteriaceae were dominant in the CM group. Synergistaceae with the function of acetogenesis, and Anaerolineaceae with the function of hydrolyzing polysaccharides, were enriched in stages I and II, respectively. In stage I with the ratio of 1:9, the Anaeroli-neaceae and acetotrophic methanogens Methanosarcinaceae played an important role in the BM group. This study utilized waste as a mixed raw material without increasing the cost of raw materials, the optimal mixed co -digestion ratio and the tolerance to high OLR impact of the stable and efficient MV anaerobic system reactor were determined. The results provide a reference for the treatment of animal manure as a substrate for anaerobic co -digestion of MV and also provide promising potential for the engineering application of anaerobic co-digestion of MV in biogas plants.

AB  - Duckweed (Lemna) is a possible solution for the treatment of aqueous waste streams and the simultaneous provision of protein-rich biomass. Nitrification-Denitrification effluent (NDNE) from pig manure treatment has been previously used as a growing medium for duckweed. This study investigated the use of a continuous duckweed cultivation system to treat NDNE as a stand-alone technology. For this purpose, a system with a continuous supply of waste streams from the pig manure treatment, continuous biomass production, and continuous discharge that meets the legal standards in Flanders (Belgium) was simulated for a 175-day growing season. In this simulation, salt accumulation was taken into account. To prevent accumulating salts from reaching a toxic concentration and consequently inhibiting growth, the cultivation system must be buffered, which can be achieved by altering the depth of the system. To determine the minimum depth of such a system, a tray experiment was set up. For that, salt accumulation data obtained from previous research were used for simulating systems with different pond depths. It was found that a depth of at least 1 m is needed to prevent a significant relative growth inhibition at the end of the growing season compared to the start. This implies a high water consumption (5-10 times more than maize). As a response, a second cultivation system was investigated for the use of more concentrated NDNE. For this purpose, salt tolerance experiments were conducted on synthetic and biological media. Surprisingly, it was observed that duckweed grows better on diluted NDNE (to 75% NDNE, or EC of 8 mS/cm) than on a synthetic medium (EC of 1.5 mS/cm), indicating the potential of such a system.

AB  - Ammonia is one of the most important toxic metabolites in the intestine of animals. It can cause intestinal damage and associated intestinal diseases through different endogenous or exogenous stimuli. However, the definition of harmful ammonia concentration and the molecular mechanism of ammonia -induced intestinal epithelial injury remain unclear. In this study, we found that the viability of porcine IPEC-J2 intestinal epithelial cells significantly decreased with the increase of NH4Cl dose (20-80 mM). Ammonia (40 mM NH4Cl) increased the expression level of ammonia transporter RHCG and disrupted the intestinal barrier function of IPEC-J2 cells by reducing the expression levels of the tight junction molecules ZO-1 and Claudin-1. Ammonia caused elevated levels of ROS and apoptosis in IPEC-J2 cells. This was manifested by decreased activity of antioxidant enzymes SOD and GPx, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, and increased cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration. In addition, the expression levels of apoptosis-related molecules Caspase-9, Caspase-3, Fas, Caspase-8, p53 and Bax were increased, the expression level of anti-apoptotic molecule Bcl-2 was decreased. Moreover, the antioxidant NAC (N-acetyl-L-cysteamine) effectively alleviated ammonia-induced cytotoxicity, reduced ROS level, Ca2+ concentration, and the apoptosis of IPEC-J2 cells. The results suggest that ammonia-induced excess ROS triggered apoptosis through mitochondrial pathway, death receptor pathway and DNA damage. This study can provide reference and theoretical basis for the definition of harmful ammonia concentration in pig intestine and the effect and mechanism of ammonia on pig intestinal health.

AB  - Rhinovirus (RV), a prominent causative agent of both upper and lower respiratory diseases, ranks among the most prevalent human respiratory viruses. RV infections are associated with various illnesses, including colds, asthma exacerbations, croup and pneumonia, imposing significant and extended societal burdens. Characterized by a high mutation rate and genomic diversity, RV displays a diverse serological landscape, encompassing a total of 174 serotypes identified to date. Understanding RV genetic diversity is crucial for epidemiological surveillance and investigation of respiratory diseases. This study introduces a comprehensive and high-quality RV data resource, designated RVdb (http://rvdb.mgc.ac.cn), covering 26 909 currently identified RV strains, along with RV-related sequences, 3D protein structures and publications. Furthermore, this resource features a suite of web-based utilities optimized for easy browsing and searching, as well as automatic sequence annotation, multiple sequence alignment (MSA), phylogenetic tree construction, RVdb BLAST and a serotyping pipeline. Equipped with a user-friendly interface and integrated online bioinformatics tools, RVdb provides a convenient and powerful platform on which to analyse the genetic characteristics of RVs. Additionally, RVdb also supports the efforts of virologists and epidemiologists to monitor and trace both existing and emerging RV-related infectious conditions in a public health context.

AB  - Simple Summary The spiders, Pirata subpiraticus Bosenberg et Strand (Araneae: Lycosidae) and Pardosa pseudoannulata Bosenberg et Strand (Araneae: Lycosidae) are important natural enemies of many rice pests. Herbivore-induced plant volatiles can attract natural enemies to pest locations and are becoming important in integrated pest management. This study assessed the effects of herbivore-induced rice volatiles on the selection behavior, predation ability and field attraction of two species of spiders. The selection frequency of spiders for methyl salicylate, linalool, and 2-heptanone were significantly greater than the blank group. Methyl salicylate can shorten the predatory latency of male P. pseudoannulata and can also trap more P. pseudoannulata in the field. Linalool may also shorten the predatory latency of male P. subpiraticus and increase the daily predation capacity of female P. pseudoannulata. In summary, herbivore-induced rice volatiles attract P. pseudoannulata and P. subpiraticus, and potentially increase their pest control capability. These results provide support for the practical use of herbivore-induced rice volatiles to attract and retain spiders in rice fields. Spiders are important natural enemies of rice pests. Studying the effects of herbivore-induced rice volatiles on spider attraction and predation ability may lead to safer methods for pest prevention and control. In this study, four-arm olfactometer, predation ability experiment, and field trapping experiment were used to evaluate the effects of herbivore-induced rice volatiles on Pirata subpiraticus Bosenberg et Strand (Araneae: Lycosidae) and Pardosa pseudoannulata Bosenberg et Strand (Araneae: Lycosidae). The 0.5 mu g/mu L linalool concentration was attractive, and also shortened the predation latency in male P. subpiraticus and female P. pseudoannulata. The 0.5 mu g/mu L linalool concentration increased the daily predation capacity of female P. pseudoannulata. Male P. pseudoannulata were attracted to 1.0 g/L methyl salicylate, which also shortened their predation latency. In field experiments, methyl salicylate and linalool were effective for trapping spiders. Herbivore-induced rice volatiles attract rice field spiders and affect their predatory ability. These results suggest that herbivore-induced rice volatiles can be used to attract spiders and provide improved control of rice pests.

AB  - Candida albicans is an oral mucosal commensal fungus that transforms into an opportunistic pathogen under specific conditions, including immunosuppression. It causes oral and systemic candidiasis, which results in a significant health burden. Furthermore, an alarming rise in antifungal drug resistance in Candida species raises the urgent need for novel drugs and drug targets. C. albicans Dfg5 and Dcw1 are homologous cell wall alpha-1,6-mannosidases with critical functions and represent potential new drug targets. Our past studies have shown that Dfg5 and Dcw1 function in cell wall biogenesis through the cross-linking of glycoproteins into the cell wall, thus playing a key role in cell wall integrity. Additionally, Dfg5 and Dcw1 are required for hyphal morphogenesis. However, the exact functions of Dfg5 and Dcw1 in cell wall integrity, hyphal morphogenesis, and pathogenesis are not known. In this study, we determined the relation of Dfg5 and Dcw1 with Hog1 MAPK, which plays a key role in cell wall integrity via the regulation of chitin synthesis in C. albicans. Additionally, we also determined the effects of dfg5 and dcw1 mutations on the gene expression of transcriptional regulators of hyphal morphogenesis. Furthermore, we determined the effects of dfg5 and dcw1 mutations on pathogenesis in a mouse model of oral candidiasis. Our results demonstrate that dfg5 and dcw1 mutations, as well as a hog1 knockout mutation, result in the dysregulation of chitin synthesis, resulting in a cell separation defect. Heterozygous and conditional mutations in dfg5 and dcw1 resulted in decreased transcriptional levels of cst20, a positive regulator of hyphal morphogenesis. However, dfg5 and dcw1 mutations resulted in increased levels of all the five negative regulators of hyphal morphogenesis-Tup1, Nrg1, Mig1, Rbf1, and Rfg1. Additionally, Tup1 levels were significantly higher than other negative regulators, indicating that Dfg5 and Dcw1 function in hyphal morphogenesis by repressing Tup1. Finally, dfg5 and dcw1 mutations affected the ability of C. albicans to cause oral candidiasis in mice. Thus, the cell wall glycosidases Dfg5 and Dcw1 are required for virulence and pathogenesis and represent novel drug targets.

AB  - The prevalence of local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity among populations is critical to accurately predicting when and where climate change impacts will occur. Currently, comparisons of thermal performance between populations are untested for most marine species or overlooked by models predicting the thermal sensitivity of species to extirpation. Here we compared the ecological response and recovery of seagrass populations (Posidonia oceanica) to thermal stress throughout a year-long translocation experiment across a 2800-km gradient in ocean climate. Transplants in central and warm-edge locations experienced temperatures > 29 degrees C, representing thermal anomalies > 5 degrees C above long-term maxima for cool-edge populations, 1.5 degrees C for central and Cool-edge, central and warm-edge populations differed in thermal performance when grown under common conditions, but patterns contrasted with expectations based on thermal geography. Cool-edge populations did not differ from warm-edge populations under common conditions and performed significantly better than central populations in growth and survival. Our findings reveal that thermal performance does not necessarily reflect the thermal geography of a species. We demonstrate that warm-edge populations can be less sensitive to thermal stress than cooler, central populations suggesting that Mediterranean seagrasses have greater resilience to warming than current paradigms suggest.

AB  - Domestication is a selection process where animals become more docile and easier to handle than their wild counterparts. This selection for 'tameness' has been suggested to lead to several behavioral modifications in domesticated animals, such as becoming more social and more playful towards humans, and also less aggressive and less fearful than their wild counterparts. The first animal to be domesticated was the dog, which is well-known for their pro-social relationship with humans. In an attempt to understand which behavioral changes occurred when the dog was domesticated, we used wolf-dog hybrids as a proxy for wolves and compared their behavior with the behavior of German shepherds, Siberian huskies, and Alaskan malamutes, which were the main dog breeds they were mixed with. We found that wolf-dog hybrids were as social as the dogs and that they did not show any signs of aggression. While the wolf-dog hybrids were less playful than German shepherds, they had the same levels of human-directed playfulness as Siberian huskies and Alaskan malamutes. The long-lasting fear reactions of the wolf-dog hybrids in this study, while almost absent in the three dog breeds, suggest that this fearfulness is a heritage from wolves, while dogs have adapted during domestication to have less fearful reactions in human environments.

AB  - Salmonella typhimurium is one of the most widespread enteric pathogens causing enterocolitis in warm-blooded animals worldwide. It is frequently spread within pig production and threatens not only primary hosts but consumers of pork meat as well. Overall, finding novel non-antibiotic agents is desirable in preventing salmonellosis outbreaks or reducing ongoing illness, where multi-strain probiotics are promising adepts. We tested a multi-strain bacterial mixture in the gnotobiotic piglet model to verify potential probiotic and anti-Salmonella properties in vivo. The bacterial consortium colonized the gut successfully and protected piglet hosts against Salmonella translocation to the blood system. Thus, the assembled bacterial mix has a promising potential for probiotic intervention in pig production management. Probiotics are a potential strategy for salmonellosis control. A defined pig microbiota (DPM) mixture of nine bacterial strains previously exhibited probiotic and anti-Salmonella properties in vitro. Therefore, we evaluated its gut colonization ability and protection effect against S. typhimurium LT2-induced infection in the gnotobiotic piglet model. The DPM mixture successfully colonized the piglet gut and was stable and safe until the end of the experiment. The colon was inhabited by about 9 log CFU g(-1) with a significant representation of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli compared to ileal levels around 7-8 log CFU g(-1). Spore-forming clostridia and bacilli seemed to inhabit the environment only temporarily. The bacterial consortium contributed to the colonization of the gut at an entire length. The amplicon profile analysis supported the cultivation trend with a considerable representation of lactobacilli with bacilli in the ileum and bifidobacteria with clostridia in the colon. Although there was no significant Salmonella-positive elimination, it seems that the administered bacteria conferred the protection of infected piglets because of the slowed delayed infection manifestation without translocations of Salmonella cells to the blood circulation. Due to its colonization stability and potential protective anti-Salmonella traits, the DPM mixture has promising potential in pig production applications. However, advanced immunological tests are needed.

AB  - This study examined enteric and excreta emissions from cattle and pigs with a focus on effects of changed feeding practices. We assessed the impact of a revision of the Austrian Greenhouse Gas and Air Pollutant Inventory (national method, NM), i.e., the implementation of the Tier2-method of the IPCC-2019 guidelines, to a more dynamic integration of past and present feeding practices. Cattle-in particular, dairy cows-had the highest contribution to enteric CH4 emissions and to nitrogen (N-ex) and volatile-solid (VSex) excretion, independent of the assessment method (NM or IPCC-2019). These emissions as well as excreta quantities are directly associated with feeding. The most relevant changes from implementing IPCC-2019 were (i) reduced enteric CH4 over the entire time series and (ii) increased N-ex and VSex, especially for the period from 1990 to 2005. Additionally, uncertainties in the emissions and excreta were analyzed and related to the quantities of protein consumed. From 1990 to 2020, favorable trends per unit of protein were shown due to increased performance and concomitantly reduced animal numbers. The changes were especially pronounced for CH4, N-ex, and VSex from dairy cows (-40% to -46%) but also substantial for other cattle (-26% to -31%), breeding pigs (-12% to -28%), and partially growing-fattening pigs (-3% to -20%). Future mitigation potential may result from reduced dietary crude-protein content, especially in pigs, and the use of feed additives. Feed additives for ruminants with enteric CH4-mitigating effects showed a particularly high reduction potential for the total amount of greenhouse gases from the livestock sector.

AB  - Aesculus indica, the Indian Horse Chestnut (IHCN), is a wild tree species indigenous to the temperate forests of the Himalayas. The seeds of this tree are abundant in carbohydrates but are not edible because they contain a very significant quantity of bitter saponins. Indigenous tribes in the Chamba district of Himachal Pradesh possess a unique traditional knowledge of separating saponins and other impurities from starch. Once this process is over, the resultant product is used as food and medicine. The starch complex, locally known as Seek, is used to prepare several dishes for auspicious occasions. Seek is used as a noncereal diet during fasting, and to keep young children and the elderly warm during the chilly winter months. The local population utilizes the seeds to treat ailments like joint pain, fatigue, diabetes, venous insufficiency, phlebitis, hemorrhoids, ulcers, thrombosis, colic, etc. IHCN has a high energy value, superior starch quality, and a variety of secondary metabolites. These qualities make it a promising raw material for the nutraceutical, functional food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industries. The utilization of plant components through local indigenous knowledge, as well as their distribution, botany, and ecology, have been described in the present study. Inventorization of the production and productivity of the tree, selection of better and high-yielding germplasm, mechanized processing, value addition, and popularization would be helpful to develop sustainable management practices for IHCN and improve the livelihood and nutritional security of the tribal population residing in the remote localities of Western Himalayas.

AB  - The reuniens (Re) nucleus is located in the ventral midline thalamus. It has fostered increasing interest, not only for its participation in a variety of cognitive functions (e.g., spatial working memory, systemic consolidation, reconsolidation, extinction of fear or generalization), but also for its neuroanatomical positioning as a bidirectional relay between the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the hippocampus (HIP). In this review we compile and discuss recent studies having tackled a possible implication of the Re nucleus in behavioral flexibility, a major PFC-dependent executive function controlling goal-directed behaviors. Experiments considered explored a possible role for the Re nucleus in perseveration, reversal learning, fear extinction, and set-shifting. They point to a contribution of this nucleus to behavioral flexibility, mainly by its connections with the PFC, but possibly also by those with the hippocampus, and even with the amygdala, at least for fear-related behavior. As such, the Re nucleus could be a crucial crossroad supporting a PFC-orchestrated ability to cope with new, potentially unpredictable environmental contingencies, and thus behavioral flexibility and adaption.

AB  - Nanotechnology and its applications have advanced significantly in recent decades, contributing to various fields, including reproduction. This study introduces a novel method to label porcine oocytes with nanoparticles (NPs) bound to oviductin (OVGP1, Ov) for use in Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ARTs). Despite promising developments, concerns about NP toxicity in gametes necessitate thorough investigation. This research aims to assess the impact of functionalized NPs (NPOv) on sperm functionality. Boar sperm were co-incubated with NPOv for 0, 0.5 and 1 h in two media: BTS (semen dilution and conservation) and TALP (sperm capacitation and in vitro fertilization-IVF). Sperm quality parameters (viability, motility and kinematics) showed no significant differences in TALP medium (p > .05). In BTS, although some kinetic parameters were altered, motility, progressive motility and viability remained unaffected (p > .05). Additionally, NPs presence on the zona pellucida (ZP) of oocytes did not affect sperm attachment (p > .05). In conclusion, in vitro exposure of boar sperm to OVGP1-functionalized NPs in IVF medium or attached to the ZP surface of matured oocytes does not impair sperm functionality, including their binding ability to the ZP.

AB  - Grasses accumulate large amounts of silicon (Si) which acts as a highly effective physical defence against insect herbivory, however recent evidence shows that Si supplementation also modifies plant secondary metabolite concetrations. Changes in plant secondary metabolites concentrations can have cascading effects on higher trophic levels, such as parasitoids, as they are dependent on the host herbivore for growth and development. However, relatively little is known about how Si application affects higher trophic levels. We examined the effects of Si addition on alkaloid content in leaves of Phalaris aquatica (Poaceae) and the effect on interactions between an aphid (Rhopalosiphum padi) and its parasitoid (Aphidius colemani). Si supplementation had no effect on aphid abundance or parasitism rate. Adult aphids, aphid mummies (parasitised aphids) and the emergent parasitoids were, however, significantly smaller on Si+ plants. Parasitoid traits (size and emergence) were correlated with aphid mummy size. Si addition reduced parasitoid emergence rate and size due to reduced host mummy size, in addition, significantly fewer females emerged from mummies on Si+ plants. Aphid infestation significantly altered alkaloids concentrations, reducing gramine by 80% while increasing tryptamine by 91% in Si- plants. Si addition reduced aphid-induced tryptamine concentrations by 64% and increased 5-MeO-tryptamine by over 800% in control and 142% in aphid infested plants. Our results show that while Si addition has modest impacts on the herbivore, it significantly alters secondary metabolites and has stronger effects on the higher trophic level through changes in the quality of the parasitised host.

AB  - The behavioral and physiological patterns of pigs are key indicators for assessing their health status. This study aims to explore the differences in activity level and body temperature variation patterns between normal and abnormal pigs. In view of the characteristics of pig ear tag data, such as high volatility, unclear features and strong randomness, we adopted various processing and analysis methods. The main work of this paper includes: (1) Preprocessing and integrating pig ear tag data to improve data quality; (2) Performing similarity and time series analysis on the daily data of each pig to identify the change patterns of activity level and body temperature; (3) Performing seasonal feature analysis and trend change analysis on the data of the pig population, finding the gap between abnormal pigs and the population pattern, and classifying abnormal and normal pigs. The main results and conclusions of this paper are as follows: (1) Pigs are most active in two time periods: 5:00 to 10:00 in the morning and 14:00 to 18:00 in the afternoon; (2) The activity duration of lame pigs is significantly lower than that of normal pigs, while the activity duration of pigs under other abnormal conditions is not much different; (3) Although the ear tag temperature data is affected by the pig's behavior, abnormal pigs can be found by the characteristic of low temperature trend within a day. (4) Random forest algorithm can effectively classify normal and abnormal pigs, with an accuracy of 0.879. The research results of this paper have important significance and value for realizing the refined management of pigs, improving the breeding efficiency, and ensuring the health and production safety of pigs.

AB  - Simple Summary Recently, stimbiotics (STB) have been suggested as a non-digestible and fermentable additive that can improve microbial fibre fermentation. This study observed that STB could improve immunity and IGF-1 levels in plasma, regulate the faecal microbial community, and have a positive effect on weaned piglets' feed intake and daily weight gain. Based on the results of this study, weaned piglets' growth performance was highly improved with STB inclusion in the diet, and this could provide a basis for its use in pig production. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of dietary supplementation with stimbiotics (STB) on growth performance, diarrhoea incidence, plasma antioxidant capacity, immunoglobulin concentration and hormone levels, and faecal microorganisms in weaned piglets. Compared with the control (CT) group, the addition of STB improved the body weight (BW) of piglets on days 28 and 42 (p < 0.05) and increased daily weight gain and daily feed intake from days 14-28 and throughout the trial period (p < 0.05). Correspondingly, the plasma insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) level on day 42 was significantly improved by STB (p < 0.05). VistaPros (VP) group levels of immunoglobulin (Ig) A and G were significantly higher on days 14 and 42 (p < 0.05) than the CT group levels. In addition, the activity of plasma catalase tended to be increased on day 14 (p = 0.053) in the VP group, as for superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and malondialdehyde, STB did not significantly affect their levels (p > 0.05). Moreover, dietary STB increased the relative abundance of beneficial bacteria, including norank_f_Muribaculaceae, Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group, Parabacteroides, and unclassified_f__Oscillospiraceae. In summary, STB improved the immunity and IGF-1 levels in the plasma of weaned piglets and consequently promoted the growth performance of weaned piglets.

AB  - Plants are continuously challenged by several environmental stresses that impair their growth and production performances. Stresses encountered by plants can be caused by biotic agents (e.g., herbivores, parasitic microorganisms, weeds) and abiotic factors (e.g., cold, drought, soil and water salinity). Despite these differences, plants respond to biotic and abiotic stresses with shared adaptive mechanisms resulting in complex and inter linked cross-talks. Systemin is a hormone peptide, playing a central role in the regulation of plant response against a wide range of stress agents, including wound, phytopathogenic fungi and phytophagous and sucking insects. It has also been shown that upregulation of prosystemin, the precursor protein of systemin, enhanced the tolerance of tomato plants to salt stress, indicating that systemin induced molecular adaptations to biotic stress can also be beneficial to plants exposed to salt stress. Considering that systemin is a small peptide that can be sensed by plants both as soil drench and foliar applications, we hypothesized that exogenous applications of systemin may increase salt stress tolerance in tomato plants through the activation of multiple adaptation mechanisms. Here we report that a soil drench picomolar solution of systemin increases tomato salt stress tolerance by i) activating of SOS1, NHX and HKT Na+ transporters in leaves ii) enhancing the cellular antioxidant power, and iii) balancing the protease activity induced by salt stress. Activation of these responses upon exogeneous application of systemin was highly correlated to an improved tomato growth under salt stress, suggesting that systemin may represent an important component of the crosstalk between biotic and abiotic stress responses in plants.

AB  - The tea plant (Camellia sinensis) is an important economic crop, which is becoming increasingly popular worldwide, and is now planted in more than 50 countries. Tea green leafhopper is one of the major pests in tea plantations, which can significantly reduce the yield and quality of tea during the growth of plant. In this study, we report a genome assembly for DuyunMaojian tea plants using a combination of Oxford Nanopore Technology PromethION((TM)) with high-throughput chromosome conformation capture technology and used multi-omics to study how the tea plant responds to infestation with tea green leafhoppers. The final genome was 3.08 Gb. A total of 2.97 Gb of the genome was mapped to 15 pseudo-chromosomes, and 2.79 Gb of them could confirm the order and direction. The contig N50, scaffold N50 and GC content were 723.7 kb, 207.72 Mb and 38.54%, respectively. There were 2.67 Gb (86.77%) repetitive sequences, 34,896 protein-coding genes, 104 miRNAs, 261 rRNA, 669 tRNA, and 6,502 pseudogenes. A comparative genomics analysis showed that DuyunMaojian was the most closely related to Shuchazao and Yunkang 10, followed by DASZ and tea-oil tree. The multi-omics results indicated that phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, alpha-linolenic acid metabolism, flavonoid biosynthesis and 50 differentially expressed genes, particularly peroxidase, played important roles in response to infestation with tea green leafhoppers (Empoasca vitis Gothe). This study on the tea tree is highly significant for its role in illustrating the evolution of its genome and discovering how the tea plant responds to infestation with tea green leafhoppers will contribute to a theoretical foundation to breed tea plants resistant to insects that will ultimately result in an increase in the yield and quality of tea.

AB  - L-3,4-Dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) is a compound with strong allelopathic effects on Brassicaceae, Asteraceae, Cucurbitaceae and Hydrophyllaceae species. Although Gramineae are less affected by L-DOPA with respect to their root growth, metabolic routes that protect them from L-DOPA toxicity are poorly understood. We identified a DOPA glucoside in maize (Zea mays L., Gramineae) roots and leaves, but DOPA aglycon was not detectable in maize. Accordingly, when maize seedlings were exposed to L-DOPA solution, DOPA glucoside concentrations increased in maize leaves, suggesting that absorbed L-DOPA is rapidly converted to glucoside conjugate. When DOPA glucoside solution was applied to lettuce seeds (Lactuca sativa; Asteraceae), lettuce radicle growth was less inhibited compared to free L-DOPA. Considering that maize radicle growth is less affected by free L-DOPA, it is likely that maize seedlings protect themselves from toxicity by L-DOPA glucosylation. Interestingly, a developmental stage dependent variation in DOPA glucoside concentration was observed with highest level of metabolite detected in L2 stage maize leaves. As DOPA glucoside also increased in maize during herbivory by the bird cherry-oat aphid (Rhopalosiphum padi L.) and the Graminae generalist armyworm (Mythimna loreyi), as well as in response to treatment with the plant hormones, we propose that DOPA glucoside might be involved in various stress responses and/or defense in maize seedlings.

AB  - Premise The evolution of sex chromosomes is driven by sexual dimorphism, yet it can be challenging to document sexually dimorphic traits in dioecious plant species. At the genetic level, sexual dimorphism can be identified through sequence variation between females and males associated with sexually antagonistic traits and different fitness optima. This study aims to examine sexual dimorphism for 26 traits in three populations of Salix purpurea (a diversity panel and F-1 and F-2 populations) and determine the effect of the traits on biomass yield, a key trait in Salix bioenergy crops across multiple years, locations, and under manipulated growth conditions. Methods Sexual dimorphism was evaluated for morphological, phenological, physiological, and wood composition traits in a diversity panel of unrelated S. purpurea accessions and in full-sib F-1 and F-2 families produced through controlled cross pollinations and grown in replicated field trials. Results We observed sexual dimorphism in the timing of development for several traits that were highly predictive of biomass yield across three populations of S. purpurea. Across all populations and years surveyed, males had significantly shallower branching angle. Male plants highly predictive of biomass yield across three populations of S. purpurea also accumulated more nitrogen under fertilizer amendment as measured by SPAD in the diversity panel and had greater susceptibility to the rust fungus Melampsora americana in the F-2 family. Allometric modelling of biomass yield showed an effect of sex and of location on the interaction between yield and stem height. Conclusions These results provide evidence of sexual dimorphism for certain traits in S. purpurea that may be involved in sex chromosome evolution.

AB  - Introduction: The hair follicle (HF) is a micro-organ capable of regeneration. A HF cycle consists of an anagen, catagen and telogen. Abnormalities in the HF cycle can lead to many hair disorders such as hair loss. The pig is a good biomedical model, but there are few data on their HF cycle. The aim of this study was to classify the pig HF cycle and determine the feasibility of the pig as an animal model for human HF cycle. Methods: Skin samples from 10 different postnatal (P) days Yorkshire pigs was collected to determine the key time points of the first HF cycle in pig by H&E staining, immunofluorescence staining, q-PCR and western-blot. Results: By morphological observation and detection of markers at different stages, pig HF cycle was classified into three main periods - the first anagen until P45, catagen (P45-P85), telogen (P85-P100), and next anagen (>P100). In addition, we examined the expression of important genes AE15, CD34, Versican, Ki67 et al. related to the HF cycle at different stages of pig HF, indicating that pig and human share similarities in morphology and marker gene expression patterns of HF cycle. Discussion: Our findings will facilitate the study of HF cycle and offer researchers a suitable model for human hair research.

AB  - In the Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV) of south Texas, native thornscrub forest restoration has been ongoing for the past four decades, yet few assessments of their efficacy exist, and no study has yet quantified species-specific responses. Seedling transplantation in conjunction one or more restoration interventions (RIs) remains the method of choice at most sites, and thus the initial months following transplantation, when seedlings are especially vulnerable to drought and animal damage, are a critical time for determining restoration success. To this end, we evaluated the survival, growth, and animal damage of 3600 native seedlings of 24 thornforest species in response to RIs incorporating a combination of seedling shelters and slow-release moisture, as well as a mycorrhizae-biostimulant admixture (MBS). We surveyed seedlings on a bi-monthly basis over one year following planting at a semi-arid upland site in the LRGV. We found that while shelters had a pronounced and lasting impact on height growth (increased by 15?27% on average), reduction of mortality by seedling shelter RIs was only modest (reduced on average by 5?12% per species), with significant benefits accruing from cocoon shelters only, which provide slow-release moisture to the seedling roots during the initial month after planting. Species-specific responses were the most variable, with mortality ranging from 8 to 69%. While shelters in some cases reduced mammalian herbivory, the growth of leggier stems and degradation of biodegradable shelters may reduce their overall efficacy. We conclude that thornforest restoration may be most effective when seedling performance is considered in species selection and costly restoration interventions are applied on species-specific basis. These results contribute an important first step towards optimizing forest restoration efforts in the LRGV on the basis of species identity and kickstart a species-specific database of seedling demographic responses in semiarid forest restoration.

AB  - Domestic herbivores show a strong motivation to form associations with conspecifics and the social dynamics of any group is dependant on the individuals within the group. Thus, common farm management practices such mixing may cause social disruption. Social integration of new group members has previously been defined as a lack of aggressive interactions within the group. However, a lack of aggression among group members may not represent full integration into the social group. Here we observe the impact of disrupting groups of cattle via the introduction of an unfamiliar individual, on the social network patterns of six groups of cattle. Cattle contacts between all individuals in a group were recorded before and after the introduction of the unfamiliar individual. Pre-introduction, resident cattle showed preferential associations with specific individuals in the group. Post-introduction, resident cattle reduced the strength of their contacts (e.g., frequency) with each other relative to the pre-introduction phase. Unfamiliar individuals were socially isolated from the group throughout the trial. The observed social contact patterns suggest that new group members are socially isolated from established groups longer than previously thought, and common farm mixing practices may have negative welfare conse-quences on introduced individuals.

AB  - The consumption of wild red deer (Cervus elaphus) meat is growing due to its nutritional benefits and sustainability. However, challenges like a shorter shelf life and increased microbial load of game meat highlight the need to investigate effective preservation techniques. This study investigated the effects of high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) on the quality parameters of wild red deer meat, including pH, color characteristics, microbial load, texture attributes, and protein stability, assessed on different days. Wild red deer meat was treated with pressures ranging from 150 to 600 MPa, followed by storage at 4 degrees C for up to 14 days. Results showed that HHP at or above 300 MPa stabilized pH and suppressed microbial growth. On Day 1, the control samples had a microbial count of 4.67 log CFU/g, while treatments at or above 500 MPa reduced microbial levels to below 1 log CFU/g. Texture analysis revealed improved tenderness at lower pressures (150-300 MPa) and enhanced firmness at higher pressures. Color parameters, including lightness and redness, were also influenced by HHP, as lightness increased with pressure, while redness decreased at higher pressure levels. SDS-PAGE analysis indicated protein denaturation, especially at >= 300 MPa, with significant degradation of sarcoplasmic and myofibrillar proteins at >= 500 MPa. These findings suggest that HHP can be an effective method for improving certain quality parameters and extending the shelf life of wild red deer meat up to 14 days of storage, depending on the pressure level applied.

AB  - Studies in humans and animals suggest that seminal plasma, the acellular seminal fluid component, stimulates the endometrium to promote immune tolerance and facilitate implantation. We designed a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial to investigate changes in the endometrial transcriptomic profile after vaginal application of seminal plasma. The study participants were randomized into two groups. Five women received a vaginal application of seminal plasma, and four received a placebo application with saline solution. The application was performed 2 days after HCG-triggered ovulation in an unstimulated cycle. After 5-8 days, an endometrial biopsy was collected to analyze differences in the endometrial transcriptomic profile using microarray analyses. A differential gene expression analysis and a gene set analysis were performed. The gene set enrichment analysis showed a positive enrichment of pathways associated with the immune response, cell viability, proliferation, and cellular movement. Moreover, pathways involved in implantation, embryo development, oocyte maturation, and angiogenesis were positively enriched. The differential gene expression analysis, after adjusting for multiple testing, showed no significantly differentially expressed genes between the two groups. A comparative analysis was also performed with similar studies conducted in other animals or in vitro using human endometrial cells. The comparative analysis showed that the effect of seminal plasma effect on the endometrium is similar in pigs, mice, and in vitro human endometrial cells. The present study provides evidence that seminal plasma might impact the endometrium during the implantation window, with potential to affect endometrial receptivity and embryo development.

AB  - Mutualistic species often must survive periods of their development without their mutualist partner, but we lack a clear understanding of the ecological mechanisms that maintain mutualisms despite these gaps in partnership. In ant-plant protection mutualisms, plants house ant colonies that deter herbivores. Yet juvenile ant-plants often lack symbiotic ant colonies and must withstand herbivory pressure until they are colonized by ants. A sapling's ability to host ants or to employ alternative direct defenses, such as leaf secondary metabolites, may depend on access to key resources, like light, soil nutrients, and water. Alternatively, juvenile ant-plants may receive biotic protection at little resource cost from generalist predators, such as spiders. We examined whether juvenile Cecropia trees maintained leaf defenses, and whether sapling ant and chemical defenses were associated with the sapling's access to resources. We surveyed three species of naturally occurring juvenile Cecropia trees across a rainfall gradient in northwest Costa Rica. We found that both ant defense and chemical defense were regulated by the availability of light, soil fertility, and water in Cecropia saplings. Rather than trade off, larger saplings and saplings with more resources were more likely to invest in both defense strategies, whereas smaller saplings and saplings with fewer resources appeared to have little leaf defense. We also found that although spiders were common on such resource-poor, undefended saplings, spiders did not reduce herbivory. This study highlights the importance of resource availability in determining the performance of ant-plants during early ontogenetic stages.

AB  - Effective waste management is a major challenge for Small Island Developing States (SIDS) like Maldives due to limited land availability. Maldives exemplifies these issues as one of the most geographically dispersed countries, with a population unevenly distributed across numerous islands varying greatly in size and population density. This study provides an in-depth analysis of the unique waste management practices across different regions of Maldives in relation to its natural and socioeconomic context. Data shows Maldives has one of the highest population density and per capita waste generation among SIDS, despite its small land area and medium GDP per capita. Large disparities exist between the densely populated capital Male' with only 5.8 km2 area generating 63% of waste and the similar to 194 scattered outer islands with ad hoc waste management practices. Given Male's dense population and high calorific waste, incineration could generate up to similar to 30 GW/a energy and even increase Maldives' renewable energy supply by 200%. In contrast, decentralized anaerobic digestion presents an optimal solution for outer islands to reduce waste volume while providing over 40%-100% energy supply for daily cooking in local families. This timely study delivers valuable insights into designing context-specific waste-to-energy systems and integrated waste policies tailored to Maldives' distinct regions. The framework presented can also guide other SIDS facing similar challenges as Maldives in establishing sustainable, ecologically sound waste management strategies.

AB  - Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies are fatal neurodegenerative diseases caused by the misfolding of the cellular prion protein (PrPC) into its pathological isoform (PrPSc). Efficient transmission of PrPSc occurs within the same species, but a species barrier limits interspecies transmission. While PrP structure is largely conserved among mammals, variations at the beta 2-alpha 2 loop are observed, and even minor changes in the amino acid sequence of the beta 2-alpha 2 loop can significantly affect transmission efficiency. The present study shows that the introduction of the elk/deer-specific amino acid substitutions at positions 169 (Ser to Asn) and 173 (Asn to Thr) into the mouse prion protein, which are associated with the structural rigidity of the beta 2-alpha 2 loop, has a substantial impact on protein dynamics as well as on the misfolding pathways of the protein. Native state hydrogen-deuterium exchange studies coupled with mass spectrometry, show that the rigid loop substitutions stabilize not only the beta 2-alpha 2 loop but also the C-terminal end of alpha 3, suggesting that molecular interactions between these two segments are strengthened. Moreover, the energy difference between the native state and multiple misfolding-prone partially unfolded forms (PUFs) present at equilibrium, is increased. The decreased accessibility of the PUFs from the native state leads to a slowing down of the misfolding of the protein. The results of this study provide important insights into the early events of conformational conversion of prion protein into beta-rich oligomers, and add to the evidence that the beta 2-alpha 2 loop is a key determinant in prion protein aggregation.

AB  - Insect meals, which have emerged as a sustainable protein source in animal nutrition, are also rich in calcium and phosphorus and thus might be a valuable source for supplying these minerals in farm animals. The aim of the present study was to determine the apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of these minerals from commercially available partially defatted meals of Hermetia illucens (HI) larvae in growing pigs. According to a difference approach, twenty male growing pigs with an average body weight of around 30 kg were divided into five groups of four pigs each and fed either a basal diet or the basal diet blended with one of three HI meals or monocalcium phosphate (MCP, as a positive control) for 14 days. Calcium and phosphorus ATTD were determined, by using the indicator method with acid-insoluble ash as an indigestible marker. Calcium ATTD on average of the three HI meals was 71.2%, ranging from 60.7% to 77.0%, and the ATTD of phosphorus was 80.6%, with a range of 70.8% to 88.9%. Calcium and phosphorus ATTD of MCP were 95.0% and 82.8%, respectively. The study shows that calcium and phosphorus from HI meals exhibit a relatively high ATTD in pigs, similar to that observed from inorganic mineral sources. Thus, HI meal could substantially contribute to the supply of calcium and phosphorus to pigs, thus opening the possibility to conserve scarce minerals resources such as phosphate-rich rocks for pig nutrition.

AB  - Analysis of animal remains in faeces is usually overlooked when investigating the nutrition of herbivores. In studies involving herbivores, the identification of consumed animal taxa becomes a secondary task in comparison with the analysis of basic plant forage. The identification of invertebrates consumed by herbivores, however, can be a valuable source of data for mammalian ecologists. In total, 611 faecal samples were analysed, and invertebrates were found in 232 samples (38%). This allowed us to discern several ecological relationships of the rodent. For example, sapromycetophages and chortophiles in dormice faeces indicated that rodents fed on the previous year's seeds scavenged from the ground. Numerous insect larvae were found developing in the woody substrate remaining in dormice faeces, thus confirming the use of hollows as shelters. Coprophages and coprophage predators were also found in dormice faeces. Notably, two ectoparasite species were identified in the study area for the first time. The analysis of invertebrate species diversity in dormice faeces represented an imprint of the ecological relationships of herbivorous species. The identification of arthropods may be used as a method for short-term studies of the ecological relationships of other species, including rare ones and species in non-inherent habitats.

AB  - Pissodes castaneus (Coleoptera, Curculionidae) is one of the most dangerous pests to Scots pine Pinus sylvestris reforestations and thickets weakened by various biotic (root diseases and herbivorous mammals) and abiotic (drought, shortage, frost, hail, etc.) factors. In the case of a massive occurrence of P. castaneus, the growth of shoots can be inhibited, but the feeding of larvae is more harmful to trees as it leads to the death of trees during growing season. In the 20th century, P. castaneus was not the subject of much research in biology, ecology, and methods of population control which is due to the fact that this species was not an economic problem for a long time. The lack of effective and environmentally safe methods to protect young Scots pine stands from P. castaneus warranted conducting research to develop methods to monitor and limit its population. The objective of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of using the breeding trap method for monitoring the number of P. castaneus. The research was conducted from 2020-2022 in P. sylvestris reforestations aged 3-7 years and located in the Wyszkow Forest District (central Poland). The traps consisted of stems of live Scots pines without branches, 5-15 cm in diameter and about 1.5 m in length, dug in May each year at a depth of about 0.5 m in rows of up to 10 pieces/ha. After 6 months, the traps were dug up and the sections in the soil were debarked to a depth of 20 cm along with the aboveground section to a height of 20 cm. The larvae and pupal chambers of P. castaneus were counted in the debarked sections. The obtained results were converted to 1 dm2. In addition, the relationship between the number of P. castaneus and its pupal chambers was found, and the diameter of the piles was determined. In addition, the cost of the tested method was compared with the cost of the previously used method to control P. castaneus which consisted of uprooting and removing infested trees. The evaluation of breeding trap colonization revealed that P. castaneus inhabited only the under- ground section of the breeding traps (from 0 to -0.2 m) as evidenced by the presence of larvae in feeding tunnels and pupal chambers as well as pupal chambers left by beetles - up to a maximum of 8 pieces/dm2 and on average 3.8 +/- 1.5 pieces/dm2. The analysis of the relationship between the number of larvae and pupal chambers and the diameter of the traps showed a higher prob- ability of colonization by P. castaneus in traps with a diameter of 10-15 cm. The tested method, with the use of up to 10 traps per 1 ha, was characterized by lower implementation costs compared to the costs of P. castaneus controls by uprooting and removing of infested trees. The results indicate the usefulness of breeding traps for monitoring the occurrence of this pest in young Scots pine stands.

AB  - Trueperella pyogenes can cause various infections in the organs and tissues of different livestock (including pigs, cows, goats, and sheep), including mastitis, endometritis, pneumonia, or abscesses. Moreover, diseases induced by T. pyogenes cause significant economic losses in animal husbandry. In recent large-scale investigations, T. pyogenes has been identified as one of the main pathogens causing endometritis in lactating cows. However, the main treatment for the above-mentioned diseases is still currently antibiotic therapy. Understanding the impact of endometritis associated with T. pyogenes on the fertility of cows can help optimize antibiotic treatment for uterine diseases, thereby strategically concentrating the use of antimicrobials on the most severe cases. Therefore, it is particularly important to continuously monitor the prevalence of T. pyogenes and test its drug resistance. This study compared the uterine microbiota of healthy cows and endometritis cows in different cattle farms, investigated the prevalence of T. pyogenes, evaluated the genetic characteristics and population structure of isolated strains, and determined the virulence genes and drug resistance characteristics of T. pyogenes. An amount of 186 dairy cows were involved in this study and 23 T. pyogenes strains were isolated and identified from the uterine lavage fluid of dairy cows with or without endometritis.

AB  - In laboratories, classical fear conditioning and extinction procedures are commonly used to study the behavioral and neural mechanisms underlying fear regulation. Contextual fear conditioning involves the association of an aversive event with the environment where it occurs, which engages the hippocampus and its interactions with the amygdala. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), divided into the lateral OFC (lOFC) and medial OFC (mOFC) subregions, plays a crucial role in integrating contextual information from the hippocampus and modulating behavioral responses based on the anticipated outcomes of the context. Because of the extensive anatomical connections of the OFC with the fear circuit, including the hippocampus, the amygdala, and the medial prefrontal cortex, and the reasoning that proper retrieval of fear-related memory is context-dependent, we raised the question to investigate the ability of the animals to discriminate between contexts when they were trained under differential OFC activation levels during the encoding of contextual fear memory. In this study, we conducted a contextual fear conditioning procedure in rats using footshock as an unconditioned stimulus (US), followed by the test of their fear levels in contexts same (dangerous) or different (safe) from the conditioning context. We used a pharmacological approach to modulate the activation levels of the lOFC or the mOFC during conditioning to examine their roles on context-specific fear encoding. Our findings showed that the animals could accurately distinguish between the two contexts in control and OFC hypoactivation groups, but failed to do so if they were trained under OFC hyperactivation. Therefore, OFC hyperactivity disturbed the encoding of contextual information during fear acquisition.

AB  - Plants respond to herbivory in diverse, complex ways, ranging from avoidance or tolerance to indirect defense mechanisms such as attracting natural enemies of herbivores, i.e., parasitoids or predators, to strengthen their defense. Defense provided by parasitoids to cultivated plants is well documented and is used in biological control programs. However, its effectiveness on wild plants under natural conditions has been little studied. Such is the case of the cactus Myrtilllocactus geometrizans (known in Mexico as garambullo), which is consumed by the soft-scale insect Toumeyella martinezae (herbivore) which, in turn, is host to the parasitoid wasp Mexidalgus toumeyellus, and mutualist with the ant Liometopum apiculatum, that tenders and protects it. This study explores the role of the parasitoid as an indirect defense, by examining its effect on both the herbivore and the plant, and how this interaction is affected by the presence of the mutualistic ant. We found that scales adversely affect the cactus' growth, flower, and fruit production, as well as its progeny's performance, as seedlings from scale-infested garambullo plants were shorter, and it also favors the presence of fungus (sooty mold). The parasitoid responded positively to herbivore abundance, but the presence of ants reduced the intensity of parasitism. Our results show that parasitoids can function as an indirect defense, but their effectiveness is reduced by the presence of the herbivore's mutualistic ant.

AB  - The relative palatability of woody perennials ' fodder has been proposed as the selection criteria for species to be integrated in livestock systems. For that purpose, 20 species with different nutritional characteristics, that grow in the tropical dry forest of Colombia, were evaluated. The woody perennials were managed under pruning, in plots established at the Agrosavias Nataima Research Center. Fodder of those species was offered to five mature Blanco Orejinegro (BON) cattle for a total of 19 days, using a cafeteria method with each species exposed to animals for only 3 minutes. The assignment of species was in pairs, with a total of 190 pairs, resulting from the combinations of 20 species taking two at the same time, without replication. The results of the palatability trials identified nine species with very high and high palatability, which ordered in a descending manner were: Albizia niopoides, Leucaena leucocephala, Erythrina fusca, Guazuma ulmifolia, Gliricidia sepium, Tithonia diversifolia, Clitoria fairchildiana, Spondias purpurea and Spondias mombin. The pair of species that showed the highest palatability was A. niopoides-L. leucocephala; and the species frequently present in combinations with high intake was A. niopoides. It is concluded that there are several native species with high relative palatability, whose forage potential is unknown by technicians and ranchers, and the high palatability of some species already known was confirmed.

AB  - Simple Summary Insects such as beet armyworm (Spodoptera exigua) can cause extensive damage to tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum). Tomato photosynthesis was clearly reduced directly at S. exigua feeding spots. However, neighboring zones and the rest of the leaf compensated through increased light energy use in photosystem II, possibly trigged by singlet oxygen from the feeding zone. Three hours after feeding, whole-leaf photosynthetic efficiency was as before feeding, demonstrating the compensatory ability. Thus, chlorophyll fluorescence imaging analysis could contribute to understanding the effects of herbivory on photosynthesis at a detailed spatial and temporal pattern. In addition to direct tissue consumption, herbivory may affect other important plant processes. Here, we evaluated the effects of short-time leaf feeding by Spodoptera exigua larvae on the photosynthetic efficiency of tomato plants, using chlorophyll a fluorescence imaging analysis. After 15 min of feeding, the light used for photochemistry at photosystem II (PSII) (phi(PSII)), and the regulated heat loss at PSII (phi(NPQ)) decreased locally at the feeding zones, accompanied by increased non-regulated energy losses (phi(NO)) that indicated increased singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) formation. In contrast, in zones neighboring the feeding zones and in the rest of the leaf, phi(PSII) increased due to a decreased phi(NPQ). This suggests that leaf areas not directly affected by herbivory compensate for the photosynthetic losses by increasing the fraction of open PSII reaction centers (q(p)) and the efficiency of these centers (Fv'/Fm'), because of decreased non-photochemical quenching (NPQ). This compensatory reaction mechanism may be signaled by singlet oxygen formed at the feeding zone. PSII functionality at the feeding zones began to balance with the rest of the leaf 3 h after feeding, in parallel with decreased compensatory responses. Thus, 3 h after feeding, PSII efficiency at the whole-leaf level was the same as before feeding, indicating that the plant managed to overcome the feeding effects with no or minor photosynthetic costs.

AB  - The tick Ixodes ricinus is widely distributed across Europe and is responsible for the transmission of several pathogens to humans and animals. In this study, we used a knowledge-based method to map variations in habitat suitability for I. ricinus ticks throughout continental France and Corsica. The multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) integrated four major biotic and abiotic factors known to influence tick populations: climate, land cover, altitude and the density of wild ungulates. For each factor, habitat suitability index (HSI) values were attributed to different locations based on knowledge regarding its impact on tick populations. For the MCDA, two methods of factor combination were tested, additive and multiplicative, both which were evaluated at the spatial scales of departments and local municipalities. The resulting habitat suitability maps (resolution=100x100 m) revealed that conditions are suitable for I. ricinus over most of France and Corsica. Particularly suitable habitats were located in central, north-eastern and south-western France, while less-suitable habitats were found in the Mediterranean and mountainous regions. To validate the approach, the HSI scores were compared to field data of I. ricinus nymph abundance. Regardless of scale, the correlation between abundance indicator and HSI score was stronger for the additive than for the multiplicative approach. Overall, this study demonstrates the value of MCDA for estimating habitat suitability maps for I. ricinus abundance, which could be especially useful in highlighting areas of the tick???s distribution where preventive measures should be prioritised.

AB  - Waterlogging is a serious threat to agriculture that is expected to become more common due to climate change. It is well established that many plants are susceptible to waterlogging, including crops such as rapeseed. To investigate the responses and tolerance to waterlogging of the re-emerging oilseed crop camelina (Camelina sativa), camelina lines of different geographical origins were subjected to waterlogging. Camelina was very sensitive to waterlogging at vegetative growth stages, with a relatively short treatment of 4 days proving lethal for the plants. A treatment duration of 2 days resulted in growth inhibition and lower yields and was used to study the response of 8 different camelina lines to waterlogging at two different vegetative growth stages before bolting. Generally, younger plants (7-9 leaves) were more sensitive than older plants (15-16 leaves). In addition to morphological and agronomic traits, plants were phenotyped for physiological parameters such as chlorophyll content index and total antioxidant capacity of the leaves, which showed significant age-dependent changes due to waterlogging. These results underpin that waterlogging during the vegetative phase is a serious threat to camelina, which needs to be addressed by identifying and establishing tolerance to excess water to harness camelina's potential as a climate-smart crop.

AB  - Early exposure of does to sexually active bucks triggers early puberty onset correlating with neuroendocrine changes. However, the sensory pathways that are stimulated by the male are still unknown. Here, we assessed whether responses to olfactory stimuli are modulated by social experience (exposure to males or not) and/or endocrine status (prepubescent or pubescent). We used a calcium imaging approach on goat sensory cells from the main olfactory epithelium (MOE) and the vomeronasal organ (VNO). For both cell types, we observed robust responses to active male hair in females under three physiological conditions: prepubescent females isolated from males (ISOL PrePub), pubescent females exposed to males (INT Pub) and isolated females (ISOL Pub). Response analysis showed overall greater proportion of responses to buck hair in ISOL PrePub. We hypothesized that females would be more responsive to active buck hair during the prepubertal period, with numerous responses perhaps originating from immature neurons. We also observed a greater proportion of mature olfactory neurons in the MOE and VNO of INT Pub females suggesting that male exposure can induce plastic changes on olfactory cell function and organization. To determine whether stimulation by male odor can advance puberty, we exposed prepubescent does to active buck hair (ODOR). In both ODOR and females isolated from males (ISOL) groups, puberty was reached one month after females exposed to intact bucks (INT), suggesting that olfactory stimulation is not sufficient to trigger puberty.

AB  - Yak yogurt, which is rich in microorganisms, is a naturally fermented dairy product prepared with ancient and modern techniques by Chinese herdsmen in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The objective of this research was to assess the impact of Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus starter cultures on the quality and shelf life of yak yogurt, as well as the genetic stability across multiple generations, in comparison to commercially available plain yogurt and peach oat flavor yogurt. Following that, the samples were evenly divided into four treatment groups denoted as T1 (treatment 1), T2, T3, and T4, with each group employing a distinct source of yogurt formulation. T1 included L. bulgaricus, T2 comprised S. thermophilus, T3 consisted of plain yogurt, and T4 represented peach oat yogurt flavor. The findings indicate that T1 yogurt consistently presents a lower pH and higher acidity compared to the other three yogurt types throughout the entire generation process. Moreover, the fat content in all generations of the four yogurt types exceeds the national standard of 3.1 g/100 g, while the total solid content shows a tendency to stabilize across generations. The protein content varies significantly among each generation, with T1 and T4 yogurt indicating higher levels compared to the T2 and T3 yogurt groups. In terms of overall quality, T1 and T4 yogurt are superior to T2 and T3 yogurt, with T1 yogurt being the highest in quality among all groups. The findings revealed that the inclusion of L. bulgaricus led to enhanced flavor, texture, and genetic stability in yak yogurt. This study will serve as a valuable source of data, support, and methodology for the development and screening of compound starters to be utilized in milk fermentation in future research and applications.

AB  - Available methods to census exophilic tick populations have limitations in estimating true population size due to their inability to capture a high proportion of the actual tick population. We currently ignore the efficacy of these methods to capture questing Hyalomma spp. ticks, vectors of the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus. To address the need of accurately estimating questing densities of Hyalomma spp., we designed a field experiment to test the efficacy of blanket dragging, blanket flagging, CO2-baited traps, and an ad hoc designed method, absolute surface counts, in capturing adult Hyalomma lusitanicum ticks from known numbers of preset fluorescent-marked ticks. The experiment was designed in 2 stages to estimate the point (1-day sampling) and cumulative (3-day serial sampling) efficacy of the methods under varying sampling effort and habitat. Tick survival, host interference, and weather effects on efficacy were controlled for in multiple regression models. There was high variability in method efficacy for capturing ticks, which was also modulated by effort, habitat, tick density, hosts, and soil temperature. The most effective method was absolute surface counts for both point estimates (39%) and cumulative efficacy (83%). CO2-baited traps reached a maximum efficacy of 37%, while blanket dragging and blanket flagging captured a maximum of the 8% of the marked ticks. Our results reveal the strengths and weaknesses of the different tick capture methods applied to adult H. lusitanicum and lay the groundwork for more accurate inferences about the true size of exophilic tick populations.

AB  - The review of the taxonomic status of Herpetoreas xenura species complex, based on morphological and molecular data, revealed a new species from Myanmar, which we describe as Herpetoreas davidi sp. nov. from the Rakhine Yoma Elephant Wildlife Sanctuary in Rakhine State. It is suggested to be a sister species to Herpetoreas pealii and Herpetoreas xenura sensu stricto, and can be separated from the latter species by a combination of morphological and scalation characters, and by its pattern. Another population from the Htamanthi Wildlife Sanctuary, Sagaing Region, was previously confused with H. xenura. However, as a closer examination of its morphology, shows it to be closer to Hebius khasiensis , we herein tentatively refer to this population as Hebius khasiensis , pending further molecular data confirming its taxonomic status. Consequently, we propose to temporarily remove Herpetoreas xenura from the fauna of Myanmar. Further studies, especially in the northwestern region of Myanmar, such as near border with India in Chin Hills and Naga Hills, are required. An updated key for the species of Herpetoreas is also provided.

AB  - In most species, oocytes are arrested at the prophase or metaphase of meiosis I and require sperm-derived or external stimuli to resume meiosis. Maturation-promoting factor (MPF) is an oocyte maturation factor composing the catalytic subunit Cdc2 and the regulatory subunit CycB that can restart stalled meiosis. In this study, we demonstrated that MPF activity affected parthenogenesis induction in the model lepidopteran insect Bombyx mori using activator and inhibitor interference. We found that the upregulation of MPF activity significantly increased the parthenogenesis induction rate, whereas downregulation significantly reduced it. Furthermore, the inhibition of MPF activity also led to a delay in embryonic development. Given its evolutionary conservation, MPF emerges as a potential universal target for manipulating reproductive outcomes, offering broad applications in genetics and selective breeding.

AB  - Insect population dynamics profoundly affect the potential for a species to serve as a pest, highlighting the importance of proper quantification and monitoring of insect reproduction. Important measurements of reproduction include individual female egg load and realized fecundity, which can be affected by insect longevity and host quality. Aster leafhoppers (Macrosteles quadrilineatus Forbes) are an important pest in Western Canada and the upper Midwest of the United States, yet little is known about factors influencing their fecundity, and thus, population dynamics. To evaluate age-specific changes in fecundity, newly emerged pairs of aster leafhoppers were caged onto plants, and egg and nymph numbers were determined on a weekly basis until females died. Moreover, water deficit can affect amino acid concentrations in phloem sap, and in turn, affect plant attractiveness and suitability for insect herbivores. To examine the relationship between water deficit and reproductive potential, aster leafhoppers were reared on unstressed and water-stressed barley plants until adult emergence. Pairs with all possible combinations of leafhoppers from each water stress condition were made and allowed to reproduce. Amino acid concentrations were quantified in unstressed and water-stressed barley plants. Aster leafhoppers produced eggs throughout their adult stage, with numbers decreasing as individuals got older. Females reared on water-stressed plants had fewer eggs following adult emergence. Following mating, females that had been reared on unstressed plants had a similar egg load to those that had been reared on water-stressed plants. Unstressed plants had a higher concentration of aspartic acid and a lower concentration of tryptophan.

AB  - Chronic stress profoundly affects forms of declarative memory, such as spatial memory, while it may spare nondeclarative memory, such as cue-based memory. It is known, however, that the effects of chronic stress on memory systems may vary according to the level of training of an individual was submitted. Here, we investigated, in birds, how chronic stress impact spatial and cue-based memories according to training level. For that, control and chronically stressed Japanese quail were trained in a task that could be solved using spatial and cuebased memory and tested for their memory performance after 5 and 15 training days (initial training and overtraining, respectively) and following an emotional challenge (exposure to an open field). Our results showed that, compared to control quail, chronic stress impacted negatively spatial memory performances in stressed birds after initial training, but these differences were lowered after overtraining. Control birds seemed to shift from spatial to cue-based memory to solve the task across overtraining. However, an emotional challenge before testing reinstated the negative impact of chronic stress on spatial memory performances between the groups, revealing that chronic stress/overtraining did not eliminate the spatial memory and differences caused by stressors can reemerge depending on the individual?s immediate psychological state. Contrary to spatial memory, cue-based memory was not affected in chronically stressed birds compared to control birds in any test occasion, confirming its resistance against the negative effects of chronic stress. Altogether these findings reveal a dynamic dialogue between stress, training level, and memory systems in birds.

AB  - The scale of deer breeding has gradually increased in recent years and better information management is necessary, which requires the identification of individual deer. In this paper, a deer face dataset is produced using face images obtained from different angles, and an improved residual neural network (ResNet)-based recognition model is proposed to extract the features of deer faces, which have high similarity. The model is based on ResNet50, which reduces the depth of the model, and the network depth is only 29 layers; the model connects Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) modules at each of the four layers where the channel changes to improve the quality of features by compressing the feature information extracted through the entire layer. A maximumpooling layer is used in the ResBlock shortcut connection to reduce the information loss caused by messages passing through the ResBlock. The Rectified LinearUnit (ReLU) activation function in the network is replaced by the Exponential LinearUnit (ELU) activation function to reduce information loss during forward propagation of the network. The preprocessed 6864 sika deer face dataset was used to train the recognition model based on SEResnet, which is demonstrated to identify individuals accurately. By setting up comparative experiments under different structures, the model reduces the amount of parameters, ensures the accuracy of the model, and improves the calculation speed of the model. Using the improved method in this paper to compare with the classical model and facial recognition models of different animals, the results show that the recognition effect of this research method is the best, with an average recognition accuracy of 97.48%. The sika deer face recognition model proposed in this study is effective. The results contribute to the practical application of animal facial recognition technology in the breeding of sika deer and other animals with few distinct facial features.

AB  - Examining the spatiotemporal habitat use by marine megafauna and human activities at a fine scale is important to achieve harmonised management of coastal areas. Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) can provide this information by observing animal vocalisations and the sounds generated by motorised vessels. Dugongs (Dugong dugon), which are endangered herbivorous mammals inhabiting coastal seas, communicate through social calls. Although their spatiotemporal acoustic presence on a fine scale could assist in prioritizing local marine spatial planning, such knowledge is limited. To address this gap, we examined the spatiotemporal pattern of the acoustic presence of dugongs and its correlation with environmental and anthropological factors; additionally, the overlap of these areas with vessel traffic was illustrated. Underwater recorders were deployed at 11 locations around Talibong Island, Thailand, for one month in both rainy and dry seasons. Based on the recorded sound stream, dugong calls and vessel sounds were automatically detected using custom-made software, and false detections were removed by manual examinations. In 2019 and 2020, 1933 h and 2719 h of recordings, respectively, revealed that while dugongs had a clear spatial preference for vocal communication at some locations, their temporal patterns varied among locations. Further, their acoustic presence was significantly correlated with environmental and anthropological factors at some locations, while these factors varied among other locations. However, the distribution of vessel traffic was spatially and temporally stable. These results suggested that (1) spatial management of vocalisation areas can effectively conserve dugongs by protecting their social behaviour and (2) temporal planning may reduce the potential disturbance risk to dugongs. Moreover, to achieve harmonised marine spatial planning in coastal areas, the PAM approach for social calls can be effectively employed to provide a unique layer of habitat use for vocalising species and vessel traffic on a fine scale.

AB  - Chromatin accessibility remodeling driven by pioneer factors is critical for the development of early embryos. Current studies have illustrated several pioneer factors as being important for agricultural animals, but what are the pioneer factors and how the pioneer factors remodel the chromatin accessibility in porcine early embryos is not clear. By employing low-input DNase-seq (liDNase-seq), we profiled the landscapes of chromatin accessibility in porcine early embryos and uncovered a unique chromatin accessibility reprogramming pattern during porcine preimplantation development. Our data revealed that KLF4 played critical roles in remodeling chromatin accessibility in porcine early embryos. Knocking down of KLF4 led to the reduction of chromatin accessibility in early embryos, whereas KLF4 overexpression promoted the chromatin openness in porcine blastocysts. Furthermore, KLF4 deficiency resulted in mitochondrial dysfunction and developmental failure of porcine embryos. In addition, we found that overexpression of KLF4 in blastocysts promoted lipid droplet accumulation, whereas knockdown of KLF4 disrupted this process. Taken together, our study revealed the chromatin accessibility dynamics and identified KLF4 as a key regulator in chromatin accessibility and cellular metabolism during porcine preimplantation embryo development.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Nowadays, there has been increased interest in the modification of the fatty acid composition of foods, such as milk and milk products, to reduce human health problems. The most common way to improve the composition of foodstuffs by n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) is supplementing animal diets with different plant oils, seeds, fish oil, and freshwater and marine algae. Moreover, fish oil and marine algae (e.g., Schizochytrium limacinum) supplements are a good source of long-chain PUFA (LC-PUFA), such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). DHA is essential for the development and normal function of the brain, and DHA has beneficial effects for human health, such as reducing the risk of coronary heart disease. In addition, DHA fatty acid has an anti-inflammatory effect, which may help to improve the health of mammary gland secretory activity against the mastitis pathogens. Mastitis pathogen bacterial infection causes an inflammatory reaction within the udder and it leads to reduced milk secretory activity and produces a disadvantageous quality of milk. It was found that marine algae supplementation improved the concentrations of beneficial fatty acids of milk, including higher concentrations of DHA and rumenic fatty acids. In addition, marine algae supplementation decreased the somatic cell counts and prevalence of mastitis pathogens in milk.
   The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the Schizochytrium limacinum marine algae on the milk composition and fatty acid profile, somatic cell count, and prevalence of pathogen bacteria in the raw milk of multiparous Alpine goats. Twenty-eight dairy goats were randomly allocated to two groups: control group (C)-fed with 1500 g alfalfa hay and 600 g concentrate; experimental group (MA)-received the same forages and concentrate supplemented with 10 g/head/day marine algae. The goats were housed indoors, while the experiment lasted five weeks, and the milk samples were taken every week. Marine algae feeding had no negative effect on milk composition. The marine algae inclusion significantly decreased the milk somatic cell count and the presence of udder pathogens in the MA group. Mean somatic cell count and presence of udder pathogens were 5.73 log cells/mL and 31%, respectively, in the C group, while these values were 5.34 log cells/mL and 10%, respectively, in the MA group. The marine algae supplementation significantly increased DHA and rumenic acid concentration in the milk of the MA group (0.32 and 0.99 g/100 g of fatty acids, respectively) compared to the C group (0.04 and 0.65 g/100 g of fatty acids, respectively). It can be concluded that a diet supplemented with marine algae significantly improves the udder health of goats and the concentrations of health-promoting fatty acids in milk.

AB  - Simple Summary Classical swine fever is a highly dangerous pathogen affecting domestic pigs. Vaccination with the modified live vaccine is critical for preventing and controlling classical swine fever. However, many factors, such as maternally derived antibodies via colostrum, could interfere with live vaccine efficacy, leading to incomplete protection in commercial herds. In this study, we investigated the transmission of classical swine fever virus in experimental piglets with various post-vaccination immune statuses. A specific-pathogen-free piglet infected with classical swine fever virus served as the viral donor and primary invader, and was cohabited with piglets with maternally derived antibodies that had or had not undergone vaccination. According to the results, most of the piglets with maternally derived antibodies that were vaccinated were fully protected from contact transmission from the viral donor and blocked viral transmission to the third party (those piglets secondarily exposed through cohabitation). Cell-mediated immunity, represented by specific interferon-gamma-secreting cells, served as the key to the viral clearance and recovery. Contrarily, the unvaccinated piglets with low levels of maternally derived antibodies had accelerated classical swine fever virus infection following viral invasion. In conclusion, vaccination still induces solid immunity in commercial herds under maternally derived antibody interference and can block viral transmission in herds. Classical swine fever (CSF) is a systemic hemorrhagic disease affecting domestic pigs and wild boars. The modified live vaccine (MLV) induces quick and solid protection against CSF virus (CSFV) infection. Maternally derived antibodies (MDAs) via colostrum could interfere with the MLV's efficacy, leading to incomplete protection against CSFV infection for pigs. This study investigated CSFV transmission among experimental piglets with various post-MLV immune statuses. Nineteen piglets, 18 with MDAs and 1 specific-pathogen-free piglet infected with CSFV that served as the CSFV donor, were cohabited with piglets that had or had not been administered the MLV. Five-sixths of the piglets with MDAs that had been administered one dose of MLV were fully protected from contact transmission from the CSFV donor and did not transmit CSFV to the piglets secondarily exposed through cohabitation. Cell-mediated immunity, represented by the anti-CSFV-specific interferon-gamma-secreting cells, was key to viral clearance and recovery. After cohabitation with a CSFV donor, the unvaccinated piglets with low MDA levels exhibited CSFV infection and spread CSFV to other piglets through contact; those with high MDA levels recovered but acted as asymptomatic carriers. In conclusion, MLV still induces solid immunity in commercial herds under MDA interference and blocks CSFV transmission within these herds.

AB  - A cornerstone of conservation policy for endangered species subject to illegal harvest involves estimating their population and offtake numbers. Census enumerations are expensive to conduct on nationwide scales, especially in resource-constrained countries housing such species. Resource and data limitations necessitate the estimation of population counts. The effect of poaching on species recruitment is often ignored in scientific population projections. Estimation of population counts should account for the interactive feedback between harvest and recruitment. Data on tiger population sizes and poaching from 51 reserves in India between 1994 and 2022 were obtained to calibrate a coupled ecological-economic model of tiger population dynamics and poaching. Cobb-Douglas harvest functions with differing degrees of concavity and scale economies are used to characterize the economics of poaching. Population dynamics are evaluated using exponential and critical depensation growth functions. The predictive abilities of linked models and their parameter parsimony are evaluated using information criteria. Poaching is shown to substantially affect recruitment dynamics and is best characterized by a Schaefer function coupled with critical depensation growth. This paper provides a novel perspective of the interaction between tiger poaching and population dynamics in India. A systematic understanding of coupled ecological-economic processes would improve the management of high-value endangered species.

AB  - Aluminum (Al) affects the yield of forest trees in acidic soils. The oil tea plant (Camellia drupifera Lour.) has high Al tolerance, with abundant phenolic compounds in its leaves, especially flavonoid compounds. The role of these flavonoids in the Al resistance of oil tea plants is unclear. In this metabolomic study of C. drupifera under Al stress, ultra-pressure liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) was utilized to identify metabolites, while principal component analysis, cluster analysis, and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis were applied to analyze the data on the flavonoid metabolites. The leaf morphology of C. drupifera revealed significant damage by excess aluminum ions under each treatment compared with the control group. Under Al stress at 2 mmol/L (GZ2) and 4 mmol/L (GZ4), the total flavonoid content in C. drupifera leaves reached 24.37 and 35.64 mg/g, respectively, which are significantly higher than the levels measured in the control group (CK) (p < 0.01). In addition, we identified 25 upregulated and 5 downregulated metabolites in the GZ2 vs. CK comparison and 31 upregulated and 7 downregulated flavonoid metabolites in GZ4 vs. CK. The results demonstrate that different levels of Al stress had a significant influence on the metabolite profile of C. drupifera. It was found that the abundance of the 24 differential flavonoid metabolites was gradually elevated with increasing concentrations of Al stress, including catechin, epicatechin, naringenin-7-glucoside, astilbin, taxifolin, miquelianin, quercitrin, and quercimeritrin. Moreover, the most significant increase in antioxidant activity (about 30%) was observed in C. drupifera precultured in leaf extracts containing 7.5 and 15 mu g/mL of active flavonoids. The qRT-PCR results showed that the expression levels of key genes involved in the synthesis of flavonoids were consistent with the accumulation trends of flavonoids under different concentrations of Al. Therefore, our results demonstrate the key role of flavonoid compounds in the oil tea plant C. drupifera in response to Al stress, which suggests that flavonoid metabolites in C. drupifera, as well as other aluminum-tolerant plants, may help with detoxifying aluminum.

AB  - Nestedness and modularity have been found in many species interaction networks. Despite being conceptually distinct, negatively correlated and having different causes, these patterns often co-occur. A realistic but seldom investigated alternative to these simple topologies is hierarchical compound networks, in which the entire network is modular, and modules are internally nested. In compound networks, nestedness is suppressed by modularity at higher network hierarchical levels, but prevails at lower levels, within modules. The aims of this study are (i) to evaluate the prevalence of simple and hierarchical compound topologies in binary and weighted networks describing different kinds of species interactions and (ii) to probe the relationships between modularity and nestedness at different network hierarchical levels. With a procedure that discriminates between simple and compound structures, we re-analysed the topology of 142 well-studied binary networks including seed dispersal, host-parasite, pollination and plant-herbivore interactions; 68 of these also had quantitative information. Additionally, we tested the relationship between robustness and topology of binary networks and compared the robustness of networks with compound topologies to different sequences of species removals. Compound topologies were detected in 34% of binary and 71% of weighted networks of all interaction kinds. These results establish the hierarchical compound topology as a widespread network architecture, often undetected without quantitative data. Furthermore, they disentangle an apparent paradox: despite conflicting with overall nestedness, modularity usually co-occurs with high values of low-level nestedness. Nestedness progressively decreased, while modularity increased, from seed dispersal to host-parasite, pollination and plant-herbivore networks. There were no consistent differences in the robustness of networks with nested and compound topologies. However, compound topologies were especially vulnerable to removal sequences that accelerate the exclusion of entire modules. Compound topologies improve the depiction of ecological networks and differentiate ecological and evolutionary processes that operate at different hierarchical levels, with the potential to advance our understanding of network dynamics, stability and response to species loss or change. Quantitative data often reveal specialization patterns that are indistinguishable in binary networks, strongly improving the detection of modular and compound topologies.

AB  - Simple Summary While consumption by predators directly reduces prey populations, some studies have shown that even the mere threat of predation can negatively impact the health and fitness of prey. This is referred to as the enemy-risk effect. We investigated enemy-risk effects in caterpillars (larval stage of the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella) feeding on two different host plants in the presence and absence of the parasitoid wasp, Diadegma insulare. We found that the threat of attack can slow down caterpillar development and produce smaller adult moths. These physiological changes coincided with a change in caterpillar behavior to feed on older foliage, and the host plant species appeared to influence the severity of the enemy-risk effects. Enemy-risk effects (i.e., non-consumptive effects) describe the non-lethal fitness costs incurred by animals when they perceive a risk of predation. These effects can result from fear-associated changes in behavior and physiology. Diamondback moth larvae (Plutella xylostella) are known to violently wriggle backwards and drop from their host plants, usually suspending themselves with a silk thread, when threatened by predators and parasitoids. Here, we investigated the developmental costs associated with this behavior when larvae were exposed to its specialist parasitoid wasp (Diadegma insulare). Additionally, the structural and chemical properties of plants are well-known to influence predation and parasitism rates of herbivorous insects. Yet, few studies have examined the influence of plants on enemy-risk effects. Therefore, we examined the developmental costs associated with parasitism risk on two host plants. Diamondback moth larvae were placed on either cabbage or Virginia pepperweed plants and exposed to gravid parasitoids with truncated ovipositors, which prevented piercing of the host cuticle without affecting host searching and attacking behaviors. On Virginia pepperweed, risk of parasitism resulted in reduced larval weight gain, longer development time, and smaller adult size compared to larvae that were not exposed to parasitoids. However, on cabbage, parasitoid exposure prolonged development time but had no significant effects on larval weight gain and adult size. On both plants, parasitoid-exposed larvae were found feeding on older foliage than younger foliage. Our findings demonstrate that the enemy-escape behavior of diamondback moths has developmental costs and that plants may mediate the intensity of these enemy-risk effects.

AB  - Repeated exposure to the stress hormone corticosterone results in depressive-like behaviours paralleled by the downregulation of hippocampal reelin expression. Reelin is expressed in key neural populations involved in the stress response, but whether its hypothalamic expression is sex-specific or involved in sex-specific vulnerability to stress is unknown. Female and male rats were treated with either daily vehicle or corticosterone injections (40 mg/kg) for 21 days. Thereafter, they were subjected to several behavioural tasks before being sacrificed to allow the analysis of reelin expression in hypothalamic nuclei. The basal density of reelin-positive cells in males was significantly higher in the paraventricular nucleus (19 %) and in the medial preoptic area (51 %) compared to females. Chronic corticosterone injections increased the immobility time in the forced swim test in males (107 %) and females (108 %) and decreased the exploration of the elevated plus maze in males (34 %). Corticosterone also caused a significant decrease in the density of reelin-positive cells in males, in both ventrodorsal (37 %) and ventrolateral (32 %) subdivisions of the paraventricular nucleus, while not affecting females. Moreover, in the paraventricular nucleus of males, 30 % of the basal reelin-positive cells co-expressed oxytocin while only 17.5 % did in females, showing a positive correlation between reelin and oxytocin levels. Chronic corticosterone did not significantly affect co-localization levels. For the first time, this study shows that there is a sexually dimorphic subpopulation of reelin-positive neurons in the paraventricular nucleus that can be differentially affected by chronic stress.

AB  - At high altitude (HA), unremitting low oxygen and persistent cold push small mammals close to their metabolic ceilings, leaving limited scope for aerobically demanding activities. However, HA breeding seasons are relatively short and endemic rodents compensate with larger litters than low altitude (LA) conspecifics. Rodent mothers are the sole source of heat and nutrition for altricial offspring and lactation is energetically costly. Thus, it is unclear how HA females balance energy allocation during the nursing period. We hypothesized that HA female rodents invest heavily in each litter to ensure postnatal survival. We measured maternal energetic output and behaviour in nursing deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) native to LA (400 m a.s.l.) and HA (4350 m a.s.l.) under control (24 degrees C, 760 mmHg) and cold hypoxia conditions, simulating HA (5 degrees C, 430 mmHg). Strikingly, resting metabolic rates of lactating HA and LA females under cold hypoxia were 70-85% of their maximum aerobic capacity. In cold hypoxia, LA mothers increased both nursing time and milk fat content, however their pups were leaner and severely growth restricted at weaning. HA mothers also increased nursing in cold hypoxia but for far less time than LA mothers. Despite receiving less care, HA pups in cold hypoxia only experienced small growth restrictions at weaning and maintained body composition. As adults, HA mice raised in cold hypoxia had increased aerobic capacity compared to controls. These data suggest that HA mothers prioritize their own maintenance costs over investing heavily in their offspring. Pups compensate for this lack of care, likely by reducing their own metabolic costs during development.

AB  - Methyl salicylate (MeSA) is a volatile shown to act as an inducer of plant defense against pathogens and certain herbivores, particularly aphids. It has been shown to have potential for aphid pest management, but knowledge on its mode of action is lacking, particularly induced plant-mediated effects. This study investigated the effects of exposing plants to MeSA on the host searching, host acceptance and feeding behavior of the bird cherry-oat aphid Rhopalosiphum padi. Barley plants were exposed to volatile MeSA for 24 h, after which biological effects were tested immediately after the exposure (Day 0), and then 1, 3 and 5 days after the end of the exposure. Aphid settling on MeSA-exposed plants was significantly reduced on days 0, 1 and 3, but not on day 5. In olfactometer tests, aphids preferred the odor of unexposed plants on days 1 and 3, but not on day 0 or 5. Analysis of volatiles from exposed and unexposed plants showed higher levels of MeSA from exposed plants, most likely absorbed and re-released from plant surfaces, but also specific changes in other plant volatiles on days 0, 1 and 3. High doses of MeSA did not affect aphid orientation in an olfactometer, but lower doses were repellent. Analysis of aphid feeding by Electronic penetration graph (EPG) showed that MeSA exposure resulted in resistance factors in barley plants, including surface factors and induced systemic factors in other tissues including the phloem. The results support the potential of MeSA as a potential tool for management of aphid pests.

AB  - Investigating how aquatic animals respond to hypoxia brought about by changes in environmental temperature may be of great significance to avoid oxidative injury and maintain the quality of farmed fish in the background of global warming. Here, we investigated the effects of hypoxia on oxidative injury and environment-sensing pathway in blood cells of Micropterus salmoides. The total blood cell count (TBCC) and Giemsa staining showed that hypoxia could lead to damage of blood cells. Flow cytometry analysis confirmed that the apoptosis rate, Ca2+ level, NO production and ROS of blood cells were significantly increased under hypoxia stress. Environment-sensing pathways, such as Nrf2 pathway showed that hypoxia resulted in significant up-regulation of hiF-1 alpha subunit (Hif-1 alpha), nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and kelch-1ike ECH- associated protein l (Keap1) expression. Meanwhile, the expression of Hippo pathway-related genes such as MOB kinase activator 1 (MOB1), large tumor suppressor homolog 1/2 (Lats1/2), yes-associated protein/transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (YAP/TAZ), protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) were significantly increased in blood cells after hypoxia exposure. In addition, hypoxia stress also increased the expression of catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), but decreased the expression of superoxide dismutase (SOD). Consequently, our results suggested that hypoxia could induce oxidative injury and apoptosis via mediating environment-sensing pathway such as Nrf2/Hippo pathway in blood cells of M. salmoides.

AB  - Background It is well-known that light/dark phase can affect energy expenditure and behaviors of most organisms; however, its influences on individuality (inter-individual variance) and plasticity (intra-individual variance), as well as their associations remain unclear. To approach this question, we repeatedly measured maintenance metabolic rate (MR), exploratory and risk-taking behaviors across light/dark phase four times using wild-caught female Asiatic toads (Bufo gargarizans), and partitioned their variance components with univariate and bivariate mixed-effects models. Results The group means of maintenance MR and risk-taking behavior increased at night, while the group mean of exploratory behavior remained constant throughout the day. At night, the intra-individual variances were elevated in maintenance MR but reduced in exploration, suggesting that phenotypic plasticity was enhanced in the former but constrained in the latter. In addition, maintenance MR was not coupled with exploratory or risk-taking behaviors in daytime or at night, neither at the inter-individual nor intra-individual levels. Conclusions Our findings suggest that these traits are independently modulated by the light/dark phase, and an allocation energy management model may be applicable in this species. This study sheds new insights into how amphibians adapt nocturnal lifestyle across multiple hierarchy levels via metabolic and behavioral adjustments.

AB  - Main conclusion With domestication, northward spread, and breeding, maize defence against root-herbivores relied on induced defences, decreasing levels of phytohormones involved in resistance, and increasing levels of a phytohormone involved in tolerance. We addressed whether a suite of maize (Zea mays mays) phytohormones and metabolites involved in herbivore defence were mediated by three successive processes: domestication, spread to North America, and modern breeding. With those processes, and following theoretical predictions, we expected to find: a change in defence strategy from reliance on induced defences to reliance on constitutive defences; decreasing levels of phytohormones involved in herbivore resistance, and; increasing levels of a phytohormone involved in herbivore tolerance. We tested those predictions by comparing phytohormone levels in seedlings exposed to root herbivory by Diabrotica virgifera virgifera among four plant types encompassing those processes: the maize ancestor Balsas teosinte (Zea mays parviglumis), Mexican maize landraces, USA maize landraces, and USA inbred maize cultivars. With domestication, maize transitioned from reliance on induced defences in teosinte to reliance on constitutive defences in maize, as predicted. One subset of metabolites putatively involved in herbivory defence (13-oxylipins) was suppressed with domestication, as predicted, though another was enhanced (9-oxylipins), and both were variably affected by spread and breeding. A phytohormone (indole-3-acetic acid) involved in tolerance was enhanced with domestication, and with spread and breeding, as predicted. These changes are consistent with documented changes in herbivory resistance and tolerance, and occurred coincidentally with cultivation in increasingly resource-rich environments, i.e., from wild to highly enriched agricultural environments. We concluded that herbivore defence evolution in crops may be mediated by processes spanning thousands of generations, e.g., domestication and spread, as well as by processes spanning tens of generations, e.g., breeding and agricultural intensification.

AB  - Garlic (Allium sativum L.), a vital global crop, suffers significant losses from soil-borne fungal pathogens such as Fusarium proliferatum, responsible for Fusarium bulb rot, and Stromatinia cepivora, the causal agent of white rot. In May 2023, garlic fields near Mak & oacute; City, Hungary, showed simultaneous yellowing and wilting symptoms of unknown fungal infestations, which appeared sporadically. The causal pathogens were later confirmed as F. proliferatum and S. cepivora through sampling of symptomatic garlic plants, incubation in humid chambers to stimulate fungal growth, and culturing on Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) under sterile conditions. This was followed by hyphal tip isolation and purification. Molecular identification was performed using ITS1-2 sequencing, supported with morphological identification based on colony and microscopic features. This research aimed to elucidate pathogen interaction dynamics and assess the resistance of eleven garlic cultivars to both single and simultaneous inoculations by these pathogens, under in vitro and in planta tests. Dual culture assays of F. proliferatum and S. cepivora were studied at two time points: Day 8, marking the cessation of growth along the interacting fronts due to competitive coexistence, and Day 14, when single cultures reached full radial growth. On Day 8, inhibition percentages were 8.47% for F. proliferatum and 6.40% for S. cepivora, reflecting the initial effects of competitive interactions at the point of contact. By Day 14, inhibition rates increased to 25.39% and 28.61%, respectively, highlighting the cumulative effects of sustained competition and the growing difference between single and dual culture growth. Inoculation trials, involving placing fungal disks onto the basal areas of wounded garlic cloves, revealed considerable variability in disease incidence and severity. Cultivars such as 'Aulxito', 'Sabadrome', 'Arno', 'Garcua', and 'Mak & oacute;i Tavaszi' were highly susceptible to both pathogens, while 'Flavor' and 'Sabagold' exhibited only mild symptoms when inoculated with F. proliferatum and S. cepivora, respectively. Simultaneous inoculation resulted in more rapid and severe infections, exhibiting disease incidences above 96.00% across all cultivars. Remarkably, the cultivar 'Elephant' exhibited complete resistance to both pathogens, even under simultaneous inoculation, highlighting its potential for future garlic resistance breeding programs.

TI  - Picking sides: feeding on the abaxial leaf surface is costly for caterpillars
T2  - PLANTA
LA  - English
AB  - Main conclusion The study provides us with the evidence that caterpillars tend to feed on the abaxial leaf surface despite the damage caused to them because of higher trichome density. To defend against herbivory, plants have evolved physical and chemical defense mechanisms, including trichomes (hair like appendages on leaves and stem) being one of them. Caterpillars, a major group of insect herbivores are generally found to occupy the abaxial (underside) leaf surface, considered as an avoidance mechanism from biotic and abiotic stresses. Since trichomes are a first line of defense, we examined the correlation between abaxial vs adaxial (above side) trichomes and caterpillar feeding, behavior, and growth. A combination of field, lab and microscopy experiments were performed using tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta (Lepidoptera: Sphingidae), a Solanaceae specialist caterpillar, and multiple host species. We found that M. sexta caterpillars overwhelmingly preferred to stay and feed on the abaxial leaf surface, but the abaxial leaf surface also had significantly more trichomes, and consequently, caterpillars took significantly longer to commence feeding. In addition, lab-based diet experiment containing shaved trichomes showed that feeding on the abaxial leaf surface with more trichomes also affected caterpillar growth. Taken together, our study shows that although caterpillars prefer to feed on the abaxial leaf surface, they accrue feeding delays and developmental constraints, indicating tradeoffs affecting performance, and exposure to predation and abiotic stressors.

AB  - Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) is a fatal disease in cattle caused by misfolded prion proteins and linked to indel polymorphisms in the promoter and intron 1 of the PRNP gene. The aim of this study was to determine the allele, genotype, and haplotype frequencies of PRNP indel polymorphisms and to investigate the effect of PRNP gene expressions of 23 bp and 12 bp indels via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in Zhongdian Yak (Bos-grunniens) (YK), Zhongdian Yellow cattle (Bos-taurus) (YC), and Zhongdian Yakow (Bos-primigenius taurus x Bos-grunniens) (PK). Resultant high allelic frequencies were found in 23- and 12+, while haplotype frequencies were very low in 23+/12 in YK, YC, and PK. PRNP expression was higher in the +-/-- diplotype of the PK and (mean +/- SE) was 3.6578 +/- 1.85964. Furthermore, two variable sites were investigated-a 23 bp indel polymorphism holding AP1 binding site and a 12 bp indel polymorphism holding SP1 binding site. Additionally, reporter gene assays revealed a link between two proposed transcription factors and lower expression levels of the +/+ allele compared with the -/- allele. The expression level of PRNP was shown to be dependent on two indel polymorphisms in the bovine PRNP promoter, which includes binding sites for RP58 and SP1 transcription factors. These findings raised the possibility that the PRNP genotype may contribute to the high variation in PRNP expression.

AB  - Simple Summary: Concern about the use of antimicrobial compounds in livestock production has promoted research of "generally recognized as safe" additive alternatives. Probiotics (living microorganisms) and prebiotics (certain type of carbohydrates derived from yeast) have been shown to alleviate the negative effects of stress and boost immunity, thereby enhancing efficiency of energy utilization. In some regions (i.e., tropical and arid zones), livestock experience adverse climatic conditions, including elevated ambient temperature and humidity, which affect their productivity. Supplementation with probiotics and prebiotics may help to alleviate these adverse effects. In the present study, supplemental probiotics or/and prebiotics improved dietary energetic efficiency in lambs finished under subtropical climatic conditions. The combination of probiotics with prebiotics reinforced this positive effect.The aim of this trial was to test the effects of the use of eubiotics (pro- and prebiotics) alone or in combination in the diet of lambs finished under subtropical climate conditions. For this purpose, 40 Pelibuey x Katahdin lambs (29.5 & PLUSMN; 4.8 kg initial live weight) were used in a 93 day growth-performance experiment. Dietary treatments consisted of a cracked corn-based finishing diet supplemented with (1) no eubiotics (control), (2) 3 g of probiotics (live Saccharomyces cerevisiae, SC), (3) 3 g of prebiotics (mannan oligosaccharide plus b-glucans, MOS), and (4) a combination of 1.5 g of SC and 1.5 g of MOS (SC+MOS). Throughout the study, the average temperature humidity index (THI) was 78.60. Compared to controls, supplementation with SC or MOS, alone did not affect average daily gain (ADG), but enhanced feed efficiency by 5.6% and 6.9% (gain-to-feed ratio, G:F) and dietary net energy by 4.6% and 5.9%, respectively. Compared to controls, SC+MOS enhanced ADG (10%), G:F (9.5%), and dietary net energy (7.2%). Lambs fed SC+MOS had also greater ADG, G:F, and dietary net energy compared to lambs fed SC alone. When compared to MOS, the combination enhanced ADG (10.4%, p = 0.04). This effect could be attributed to the increased dry matter intake (7.6%, p = 0.06), as neither G:F nor dietary energy was significantly affected. Compared with controls and SC, supplementation with MOS alone and SC+MOS increased kidney-pelvic-heart fat, while SC supplementation tended (p = 0.08) to reduce 4.1% the relative intestinal mass (as a proportion of empty body weight) when compared to controls. Treatment effects on the other carcass measures were not significant. In the present study, supplemental probiotics and/or prebiotics improved dietary energetic efficiency in lambs finished under subtropical climatic conditions. The combination of probiotics with prebiotics reinforced this positive effect.

AB  - Major challenges in using lignocellulosic residues as biogas substrates arise from their high diversity and their typically low nitrogen content, which may not provide sufficient nitrogen for the microorganisms. To investigate to what extent such substrates can be used in biogas plants without extensive pre-treatment, this study presents a 300-day continuous co-digestion of lignocellulosic substrates (i.e., sugarcane reed, lemon, and grape leaves) and goat manure while continuously monitoring various process parameters. The results suggest a stable and effective biogas production at a carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (C/N ratio) of 33, with a production of 244 +/- 15 mL(N) g(VS)(-1) d(-1) biogas. At a higher C/N ratio of 43, the process remained stable, but hindrance was encountered. Process failure occurred at a C/N ratio of 52, where a rapid decline in biogas production was observed, accompanied by an increase in the volatile fatty acids to total alkalinity ratio (from < 0.2 to 0.9), a drop in the pH-value (from > 7 to 5.4), and an increased CO2-content of the provided biogas (from > 50% to 43%). The compositional analysis of the digestate suggests an insufficient N-supply and a failure of the carbonate and ammonium buffer systems inside the reactor. The experiment also served to validate a previously developed model based on the individual substrates' degradation kinetics. With a relative root mean square error rRMSE of 8%, the model adequately predicted biogas production within defined limits. However, it could not anticipate process breakdown at high C/N ratios, highlighting a strong limitation.

AB  - Growing population and rising incomes are leading to an ever-increasing demand for animal-based foods. Pigmeat is currently the most consumed meat globally, even exceeding the consumption of poultry meat. Despite the disproportionate environmental burden of animal production-mostly attributable to associated feed demand, up-to-date country-scale quantifications of the land and water impacts of the concentrate feed (mainly cereals and soybean) and co-products required to support pig production are still missing. In addition, the specific role that international feed trade plays in separating resource use from consumption and in altering resource use efficiencies remains unclear. This paper analyses at a country-scale the internal and external consumption of natural resources (i.e. land and water) to support pig feed production in 2018. Combining data on the country- and production system-specific diets and crop-specific yields with an agro-hydrological model, we find that 64.1 Mha of agricultural land (5% of all croplands) and 332.6 km(3) of water (both green and blue) (6% of all agricultural water use) were utilized by China, EU-27 and the United States (accounting for 70% of pigmeat production) to produce pig feed alone. Comparing domestic feed production scenarios with those that also consider the feed trade, we show that global resource consumption tends to be more efficient when considering international feed trade, especially in China and EU-27, while sometimes causing significant environmental impacts. This demonstrates the need to investigate the environmental effects of pig feed associated both with the domestic use of natural resources, but also to the ones displaced by international trade.

AB  - Antibodies are of central importance as reagents for the localization of proteins and other biomolecules in cells and tissues. To expand the repertoire of antibody-based reagents, we have constructed a series of plasmid vectors that permit expression of amino-terminal fusions to the hinge and Fc regions from goat, guinea pig, human, mouse, and rabbit immunoglobulin Gs, and chicken immunogloblin Y. The resulting fusion proteins can be produced in transfected mammalian cells and detected with commercially available and species-specific secondary antibody reagents. We demonstrate the utility of this platform by constructing and testing Fc fusions with DARPin, single-chain Fv, nanobody, toxin, and chemokine partners. The resulting fusion proteins were used to detect their targets in tissue sections or on the surface of transfected cells by immunofluorescent staining or on the surface of immune cells by flow cytometry. By expanding the range of Fc sequences available for fusion protein production, this platform will expand the repertoire of primary antibody reagents for multiplexed immunostaining and fluorescenceactivated cell sorting analyses.

AB  - Priming is an induced defence mechanism in which plants that have been exposed to elicitors, such as herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs), go into an alert state with faster and stronger responses against a future biotic challenge. This study evaluated whether HIPVs emitted by maize genotypes after herbivory by fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) larvae could prime neighbouring maize plants for an enhanced indirect defence response, and if priming was consistent across different genotypes. Two genotypes were selected based on their differences in HIPV emission: Sintetico Spodoptera (SS), a relatively high emitter of HIPVs, and L3, a relatively low emitter of HIPVs. SS plants that were previously exposed to SS HIPVs initiated earlier and enhanced volatile production upon larval challenge, compared to SS plants that were previously exposed to SS undamaged plant volatiles. In addition, SS plants exposed to SS HIPVs and then to larval challenge attracted an egg parasitoid, Telenomus remus, at an earlier stage than SS plants that were only subjected to larval challenge, indicating a priming effect. There was no evidence of a priming response by L3 plants that were previously exposed to L3 or SS HIPVs. When comparing the gene expression of HIPV-exposed and undamaged plant volatile (UDV)-exposed plants, jasmonate-induced protein GRMZM2G05154 and UDP-glucosyltransferase bx8 genes related to the biosynthesis of DIBOA-Glu were upregulated. These data indicate that priming by HIPVs enhances indirect defence in maize plants as reported by other studies, and provide new information showing that the priming effect can be genotype-specific.

AB  - Land application of biomass materials and their products of thermal treatment (biochars and ashes) can offset the unsustainable use of soluble P fertilisers. However, few evaluations of P fertiliser potential have systematically addressed diverse biomass types with contrasting P contents. This paper evaluates the relative P fertiliser potential of four P-rich biowastes (animal bone, poultry manure, pig slurry, and a municipal sewage sludge) and three low-P, plant-based materials (reeds [Phragmites australis L.], rice husks [Oryza sativa L.] and cocoa prunings [Theobroma cacao L.]) and their biochars and ashes. We utilised three complementary approaches: P extractability in single solvents (2% formic and citric acids, and 1 M neutral ammonium citrate); sequential chemical P fractionation, and P dissolution/desorption kinetics. In most cases, pyrolysis and incineration of the P-rich biowastes increased P extractability (% TP) in the single solvents, whilst decreasing water-soluble P. For pig slurry, for example, pyrolysis reduced water-soluble P 20fold, with corresponding increases observed not only in the solvent-extractable P but also in the pool of potentially plant available, NaHCO3-Pi fraction (e.g., 17 to 35% TP). These complementary datasets were also evident for the low-P feedstocks and thermal products; e.g., pyrolysis increased the NaHCO3-Pi fraction in reed feedstock from 6 to 15% TP. For all biomass feedstocks, biochars and ashes, pseudo-second order P-release kinetics provided the best fit with the experimental data. The data demonstrate scope for using pyrolysis to upgrade the P fertiliser value of a wide range of biomass materials whilst reducing their environmental impact.

AB  - This study investigated the dynamics of perceived livestock depredation over the last 2 years (from 2021 to 2022) in villages close to Mkomazi National Park in Tanzania. The findings revealed that sheep were the most frequently affected livestock (57.1%), followed by goats (36.7%) and cattle (6.1%). Attacks primarily occurred at home (59.2%) and during the night (65.3%), with a higher prevalence during the dry season (75.5%). The majority of respondents (81.6%) perceived a decrease in attacks. Logistic regression indicated village proximity to the park as a significant predictor in explaining the reported incidents related with livestock depredation, with closer villages experiencing higher risks. Gender, age, education level, and resident status showed no significant correlation with the reported livestock depredation incidents. Spotted hyena sightings varied significantly based on village proximity to the park (p = 0.039), while other factors showed no significant differences. Mitigation measures against livestock depredation included guarding livestock (28.3%), employing noise and scaring tactics (42.2%), and utilizing domestic dogs (29.4%). These findings offer valuable insights into human-wildlife conflicts and inform targeted interventions for mitigating livestock losses not only in the surveyed villages but also in other areas globally facing similar challenges.

AB  - Simple Summary Weaning stress has negative effects on the growth and intestinal health of goat kids. The application of antibiotics can relieve weaning stress; however, their prophylactic application has motivated researchers to find alternatives to antibiotics for mitigating the weaning stress. Fucoidan is a natural polysaccharide with antioxidant and immune-modulatory properties, and it has shown beneficial effects on intestinal barrier function. In this study, dietary supplementation of fucoidan improved the small intestinal barrier function and cecal microflora in weaned goat kids. These results suggested that fucoidan can be used as a promoter of gut health in weaned goat kids. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of fucoidan supplementation on serum biochemical parameters, small intestinal barrier function, and cecal microbiota of weaned goat kids. A total of 60 2-month-old weaned castrated male goat kids (Chuanzhong black goat) were used in this 30-day experiment. The goat kids were randomly divided into four groups: a control group (CON) fed the basal diet, and three other groups supplemented with 0.1%, 0.3%, and 0.5% fucoidan in the basal diet (denoted as F1, F2, and F3 groups, respectively). The results indicated that dietary fucoidan supplementation decreased (p < 0.05) the activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and the content of glucose (GLU) as measured on day 15. As measured on day 30, dietary fucoidan increased (p < 0.05) the content of total protein (TP) and decreased the activity of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and supplementation with 0.3% and 0.5% fucoidan decreased (p < 0.05) the activity of LDH. Dietary fucoidan decreased (p < 0.05) the content of D-lactic acid (D-LA) and the activity of diamine oxidase (DAO). Dietary fucoidan increased (p < 0.05) the activity of catalase (CAT) in the duodenum. Dietary 0.3% and 0.5% fucoidan enhanced (p < 0.05) the activity of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) in the ileum, the activity of total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) in the jejunum and ileum, and the activity of CAT in the ileum. Dietary 0.3% and 0.5% fucoidan reduced the contents of malondialdehyde (MDA) in the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum and the content of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the duodenum. Dietary fucoidan increased (p < 0.05) the content of secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) in the duodenum. Supplementation of 0.3% and 0.5% fucoidan upregulated (p < 0.05) the gene expression of ZO-1 and claudin-1 in the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum, and dietary supplementation of 0.3% and 0.5% fucoidan upregulated (p < 0.05) the gene expression of occludin in the jejunum and ileum. The 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing results showed that at the phylum level, dietary fucoidan increased (p < 0.05) the abundance of Bacteroidetes while decreasing (p < 0.05) the abundance of Firmicutes. At the genus level, dietary 0.3% and 0.5% fucoidan increased (p < 0.05) the abundances of Unspecified_Ruminococcaceae, Unspecified_Bacteroidale, Unspecified_Clostridiales, and Akkermansia. In conclusion, dietary fucoidan supplementation had positive effects on intestinal permeability, antioxidant capacity, immunity function, tight junctions, and the cecal microflora balance in weaned goat kids.

AB  - Simple Summary Raising goats in tropical regions has become more popular in recent years. Black Bengal goats are meat-type goats that can resist hot environments. Identifying some selective genes related to growth is one of the most important factors for genetic improvement. The somatotropic axis is related to kid growth, while the growth hormone has been proven to be essential for the kid growth rate. The single-nucleotide polymorphisms of the growth hormone gene in dairy cows and many small ruminants showed that A781G and A1575G are related to growth rate. However, data on Black Bengal goats in Thailand are still limited and have shown variable results. The aims of the present study were to investigate genotypes and their association with the preweaning growth rate. Genotypes were identified from 77 goats of both sexes, and our results showed three different genootypes-AA, AB, and BB-for A781G, while only a CC genotype was found for A1575G. A relationship was found between preweaning growth and the genotypes of A781G, in which the AA genotype had the highest growth rate. Therefore, the identification of the genotypes of A781G can be applied in the management of breeding programs for Black Bengal goats in Thailand. The single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the growth hormone (GH) gene could be related to growth traits, particularly in farm animals. This study aimed to identify the SNPs of the GH gene (A781G and A1575G) in Black Bengal (BB) goats in Thailand. Seventy-seven BB goats of both sexes were recruited, and their genotypes were identified. Preweaning growth at birth (weight, W0; height, H0; length, L0; and chest girth, C0) and at 10 weeks postpartum (W10, H10, L10, and C10), including average daily gain (ADG) at 0-4 weeks (ADG0-4W), 4-8 weeks (ADG4-8W), and 8-12 weeks (ADG8-12W), was compared among the different genotypes in goats born from twin litter-size dams. The results showed one genotype, CC, for A1575G and three genotypes, AA, AB, and BB, for A781G. The AA gene had significantly higher W10 than AB (p < 0.05) and BB (p < 0.05). The AA had significantly higher L10 than AB (p < 0.05), while C10 was only higher in male goats (p < 0.01). The ADG4-8W of the AA genotype was significantly higher than the BB genotype (p < 0.01). We came to the conclusion that A781G is associated with growth traits during the preweaning period, while the AA genotype showed better performance than the other genotypes.

AB  - Like other threatened species, detailed knowledge of the food habits of the Souss Valley Tortoises (Testudo graeca graeca) is important for its conservation and management. We determined the composition of the diet and its seasonal changes using fecal microhistological analysis in tortoises from an arid steppe-land of the central Jbilet Mountains, west-central Morocco, between spring 2011 and winter 2012. Tortoises were exclusively herbivorous with a specialist trend selecting rare, very rare, or some abundant plant species. Diets differed among seasons as indicated by Margalef's Richness, Shannon's Diversity, and Evenness indices. The spring diet is more diverse, with 16 plant species consumed versus just five and seven species in summer and autumn-winter respectively, with only five shared species among all seasons. Dietary overlaps are low between spring and other seasons and between summer and autumn. Conversely, there is moderate overlap between the summer diet and no difference between the autumn and winter diets. Trophic niche overlap is highest between spring, winter, and medium between other seasons, and there is a pronounced similarity between autumn and winter. The data we provide on seasonal variations in diet could be useful in developing management plans for tortoises and their natural habitat in arid lands with low productivity.

AB  - Simple Summary Insecticide baits for use against subterranean termites have been shown to be highly effective, but the time required for termites to find and feed on baits may be a barrier to adoption in some areas. One explanation for this "time-to-attack" problem is that termite foraging near the soil surface may be limited during inhospitable periods. In California, characterized by a hot-summer Mediterranean climate, western subterranean termites have mostly been observed near the surface during the wet season, suggesting that baits installed in summer may sit uninvestigated for many months. To test this hypothesis, we established research plots in areas of known termite incidence, installing baits on four different dates over a one-year period and then recording termite activity every 60 days for two years. As expected, most foraging in these stations was observed in winter and spring. Time-to-attack for stations installed at the beginning of winter was significantly less than for stations installed at the beginning of summer (194 d vs. 296 d). These findings may help pest control operators in regions with pronounced dry periods to optimize their use of bait station systems by targeting specific installation seasons. Rhinotermitid termites, serious pests of wooden structures throughout the world, are commonly controlled with chitin synthesis inhibitor bait systems. Seasonal termite foraging patterns in some regions may prolong bait interception time, however, significantly decreasing colony elimination speed. We hypothesized that installing baits immediately prior to the season of highest foraging activity will minimize interception time when baiting for Reticulitermes spp. in California, a region characterized by a hot-summer Mediterranean climate. To test this theory, we installed three different bait systems on four dates corresponding to the major seasons (spring, summer, autumn, winter) at five field locations known to harbor the target species. We then recorded initial termite discovery events every 60 days for two years, considering effects of installation season, bait system, site, and distance from previously observed termite incidence on bait interception time. Observed foraging activity in bait stations was highest during late winter and spring. Baits installed during winter exhibited interception times more than 100 days shorter than those of baits installed during summer. From these findings, we conclude that colony elimination speed and perceived CSI bait utility may be increased in Mediterranean climate regions when baits are installed immediately prior to the wet season.

AB  - Simple SummaryHepatitis E is a viral disease found in humans worldwide. The hepatitis E virus (HEV) is also found in various animals, with pigs as the main reservoir. A transmission of the zoonotic genotype 3 to humans is possible via direct contact with infected animals or through the consumption of raw or undercooked meat. A good knowledge of the genetic diversity of the virus in pigs is needed to prevent future transmissions by tracing chains of infections. Thus, this study aimed at developing a practical and easy to use screening tool for pig herds and gaining first experiences with it. Sock swabs turned out to be the method of choice and were used to test 138 Swiss pig herds for HEV. In positive cases the virus was further characterized. Of the 138 farms tested, 81 were HEV positive (58.8%) and most viral sequences belonged to a distinct cluster within subtype 3h that was also commonly found in Swiss patients infected with HEV. These data showed that sock swabs are useful for HEV screening in pig herds, that HEV is frequent in Swiss pig herds, and that the same subtype of virus is found in Swiss pig farms and human patients.Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is an important cause of acute hepatitis in humans worldwide. In industrialised countries, most infections are caused by the zoonotic genotype 3. The main reservoir was found in pigs, with fattening pigs as the main shedders. The aim of this study was to establish a screening tool to detect HEV in pig farms. HEV-positive samples were sequenced using Sanger sequencing. First, different sample materials, including floor swabs, slurry, dust swabs and faeces were tested for HEV. Floor swabs turned out to give the best results and, in the form of sock swabs, were used for the screening of Swiss pig herds. A total of 138 pig farms were tested, with a focus on fattening pigs. Overall, 81 farms (58.8%) were HEV positive. Most sequences belonged to subtype 3h, in which they formed a specific cluster (Swiss cluster). In addition, subtype 3l and two unassigned sequences were detected. As a conclusion, sock swabs were found to be a helpful tool to screen pig herds for HEV and establish a sequence collection that may enable molecular epidemiology and support outbreak investigation and prevention.

AB  - The carob moth, Ectomyelois ceratoniae (Zeller) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), is an important pest of pistachio causing direct damage to nuts during ripening, and in storage. We examined the tritrophic effects of 5 pistachio cultivars, representing the full range of kernel suitability for E. ceratoniae, on 2 larval parasitoids, Habrobracon hebetor (Say) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), a gregarious, synovigenic, idiobiont, ectoparasitoid, and Venturia canescens Gravenhorst (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae), a solitary, pro-ovigenic, koinobiont, endoparasitoid. The suitability of pistachio cultivars for development and reproduction of the 2 parasitoids was closely correlated, despite their divergent lifestyles and developmental patterns, and paralleled variation in kernel suitability for host larvae. Although kernels of the most resistant cultivar reduced demographic parameters of the parasitoids, the potential impact on numerical responses was minor. Successful biological control of carob moth within the vulnerable period of nut ripening will likely depend on the functional responses of earlier generations of adult parasitoids emerging from other fruit and nut crops, or those released in an augmentation program.

AB  - Ghrelin (GHRL) is a gastric endocrine hormone, which has biological functions of regulation of appetite, body weight, gastrointestinal motility and growth hormone secretion. The aim of this study was to investigate the novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at GHRL gene in three different pig breeds, including Duroc, Yorkshire and Landrace, and the association of the novel SNPs with growth traits. PCR-SSCP and sequencing were used to detect the GHRL gene polymorphisms in the present study. Three SNPs were detected, one in the exon 1 (g.3734 G>T), which was synonymous, and two SNPs in intron 4 (g.7691 A>C and g.8523 T>C). The sites g.3734 G>T and g.7691 A>C had significantly impact on body weight at 21 days (BW21) and body weight at 70 days (BW70), the days when the pigs reached the target weights of 30 kg(D30) and 100 kg(D100), average daily gain between 30 kg and 100 kg (ADG), and backfat thickness of 100kg body weight (BFT) (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01), while did not contribute birth weight and days to 50 kg body weight(D50) (P > 0.05). At g.8523 T>C site, compared to TC genotype, the individuals with TT genotype in Duroc had greater D100 and BFT (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01), which had lower ADG between 30 kg and 100 kg (P < 0.01). In Yorkshire and Landrace, the polymorphism g.8523 T>C had no effect on the tested traits (P > 0.05). Our findings suggested that the 3 sites (g.3734 G>T, g.7691 A>C and g.8523 T>C) polymorphism in porcine GHRL gene might be one of the useful genetic marker in pig breeding and which needed to be further studied.

AB  - Kisspeptins (KISSs) and RFamide-related peptide-3 (RFRP-3) affect the synthesis and secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) and modulate female reproductive processes. The presence of KISS and RFRP-3 in the porcine pituitary gland and their contribution to the regulation of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) synthesis and secretion is unknown. This study analyzed the presence of KISS and RFRP-3 in the pituitary of estrous-cyclic pigs on days 2 to 3, 10 to 11, 12 to 13, 15 to 16 and 19 to 20 and early pregnant pigs on days 10 to 11, 12 to 13 and 15 to 16, and evaluated the effect of KISS and RFRP-3 on b-Fsh mRNA expression and FSH secretion in vitro by pituitary cells collected on selected days of the estrous cycle. The cells were cultured in vitro and treated with KISS (10(-6) M, 10(-7) M) and RFRP-3 (10(-6) M, 10(-7) M) or gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH; 100 ng/mL) alone and in combinations (4 h or 24 h). The relative abundance of Kiss and Rfrp-3 and their receptor mRNA transcripts, as well as the KISS and RFRP-3 proteins, were found in the pituitaries of estrous-cyclic and early pregnant pigs. KISS after 4 h increased the secretion of FSH in estrous cyclic pigs mostly during the early-luteal phase and luteolysis. RFRP-3 inhibited the synthesis and secretion of FSH in estrous-cyclic pigs on days 19 to 20 and the secretion of FSH on days 2 to 3 and 10 to 12 of the estrous cycle compared with GnRH-treated cells. KISS in cotreatment with GnRH after 24 h enhanced FSH release on days 2 to 3 and 15 to 16 of the estrous cycle. In conclusion, KISS and RFRP-3 systems are present in the pituitary of estrous-cyclic and pregnant pigs. In estrous-cyclic pigs, KISS and RFRP-3 may affect the synthesis and secretion of FSH by pituitary cells. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Simple Summary Previous research has shown that both landscape and field variables significantly influence the abundance of herbivorous insects and their natural enemies in Bt maize; however, crop phenology was found to have the strongest effects. Therefore, here, we studied how the planting period affected the insect dynamics in Bt maize. Our data provide clear evidence that the abundance of herbivores and natural enemies peaks in earlier growth stages and that their abundance varied between maize phenology stages, but interestingly, it did not show a strong effect when the planting period changed. Knowledge of the insect densities during crop development is necessary for adopting appropriate measures for the control of insect pests and minimizing yield losses. Within integrated pest management programs, crop rotation has been carried out in recent years, but this current trend delays the planting period for Bt maize. The small amount of available information regarding the influence of sowing Bt maize early or late on the seasonal abundance of herbivores prompted us to study these aspects in two current common planting periods in northeastern Spain in 52 maize fields over three consecutive years. We sampled the fields planted on different dates with sticky yellow traps. Our results show that only the abundances of herbivore thrips, other than Frankliniella occidentalis, and Syrphidae were significantly different between the two planting periods. Moreover, when we performed yearly analyses, we found significant effects of the planting period on Coccinellidae and Chrysopidae in 2015 and on Aeolothrips sp. in 2016 and 2017. In most of the taxa, the abundance peaks in earlier growth stages, which is related to pollination (before or during). Only the abundances of Stethorus punctillum and Syrphidae peak later in the season. In addition, F. occidentalis, aphids, Syrphidae, and Coccinellidae registered higher abundance in fields sown in the late planting period. These results highlight the effects of sowing in different planting periods on insect dynamics in Bt maize and can be used to identify the abundance of certain pests and natural enemies in specific phenological stages of maize, which may allow producers to adopt better-integrated management and thus avoid reaching the level of economic damage.

AB  - Humans automatically detect and remember regularities in the visual environment-a type of learning termed visual statistical learning (VSL). Many aspects of learning from reward resemble VSL in certain respects, yet whether and how reward learning impacts VSL is largely unexamined. In two studies, we found that reward contingencies affect VSL, with high-value associated with stronger behavioral and neural signatures of such learning than low-value images. In Experiment 1, participants learned values (high or low) of images through a trial-and-error risky choice task. Unbeknownst to them, images were paired as four types-High-High, High-Low, Low-High, and Low-Low. In subsequent recognition and reward memory tests, participants chose the more familiar of two pairs (a target and a foil) and recalled the value of images. We found better recognition when the first images of pairs have high-values, with High-High pairs showing the highest recognition rate. In Experiment 2, we provided evidence that both value and statistical contingencies affected brain responses. When we compared responses between the high-value first image and the low-value first image, greater activation in regions that included inferior frontal gyrus, anterior cingulate gyrus, hippocampus, among other regions, were found. These findings were driven by the interaction between statistically structured information and reward-the same value contrast yielded no regions for second-image contrasts and for singletons. Our results suggest that when reward information is embedded in stimulus-stimulus associations, it may alter the learning process; specifically, the higher-value first image potentially enables better memory for statistically learned pairs and reward information.

AB  - In China, fence net aquaculture practices have been established in some subsidence waters that have been formed in coal mining subsidence areas. Within this dynamic ecological context, diverse fish species grow continuously until being harvested at the culmination of their production cycle. The purpose of this study was to investigate diverse factors influencing the bioavailability and distribution of mercury (Hg) and methylmercury (MeHg), which have high physiological toxicity in fish, in the Guqiao coal mining subsidence area in Huainan, China. Mercury and MeHg were analyzed in 38 fish samples of eight species using direct mercury analysis (DMA-80) and gas chromatography-cold vapor atomic fluorescence spectrometry (GC-CVAFAS). The analysis results show that the ranges of Hg and MeHg content and methylation rate in the fish were 7.84-85.18 ng/g, 0.52-3.52 ng/g, and 0.81-42.68 %, respectively. Meanwhile, conclusions are also summarized as following: (1) Monophagous herbivorous fish that were fed continuously in fence net aquaculture areas had higher MeHg levels and mercury methylation rates than carnivorous fish. Hg and MeHg contents were affected by different feeding habits of fish. (2) Bottom-dwelling fish show higher MeHg levels, and habitat selection in terms of water depth also partially affected the MeHg content of fish. (3) The effect of fence net aquaculture on methylation of fish in subsidence water is mainly from feed and mercury-containing bottom sediments. However, a time-lag is observed in the physiological response of benthic fishes to the release of Hg from sediments. Our findings provides baseline reference data for the ecological impact of fence net aquaculture in waters affected by soil subsidence induced by coal mining in China. Prevalent environmental contaminants within coal mining locales, notably Hg, may infiltrate rain-induced subsidence waters through various pathways.

AB  - Cultivating insect-resistant plants is one of the essential parts of the integrated pest management approach. The genotype by yield*trait (GYT) biplot is a unique procedure for genotype evaluation through multiple traits. In the present study, soybean cultivars were planted on two sowing dates during two growing seasons. The cultivars were evaluated under the cotton bollworm (CBW), Helicoverpa armigera Hubner natural infestation conditions. Insect-damage-related traits were subjected to the GYT biplot analysis to identify the cultivars according to their tolerance against H. armigera and high yield performance and stability. According GT biplot analysis based on the angle between the traits (acute angle as positive, obtuse angle as negative and right angle as no correlations), the trichome density of the lower and upper surface of the leaves with grain yield was positive. Grain yield reduction (due to the insect damage) (YR) and pod damage (PD) were uncorrelated, and the correlation between biological yield reduction (BR) and PD was negative on the first sowing date. In contrast, the correlations of YR with PD, and BR with PD were positive on the second sowing date. All the yield-trait combinations were positively correlated on the first sowing date. A negative correlation between YLD*UTRM (trichome density of leaf upper surface) and YLD/YR, also between YLD*UTRM and YLD/BR was observed on the second sowing date. The GYT biplot showed cultivars Caspian and Williams had the best performance in combining yield and insect-damage-related traits under H. armigera infestation conditions on the first and second sowing dates, respectively.

AB  - This study explores the impact of potentially toxic metals (PTMs) contamination in Indian tea-growing soils on ecosystems, soil quality, and human health using machine learning and statistical analysis. A total of 148 surface soil samples were collected from: Terai, Dooars, Darjeeling, and Jorhat, which are significant regions for tea cultivation in India. Results showed that the PTM concentrations in total soil, bioavailable fraction (DTPA), and tea leaves were significantly higher than the acceptable limits in Zone 1. Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF), correlation analysis and Self-Organizing Map (SOM) were applied to identify primary pollution sources and contributors. A geospatial model was developed to forecast the PTMs distribution patterns in tea-growing zones. The Free Ion Activity Model (FIAM) assessed PTM solubility in contaminated soils and transfer to tea leaves, with Hazard Quotient values (FIAM-HQ < 0.5) moderately exceeding the safety threshold for Cr, Ni, Pb, Cd, and Cu. The severity adjustment margin of exposure (SAMOE) results indicate that PTM-contaminated tea poses a moderate (concern level 4: 0.01-0.1) health risk to humans for Cr: 0.045 and Ni: 0.062 except Pb, Cu, and Cd. Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) indicated that total carcinogenic risk (TCR) is significant, with children being the most affected compared to adults, as shown by Sensitivity analysis. This underscores the importance of addressing TCR, especially for children. This study underscores the ecological and health risks posed by PTM contamination in tea-growing soils, highlighting the need for targeted mitigation strategies to safeguard both soil quality and human health.

AB  - Individual niche variation occurs when individuals within a population adopt unique behavioural or ecological traits, giving the population a distinct niche structure. Although widespread amongst natural populations, most of niche theory and its applications in ecological and palaeoenvironmental contexts remains focused on species level patterns, treating variation within the population as noise. Using serial stable isotope profiles sampled along teeth of herbivore fossils recovered from the Mid-Pleistocene site of Kathu Pan 1, Northern Cape (South Africa), enabling partitioning of isotopic niche variation into between- and within-individual components. Stable carbon isotope data revealed significant dietary differences between-individuals within most of the taxa sampled, but no dietary differences between taxa. By contrast, stable oxygen isotope compositions were more consistent amongst individuals, but varied across taxa. In both isotope systems, as well as in bivariate space, most taxa comprised individuals with both narrow and broad isotope niches, indicating flexibility in dietary strategies. These results indicate sufficient opportunity for individual level specialization within the Kathu palaeocommunity, afforded by a palaeoenvironment that provided a consistent supply of resources year-round. Given the herbivore sample is strongly associated with fossil hominin activities, our results imply that hominins in these landscapes would have profited from year-round accessibility to resources, accounting for the record of occupancy of Kathu Pan I during the Mid-Pleistocene.

AB  - Anthelmintic resistance (AR) of soil-transmitted helminth parasites against the most widely available drugs is an ongoing concern for both human-infecting and livestock-infecting species. There has been substantial evidence of AR in livestock but less in humans, which may be due to a variety of reasons. In this paper, we develop an eco-evolutionary model that couples the life cycle of these parasites with their underlying evolution in a single biallelic genetic locus that confers resistance to treatment drugs. We determine the critical treatment frequency needed to effectively eliminate the population, for a fixed drug efficacy (without evolution) and use this to classify three qualitative distinct behaviors of the eco-evolutionary model. Then, we describe how aspects of the life cycle influence which qualitative outcome is achieved and the rate of spread of the resistance allele, comparing across parameterized models of human-infecting and livestock-infecting species. For all but one species, we find that lower fecundity rates and lower contact rates speed the spread of resistance, while lower larval death slows it down. The life cycle parameters of Ancylostoma duodenale and Ostertagia circumcincta are associated with the fastest and slowest spread of resistance, respectively. We discuss the mechanistic reason for these results.

AB  - Regular exercise has already been established as a vital strategy for maintaining physical health via experimental results in humans and animals. In addition, numerous human studies have reported that physical inactivity is a primary factor that causes obesity, muscle atrophy, metabolic diseases, and deterioration in cognitive function and mental health. Regardless, an established animal experimental method to examine the effect of physical inactivity on physiological, biochemical, and neuroscientific parameters is yet to be reported. In this study, we made a new housing cage, named as the physical inactivity (PI) cage, to investigate the effect of physical inactivity on cognitive function and depressive-like states in mice and obtained the following experimental results by its use. We first compared the daily physical activity of mice housed in the PI and standard cages using the nano-tag method. The mice's physical activity levels in the PI cage decreased to approximately half of that in the mice housed in the standard cage. Second, we examined whether housing in the PI cage affected plasma corticosterone concentration. The plasma corticosterone concentration did not alter before, 1 week, or 10 weeks after housing. Third, we investigated whether housing in the PI cage for 10 weeks affected cognitive function and depressive behavior. Housing in an inactive state caused a cognitive decline and depressive state in the mice without increasing body weight and plasma corticosterone. Finally, we examined the effect of regular low-intensity exercise on cognitive function and depressive state in the mice housed in the PI cage. Physical inactivity decreased neuronal cell proliferation, blood vessel density, and gene expressions of vascular endothelial growth factors and brain-derived neurotrophic factors in the hippocampus. In addition, regular low-intensity exercise, 30 min of treadmill running at a 5-15 m/min treadmill speed 3 days per week, prevented cognitive decline and the onset of a depressive-like state caused by physical inactivity. These results showed that our novel physical inactivity model, housing the mice in the PI cage, would be an adequate and valuable experimental method for examining the effect of physical inactivity on cognitive function and a depressive-like state.

AB  - A new genus of derelomine flower weevil (Curculionidae: Derelomini sensu Franz 2006), Ebenacobius Haran gen. nov., is described to accommodate a clade of species morphologically and phylogenetically distinct from other genera in this tribe. This genus can be diagnosed as follows: protibiae armed with an apical mucro, claws free, eye convexity exceeding the contour of head in dorsal view and forehead with a median furrow. In total, 19 species are recognized in this genus; 14 species are described as new (E. curvisetis Haran gen. et sp. nov.; E. duplicatus Haran gen. et sp. nov.; E. grobbelaarae Haran gen. et sp. nov.; E. hessei Haran gen. et sp. nov.; E. hippopotamorum Haran gen. et sp. nov.; E. kuscheli Haran gen. et sp. nov.; E. mulanjensis Haran gen. et sp. nov.; E. oberprieleri Haran gen. et sp. nov.; E. rectirostris Haran gen. et sp. nov.; E. san Haran gen. et sp. nov.; E. pedi Haran gen. et sp. nov.; E. thoracicus Haran gen. et sp. nov.; E. tsonga Haran gen. et sp. nov. and E. xhosa Haran gen. et sp. nov.), five species of Derelomus Schoenherr (D. atratus Hesse; D. costalis F??hraeus; D. incognitus Hesse; D. rhodesianus Hesse; D. turneri Marshall) are hereby transferred to Ebenacobius gen. nov. and one species name is placed in synonymy (Derelomus rugosicollis Hesse, 1929 = Derelomus costalis F??hraeus, 1844 syn. nov.). Members of Ebenacobius gen. nov. seem to develop in inflorescences of dicot plants, with larval stages of at least two species recovered from the flowers of Euclea species (Ebenaceae). A key to the continental African genera of Derelomini and to species of Ebenacobius gen. nov. is provided. Pictures of habitus and terminalia of adults, along with distribution and life history data are also provided for each species.

AB  - Ungulate herbivory is a key driver of leaf trait syndromes and defense strategies at the ecological and macroevolutionary levels. Herbivory should also cause short-term evolution within plant populations, but few studies have experimentally tested this prediction. We set out to experimentally assess the plastic and heritable effects of contemporary history of ungulate herbivory on 1) leaf trait syndromes at the intraspecific level, and on the defense traits, 2) leaf size and 3) size of spines. We measured leaf traits (specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, leaf nitrogen concentration and leaf mechanical resistance) in populations of six grass and four woody legume species that had grown under contrasting pressures of domestic ungulate herbivory for at least 40 years. We then performed a common garden experiment, measuring the same traits. Next, we performed cutting experiments on the plants grown in the common garden to measure leaf trait plasticity. In the woody species, we also measured the length of spines and the leaf size (average area per leaf), in the field and in the common garden experiment. We found that in grasses field herbivory over decades produced a displacement toward more acquisitive leaf trait syndromes. Most of these changes appeared largely due to plasticity. In woody legume species, in contrast, herbivory produced a displacement towards more conservative leaves, longer spines and smaller leaves, with the trait differences between histories of herbivory being mostly hereditary. These results point out that vertebrate herbivory can lead to evolutionary processes at contemporary time scales even in long-lived perennial plant species, but the direction of such change depends on the life form of the species. These divergent effects could depend on the predominant anti-herbivore strategies in the different life forms (tolerance versus resistance).

AB  - Microtubules (MTs) form physiologically important cytoskeletal structures that are assembled by tubulin polymerization in nucleation- and guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-dependent manner. GTP hydrolysis competes with the addition of monomers, to determine the GTP-cap size, and the onset of shrinkage, which alternates with growth. Multiple theoretical models of MT polymerization dynamics have been reconciled to the kinetics of animal brain tubulins, but more recently, rapid kinetics seen in Arabidopsis tubulin polymerization suggest the need to sample a wider diversity in tubulin polymerization kinetics and reconcile it to theory. Here, we isolated tubulin from seedlings of Vigna sp. (mung bean), compared polymerization kinetics to animal brain tubulin, and used a computational model to understand the differences. We find that activity-isolated mung tubulin polymerizes in a nucleation-dependent manner, based on turbidimetry, qualitatively similar to brain tubulin, but with a 10-fold smaller critical concentration. GTP-dependent polymerization kinetics also appear to be transient, indicative of high rates of GTP hydrolysis. Computational modeling of tubulin nucleation and vectorial GTP hydrolysis to examine the effects of high nucleation and GTP-hydrolysis rates predicts a dominance of the latter in determining MT lengths and numbers. Microscopy of mung tubulin filaments stabilized by GMPCPP or taxol results in few and short MTs, compared to the many long MTs arising from goat tubulin, qualitatively matching the model predictions. We find GTP-hydrolysis outcompetes nucleation rates in determining MT lengths and numbers.

AB  - The U.S. swine industry is diverse, but opportunities exist to strategically improve manure management, especially given much of the industry's vertical integration. We investigate opportunities for improving manureshed management, using swine production examples in Iowa, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania as a lens into historical trends and the current range of management conditions. Manure management reflects regional differences and the specialized nature of hog farms, resulting in a large range of land bases required to assimilate manure generated by these operations. Selected representative farm scenarios were evaluated on an annual basis; farm-level manuresheds were largest for Pennsylvania sow farms and smallest for North Carolina nursery farms. Compared with nitrogen-based manuresheds, phosphorus-based manuresheds were up to 12.5 times larger. Technology advancements are needed to promote export of concentrated nutrients, especially phosphorus, from existing "source" manuresheds to suitable croplands. The industry is dynamic, as revealed by historical analysis of the siting of hog barns in Pennsylvania, which are currently trending toward the north and west where there is greater isolation to prevent the spread of disease and a larger land base to assimilate manure. Industry expansion should focus on locating animals in nutrient "sink" areas.

AB  - This study was carried out on pregnant uteruses obtained from healthy Hair goats (Capra aegagrus hircus). A total of thirteen pregnant uteruses, six second and seven third trimesters, were used. Morphometrically, placentome numbers, lengths, widths and depths were measured. Randomly selected placentomes from the second and third trimesters were stained with the triple staining method. Caruncular and cotyledonary areas, capillary numbers and areas were measured using Qupath v0.5.0 software. The Minitab (version 21.4.1) was used for statistical analysis. While no statistical difference was observed in the number of placentomes between trimesters (p > 0.05), placentome length, width and depth were higher in the third trimester compared to the second trimester (p < 0.001). No difference was observed in the number of caruncular and cotyledonary capillaries in the second trimester. In the second trimester, the caruncular capillary area was higher than the cotyledonary capillary area (p < 0.05). Both caruncular and cotyledonary capillary area parameters were higher in the third trimester than in the second trimester (p < 0.001). In the third trimester, the caruncular capillary area was higher than the cotyledonary capillary area (p < 0.001). The number of caruncular capillaries and cotyledonary capillaries was statistically significantly higher in the third trimester compared to the second trimester. In addition, the number of cotyledonary capillaries was higher than that of caruncular capillaries in the third trimester (p < 0.001). A positive and significant correlation was found between the day of pregnancy and the number of placentomes in the second trimester (p < 0.05). No correlation was observed between the day of pregnancy and the number of placentomes in the third trimester. Vascular area density showed a faster development in foetal tissue than in maternal tissue. Placentome size and angiogenesis increased with the progression of pregnancy.

AB  - Compound extremes can arise from combinations of multiple drivers, and even non-extreme univariate events can combine to cause large societal and economic impacts. In this study, we model multivariate compound events focusing on the potential interaction of nitrate loads and discharge. We use daily discharge and nitrate loads at seven US Geological Survey sites in the state of Iowa. We apply a two-sided conditional sampling method, which derives two joint probabilities conditioning on discharge and nitrate loads, respectively. Our results show that there is a dependence between discharge and nitrate loads, which can be described through bivariate modeling and the subsequent estimation of their joint annual exceedance probabilities (AEPs). The magnitude of the joint AEPs to extreme discharge and extreme nitrate loads exhibit different structures across the different sites, highlighting the different roles of these two quantities in controlling their compounding. In examining the ranges in design values for a given AEP, we found that the largest variability in highly likely values was generally associated with high agricultural intensity, high hog density, and fertilizer expenditures.

AB  - Simple Summary: Building on our previous research, which demonstrated that replacing 100% inorganic trace minerals with 30% amino acid-chelated minerals significantly enhanced antioxidant capacity and nutrient utilization efficiency and reduced fecal mineral excretion in growing-finishing pigs while preserving growth performance, this study aimed to investigate the feasibility of implementing an even greater reduction in chelated trace mineral supplementation. We found that low-dose substitution of trace minerals did not have any adverse effects on growth performance, carcass traits, meat quality, or nutrient digestibility. Moreover, the organic trace minerals (amino acid chelates) exhibited greater efficacy in enhancing antioxidant activity, as seen through higher antioxidant enzyme activities and lower malondialdehyde content in the liver. They also showed better trace element deposition in the muscle and liver than inorganic minerals. Additionally, both low-dose inorganic and organic trace mineral substitutions effectively reduced fecal emissions of heavy metals, and low-dose organic ones showed greater efficiency, which is an important aspect considering environmental concerns in the livestock industry. The results of this study are of great significance as they provide new insights into the use of different forms and doses of trace minerals in pig diets.
   Our previous study has shown that replacing 100% inorganic trace minerals with 30% amino acid-chelated ones can enhance antioxidant capacity, improve nutrient digestibility, and reduce fecal excretion in growing-finishing pigs without compromising performance. This study aimed to further reduce the amino acid-chelated trace minerals content in pig diets and assess its impact. Seventy-two growing-finishing barrows (Duroc x Landrace x Yorkshire), with an initial average body weight of 67.04 +/- 0.12 kg, were divided into four groups: negative control (NC, no additional trace minerals), high-dose inorganic trace minerals (HITM, 100% inorganic; 75 mg/kg Fe, 10 mg/kg Cu, 65 mg/kg Zn, 25 mg/kg Mn), and two low-dose groups (15 mg/kg Fe, 4 mg/kg Cu, 12.5 mg/kg Zn, 5 mg/kg Mn) receiving either inorganic sulfates (LITM) or amino acid-chelates (LOTM). The trial concluded when the body weight of pigs reached similar to 130 kg. Results showed that low-dose trace mineral substitution did not adversely affect growth performance, carcass traits, meat quality, or nutrient digestibility in growing-finishing pigs (p > 0.05). The LOTM pigs exhibited significantly higher serum glutathione peroxidase, liver total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD), and CuZn-SOD activities, muscle CuZn-SOD and catalase activities, and lower liver malondialdehyde content compared with LITM (p < 0.05). Muscle CuZn-SOD in LITM was lower than HITM (p < 0.05), but not in LOTM (p > 0.05). LOTM showed significantly higher muscle Fe content and lower muscle Mn content compared with HITM (p < 0.05), yet its muscle Mn level was higher than that of LITM (p < 0.05). Liver Zn content decreased in LITM compared with HITM (p < 0.05), but remained unchanged in LOTM (p > 0.05). Both LITM and LOTM significantly reduced fecal emissions of Fe, Cu, Zn, and Mn compared with HITM (p < 0.05), with greater reductions in Cu, Zn, and Mn in LOTM. In conclusion, low-dose substitution of inorganic or organic trace minerals did not negatively affect growth, carcass traits, meat quality, or nutrient digestibility in growing-finishing pigs, while it effectively reduced fecal heavy metal emissions. Organic trace minerals were more effective in enhancing antioxidant activity and trace mineral deposition.

AB  - Background:Chronic rhinosinusitis is a disease of the nasal and sinus mucosa with direct and indirect costs for individuals and society, including the risk of transition to lower airway diseases. Using electronic health records from the Geisinger Health System in Pennsylvania, we evaluated associations of environmental and community features as surrogates for aeroallergens with radiologic sinus inflammation, an objective finding of chronic rhinosinusitis.Methods:In a nested case-control study using electronic health records data, we included individuals aged 18-80 years from 2008 to 2018, with two encounters in the 4 years before their index date, and residence in a 38-county study region. We identified cases (n = 2,382) with radiologic sinus inflammation using a validated text algorithm applied to sinus computed tomography scan reports. Controls (n = 11,910) were frequency-matched on age, sex, and year of encounter. Exposures were assigned based on the residential address within latency and duration windows. We used logistic regression with robust standard errors clustered on community to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals while adjusting for confounding variables.Results:Cases and controls had a mean (SD) age of 49.5 (15.3) years, were predominantly non-Hispanic White (96%), and had a mean (SD) contact time with the Geisinger Health System of 5.88 (3.29) years. We found independent associations of greater urbanization, higher greenness, higher cumulative growing degree days, and lower precipitation with increased odds of radiologic sinus inflammation. Residence in higher density urban areas (compared with rural) was strongly associated (odds ratio [95% confidence interval]) with radiologic sinus inflammation (1.70 [1.31, 2.21]).Conclusions:Higher cumulative growing degree days, greater urbanization, lower precipitation, and higher greenness had robust associations with radiologic sinus inflammation. Findings reflect the complexity of environmental and community risk factors that directly and indirectly influence radiologic sinus inflammation, including both aeroallergens and air pollutants. Risk of this objective finding of chronic rhinosinusitis could increase with continued climate change-driven variation in weather and land use.

AB  - Fasciclin-like arabinogalactan proteins (FLAs) are a class of highly glycosylated glycoproteins that perform crucial functions in plant growth and development. This study was carried out to further explore their roles in pollen tube growth. The results showed that seven members (CoFLA1/2/3/4/7/8/17) of the CoFLAs family were identified by sequence characteristics, and they all possessed the fasciclin 1 (FAS1) domain and H1 and H2 conserved domains. They were all located on the plasma membranes of tobacco epidermal cells, and the GPIanchor sequences of CoFLA1/2/3/4 determined the membrane localization. In flower tissues, CoFLA2 and CoFLA8 were not expressed in the pollen tube but were expressed in the unpollinated style and ovary; the others were all expressed in the pollen tube. In the pollination-compatible style and ovary, they exhibited different expression patterns. Furthermore, all CoFLAs promoted pollen germination in vitro, while only CoFLA7 significantly promoted pollen tube elongation, and the expression of CoFLA1/3/4/7/17 in pollen tubes was regulated by CoFLA proteins. The ABA and ABA synthetic inhibitor (sodium tungstate, ST) both inhibited pollen tube elongation; however, only ST downregulated the expression of CoFLA1/7/17 and upregulated the expression of CoFLA4. Taken together, these results demonstrate that CoFLAs may be significant in pollen tube growth in C. oleifera and that some CoFLAs may participate in the regulation of ABA signaling.

AB  - Hyperspectral video camera captures spatial, spectral, and temporal information of moving objects. Traditional object tracking methods developed for color videos have been applied to hyperspectral videos after compressing hundreds of spectral bands into three, which does not fully use the wealth spectral information. To address this issue, we present a tensor sparse correlation filter (CF) with a spatial-spectral weighted regularizer for object tracking. First, tensor processing is used to reduce the spectral differences in homogeneous background, thereby producing robust spectral structure features. Second, a spatial-spectral weighted regularizer is designed in the CF framework to penalize filter template by suppressing the spectral features dissimilar to the center pixel in tracking. Third, a sparse constraint term and tracking context information are incorporated to suppress unexpected peaks in the response map. Finally, a reformulated stacked histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) feature extractor and a 2-D adaptive scale search strategy are developed to further improve the tracker's feature discrimination and scale adaptation capability. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior tracking performance than the traditional CF-based trackers.

AB  - Mammalian newborns depend on their mother's milk to satisfy their initial needs of protection and nutrition. They reach the source of milk in following visual, tactile and olfactory cues. In particular, parturient ewes produce an odorous wax in the inguinal glands close to the teats. When presented separately to newly born lambs, this inguinal wax (IW) elicits arousal, head orientation, licking and increased respiratory rate indicative of their avidity for it. The present study assessed whether transferring IW into the environment of artificially fed lambs would improve their responses to the novelty of the situation. We first assessed whether suckled lambs preferred an IW-scented teat to a scentless control teat. Then, we assessed whether a teat odorized with IW was more easily learned as suckable relative to a control teat. Finally, the lambs' growth performance from postnatal days (PND) 0 and 20 was compared in groups reared with or without IW spread on the milk-feeder in their home pen. The behavioral assays did not evidence any significant effect of IW odor on previously suckled lambs' attraction and appetence responses. However, relative to the scentless control condition, being exposed to an IWsmeared milk-feeder led to a higher body weight at 20 days after birth. In the conditions of the present study, namely after suckling initiation, IW odor appeared not to be a strong determinant of short-term attraction or appetitive behavior in neonate lambs. The continued presence of IW, a familiar odor, in the artificial suckling context may improve artificially-reared lambs' emotional state that may affect their weight gain.

AB  - The screening of genomic variations within the male-specific region of the mammalian Y chromosome (MSY) is one of the most effective ways to investigate paternal evolutionary history and identify mo-lecular markers related to male fertility. The current study was to identify single nucleotide poly-morphisms (SNPs) within single-copy genes of the ovine MSY, and confirm whether they are associated with testicular size. A total of 21 Y-specific gene fragments were successfully amplified to screen Y-SNPs in 956 rams across nine sheep breeds. Three Y-SNPs, including SRY16: g.88 A > Gin South African Mutton Merino sheep, ZFY16: g.146 C > T in Suffolk and South African Mutton Merino sheep, and EIF2S3Y2: g.77 C > G in Hu and Tan sheep, were identified using DNA-pooled sequencing and PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) methods. The investigation of the global distribution for three Y-SNPs showed that the C allele of ZFY16: g.146 C > T co-segregated with haplogroup y-HC, and the C/G allele of EIF2S3Y2: g.77 C > G co-segregated with haplogroup y-HA/y-HB1 in Hu sheep according to data mining from a previous study. In addition, association analysis revealed that ZFY16: g.146 C > T had a significant effect on yearling scrotal circumference in Suffolk sheep, and EIF2S3Y2: g.77 C > G was significantly associated with testicular and epididymis weight in Hu sheep (P <= 0.05). The current study concluded that Y-SNPs were associated with testicular size in specific sheep, which provides valuable candidate makers for selecting elite rams at an early age.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Simple Summary: Protein in the diet is essential for the growth and health of ruminants and other animal species. Protein is also one of the most expensive components in animals' diets, and finding good protein sources can sometimes be challenging. Urea supplementation, as a non-protein nitrogen source, is often recommended for goats fed low-quality forages. In the rumen, microorganisms transform urea into microbial protein that can be assimilated by the animal. In this study, we investigated nitrogen utilization in goats fed low-quality hay supplemented with molasses blocks containing various levels of urea. The findings and discussion in this paper contribute to a better understanding of nitrogen utilization in goats using urea as a non-protein nitrogen source. The use of goats for meat production faces challenges from environmental and nutritional factors. Urea is an affordable non-protein nitrogen source commonly utilized in ruminant nutrition. The objective of this study was to investigate nitrogen utilization in goats fed low-quality hay supplemented with molasses blocks containing urea. Twenty Anglo-Nubian doelings were individually housed in metabolic cages and provided with chopped Buffelgrass (Cenchrus ciliaris) hay ad libitum. Goats were randomly assigned to four urea levels (0, 2, 4, and 6%; n = 5 per treatment) in molasses blocks for a duration of 30 days. A negative nitrogen balance (-2.458 g/day) was observed in doelings consuming blocks without urea, compared with a positive balance (0.895 g/d) for those consuming the 6% urea blocks. Block nitrogen intake significantly increased with urea level, but urea supplementation did not affect dry matter (DM) or neutral detergent fiber (NDFom) intake or digestibility. A minimum crude protein (CP) requirement of 8% for maintenance in doelings consuming low-quality forage with a urea-based supplement was determined through regression analysis between CP intake (% of DM) and N balance (r(2) = 0.479; p < 0.002). The value of 8% of CP obtained in this study is similar to several previous studies reported in the literature, but in this case, the increments in CP came exclusively from urea. In this study, increasing the urea content of molasses blocks up to 6% significantly increased nitrogen intake, retention, and balance in goats. These results contribute to a better understanding of nitrogen utilization in goats fed low-quality hay with urea supplementation.

AB  - Simple Summary Buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis) are one of the important dairy animals in Egypt because they account for about 56% of total milk production. However, Egyptian buffaloes are characterized by low reproductive potential. Prolonged acyclicity and anestrum are major sources of economic loss in postpartum buffaloes. Therefore, various protocols that have been established to enhance the reproductive performance of postpartum buffaloes are of great value. The purpose of the present study was to assess the effect of the administration of estradiol benzoate on ovarian and uterine hemodynamics using color Doppler technology in postpartum dairy buffaloes. The findings of the current study are very important because they give new insight into the potential improvement of estradiol benzoate for improving the hemodynamic parameters of ovarian structures and the uterus concomitantly, with improvements in circulating estradiol and nitric oxide levels, in buffaloes 4 weeks postpartum. The postpartum (PP) period is a crucial stage for the resumption of reproductive performance and ovarian cyclicity in dairy buffaloes. The present study aimed, for the first time, to assess the effect of the administration of estradiol benzoate (EB) on ovarian and uterine hemodynamics in PP dairy buffaloes. Eight pluriparous acyclic domestic buffaloes were enrolled in the present experiment and received a dose of 10 mg of estradiol benzoate (EB) intramuscularly 4 weeks after parturition. All animals were examined two times before EB administration (days -3, and -1) and on the day of EB administration (day 0), followed by examinations on days 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 post-EB administration. The middle uterine artery (MUA) and ovarian artery (OA) blood flow patterns were assessed using a color Doppler ultrasound device. The reproductive parameters were (1) the cross-sectional diameters (cm) of the OA and MUA, (2) cranial uterine horn thickness (UHT; cm), and (3) hemodynamic changes within the MUA on both the ipsi- and contra-lateral sides of the previous pregnant horn and within the OA corresponding to the ovarian tissues. The examined blood flow parameters were the pulsatility index (PI), resistance index (RI), peak systolic/end-diastolic ratio (S/D), time-averaged maximum velocity (TAV; cm/s), uterine blood flow rate (BFR; bpm), and uterine blood flow volume (BFV; mL/min). Concomitantly, blood samples were collected from the coccygeal vein, and the sera were stored at -18 & DEG;C for use in estradiol (E2-17 & beta;) and nitric oxide (NO) assays. The results revealed increases in both OA and MUA cross-sectional diameter (cm) on the ipsi-lateral and contra-lateral (p < 0.05) sides within 24 h until day 9 post-treatment. The values of the RI and PI of blood flow within the OA and MUA on the ipsi-lateral and contra-lateral sides of the previous pregnancy were obviously lower (p < 0.05) at 24 h after the administration of EB, and then, started to gradually elevate, reaching the pre-treatment values on day 9 after EB administration. Both the BFR and BFV in the OA and MUA significantly increased from 24 h to 72 h after EB administration on both the ipsi-lateral and contra-lateral sides (p < 0.05); then, their values started to decrease to reach the pretreatment value on day 9 after EB administration. Both E2 and NO concentrations significantly increased (p < 0.05) from 24 h until day 3 after EB injection and then started to decline after that, reaching the pre-treatment value on day 9.
   In conclusion, the administration of EB enhances the ovarian and uterine blood flow concomitantly with increased levels of NO in PP dairy buffaloes.

AB  - Hydrogen and oxygen isotope ratios in proteinaceous tissues have been used for some time in migratory, ecological, and archaeological studies. While the result of isotopic variation in drinking water and diet has been investigated with controlled feeding experiments and studies in the wild, there are few controlled feeding studies that manipulate the diet components and diet type, and this across different taxa. In this experiment, the diet fed to rats, guinea pigs, and quail varied from plant-based to insect-based and meat-based pelleted diets. We report the diet to tissue offsets for delta H-2 (denoted Delta delta H-2) and delta O-18 (Delta delta O-18) of tissue-bound organic matter in two tissue types: muscle and dentine collagen. The diet to tissue offset varies by diet type in muscle of all three species, by up to 16 parts per thousand (Delta delta H-2) and 2 parts per thousand (Delta delta O-18). In dentine collagen, a range of similar to 20 parts per thousand in Delta delta H-2 and similar to 1.5 parts per thousand in Delta delta O-18 are observed across diets, though in a smaller number of samples. Additionally, we note large variation in Delta delta H-2 and Delta delta O-18 by tissue type (delta H-2 = similar to 60 parts per thousand, delta O-18 = similar to 3-4 parts per thousand) and more moderate differences by species (up to delta H-2 = 7.4 parts per thousand, delta O-18 = 1.5 parts per thousand). The difference in consumer tissue Delta delta H-2 and Delta delta O-18 by diet type is important to consider as a source of isotopic variability for some studies such as migratory research or diet or drinking water reconstructions and (palaeo-)climate inferences drawn from them, particularly in species that may vary their dietary habits.

AB  - The huge volume of wastes generated from industries kindles immediate attention, especially those wastes that bring adverse effects to humans and the environment. For one, cassava waste pulps (CWPs) from starch-producing industries are needing attention for its alternate disposal by making value-adding products out of it. In this work, the CWP with pig manure as inoculum was anaerobically digested for the possible production of biogas. The effect of the concentration of pig manure (CPM) and biomass to water ratio (BMR) was scientifically analyzed in relation to biogas yield. The central composite design of the response surface methodology was used as the design of the experiment. Biogas yield was modeled and characterized according to essential properties. The result of the batch experiment obtained a biogas yield of 4.9-7.3 L per kg of CWP. At optimized conditions of 250 gVS of CPM and 1:1.22 BWR (kg/L), the optimum biogas volume was 7.43 +/- 0.58 L per kg of CWP. Analysis of the produced biogas via gas chromatography showed a significant concentration of biohydrogen (18.69 +/- 1.71%), a highly desirable upshot considering that this gas is highly flammable with less emissions when combusted. Other percent components of the produced biogas include carbon dioxide (38.02 +/- 0.71), nitrogen (20.77 +/- 1.59), and a trace of methane (0.73 +/- 0.28). This work, therefore, proved that CWP can be used for the production of biogas and would eventually provide practical solutions to starch processing industries as it gives promising lucrative routes of CWP with added commercial worth in the production of high-value energy resources like the desirable H-2 gas. It poises high potentials with less socio-economic apprehensions while offers numerous environmental advantages.

AB  - White stork nestlings can provide quantitative data on the quality of the environment, as they are dependent on their parents that provide locally foraged food. Blood was sampled from the brachial vein (n = 109) and the sampling was performed in parallel with ringing during breeding season 2020 from five areas in eastern Croatia: Lonjsko polje, Jelas polje, Slavonski Brod-east, Podunavlje, and Donje Podravlje. In the present study, for the first time in Croatia, the following enzymatic biomarkers were assessed in white stork nestlings: activities of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), carboxylesterase (CES), glutathione S-transferase (GST), and glutathione reductase (GR), as well as nonenzymatic biomarkers: levels of glutathione (GSH) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). All endpoints were measured in two blood fractions: plasma and a postmitochondrial fraction (S9). Nestlings from Podunavlje and Donje Podravlje, areas known for intensive agriculture, showed lower AChE and CES activity when compared to the other investigated areas, indicating the presence of inhibitory xenobiotics. Higher oxidative stress was observed in Slavonski Brod-east, an area surrounded by metal and engineering industry, and Podunavlje compared to the other sampling areas. Hence, this study shows the impact of pollutants from the surrounding metal, petroleum, and agricultural industry might have on the biomarkers in white stork nestlings, which are often seen as early-warning signals.

AB  - With growing evidence of widespread health and environmental impacts from oil and gas activity, localities and states are beginning to develop protective measures. Interdisciplinary approaches that integrate across human, wildlife, domesticated animal, and land health are likely to provide more just and comprehensive solutions than would be possible with siloed approaches. However, this is not common practice, and there is little guidance on how to apply such a strategy. In the present article, we summarize the state of knowledge on the impacts of terrestrial unconventional oil and gas development from the fields of ecology and public health. We then discuss synergies and trade-offs regarding impacts and mitigation strategies emerging from these two literatures. Finally, we provide recommendations for research and practice to fill knowledge gaps and better inform integrated decision-making to achieve multiple benefits and minimize impacts on human, wildlife, domesticated animals, and land health from energy development.

   Maintaining high productivity in small ruminants is hindered by infection with the parasitic gastrointestinal nematode (GIN) Haemonchus contortus. There is an increasing interest to find alternative treatments for controlling GINs due to the rapid development of resistance to synthetic anthelmintics. Supplementary feeding of plant nutraceuticals or mineral supplements may contribute to improving the resilience of lambs. The trace element selenium and vitamin E act synergistically as antioxidants in circulation, but the natural occurrence of selenium is very low in the soil, grain, and roughage. The aim of this study was therefore to determine the long-term effects of medicinal plants and organic selenium in lambs experimentally infected with H. contortus. The results indicated that both supplements favorably affected the infected lambs and may provide a new approach to controlling haemonchosis in small ruminants.
   The objective of this study was to determine the effect of traditional medicinal plants typical to Central Europe as well as organic selenium on increasing the resistance of lambs to gastrointestinal nematode (GIN) infection with Haemonchus contortus. 21 female lambs were infected with third-stage larvae of H. contortus on the day (D) 0 and re-infected on D49 and D77. The animals were divided into three groups based on a treatment diet: a basal diet (control), a diet enriched with dry plants (Herbmix), and a diet enriched with selenized yeast (Selplex). The number of eggs per gram (EPG) of feces was quantified on D21, D28, D35, D42, D49, D56, D63, D70, D77, D84, D91, D98, D105, D112, and D119. The mean reductions in EPG on D28 were 43.4 and 28.6% for Selplex and Herbmix, respectively. The reduction in egg output was nearly uniform throughout the experiment for Selplex. However, for Herbmix the mean reduction was only 19.8% up to D91 and 46.1% after D91. Glutathione peroxidase activity in the blood from D35 to D98 was two to three-fold higher for Selplex than the other groups. Both supplements slowed the dynamics of GIN infection and gradually increased the resistance of lambs against ovine haemonchosis.

AB  - Microcystin-leucine-arginine (MC-LR) is a natural toxin produced by freshwater cyanobacteria that can cause pubertal growth retardation. As bone tissues are the supporting organ of the body, it remains unknown whether MC-LR interferes with adolescent growth and development by targeting bone tissue. In the present study, MC-LR accumulated in bones and caused increased loss of trabecular bone and incomplete bone microstructure, leading to bone retardation in adolescent mice. Moreover, the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the bone marrow cavity of MC-LR-treated femurs led to the presence of massive numbers of senescent bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), which was responsible for enhanced adipogenic differentiation of BMSCs rather than osteogenic differentiation. MC-LR-treated BMSCs presented an obvious decrease in the expression of glutaminase (GLS), a key gene for glutamine metabolism, accompanied by a decrease in glutamate content and GSH synthesis, which was the main cause of ROS accumulation. Activation of GLS reversed MC-LR-induced BMSCs senescence by promoting glutamine metabolism and reducing ROS release. Moreover, transcriptome sequencing data from BMSCs exposed to MC-LR indicated that the Hippo pathway was enriched, and endogenous levels of Yes-associated protein (YAP) were markedly decreased under MC-LR exposure. The overexpression of YAP promoted GLS transcription by facilitating its promoter, which then reversed MC-LR-induced disturbance of glutamine metabolism and BMSCs senescence. After MC-LR exposure, decreased protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity can activate the Hippo pathway. These findings suggest that MC-LR binds to and inhibits PP2A activity, causes activation of the Hippo pathway, blocks GLS-mediated glutamine metabolism, and accelerates BMSCs senescence, which is the key to delaying MC-LR-induced adolescent bone development retardation.

AB  - Background: Micronutrient malnutrition affects millions of people due to a lack of Zn and Se. Methods: The process conditions for the manufacture of glycine-chelated sodium selenite (Se-Gly) and zinc sulfate heptahydrate (Zn-Gly) were studied. The effects of ligand concentration, pH, reaction ratio, reaction temperature, and reaction time on fertilizer stability were assessed. The effects of Zn-Gly and Se-Gly on tea plants were determined. Results: Orthogonal experiments showed that the optimal preparation conditions for Zn-Gly (75.80 % Zn chelation rate) were pH 6.0, ligand concentration 4 %, reaction ratio 1:2, reaction time 120 min, reaction temperature 70 celcius. The optimal preparation conditions for Se-Gly (56.75 % Se chelation rate) were pH 6.0, ligand concentration 10%, reaction ratio 2:1, reaction time 40 min, temperature 50 celcius. Each chelate was completely soluble in water and verified by infrared spectroscopy and ultraviolet spectroscopy. Conclusions: Zn-Gly and Se-Gly increased the Zn and Se content in tea plants, and foliar application was more effective than soil application. Combined application of Zn-Gly and Se-Gly was more effective than Zn-Gly or Se-Gly alone. Our findings suggest that Zn-Gly and Se-Gly provide a convenient method of addressing human Zn and Se deficiency.

AB  - Though building-scale energy demand and indoor thermal comfort have been extensively covered by recent studies, the automation of middle- and larger-scale outdoor microclimate evaluation in parametric design is less covered. The relatively slow computation and the need for sophisticated expertise are some of the current issues. This paper proposes a Rhino-Grasshopper custom script to automatically compute spatial indicators for a quick thermal comfort estimation. The Galapagos evolutionary algorithm is used to optimize thermal comfort and select the best combinations of spatial indicators. In a summer case study located in Shantou, China, the proposed workflow was three times faster than a non-automated indicator calculation in ArcGIS, while the optimization method achieved 25% to 33% reduction in land areas under extreme heat stress. This automated process applies to existing states and new urban designs. It is adaptable to customized prediction models under different climatic zones.

AB  - The Bromacker vertebrate fossil assemblage is strikingly unique compared to those of the highly fossiliferous, widespread Early Permian deposits of the USA in exhibiting: 1) total absence of aquatic and semi-terrestrial forms, 2) greatly reduced abundance and diversity of basal synapsids ("pelycosaurs") that fulfilled the role of apex predators, and 3) high abundance and diversity of terrestrial herbivorous taxa. That is, the composition of the Bromacker vertebrate assemblage and the relative abundances of its taxa are difficult to reconcile with current knowledge of the well-documented examples of the Early Permian mixed aquatic-to-terrestrial trophic systems in the USA. The explanation given here for these unique paleobiological features is that the vertebrate assemblage reflects an adaptation to a rarely encountered paleoenvironment, the small, far inland, isolated, internally drained Tambach Basin. It is hypothesized that the Early Permian Bromacker assemblage is unique in representing an initial stage in the evolution of the modern terrestrial trophic system or food chain.

AB  - This study aims to investigate the structural behaviour of timber-timber composite (TTC) systems subject to hogging moment. A total of thirty-one TTC and six bare timber beam-to-column subassemblies (including fourteen replicates) were fabricated and tested to failure under hogging moment. The TTC beams were fabricated by connecting a cross laminated timber (CLT) slab to the top edge of a pair of laminated veneer lumber (LVL) or glued laminated timber (GLT) beams/joists. The effect of the CLT slab thickness, width, and orientation (i.e., loaded lengthwise or crosswise), column penetration in the CLT slab, bending moment to shear force ratio (span length), degree of shear interaction between the slabs and beams (controlled by the size of the shear connectors), and type of beams (LVL or GLT) on the structural performance of the ITC subassemblies were investigated experimentally. In addition, an analytical model was adopted for composite Timoshenko beams and modified to predict the stiffness and load carrying capacity of the TTC beams under hogging moment. The width of the CLT slab and column penetration in the slab (resulting in the reduction of the slab area of up to 20%) had minor (less than 9%) influence on the stiffness and peak load. However, the CLT slab thickness (in the range of 60-100 mm) had a major (up to 48%) influence on the peak load and stiffness of the TTC beam subject to hogging moment. The size of shear connectors (degree of shear connection provided by 8-12 mm screws) and orientation of the CLT slab had a moderate (max. 18-23%) influence on the load carrying capacity and stiffness of the samples.

AB  - The utilization of locally available organic de-oiled cakes and their combination with compost, liquid vermicompost, bone meal, and biodynamic formulations is becoming an emerging practice in organic farming. We aimed to optimize organic inputs with seven de-oiled cakes, viz. Sesamum indicum L, Carthamus tinctorius L, Oryza sativa L bran, Azadirachta indica, Brassica nigra L, Arachis hypogaea, Pongamia pinnata L, and a bone meal for sustaining organic Darjeeling tea (D-tea) yield, quality, profitability, and soil fertility in the Himalayan foothills. Darjeeling tea gardens (elevation 1014.68 m above mean sea level), suitable for a four-year pruning cycle, with different pruning types DS (dip skiff, 1st year), UP (un-prune, 2nd year), LP (light prune, 3rd year), and UP1 (un prune, 4th year), were imparted to process black tea following the orthodox method focusing on retaining the aroma and flavor of the tea. An optimized organic application resulted in a significant tea yield (> 600 kg ha(-1), P = 0.0001) and higher tea quality (total polyphenols, total chlorophyll, and carotenoids). Interestingly, theaflavins and thearubigins were higher than the control with the foliar application of liquid vermicompost. Total N-content in the pluckable-tea shoot was more in the compost treatment; however, phosphorus and potash contents were more with the optimized dose. Tea quality parameters were seasonally distinct. The authors recommended the optimized dose of organic inputs for sustained tea production, improved soil sustenance through NPK balance, bulk density, organic-C, dehydrogenase activity, and water holding capacity in soils, producing high-quality organic tea; however, compost and liquid vermicompost improved tea qualities at par in the old Chinary-tea plant remained promising for profitability/net income. The first flush tea qualities are elite, and total polyphenols correlate positively with caffeine, theaflavins, thearubigins, total chlorophyll, and the color of the made tea.

AB  - The features of the historical formation of modern natural landscapes in the city area of Saint Petersburg are described. The role of protected areas of the city as an "ecological framework" for the preservation and maintenance of the urban environment and the specific problems of urban nature protected areas (PAs) are considered. The data on the location, area, and species diversity of mammals in each of the existing nature protected areas of Saint Petersburg are presented. The reasons for the differences in the faunas of the protected areas of the northern and southern coasts of the Gulf of Finland due to their landscape and geographical characteristics and the current state of habitats are revealed. Based on the above data, it is concluded that the increased anthropogenic load in some protected areas leads to the reduction or disappearance of mammal groups such as ungulates or large carnivores. However, in other areas, the composition of fauna remains close to the natural, and the number of observed mammal species is up to 80% of the region's inhabitants.

AB  - Sperm quality is usually evaluated prior to artificial insemination in farm animals. In addition to conventional semen analysis, other biomarkers, such as mitochondrial activity, integrity and lipid disorder of plasma membrane, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and sperm DNA integrity, have been found to be related to fertility rates in different species. While mounting evidence indicates that the Comet assay is a sensitive method for the detection of DNA breaks, complete sperm chromatin decondensation is required in order to properly analyze the presence of single- and double-strand DNA breaks. In this sense, a previous study showed that longer lysis treatment with proteinase K is needed to achieve complete chromatin decondensation. The current work sought to determine which specific lysis treatment leads to complete chromatin decondensation in pig sperm, as this is needed for the measurement of DNA damage in this species. With this purpose, incubation with a lysis solution containing proteinase K for 0, 30, and 180 min was added to the conventional protocol. The impact of the DNA damage induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2; 0.01 and 0.1%) and DNAse I (1U and 4U) was also evaluated. Complete chromatin decondensation was only achieved when a long additional lysis treatment (180 min) was included. Furthermore, olive tail moment (OTM) and percentage of tail DNA (TD) indicated that a higher amount of DNA breaks was detected when hydrogen peroxide and DNAse I treatments were applied (P < 0.05). The comparison of treated and control sperm allowed defining the thresholds for OTM; these thresholds revealed that the percentage of sperm with fragmented DNA determined by the alkaline Comet does not depend on chromatin decondensation (P > 0.05). In conclusion, complete chromatin decondensation prior to alkaline and neutral Comet assays is needed to analyze DNA breaks in pig sperm.

AB  - Neonatal cloned pigs generated via somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) have high incidences of malformation and mortality. The mechanisms underlying the massive loss of cloned pig neonates remain unclear. We compared the cord serum metabolic profiles and biochemical indexes of SCNT-derived piglets that died within 4 days (SCNT-DW4), SCNT-derived piglets that survived over 4 days (SCNT-SO4) and artificial insemination (AI)-generated piglets that survived over 4 days (AI-SO4) to investigate the associations of serum metabolomics and biochemical indexes in umbilical cord (UC) sera at delivery with the neonatal loss of cloned pigs. Results showed that compared with SCNT-SO4 and AI-SO4 piglets, SCNT-DW4 piglets had lower birth weight, placental indexes, placental vascularization scores, UC scores, vitality scores, serum glucose and levels but higher creatinine, urea nitrogen and uric acid levels in cord sera. Metabolomics analysis revealed alterations in lipid, glucose and purine metabolism in the cord sera of SCNT-DW4 piglets. These results indicated that the disturbance of the cord serum metabolome might be associated with the low birth weight and malformations of cloned neonates. These effects were likely the consequences of the impaired placental morphology and function of SCNT-derived piglets. This study provides helpful information regarding the potential mechanisms responsible for the neonatal death of cloned pigs and also offers an important basis for the design of effective strategies to improve the survival rate of these animals.

AB  - The physiological functions of mammalian sperm, such as motility, hyperactivation, and capacitation, require substantial energy. This study investigates the effects of two classic cryopreservation extenders-TCG (tris-citrate-glucose) and LEY (lactose-egg yolk)-on the energy metabolism of frozen-thawed boar semen. By comparing the quality indicators, key metabolite levels, and the activities of critical enzymes involved in glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle, we aim to understand how these different semen extenders influence the spermatozoa vitality of frozen-thawed boar semen. Following thawing, the LEY-cryopreserved sperm demonstrated significantly elevated motility parameters (viability, VCL, VSL, and VAP) and enhanced plasma membrane and acrosomal integrity compared with the TCG group (p < 0.05), though both cryopreserved groups exhibited significantly reduced performance relative to fresh semen controls. Cryopreservation markedly reduced intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP), pyruvate, and acetyl coenzyme A (A-CoA) levels (fresh > LEY > TCG; p < 0.05). The LEY-preserved spermatozoa retained higher activities of glycolysis-related enzymes (phosphofructokinase, PFK; pyruvate kinase, PK) compared with the TCG group, which, in turn, showed elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity. Critically, TCG-suppressed pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity (p < 0.05) coincided with diminished A-CoA, indicating impaired mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. These results demonstrate LEY's superior preservation of motility and membrane stability but highlight cryodamage-induced energy metabolism dysregulation, particularly TCG's disruption of the glycolysis-TCA cycle coordination essential for spermatozoa function. In conclusion, the choice of semen extender has a significant impact on the energy metabolism and overall quality of frozen-thawed semen, highlighting the importance of optimizing cryopreservation protocols for improved spermatozoa viability and functionality.

AB  - Identifying genome regions subject to selection in local breeds of Brazil is an opportunity to elucidate the C. hircus genome plasticity, flowing the colonization history of the country. Using SNP Bead Chip Illumina 50K genotyping of Brazilian Anglo-Nubian (standardized breed) and Marota (local endangered population from the semiarid area of Brazil) to show outliers loci in genome regions subject to selection. After applying data quality control, 45,600 SNPs were included in this investigation. Principal component analysis (PCAdapt) and FDIST2 analysis signalized 14 genomic regions more affected by selection in the Brazilian dry zone environment. The genome study signalized regions that are close to the sequences of genes related to growth and embryonic skeletal development (FGF12, AMPD2, OSTN). In addition, flagged regions close to the genes UTSB2 and SLC5A2 contribute to research on functional adaptation with low water needs and poor nutritive diet to survive. Both genes encode proteins that act on osmotic pathways and avoid cell flooding on stress cell responses. Further studies on the genetic role and involvement of these outliers' genomic regions, building a robust conceptual high-resolution map of natural selection drives, help to achieve hardiness candidate genes linked to the evolutionary history of Capra hircus in the semiarid area of Brazil.

AB  - Productive activities such as pig farming are a fundamental part of the economy in Mexico. Unfortunately, because of this activity, large quantities of wastewater are generated that have a negative impact in the environment. This work shows an alternative for treating piggery wastewater based on advanced oxidation processes (Fenton and solar photo Fenton, SPF) that have been probed successfully in previous works. In the first stage, Fenton and SPF were carried out on a laboratory scale using a Taguchi L9-type experimental design. From the statistical analysis of this design, the operating parameters: pH, time, hydrogen peroxide concentration [H2O2], and iron ferrous concentration [Fe2+] that maximize the response variables: Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Total Organic Carbon (TOC), and color were chosen. From these, a cascade forward neural network was implemented to establish a correlation between data from the variables to the physicochemical parameters to be measure being that a great fit of the data was obtained having a correlation coefficient of 0.99 which permits to optimize the pollutant degradation and predict the removal efficiencies at pilot scale but with a projection to a future industrial scale. A relevant result, it was found that the optimal values for maximizing the removal of physicochemical parameters were pH = 3, time = 60 min, H2O2/COD = 1.5 mg L- 1, and H2O2/Fe2+ = 2.5 mg L-1. With these conditions degradation percentages of 91.44%, 47.14%, and 97.89% for COD, TOC, and color were obtained from the Fenton process, while for SPF the degradation percentage increased moderately. From the ANN analysis, the possibility to establish an intelligent system that permits to predict multiple results from operational conditions has been achieved.

AB  - Simple Summary: Ningxiang pigs are popular for their high meat quality and unique flavor, but they contain a low lean percentage. Long-term excessive intake of pork with high fat content and its products might be associated with dyslipidemia. Lactobacillus delbrueckii has been proven to regulate lipid metabolism and improve blood lipids in our previous studies; however, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the effects of L. delbrueckii on gut microbiota and body lipid metabolism and found that L. delbrueckii regulated hepatic and tissular fat metabolism via gut microbiota modulation and fecal TBA excretion to reduce blood lipid levels in Ningxiang pigs. Lactobacillus delbrueckii intervention can regulate body lipid metabolism, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Our study investigated the effects of L. delbrueckii on serum lipid levels, tissular fat metabolism and deposition, bile acid metabolism, and gut microbiota in Ningxiang pigs. Ninety-six pigs were divided into two groups and fed basal diets containing either 0 (CON) or 0.1% L. delbrueckii (LD) for 60 days. Dietary L. delbrueckii promoted fecal total bile acid (TBA) excretion and increased hepatic enzyme activities related to cholesterol and bile synthesis but decreased hepatic and serum lipid concentrations. L. delbrueckii downregulated gene expression associated with fatty acid synthesis but upregulated gene expression related to lipolysis and beta-fatty acid oxidation in liver and subcutaneous fat. L. delbrueckii elevated gut Lactobacillus abundance and colonic short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria but declined the abundance of some pathogenic bacteria. These findings demonstrated that L. delbrueckii modulated intestinal microbiota composition and facilitated fecal TBA excretion to regulate hepatic fat metabolism, which resulted in less lipid deposition in the liver and reduced levels of serum lipids.

AB  - Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning is a leading cause of poison-related morbidity and mortality worldwide. By binding to hemoglobin and other heme-containing proteins, CO reduces oxygen delivery and produces tissue damage. Prompt treatment of CO-poisoned patients is necessary to prevent acute and long-term complications. Oxygen therapy is the only available treatment. Visible light has been shown to selectively dissociate CO from hemoglobin with high efficiency without affecting oxygen affinity. Pulmonary phototherapy has been shown to accelerate the rate of CO elimination in CO poisoned mice and rats when applied directly to the lungs or via intraesophageal or intra-pleural optical fibers. The extracorporeal removal of CO using a membrane oxygenator with optimal characteristic for blood exposure to light has been shown to accelerate the rate of CO illumination in rats with or without lung injury and in pigs. The development of non-invasive techniques to apply pulmonary phototherapy and the development of a compact, highly efficient membrane oxygenator for the extracorporeal removal of CO in humans may provide a significant advance in the treatment of CO poisoning.

AB  - Purple threeawn (Aristida purpurea Nutt.) is a perennial bunchgrass indigenous to much of North America that often dominates disturbed or previously overgrazed rangelands and is mostly avoided by herbivores as forage. Management of threeawn using fire and nitrogen addition can increase its forage quality and likelihood of selection by livestock. We assessed effects of fire, nitrogen fertilizer addition, and phenological stage on purple threeawn mineral concentrations the first growing season postfire on two similar sites in southeastern Montana. Fire (no fire, summer fire, fall fire) and rate of nitrogen fertilizer addition (0, 46, 80 kg N.ha(-1)) were arranged in a completely randomized, fully factorial design. Samples were collected at five phenological stages throughout each growing season. Minerals were evaluated using laboratory analysis of potassium (K), calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), sulfur (S), magnesium (Mg), iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), manganese (Mn), and copper (Cu) concentrations. With no nitrogen addition, summer and fall fire increased Ca from 0.22% to 0.38% and 0.31%, respectively, S from 0.08% to 0.15% and 0.13%, and Mg from 0.06% to 0.14% and 0.12%, while fall fire decreased Fe from 289 to 176 ppm. In the vegetative stage, fire (fall and summer averaged) increased K from 0.38% to 1.08%, Ca from 0.22% to 0.35%, P from 0.10% to 0.23%, S from 0.08% to 0.16%, Mg from 0.05% to 0.13%, Zn from 19.2 ppm to 35.8 ppm and Cu from 2.8 ppm to 6.2 ppm. Increasing rate of nitrogen addition and advancing phenological stage had little to no effect on mineral concentrations relative to fire effects. Results indicate prescribed fire can increase mineral concentrations from deficient levels to exceeding requirements for growing cattle, providing more evidence supporting use of prescribed fire to increase forage quality and potential herbivore utilization of purple threeawn within 1 yr following fire.

AB  - Melatonin plays a crucial role in the regulation of reproductive seasonality in sheep. Melatonin supplementation has been widely used both in vivo to increase fertility and prolificacy, and in vitro during oocyte maturation, fertilization, and embryo culture. However, its effects have only been assessed in vitro up to the hatched blastocyst stage in conventional embryo culture systems. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of melatonin supplementation from oocyte in vitro maturation (IVM) through post-hatching embryonic stages in vitro on the development of the first three embryonic lineages. Supplementation with melatonin at 10_8 or 10_6 M during IVM, in vitro fertilization (IVF), and in vitro culture (IVC) did not affect cleavage and blastocyst rates at day (D) 8, nor embryo survival and growth at D12. While hypoblast development was not affected, epiblast survival was reduced in D12 embryos treated with 10_ 6 M melatonin from the blastocyst stage onward. In conclusion, melatonin supplementation did not show a clear beneficial effect on ovine in vitro embryo production or lineage development during post-hatching embryo culture.

AB  - Leaf fungal microbiomes can be fundamental drivers of host plant success, as they contain pathogens that devastate crop plants and taxa that enhance nutrient uptake, discourage herbivory, and antagonize pathogens. We measured leaf fungal diversity with amplicon sequencing across an entire growing season in a diversity panel of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum). We also sampled a replicated subset of genotypes across 3 additional sites to compare the importance of time, space, ecology, and genetics. We found a strong successional pattern in the microbiome shaped both by host genetics and environmental factors. Further, we used genome-wide association (GWA) mapping and RNA sequencing to show that 3 cysteine-rich receptor-like kinases (crRLKs) were linked to a genetic locus associated with microbiome structure. We confirmed GWAS results in an independent set of genotypes for both the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and large subunit (LSU) ribosomal DNA markers. Fungal pathogens were central to microbial covariance networks, and genotypes susceptible to pathogens differed in their expression of the 3 crRLKs, suggesting that host immune genes are a principal means of controlling the entire leaf microbiome.

AB  - Interactions between plants and insects have shaped biodiversity at multiple ecological and evolutionary scales in both diverse taxonomic groups. Antagonistic interactions (such as herbivory) can impose strong selective pressures on plants, resulting in increased defense levels or diverse defense strategies. The nature and extent of plant defenses can vary both within and between species, potentially reflecting trade-offs between defense and growth strategy that are associated with environmental resources, known as the resource availability hypothesis. Global interspecific patterns may or may not reflect mechanisms acting within species at more restricted geographic scales. Here, we ask whether there is evidence for associations between growth strategies and defense levels, resource availability, and herbivore damage within three Helianthus species (H. giganteus, H. grosseserratus, and H. maximiliani) in a restricted region of the Upper Midwest in the USA. We measure growth traits, leaf defense traits, and leaf herbivore damage levels in wild sunflower populations to assess patterns across populations and in two common gardens to assess patterns within populations. We estimate associations between growth traits and defense traits, defense traits and environmental resources, and herbivore damage and environmental resources. Overall, we find that slower growth strategies are associated with increased levels of defenses, though these higher defense levels are not associated with lower-resource environments in wild populations, and some of these patterns are detected in the commons. We also find that herbivore damage levels are not associated with these resource levels. We conclude that defenses in these species are related to growth strategy even at this intraspecific scale and are largely in line with macroevolutionary patterns across the genus. Both defense levels and herbivore damage are not strongly related to resource availability, which may reflect limited amounts of resource variation in this restricted region and follow prediction within a general framework for intraspecific defense trait associations.

AB  - Ghrelin is a gastric-derived peptide hormone with demonstrated impact on alcohol intake and craving, but the reverse side of this bidirectional link, that is, the effects of alcohol on the ghrelin system, remains to be fully established. To further characterize this relationship, we examined (1) ghrelin levels via secondary analysis of human laboratory alcohol administration experiments with heavy-drinking participants; (2) expression of ghrelin, ghrelin receptor, and ghrelin-O-acyltransferase (GOAT) genes (GHRL, GHSR, and MBOAT4, respectively) in post-mortem brain tissue from individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD) versus controls; (3) ghrelin levels in Ghsr knockout and wild-type rats following intraperitoneal (i.p.) alcohol administration; (4) effect of alcohol on ghrelin secretion from gastric mucosa cells ex vivo and GOAT enzymatic activity in vitro; and (5) ghrelin levels in rats following i.p. alcohol administration versus a calorically equivalent non-alcoholic sucrose solution. Acyl- and total-ghrelin levels decreased following acute alcohol administration in humans, but AUD was not associated with changes in central expression of ghrelin system genes in post-mortem tissue. In rats, alcohol decreased acyl-ghrelin, but not des-acyl-ghrelin, in both Ghsr knockout and wild-type rats. No dose-dependent effects of alcohol were observed on acyl-ghrelin secretion from gastric mucosa cells or on GOAT acylation activity. Lastly, alcohol and sucrose produced distinct effects on ghrelin in rats despite equivalent caloric value. Our findings suggest that alcohol acutely decreases peripheral ghrelin concentrations in vivo, but not in proportion to alcohol's caloric value or through direct interaction with ghrelin-secreting gastric mucosal cells, the ghrelin receptor, or the GOAT enzyme.

AB  - Goats are an important livestock and goat meat is essential to local people. The intramuscular fat (IMF) content has a great influence on the quality of goat meat. The intramuscular preadipocytes differentiation is closely related to the IMF deposition; however, its potential regulatory mechanisms remain unclear. CircRNAs were revealed to be involved in multiple biological progressions. In this study, we took primary goat intramuscular preadipocyte (GIMPA) as the study model to verify the function and mechanism of chi-circ_0006511, which was abundant and up-regulated in mature adipocytes (GIMA). The results showed that the expression level of chi-circ_0006511 gradually increased in the early stage of GIMPA differentiation, and chi-circ_0006511 was confirmed to promote GIMPA lipid droplets aggregation and up-regulate the adipogenic differentiation determinants, further promoting GIMPA differentiation. Mechanistically, chi-circ_0006511 exerts its function by sponging novel-miR-87, thereby regulating the expression of CD36. The results from this study provided novel significant information to better understand the molecular regulatory mechanism of intramuscular preadipocytes differentiation, thereby providing a new reference for the intramuscular fat adipogenesis in goats.

AB  - This study was conducted to investigate the effects of dietary supplementation with Ginkgo biloba L. residues (GBLR) partially replacing alfalfa hay pellet on growth performance, serum biochemical parameters, rumen fermentation, immune function, and meat quality in finishing Haimen white goats. The results demonstrated that appropriate replacement of alfalfa hay pellet by GBLR in the diets could significantly improve the growth performance, reduce feed cost, and elevate the apparent digestibility of dry matter (DM) and neutral detergent fiber (NDF). Moreover, supplementation with GBLR has potential to enhance the ability of antioxidation, boost immunity, and ameliorate rumen fermentation as well as meat quality. It was concluded that 18% (G18) replacement of alfalfa hay pellet by GBLR was optimal in this experiment.
   Sixty castrated male Haimen white growing goats with an initial age of 100 days old and similar body weight (16 +/- 1.5 kg) were selected and randomly allocated into five groups with three replicates in each group with four goats in each pen (5 m x 3.2 m). Goats in the control group (CG) were fed a basal pelleted total mixed ration supplemented with 30% alfalfa hay pellet, while experimental treatments (G6, G12, G18, or G24) were supplemented with four levels (6%, 12%, 18%, or 24%) of GBLR replacing alfalfa hay pellet in the diet, separately. Results showed that (1) the final body weight, average daily gain, and average feed intake of G18 was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than CG; in contrast, the feed conversion ratio of G18 was significantly lower than CG and G12 (p < 0.05); the feed cost per head per day of CG was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than that of G18 and G24, and exhibited obvious linearly decrease (p = 0.04) with increasing GBLR supplementation; and apparent total-tract digestibility of DM and NDF in GBLR treatments were significantly higher (p < 0.05) than CG; (2) alanine transaminase (ALT) concentration in the G18 group was significantly lower (p < 0.05) than those in the control group; aspartate transaminase (AST) concentration in the G24 was significantly lower (p < 0.05) than those in the control group, and an increase in dietary level of GBLR tended to result in a linear decrease (p = 0.09) in the concentration of serum AST; (3) the concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA) demonstrated a tendency to decrease (p = 0.06) linearly with increasing GBLR supplementation; however, glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) activity in G12 was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than CG, G6, and G24; in addition, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in G18 was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than CG and G6; concentration of immunoglobulin M (IgM), immunoglobulin G (IgG), and immunoglobulin A (IgA) were not affected by GBLR, but increasing dietary GBLR showed a tendency (p = 0.08) to linearly increase the IgG concentration; the content of interleukin 4 (IL4) was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in G12, G18, and G24 than that in CG and G6; (4) There were similar NH3-N, pH, TVFA, and butyrate for goats fed different levels of GBLR supplementation; the C2 (p = 0.07) and acetate: propionate (p = 0.06) demonstrated a tendency to increase linearly with increasing level of GBLR supplementation, separately; however, it was observed that concentration of propionate showed a tendency to decrease (p = 0.08) linearly in response to GBLR supplementation; and (5) Increasing dietary GBLR tended to linearly enhance the lightness (L*) (p = 0.07) and yellowness (b*) (p = 0.09) values of longissimus dorsi muscles; the redness (a*) value in G18 was significantly higher than that in CG (p < 0.05).

AB  - Simple Summary Weaning is a stressful period that reduces digestive capacity and increases oxidative stress and disease susceptibility in piglets. Feed additives can protect the piglets' health status in a natural way. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of full-fat H. illucens larvae meal (HI) and astaxanthin (AST) supplementation on the growth performance and health status of weaned pigs. HI contains bioactive substances (chitin, antimicrobial peptides, lauric acid) with immunostimulatory, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory properties. Astaxanthin is a carotenoid pigment with strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory capacities. The results showed that astaxanthin supports the inhibition of oxidative stress. In the experiment lasting from 35 to 70 days of age, 48 weaned pigs (about 8.7 kg body weight) were involved. Both supplements were tested separately or combined in feed mixtures. The 2.5% HI and AST supplementation can reduce the susceptibility of pork fat to oxidation. However, a higher concentration of HI (5%) was not beneficial because of the adverse changes in some of the red cell indices and thus should be combined with the antioxidant AST to improve these indices. Both supplements did not negatively affect the piglets' productivity. Weaning is a critical period in farming, and therefore, searching for health-promoting feed additives of natural origin is necessary. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of full-fat H. illucens larvae meal (HI) and astaxanthin (AST) supplementation on the growth performance and health status of weaned pigs. The experiment was carried out on 48 pigs (8.7 kg) divided into six groups: I-control; II-2.5% HI; III-5% HI; IV-2.5% HI and AST; V-5% HI and AST; VI-AST. The experiment lasted from the 35th to 70th day of age, and animals were fed ad libitum. The results obtained indicate that HI meal and astaxanthin had no effect on feed intake and utilization, weight gain, or organ weight. Additionally, blood parameters remained within the norms. It seems that astaxanthin supports the inhibition of oxidative stress, which became apparent in the case of some red blood cell parameters. The 2.5% HI and AST supplementation can reduce the susceptibility of pork fat to oxidation (lower adipose tissue TBARS). However, 5% HI in feed was not beneficial because of the adverse changes in some red cell indices, and it should be combined with the antioxidant AST to improve these indices.

AB  - Energy recovery from biowaste is of high significance for a sustainable society. Herein, hydrothermal treatment (HT) was applied to valorize pig manure digestate. The effects of hydrothermal operational parameters, including temperature (130-250 degrees C), residence time (15-90 min), and total solid (TS) concentration (10%-20%), on reducing sugar yield were investigated in this study. Among them, hydrothermal temperature was identified as the most important factor influencing reducing sugar yield, followed by the TS concentration and time. The optimal hydrothermal conditions for the pig manure digestate were 175.6 degrees C, 35.4 min and a TS concentration of 10% with a reduced sugar yield of 9.81 mg gTS(-1). The addition of hydrolysate could enhance methane production by 21.6-50.4% from the anaerobic digestion of pig manure than that without the hydrolysate addition. After HT, the hygienic quality, including fecal coliform number and ascaris egg mortality, was improved in the residual digestate. Antibiotics such as sulfamonomethoxine, oxytetracycline, doxycycline and sulfaclodazine in the pig manure digestate were decomposed during HT and decreased environmental risk. These findings indicated that the hydrothermal process might be an effective technique to recover energy from the digestate of livestock and poultry manure and to improve the residual digestate for subsequent utilization.

AB  - Trichomes of aerial plant organs contribute to adaptive responses to abiotic and biotic stresses. In horticultural plants, increasing glandular trichome density is an effective breeding strategy to enhance resistance to herbivores through promoting the capacity to produce specialized metabolites. The regulatory mechanisms controlling multicellular trichome formation are only partially understood. In this study, we reveal that SlGRAS9 and SlMYC1 transcription factors form a regulatory module controlling glandular trichome formation in multiple tissues. Knockout of SlGRAS9 or overexpression of SlMYC1 in tomato leads to an increased number of type VI glandular trichomes and to higher terpenoid accumulation in leaves, petals, sepals, and fruits. Conversely, knockout of SlMYC1 results in reduced type VI glandular trichomes number and terpenoid levels. Promoter-binding and genetic interaction experiments revealed that SlGRAS9 negatively regulates the transcription of SlMYC1, indicating that the regulation of glandular trichome formation by SlGRAS9 is dependent, at least partly, on SlMYC1. Consistently, both SlGRAS9 knockout and SlMYC1 overexpression result in higher tolerance of tomato plants to spider mites and aphids. In addition to adding some of the missing components to the mechanisms controlling formation of type VI glandular trichome, our findings also uncover new targets for breeding strategies aimed at improving crop protection against pest invasion, thus ensuring crop yield resilience to climate change.

AB  - Background: Transgenic animal production is an important means of livestock breeding and can be used to model pharmaceutical applications. Methods: In this study, to explore the biological activity of endogenously produced melatonin, Acetylserotonin-O-methyltransferase (ASMT)-overexpressed melatonin-enriched dairy goats were successfully generated through the use of pBC1-ASMT expression vector construction and prokaryotic embryo microinjection. Results: These transgenic goats have the same normal phenotype as the wild-type goats (WT). However, the melatonin levels in their blood and milk were significantly increased (p < 0.05). In addition, the quality of their milk was also improved, showing elevated protein content and a reduced somatic cell number compared to the WT goats. No significant changes were detected in the intestinal microbiota patterns between groups. When the animals were challenged by the intravenous injection of E. coli, the ASMT-overexpressed goats had a lower level of pro-inflammatory cytokines and higher anti-inflammatory cytokines compared to the WT goats. Metabolic analysis uncovered a unique arachidonic acid metabolism pattern in transgenic goats. Conclusions: The increased melatonin production due to ASMT overexpression in the transgenic goats may have contributed to their improved milk quality and enhanced the anti-inflammatory ability compared to the WT goats.

AB  - Simple Summary: The impact of climate change around the world cannot be overstated. South African indigenous sheep face the threat of extinction. This study was aimed at evaluating the seasonal variations in semen quality, testosterone levels, and scrotal size following dietary flaxseed oil and ascorbic acid in South African indigenous rams. Total motility did not differ significantly (p > 0.05) between the seasons when negative and (PC) were supplemented; nevertheless, there was an improvement when FLAX, ASCA, and FLAX + ASCA were supplemented. Testosterone levels were significantly influenced by the seasons when negative and PC diets were supplemented. It was observed that flaxseed oil and ascorbic acid can reverse the seasonal variations in semen quality and testosterone levels.
   The purpose of this study was to determine the seasonal variations in semen quality, testosterone levels, and scrotal size, following dietary flaxseed oil and ascorbic acid in South African indigenous rams. A total of 22 South African indigenous rams were randomly distributed into five treatment diets from June 2021 to May 2022 (12 months). To allow for the spermatogenesis period, semen was collected after sixty days of dietary supplementation with treatment diets. Blood was collected twice a week using an 18-gauge needle and vacutainer tubes and sent to the laboratory for testosterone analysis. Semen and blood collection were repeated eight times each season. The scrotal size (circumference, length, and width) was measured using a flexible measuring tape. Data was subjected to the General Linear Model (GLM) in Minitab (R) 2017. Treatment means were separated using Fisher's t-test and considered significantly different when the p-value was less than 0.05. Seasons and diet had an effect on progression, total motility, and testosterone levels. For instance, NC during the spring season had the lowest progressive motility (42.84 +/- 5.32), followed by the summer (49.38 +/- 4.49), winter (62.46 +/- 4.35), and autumn (63.26 +/- 3.58). Notably, when treatment diets were introduced, improvements were realized, and there were significant differences (p < 0.05) among the seasons following supplementation of FLAX, ASCA, and FLAX + ASCA, except for FLAX in the autumn season (53.83 +/- 4.16). Total motility did not differ significantly (p > 0.05) between the seasons when the NC and PC diets were supplemented; nevertheless, there was an improvement when FLAX, ASCA, and FLAX + ASCA were supplemented. Testosterone levels were significantly influenced by the seasons when negative and PC diets were supplemented. It is noteworthy that supplementing FLAX + ASCA can reverse the influence of the season on the testosterone levels (spring, 27.52 +/- 4.42; summer, 20.23 +/- 5.11; autumn, 25.24 +/- 3.96; and winter, 25.92 +/- 4.42). In conclusion, seasons do affect semen quality and testosterone levels of South African indigenous rams. However, flaxseed oil and ascorbic acid can reverse the seasonal variations in semen quality and testosterone levels.

AB  - This study describes the effect of adding carrot on the nutritional and biological value of canned goat meat. Four batches of canned goat meat were produced: control (without carrot), and three experimental treatments T10, T20, and T30 that was canned goat meat with the addition of 10, 20, and 30% carrot, respectively. Canned goat meat with 30% added carrot had the lowest fat (5.76%) and protein (17.08%) content. The mass fraction of fiber was significantly increased, up to 1.96% in T10, 2.33% in T20, and 2.71% in T30. The same trend was observed for beta-carotene content (from 0.78 mg/100 g in the control sample to 1.91 mg/100 g in T30). Among the amino acids, histidine was significantly increased in T30 (p < 0.05), and lysine in T20 and T30 (p < 0.05). There was also evidence of increased vitamin A, B-6 (pyridoxine), B-9 (folic acid), and B-5 (pantothenic acid) content in experimental samples than in the control sample. Among the minerals, the most significant increase was in potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus levels in samples with carrot. Organoleptic evaluation showed differences in color, taste, consistency, and odor. Thus, the addition of carrots increases the nutritive value and improves the palatability of canned goat meat.

AB  - Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in natural language-relevant tasks like text generation and question answering Q&A. To further expand their application, efforts focus on enabling LLMs to utilize real-world tools. However, their tool-use ability in professional GIS remains under explored due to two main challenges. Firstly, LLMs are usually trained on general-domain corpora, lacking sufficient and comprehensive GIS-specific data to align with professional knowledge, including understanding the functions of GIS tools. Secondly, researchers often need to combine multiple GIS tools to solve geospatial tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a trainable method to enable LLMs to master GIS tools. We curated a comprehensive set of resources: instruction-response data (GeoTool, 1950 instructions) to enhance the understanding of LLMs for GIS tools, instruction-solution data (GeoSolution, 3645 instructions) to improve their ability to generate tool-use solutions for geospatial tasks, and annotated instruction-solution evaluation data (GeoTask, 300 instructions) for evaluating LLMs' GIS tool-use proficiency. Using the collected training data (GeoTool and GeoSolution), we fine-tuned a professional-domain LLM called GeoTool-GPT based on an open-source general-domain LLM, the LLaMA-2-7b model. The experiment based on evaluation data validates our method's effectiveness in enhancing the tool-use ability of general-domain LLMs in the professional GIS domain, with the performance of our model closely approaching that of GPT-4.

AB  - Human-wildlife conflict (HWC) negatively impacts both humans and wildlife. Attitudes of local residents have been critical in promoting wildlife conservation. It is therefore necessary to understand the characteristics of HWC and identify influential factors on attitudes towards conservation to implement conservation strategies efficiently. This research focused on features of human-elephant interactions, while attitudes and values regarding the small population of Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) in Nangunhe National Nature Reserve (NNR), Yunnan, China. The total of 327 valid questionnaires were gathered around the area where Asian elephants were distributed. Logistic regression models were employed to analyze the correlations among five predictor variables ("Area', "Family size', "Annual income', "Quantity of family members in non-primary industries' and "Experiencing loss or not') and three response variables ("Attitude towards elephants', "Perception of the values of elephants' and "Attitude towards tourism development'). The study area was densely forested with tea plants, rubber trees, corns and sugarcane. There, 25.99% of respondents reported the experience of human -elephant conflict (HEC), with crop raiding and cash crop damages being the major conflict types. To demonstrate respect for elephants and to mitigate HEC, a unique custom called "Giving tribute to elephants' was developed long ago. Respondents' township with an official annual festival of "Giving Tribute to Elephants' (odds ratio (OR) = 2.75, P = 1.73 x 10(-6)) and higher annual income (OR = 2.09, P = 5.45 x 10(-5)) significantly contributed to forming a more positive attitude towards elephants, whereas HEC itself have contributed to a more negative attitude (OR = 0.50, P = 3.29 x 10(-3)). Therefore, we propose that: 1) reducing human-elephant conflict by testing multiple mitigation measures and adopting the most effective one of them; 2) enhancing local livelihoods through the development of ecological products and ecotourism; and 3) preserving and developing the Wa culture in this region. The study area deserves more attention and further research to explore and obtain endorsement from the public to achieve coexistence between human and wildlife.

AB  - Adoption and refinement of monitoring and management techniques is important for improving the conservation status of threatened fauna, especially in remote areas with high logistical and financial costs. In Australia, many of these remote conservation projects are conducted by Traditional Owners and Indigenous Ranger groups, with input and support from various stakeholders including government and non-government organisations, and third-party ecologists. A collaborative approach to project development and adaptive management in response to stakeholder objectives is essential for long-term project success. Aims In the remote context of the Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara (APY) Lands, we collaboratively develop a sustainable and robust monitoring and management method for warru (black-flanked rock wallabies) that recognises the skills, interests, and capacity of all project members. In developing this method over 22 years, we also evaluate the influence of rainfall and predator-control strategies on warru populations to inform optimised management. Methods Practical and economic capabilities and preferences of both Traditional Owners and external scientists for monitoring and management actions were evaluated. Data from long-term cage trapping, and scat and spotlight counts of warru were compared with population trajectories, annual rainfall, and management strategies. Key results Population indices with lower resource requirements, such as scat and spotlight counts, provide trends consistent with more resource-intensive capture-mark-recapture studies. The warru scat index was negatively associated with the scat index for a competing herbivore (kanyala, euro). Warru growth rates were positively influenced by rainfall. Contrary to initial results from other regions, warru populations declined during periods when we undertook predator baiting. By contrast, targeted shooting of feral cats and foxes was associated with increased warru population growth rates. Conclusions These results suggest that a minimum of four groups of five scat quadrats in prime refuge areas and equivalent sampling in prime feeding zones (total 40 quadrats) is appropriate for rock-wallaby monitoring. Predator control via shooting appears preferable to baiting, which may have negative effects by removing dingoes, which prey on the competing kanyala. Implications Predator control via shooting is an effective way to support warru populations, and repeated scat counts are an effective monitoring approach for warru.

AB  - Double electron electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy is an important technique to measure distance distributions P(r) for studying protein structures and protein-protein interactions. DEER data analysis can at times become challenging due to the lack of a detailed analytical signal expression or numerical methods with rapid computation time. We have derived an analytical expression kappa(FULL), which includes both the pseudo-secular dipolar coupling (PSDC) and the finite pulse effects, especially important for shorter distances. Analyses of experiments by kappa(FULL) yield accurate and consistent P(r) values for three DEER nitroxide-rulers with distances (r(AVG)) in the range of 15 to 32 & Aring;, while the current standard analysis produces erroneous results for r(AVG) < 20 & Aring;. Computation times for deriving P(r) vary between 1 min and 4 min, which is usually much shorter than previous methods that include pseudo-secular and other effects. The expression can be applied to all types of DEER spin probes with little or no modifications.

AB  - To conserve wide-ranging species in human-modified landscapes, it is essential to understand how animals selectively use or avoid cultivated areas. Use of agriculture leads to human-wildlife conflict, but evidence suggests that individuals may differ in their tendency to be involved in conflict. This is particularly relevant to wild elephant populations. We analysed GPS data of 66 free-ranging elephants in the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem to quantify their use of agriculture. We then examined factors influencing the level of agricultural use, individual change in use across years and differences in activity budgets associated with use. Using clustering methods, our data grouped into four agricultural use tactics: rare (<0.6% time in agriculture; 26% of population), sporadic (0.6%-3.8%; 34%), seasonal (3.9%-12.8%; 31%) and habitual (>12.8%; 9%). Sporadic and seasonal individuals represented two-thirds (67%) of recorded GPS fixes in agriculture, compared to 32% from habitual individuals. Increased agricultural use was associated with higher daily distance travelled and larger home range size, but not with age or sex. Individual tactic change was prevalent and the habitual tactic was maintained in consecutive years by only five elephants. Across tactics, individuals switched from diurnal to nocturnal activity during agricultural use, interpreted as representing similar risk perception of cultivated areas. Conversely, tactic choice appeared to be associated with differences in risk tolerance between individuals. Together, our results suggest that elephants are balancing the costs and benefits of crop usage at both fine (e.g. crop raid events) and long (e.g. yearly tactic change) temporal scales. The high proportion of sporadic and seasonal tactics also highlights the importance of mitigation strategies that address conflict arising from many animals, rather than targeted management of habitual crop raiders. Our approach can be applied to other species and systems to characterize individual variation in human resource use and inform mitigations for human-wildlife coexistence.

AB  - Synanthropes are known for their remarkable adaptability to coexist with humans, yet increased visibility exposes them to significant threats, such as hunting or conflict over resources. Moore et al.'s review 'The rise of hyperabundant native generalists threatens both humans and nature' () explores distribution patterns and impacts of macaques and pigs in anthropogenic environments. Our critical evaluation of this study revealed several substantial issues: the pooling of data from species that are ecologically and behaviourally distinct, an error in data acquisition, potential biases in statistical analyses, and critical misrepresentations of threats to and from wildlife in human-impacted habitats. Additionally, we highlight the lack of evidence supporting the authors' core assertion of hyperabundance of the study species. While Moore et al. compare species densities and abundance across various habitat types, their analyses did not demonstrate population increases over time. On the contrary, our re-analysis of their data sets showed a decreasing population trend in Macaca nemestrina and the absence of M. fascicularis from 44% of surveyed habitats characterized by medium to high forest integrity. Further, our findings emphasize the importance of intact forests for predicting a high relative abundance of macaques and pigs. Overall, we recommend a more careful interpretation of the data, as misrepresentations of abundance data can result in negative or sensational discourses about overabundance, which may threaten the conservation of species that often thrive in anthropogenic landscapes.

AB  - Simple Summary The red deer (Cervus elaphus) de novo genome assembly (CerEla1.0) has provided a great resource for genetic studies in various deer species. In this study, we used gene order comparisons between C. elaphus CerEla1.0 and B. taurus ARS-UCD1.2 genome assemblies and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with bovine BAC probes to verify the red deer-bovine chromosome relationships and anchor the CerEla1.0 C-scaffolds to karyotypes of both species. We showed the homology between bovine and deer chromosomes and determined the centromere-telomere orientation of the CerEla1.0 C-scaffolds. Using a set of BAC probes, we were able to narrow the positions of evolutionary chromosome breakpoints defining the family Cervidae. In addition, we revealed several errors in the current CerEla1.0 genome assembly. Finally, we expanded our analysis to other Cervidae and confirmed the locations of the cervid evolutionary fissions and orientation of the fused chromosomes in eight cervid species. Our results can serve as a basis for necessary improvements of the red deer genome assembly and provide support to other genetic studies in Cervidae. The family Cervidae groups a range of species with an increasing economic significance. Their karyotypes share 35 evolutionary conserved chromosomal segments with cattle (Bos taurus). Recent publication of the annotated red deer (Cervus elaphus) whole genome assembly (CerEla1.0) has provided a basis for advanced genetic studies. In this study, we compared the red deer CerEla1.0 and bovine ARS-UCD1.2 genome assembly and used fluorescence in situ hybridization with bovine BAC probes to verify the homology between bovine and deer chromosomes, determined the centromere-telomere orientation of the CerEla1.0 C-scaffolds and specified positions of the cervid evolutionary chromosome breakpoints. In addition, we revealed several incongruences between the current deer and bovine genome assemblies that were shown to be caused by errors in the CerEla1.0 assembly. Finally, we verified the centromere-to-centromere orientation of evolutionarily fused chromosomes in seven additional deer species, giving a support to previous studies on their chromosome evolution.

Several authors have demonstrated the influence of meat from indigenous pigs breeds on chemical, physical, and organoleptic features of meat products such as salami. Among the advantages, its effect on the lipid component is undoubtedly the most discussed as it influences their fatty acid profile. In Italy, the Apulo-Calabrese is an example of a pig breed taken up for the enhancement of local productions. However, it is essential to underline the crucial role of the ripening process for cured products, which preserves their quality and improves their appearance and integrity. This research evaluated how Apulo-Calabrese meat influences physicochemical, rheological, and microbiological profiles of salami during the ripening time. The study found that the partial inclusion of 50 and 75% of Apulo-Calabrese meat to the dough of salami reduced the content of saturated fatty acids and improved the appearance by acting on texture and color. The combined effect of the composition of doughs and the ripening process has led to the production of products with a high-quality nutritional profile. The study provides valuable information to manufacturers on how to exploit local pork breeds, suggesting the best cost-benefit combination for them and consumers.This study focused on the characterization of salami produced with meat from different pig breeds. The aim consisted in evaluating the added value of the inclusion of Apulo-Calabrese meat in the production of salami, which was characterized by production until the end of maturation (1, 30, 60, and 120 days). The experimental design involved three types of salami, two of which were produced by partial inclusion of 50 and 75% of the Italian breed pork meat (S50 and S75, respectively). Physicochemical (pH, a(w), fatty acid analysis, and malondialdehyde concentration), rheological parameters (texture analyses and color measurement), and bacterial biodiversity were evaluated. Results showed that the partial inclusion of Apulo-Calabrese meat influences the fatty acid profile of final products, which were characterized by a higher percentage of monounsaturated fatty acids compared to traditional salami; however, due to the high content of unsaturated fatty acids, S50 and S75 showed higher values of secondary lipid oxidation up to the 120th day. The linoleic and palmitic acid content significantly affected hardness and brightness. Overall, the ripening process was able to control the microbiological profile and the S50 formulation appeared as a suitable choice that could satisfy consumers for nutritional expectations and sensory profiles.

AB  - We evaluated the possible effect of maternal social rank (SR) concerning different morpho-physiological maternal indicators such as live weight (LWM, kg), body condition score (BCS, units), thoracic diameter (TD, cm), thoracic perimeter (TP, cm), and serum glucose content (GLU, mg dL(-1)), upon the kid's live weights (LWGK, kg) during the birth-to-weaning period. To define the SR [either high (HSR) or low (LSR)], a behavioral study was conducted on pregnant goats managed under semi-extensive conditions in northern arid Mexico (25 degrees N; Alpine-Saanen-Nubian x Criollo; n = 15, 2-3 y/old) 30 days before the expected kidding date. The behavioral study was conducted during feeding time (i.e., 08:00, 13:00, and 17:00; 60 min test(-1), 180 min d(-1)). The HSR goats showed higher values (p < 0.05) regarding prepartum, parturition, postpartum weights, and zoometric values. However, no differences (p > 0.05) between HSR and LSR goats occurred concerning the maternal serum glucose values, litter size, individual kid weights, or litter weights at weaning.

AB  - Cashmere is widely acclaimed as one of the most luxurious textile fibers. Mongolia, a major player in cashmere production and processing, is key to this industry. Despite the rich history of cashmere, there is limited research on cashmere fiber properties, which are essential in producing high-quality garments. This study aims to improve our understanding of cashmere fibers' physical and mechanical properties and to assess how genetic and non-genetic factors affect these characteristics. We analyzed key fiber characteristics, including scale morphology, and the physical and mechanical properties (such as fineness, length parameters, stress, and strain) in 11 samples from Mongolian goats of varying areas, breeds, ages, and genders. Through detailed statistical analysis, our experimental results revealed that both genetic and non-genetic factors significantly affect fiber fineness and the specific energy of rupture. Additionally, we observed that the influence of these factors can inform better classification systems for raw cashmere and enhance the determination of the fiber's spinability limit.

AB  - Plants produce an array of defensive compounds with toxic or deterrent effects on insect herbivores. Pollen can contain relatively high concentrations of such defense compounds, but the causes and consequences of this enigmatic phenomenon remain mostly unknown. These compounds could potentially protect pollen against antagonists but could also reduce flower attractiveness to pollinators. We combined field observations of the pollen-rewarding Lupinus argenteus with chemical analysis and laboratory assays to test three hypotheses for the presence of pollen defense compounds: (1) these compounds are the result of spillover from adjacent tissues, (2) they protect against pollen thieves, and (3) they act as antimicrobial compounds. We also tested whether pollen defense compounds affect pollinator behavior. We found a positive relationship between alkaloid concentrations in pollen and petals, supporting the idea that pollen defense compounds partly originate from spillover. However, pollen and petals exhibited quantitatively (but not qualitatively) distinct alkaloid profiles, suggesting that plants can adjust pollen alkaloid composition independently from that of adjacent tissues. We found no relationship between pollen alkaloid concentration and the abundance of pollen thieves in Lupinus flowers. However, pollen alkaloids were negatively associated with bacterial abundance. Finally, plants with more alkaloids in their pollen received more pollinator visits, but these visits were shorter, resulting in no change in the overall number of flowers visited. We propose that pollen defense compounds are partly the result of spillover from other tissues, while they also play an antimicrobial role. The absence of negative effects of these compounds on pollinator visitation likely allows their maintenance in pollen at relatively high concentrations. Taken together, our results suggest that pollen alkaloids affect and are mediated by the interplay of multiple interactions.

AB  - Protein neddylation inactivation is a novel topic in cancer research. However, there are few studies on the mechanism of neddylation underlying the development of sheep follicular granulosa cells (GCs). In this study, the development of follicular GCs in sheep was inactivated by MLN4924, a neddylation-specific inhibitor, which significantly attenuated the proliferation and cell index of sheep follicular GCs. Further, the inactivation of neddylation by MLN4924 caused the accumulation of the cullin ring ligase (CRLs) substrates Wee1 and c-Myc, which could upregulate NOXA protein expression. Meanwhile, the B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 2 (BCL2) family members Bcl-2 and MCL-1 were downregulated, subsequently inducing apoptosis in follicular GCs of sheep. Increasing Wee1 levels caused G2/M-phase arrest. The effects of neddylation inactivation on Akt, the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway, and Forkhead box class O(FOXO) family members were evaluated. Neddylation inactivation by MLN4924 increased the levels of phospho-Akt, JAK2, phospho-STAT3, and FOXO1 (p < 0.05) and decreased the levels of phospho-FOXO3a and STAT3 (p < 0.05). In addition, MLN4924 could alter the mitochondrial morphology of GCs, increase cellular glucose utilization and lactate production, increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and promote sheep follicular GCs glycolysis, thus causing changes in mitochondrial functions. Together, these findings point to an unrecognized role of neddylation in regulating follicular GCs proliferation in sheep.

AB  - Featured Application Our work provides reliable technical support for the information extraction of pig diseases in Chinese . It can be applied to other domain - specific fields, thereby facilitating seamless adaptation for named entity identification across diverse contexts .Abstract Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a fundamental and pivotal stage in the development of various knowledge-based support systems, including knowledge retrieval and question-answering systems. In the domain of pig diseases, Chinese NER models encounter several challenges, such as the scarcity of annotated data, domain-specific vocabulary, diverse entity categories, and ambiguous entity boundaries. To address these challenges, we propose PDCNER, a Pig Disease Chinese Named Entity Recognition method leveraging lexicon-enhanced BERT and contrastive learning. Firstly, we construct a domain-specific lexicon and pre-train word embeddings in the pig disease domain. Secondly, we integrate lexicon information of pig diseases into the lower layers of BERT using a Lexicon Adapter layer, which employs char-word pair sequences. Thirdly, to enhance feature representation, we propose a lexicon-enhanced contrastive loss layer on top of BERT. Finally, a Conditional Random Field (CRF) layer is employed as the model's decoder. Experimental results show that our proposed model demonstrates superior performance over several mainstream models, achieving a precision of 87.76%, a recall of 86.97%, and an F1-score of 87.36%. The proposed model outperforms BERT-BiLSTM-CRF and LEBERT by 14.05% and 6.8%, respectively, with only 10% of the samples available, showcasing its robustness in data scarcity scenarios. Furthermore, the model exhibits generalizability across publicly available datasets. Our work provides reliable technical support for the information extraction of pig diseases in Chinese and can be easily extended to other domains, thereby facilitating seamless adaptation for named entity identification across diverse contexts.

AB  - Simple Summary Lawsonia intracellularis (LI) is a pathogenic bacterium in pig ileitis, which will cause the thickening of ileal mucosa and slow and uneven growth in pigs. Currently, the global positive rate of colitis is gradually increasing. It is estimated that the annual loss per infected pig exceeds 3-11 dollars, seriously increasing the cost of breeding production. Due to the high cost of commercial vaccines and immune function acquired three weeks later, there are fewer vaccines used in actual production. This experiment investigated the effects of probiotic ferment added to the diet on the growth performance, digestion, absorption, and intestinal function of piglets infected with LI, to explore the efficiency and mechanism of probiotic ferment in alleviating LI infection in piglets. The results suggest that probiotic ferment can reduce the colonization of LI in the ileum, improve intestinal damage, barrier function and microbiota structure, and enhance digestive enzyme activity and nutrient transport proteins expression, thereby improving piglet growth performance, which has the effect of preventing ileitis in pigs, to provide a scientific basis for the prevention of pig ileitis and its application in the aquaculture industry. (1) Background: Lawsonia intracellularis (LI) is an obligate intracellular Gram-negative bacterium that causes porcine ileitis. Pigs infected with LI have severe ileal lesions and show symptoms of diarrhea, indigestion, and growth retardation. Previous studies found that probiotic ferment (FAM) improved the growth performance, gut barrier, and function in piglets. Therefore, we aimed to reveal the mechanism that FAM alleviates negative performance in LI-challenged piglets by characterizing the changes in intestinal integrity, function, and gut microbiota following FAM supplementation. (2) Methods: Twenty-four healthy piglets were randomly allotted to four treatments. Three groups were challenged with LI; both FAM addition and vaccination were performed to explore their positive effects on LI-infected piglets. (3) Results: Piglets infected with LI showed lower growth performance and typical pathological symptoms. Moreover, microscopic images showed that observed intestinal morphological damage could be repaired by FAM and vaccine. To explore the digestion of nutrients in piglets, both digestive enzyme activity and ileal transporter expression were performed to reveal the promoting effect of additives. Reduction of LI colonization intervention by FAM could also ameliorate abnormal differentiation and function of intestinal epithelial cells and alleviate severe inflammatory responses in piglets. Regarding the gut microbiota, both the structure and function of the ileal and colonic microbiota were altered following FAM supplementation. (4) Conclusions: In conclusion, probiotic ferment can reduce the colonization of LI in the ileum, improve intestinal damage, barrier function and microbiota structure, and enhance digestive enzyme activity and nutrient transport proteins expression, thereby improving piglet growth performance, which has the effect of preventing ileitis in pigs.

AB  - Pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic interstitial lung disease characterized by irreversible, progressive lung scarring and eventual respiratory failure. Fibroblast activation plays a crucial role in the progression of pulmonary fibrosis. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling contributes to pulmonary fibrosis by regulating lung fibroblast activation. Currently, most studies focus on TGF-beta 1 regulatory effects on fibroblasts, with limited reports on myostatin (MSTN), another member of the same family. This study used MSTN gene knockout (MSTN- /-) boars as animal models to explore MSTN regulatory effects on pulmonary fibrosis by modulating lung fibroblast activation. Studies have demonstrated that MSTN is significantly upregulated in the lungs during pulmonary fibrosis, promoting the activation of downstream Smad and AKT signaling pathways. MSTN-/- inhibits alveolar collapse and interstitial thickening in pulmonary fibrosis pigs and suppresses downstream Smad and AKT signaling. In vitro experiments showed that MSTN-/- inhibits lung fibroblast activation by blocking Smad/AKT signaling. These findings suggest that the MSTN/Smad/AKT signaling axis suppresses pulmonary fibrosis by inhibiting lung fibroblast activation, indicating that MSTN could be a potential therapeutic target for pulmonary fibrosis.

AB  - Climate variability has major implications for agriculture due to the increase in the frequency and intensity of simultaneous abiotic, namely water-stress, and biotic stresses to crops. Plant water-stress alone harms crops but also can attract outbreaks of herbivores with varied host specialization, and plants succumb to further yield losses dealing with multiple stressors. Host plant resistance provides a route to lessen yield losses from herbivory; however, our knowledge of the interactions between water-stress and pest resistance is limited, especially for mite herbivores of maize including the generalist two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae, TSM) and the specialist Banks grass mite (Oligonychus pratensis, BGM). We conducted parallel greenhouse and field experiments whereby a susceptible line (B73) and two TSM-resistant lines (B75 and B96) were subjected to either optimal irrigation or water-stress [50-60% and 5-10% volumetric water content (VWC), and 25-32% and 10-15% VWC, in the greenhouse and field, respectively] to test whether pest-resistant lines maintain their resistance when exposed to water-stress. We found that under optimal irrigation, TSM and BGM populations increased readily on B73, while B75 and B96 were largely resistant to the TSM but not BGM. While plant water-stress increased the susceptibility of B73 to both mite species, water-stress did not disrupt initial resistance levels of B75 and B96 maize for either mite species. Elevated protease activity was found in B75 and B96 and may contribute to maize resistance. Our findings that B75 and B96 are highly resistant to the TSM, and maintain resistance to both mite species with water-stress, highlight the importance of including the nuances of multiple stressors within the framework of host plant resistance.

AB  - Fasciolosis is a parasitic disease of livestock causing important economic losses worldwide, and it is also a zoonosis. The treatment is based on the use of anthelmintic drugs, but the increase in resistance and the risk of drug residues in food make this approach no longer sustainable. Developing protective vaccines for the control of fasciolosis is postulated as an appropriate treatment, but a better knowledge of the host-parasite interaction is needed. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the hepatic lesions in sheep infected and reinfected with Fasciola hepatica during the acute and chronic stages of infection and the characterization of the hepatic inflammatory infiltrates using immunohistochemistry with CD3, Foxp3, iNOS, and CD163 antibodies. The most remarkable histopathological finding was the presence of large necrotic foci and/or hemorrhages adjacent to enlarged bile ducts containing adult parasites, suggesting flukes may have caused these lesions while feeding. In the literature, necrotic foci/hemorrhages are considered a consequence of parasite migration. In both the primoinfected and reinfected groups, and during acute and chronic stages of the infection, an increase in Foxp3 T cells with respect to uninfected controls and a poor expression of iNOS was found accompanied by a strong expression of CD163, suggesting a marked M2 activation of macrophages in the hepatic lesions. Fasciolosis is an important economic disease of livestock. There is a global interest in the development of protective vaccines since the current anthelmintic therapy is no longer sustainable. A better knowledge of the host-parasite interaction is needed to design effective vaccines. To date, few studies have evaluated host-parasite interaction by comparing infected and reinfected animals. The present study evaluates the microscopical hepatic lesions in sheep infected and reinfected with Fasciola hepatica during the acute and chronic stages of infection. The histopathological study revealed the presence of necrotizing foci (NF1) associated with larvae migration during the early stages of infection in the primoinfected (PI) and reinfected (RI) groups. In the late stages of infection of the PI group and at the early and late stages of infection in the RI groups, extensive necrotizing/hemorrhagic foci (NF2) were found in the vicinity of enlarged bile ducts, some containing adult flukes, suggesting parasites may have caused NF2 while feeding. The immunohistochemical study revealed an increase in Foxp3+ T cells in both PI and RI groups with respect to the UC group and in the infiltrates adjacent to NF1 in the RI groups with respect to the PI group, suggesting the F. hepatica induce Foxp3 T cell expansion to facilitate parasite survival. In addition, in both the PI and RI groups, and during acute and chronic stages of the infection, a poor expression of iNOS was found accompanied by a strong expression of CD163, suggesting a marked M2 activation of macrophages in the hepatic lesions, which may be related with healing processes, and it also may facilitate parasite survival. The main differences between PI and RI animals were the more severe infiltration of eosinophils and Foxp3+ T cells, whereas RI did not modify M2 activation of macrophages which occurs since the early stages of primoinfection.

AB  - The North African sengi (Petrosaltator rozeti syn. Elephantulus rozeti) is a small mammal endemic to the Maghreb area, and is one of the least studied mammals in North Africa. Little is known about its status, habitat preference, and distribution across large areas of its range. This work provides a detailed geographical and ecological distribution of the species in Tunisia based on 200 surveyed sites throughout the country with 103 positive occurrence records. We also used species distribution modelling to assess the habitat suitability of the species. P. rozeti showed a heterogeneous bioclimatic niche, with a presence in the semi-arid, arid and Saharan bioclimatic zones. But the species' distribution seems to be limited to the main mountain ranges of Tunisia. This was also confirmed by habitat suitability modeling where the elevation was the most informative predictor variable. Our work also show some first recorded ecological traits, confirms the rock-dwelling specialist nature of the species and debate its endemism to mountain ecosystems.

AB  - Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and subsequent steatohepatitis (NASH) is the most common cause of liver disease and liver transplantation in humans. Affecting millions of patients worldwide, diagnosis relies on a biopsy, not without risk to the patient, and emphasises the need for improved diagnostic measures to determine and monitor disease progression. Despite intensive research, approved pharmacological treatment modalities are few, underlining that animal models with increased translational validity are important to advance preclinical drug development. This study validates the applicability of computed tomography (CT) as a non-invasive diagnostic tool for the assessment of liver steatosis in a guinea pig model of NAFLD/NASH. Guinea pigs with induced NAFLD or NASH were compared to healthy controls at two separate time points: week 16, serving as baseline measure, and week 25 to monitor disease progression over time. The animals were subsequently euthanised, and samples were collected to confirm disease stage. The data showed a strong negative correlation between liver triglycerides and Hounsfield unit (HU) values (R2 = 0.8157; p < 0.0001). A significant difference in histopathological scoring and HU values between grade 0 and more advanced stages of steatosis was recorded (p < 0.001), although the degree of liver fibrosis could not be accurately evaluated by differences in HU. In conclusion, the present study validates CT scanning for the determination of hepatic steatosis in guinea pigs, and it strongly supports the technique as a relevant non-invasive diagnostic tool in this species.

AB  - In this trial, the effects of different nutritional treatments on the N balance parameters of fattening pigs in the 55-65 kg live weight category were evaluated. The following diets were used: control diet (C) and low-protein (LP) diet with 2% crude protein reduction, with and without 10% sugar beet pulp (S) or 0.5% benzoic acid supplementation. Six pigs per treatment with similar live weight were used, and in the context of the balance trial, the daily N intake, fecal and urinary N excretion and the pH of urine were measured. From the data N digestibility, the TAN % and N retention were calculated. Feeding LP diets reduced the fecal, urinary and total N excretion and also the pH of urine significantly compared with the control diet. Sugar beet pulp significantly increased the fecal N excretion and urinary pH, and it also reduced significantly N digestibility and the TAN ratio. Benzoic acid failed to reduce urinary pH. The measured N excretion, retention and TAN excretion values were more favorable than those that can be found in the different guidelines or those used in the Hungarian ammonia emission inventory.

AB  - Every year, foodborne pathogens, including the hepatitis E virus (HEV), cause thousands of infections in different continents. Final consumers become infected through the ingestion of contaminated animal origin foodstuffs. Generally, in industrialized countries, HEV genotype 3 is involved in sporadic outbreaks. Infections have been described, in Europe and Japan as consequence of pork products and contaminated wild boar's primary or processed products (liver and muscle tissues) consumption. In Central Italy, hunting activities are largely practiced. In these small and rural communities, game meat and liver are ingested by hunters' families or at local and traditional restaurants. Therefore, these food chains can be considered critical HEV reservoirs. In this study, 506 liver and diaphragm tissues were collected from hunted wild boars in the Southern Marche region (Central Italy) and were screened for HEV RNA detection. From the 10.87% of liver and 2.76% of muscle samples, HEV3 subtype c was discovered. The observed prevalence values resulted in line with previous investigations performed in other Central Italian regions, but higher than Northern ones (3.7% and 1.9% from liver tissue). Therefore, the obtained epidemiological data highlighted the wide occurrence of HEV RNA circulation in a low-investigated area. Basing on results, a One-health approach was adopted due to the sanitary relevance of this Public Health concern.

AB  - Non-native species can be major drivers of ecosystem alteration, especially through changes in trophic interactions. Successful non-native species have been predicted to have greater resource use efficiency relative to trophically analogous native species (the Resource Consumption Hypothesis), but rigorous evidence remains equivocal. Here, we tested this proposition quantitatively in a global meta-analysis of comparative functional response studies. We calculated the log response ratio of paired non-native and native species functional responses, using attack rate and maximum consumption rate parameters as response variables. Explanatory variables were consumer taxonomic group and functional feeding group, habitat, native assemblage latitude, and non-native species taxonomic distinctiveness. Maximum consumption rates for non-native species were 70% higher, on average, than those of their native counterparts; attack rates also tended to be higher, but not significantly so. The magnitude of maximum consumption rate effect sizes varied with consumer taxonomic group and functional feeding group, being highest in favour of non-natives for molluscs and herbivores. Consumption rate differences between non-native and native species tended to be greater for freshwater taxa, perhaps reflecting sensitivity of insular freshwater food webs to novel consumers; this pattern needs to be explored further as additional data are obtained from terrestrial and marine ecosystems. In general, our results support the Resource Consumption Hypothesis, which can partly explain how successful non-native species can reduce native resource populations and restructure food webs.

AB  - While it is well known that ceramic UO2 fuel cracks early in its life in a nuclear reactor, it is very difficult to collect in-reactor data regarding fuel cracking initiation and propagation to validate fracture models in fuel performance codes. Most fracture data comes from the post-irradiation examination of fuel that has been subjected to long and complex power histories. Replicating the thermal gradients experienced in this fuel to study crack initiation and propagation in a laboratory environment is challenging. This is primarily because the fuel is heated volumetrically by fission, which is difficult to replicate. One way to approximate this volumetric heating out of the reactor is to use electrical resistance (or Joule heating). An electrical conductivity model has been developed and coupled with the existing thermomechanical modeling capability in the BISON nuclear fuel performance code. This will permit simulation of experiments that use resistive heating for the purpose of validating fracture models in BISON. The modeling approach developed here is applied to simulate both historical and current resistive heating experiments on ceramic nuclear fuel. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Simple Summary This study evaluated the ventilation rates and efficiency in research-scale pig houses by examining different inlet and exhaust configurations. The goal was to understand how well the ventilation system worked. Two pig rooms were studied, and actual ventilation rates were measured using specialized equipment. The results revealed that certain combinations of inlets and exhausts performed better in terms of ventilation rates. However, the measured rates were lower than expected. This study also found that the side exhaust fan closer to where the pigs were active was more effective at providing fresh air compared to the chimney exhaust fan. Additionally, the ceiling inlet provided better air distribution. This study highlights the importance of choosing the right ventilation setup to ensure a healthy environment for both pigs and workers. By improving ventilation efficiency, this research can contribute to creating better conditions for pig farming, resulting in improved animal welfare and productivity. Accurate ventilation control is crucial for maintaining a healthy and productive environment in research-specialized pig facilities. This study aimed to evaluate actual ventilation rates and ventilation efficiency by investigating different inlet and exhaust configurations. The research was conducted in two pig rooms, namely pig room A and pig room B, in the absence of animals and workers to focus solely on evaluating the ventilation system's performance. Actual ventilation rates were measured using hood-type anemometers, and the local air change per hour was analyzed at various measurement points via tracer gas decay experiments. The results demonstrated that specific inlet and exhaust combinations, such as side inlet/chimney outlet and ceiling inlet/side outlet, exhibited higher ventilation rates. However, the measured ventilation rates were much lower than the manufacturer's specifications. The side exhaust fan closer to the pig activity space demonstrated better ventilation effectiveness for the animals than the chimney exhaust fan. Additionally, the ceiling inlet exhibited superior air distribution and uniformity. Lower ventilation rates and higher infiltration ratios resulted in reduced ventilation efficiency, with the difference between pig and worker activity spaces being pronounced. This study emphasizes the importance of selecting optimal inlet and exhaust configurations to achieve efficient ventilation and create a healthy environment for both pigs and workers.

AB  - One of the global problems that are anthropogenic in nature is the sharp decline in biodiversity, a special case of which is the reduction in the number of species of wild animals and the number of breeds of farm animals. The Myrhorod pig breed, due to its genetic and biological characteristics, is of great importance for the process of preserving the biodiversity of agricultural animals. The study's object was Myrhorod breed pigs, the study focused on the variations in the allele frequency of the RYR1 / SNP g.1843 C>T and MC4R / SNP c.1426 G>A genes that occurred in the Myrhorod breed as it recovered from the African swine fever epidemic. The age at which one pig reaches 100 kg (days); the average daily weight gain from 90 days to slaughter (g); the thickness of the backfat (mm); the length of the carcass (cm); the cross-sectional area of the longest back muscle at the level of the 6th and 7th thoracic vertebrae (cm2); the slaughter output (%); and the yield of meat, fat, and bones from the carcass (%) are other quantitative changes in indicators of fattening and meat productivity. Significant alterations in the SNP marker MC4R polymorphism were observed during the restoration of the Myrhorod pig breed after the African swine fever epidemic. The frequency of the A allele dropped by 2.79 times to just 26.9% from 75.0%, which was 3.17 times higher than the frequency of the G allele until 2019. These alterations resulted from the forced crossing of the Myrhorod breed with the Pietrain breed, which has a high frequency of the G gene (83.0%), during the early phase of the breed's restoration in order to prevent close inbreeding. It is suggested that animals with the AA genotype should be preferred during further restoration in order to restore the Myrhorod breed to its original state. If crossbreeding becomes necessary again (to prevent excessive inbreeding), only breeds related to the Myrhorod (Berkshire, Poltava meat, Large White) should be used. The allele frequency in 2023 did not differ substantially from 2015 or 2019, based on the RYR1 DNA marker. The recessive T gene at the RYR1 g.1843 C>T locus was absent in 2023, confirming the stress resistance of the Myrhorod breed. When compared to the same indicator in the population of 2019, the average daily gain in the live weight of pigs belonging to the restored Myrhorod breed in 2023 was higher. Although this is a good development in terms of making profits by producing this breed of pig, these notable variations might point to important shifts in the polymorphism of genetic markers linked to growth rate. To determine the extent to which restoration has altered DNA markers linked to this productive attribute, more research is required to examine the frequency of alleles of genes linked to growth intensity.

AB  - Polysaccharide biopolymers have been shown to be alternatives to established dust suppressants. This study investigates the potential of 14 polysaccharides and proteins from diverse botanical (corn, pea, wheat, cellulose, potato, and fava bean) and animal (pig, chicken, and cow) sources as dust suppressants on two mine soils (medium-grained sand and fine-grained silica sand). Results of laboratory tests demonstrate that the type of biopolymer and its concentration have a significant effect on penetration resistance, moisture retention, and crust thickness. Depending on biopolymer type, concentration, and soil type, moisture retention range from 1.0 to 19.5 wt% (control, Cmedium-gr. = 2.5 and Cfine-gr. = 6.9 wt%), penetration resistance from 1.7 to 37.9 N (Cmedium-gr. = 1.5 and Cfine-gr. = 1.7 N), and crust thickness from 0.3 to 18.1 mm (Cmedium-gr. and Cfine-gr. = 0 mm). Proteins form crusts with penetration resistances similar to polysaccharides but mainly require higher concentrations than polysaccharides. Based on the test results, xanthan gum, carboxymethyl cellulose, corn starch, fava bean protein concentrate, and plasma protein exhibit the highest potential to act as dust suppressants. This research contributes to evaluating biopolymers as environmentally friendly soil amendments that may be used to control fugitive dust emissions from large, barren surfaces.

AB  - The aim was to evaluate the chemical composition, carbohydrates, protein fractionation and in vitro gas production of silages composed of spineless cactus and tropical forages and their effect on sheep performance. Treatments consisted of silages: corn silage (CS), spineless cactus silage (SCS), spineless cactus + gliricidia (SCG), spineless cactus + buffel grass silage (SCBG) and spineless cactus + pornunca (SCP). Silos were opened 60 days after ensiling, and analyses were carried out. The digestibility test lasted for 36 days, with eight animals per treatment. A completely randomized design was adopted. Considering carbohydrate fractionation, CS, SCS and SCBG silages had higher total carbohydrate content (p = 0.001). The SCS silage presented a higher A + B1 fraction (p = 0.001). The SCBG and SCG silages showed a higher B2 fraction (p < 0.0001) compared to the CS and SCS silages. The SCBG and SCP silages presented a higher C fraction (p = 0.001). For protein fractionation, the SCP and SCG silages showed higher crude protein contents (p = 0.001). The CS and SCS silages showed a higher A fraction (p = 0.001). The SCBG silage presented a higher B1 + B2 fraction (p = 0.001). The SCG silage showed a higher B3 fraction (p = 0.006) compared to SCBG silage. The SCS and SCP silages showed a higher C fraction (p = 0.001). Exclusive SCS silage showed higher in vitro dry matter digestibility (p = 0.001), dry matter degradability (p = 0.001) and total gas production (p = 0.001). The use of the SCBG, SCP and SCG silages to feed sheep increased the dry matter intake (p < 0.001). Sheep fed the SCG silage showed greater dry matter and crude protein digestibility compared to the sheep fed the CS, SCS and SCP silages (p = 0.002). There was a higher water intake (p < 0.001) with the use of the SCS and SCG silages to feed the sheep. The SCP and SCG silages provided a greater intake (p < 0.001) and excretion (p < 0.001) of nitrogen by the animals. Although there were no differences between the treatments for daily gains, lambs that received the spineless cactus-based silage associated with tropical forages showed higher gains (160-190 g/day) than lambs that received CS silage (130 g/day). Thus, the use of spineless cactus associated with buffelgrass, pornunca and gliricidia to prepare mixed silages (60:40) to feed sheep has potential use to feed sheep, with positive effects on nutrient degradation and increases in dry matter intake. Under experimental conditions, we recommend the exclusive use of spineless cactus silage associated with buffel grass, pornunca and gliricidia in feeding sheep in semi-arid regions, as it provides nutrients, water and greater daily gains compared to corn silage.

AB  - Copper (Cu), one of the heavy metals, is far beyond the carrying capacity of the environment with Cu mining, industrial wastewater discharging and the use of Cu-containing pesticides. Intaking excess Cu can cause toxic effects on liver, kidney, heart, but few studies report Cu toxicity on brain tissue. It is noteworthy that most toxicity tests are based on rodent models, but large mammals chosen as animal models has no reported. To explore the relationship of the Cu toxicity and mitochondria-mediated apoptosis on hypothalamus in pigs, the content of Cu, histomorphology, mitochondrial related indicators, apoptosis, and AMPK-mTOR signaling pathway were detected. Results showed that Cu could accumulate in hypothalamus and lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, evidenced by the decrease of ATP production, activities of respiratory chain complex I-IV, and mitochondrial respiratory function in Cu-treated groups. Additionally, the genes and proteins expression of Bax, Caspase-3, Cytc in treatment group were higher than control group. Furthermore, the protein level of p-AMPK was enhanced significantly and p-mTOR was declined, which manifested that AMPK-mTOR signaling pathway was activated in Cu-treated groups. In conclusion, this study illuminated that the accumulation of Cu could cause mitochondrial dysfunction, induce mitochondria-mediated apoptosis and activate AMPK-mTOR pathway in hypothalamus.

AB  - Situated in the northern part of Dobrogea which belonged to Scythia Minor province, Ibida was the largest fortification in this region during Roman-Byzantine times, between the 4th and 6th centuries. This study investigates the usefulness of multidisciplinary analysis on the territory of Ibida fortress by integrating faunal data and phytolith records in relation to soil characteristics to understand past human-environmental interactions. One of the four soil profiles excavated within the fortress territory was sampled for phytolith analysis indicated the domination of grasses. The habitation phase corresponding to the Roman-Byzantine period was identified at 1.65 m depth on the Slava Rusa floodplain. This was the richest level in artefacts and elongate dendritic phytoliths, also suggesting an important accumulation of grass spikelets in the cultural layer. This could be explained either by the presence of cereals in the dwelling level or by the presence of non-cereal grasses used for animal fodder. The faunal remains were collected from various archaeological contexts (i.e. intramuros, wall and extramuros). The identification of numerous cattle and sheep/goat remains and the soil characteristics more likely suggest a pastoral use of the land from fortress proximity, where the cultivation of cereals seems to play a less important role.

AB  - Advances in network ecology offer new tools for the sustainable management of agroecosystems. Plants in field margins may be involved in different processes of agronomic importance -indirectly affecting crops by supporting shared pollinators, hosting natural enemies of pests or acting as pest reservoirs. In this work, we explored the use of motifs (patterns of interaction between a subset of species) in agricultural ecological networks incorporating multiple types of trophic interactions to identify plant species with a key role in field margins. We searched for plant species benefiting crops via (1) shared pollinators and (2) supporting parasitoids of crop pests; or (3) negatively affecting crops through attracting pest herbivore species. We focused on determining whether species' showed consistent affiliation with these roles across the landscape and evaluated the potential of plant species to influence crops indirectly via shared insect partners. To showcase our framework, we used a unique data set of antagonistic and mutualistic interactions recorded in soybean crops and wild plant species in field margins, that despite its limitations (e.g., spanning one growing season) allowed us to test our approach using multiple types of interactions simultaneously. Here, we support the use of motifs in multi-trophic interaction networks in agroecosystems to reveal the role of key plant species in sustaining ecological functions involving crops and other plant species, enhancing the evidence base for management recommendations in the future.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) is an essential nutrient for plant growth, but its availability is limited in the soil of subtropical ecosystems. Identifying the genes responsible for N utilization efficiency (NUE) in Camellia oleifera is important because of the excessive cost of N fertilization. To investigate this, we performed RNA-sequencing of C. oleifera roots to reveal the genome-wide gene expression in response to three synthetic forms of N, namely ammonium (NH + 4), nitrate (NO- 3), and ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3), provided to three independent groups of plants. The expression of several ammonium and nitrate transporters increased slightly in the NO- 3-treated group and significant changes were observed in the NH + 4- and NH4NO3-treated groups. The opposite expressions of some key N transport and assimilation genes under the different N treatments suggested that C. oleifera might have different N utilization pathways for the different N forma. Additionally, the genes involved in N transport and assimilation account for the different N uptake and for different concentrations of glutamate and glutamine in plants and the metabolomic data showed that the accumulation of both amino-acids was promoted by the NH + 4 and NH4NO3 treatments but not by the NO- 3 treatment. These findings will help improve the NUE of C. oleifera and guide its agricultural production in the future.

AB  - The increasing application of biosolids and agrochemicals containing silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO(2)NPs) results in their inevitable accumulation in soil, with unknown implications along terrestrial food chains. Here, the trophic transfer of single NPs and a mixture of AgNPs and TiO(2)NPs from lettuce to snails and their associated impacts on snails were investigated. Both AgNPs and TiO(2)NPs were transferred from lettuce to snails with trophic transfer factors (defined as the ratio of the Ag/Ti concentration in snail tissues to the Ag/Ti concentration in lettuce leaves) of 0.2-1.1 for Ag and 3.8-47 for Ti. Moreover, the majority of Ag captured by snails in the AgNP-containing treatments was excreted via feces, whereas more than 70% of Ti was distributed in the digestive gland of snails in the TiO2NP-containing treatments. Additionally, AgNP-containing treatments significantly inhibited the activity of snails, while TiO2NP-containing treatments significantly reduced feces excretion of snails. Furthermore, the concurrent application of AgNPs and TiO(2)NPs did not affect the biomagnification and distribution patterns of Ag and Ti in snails, whereas their co-existence exhibited more severe inhibition of the growth and activity of snails than in the case of applying AgNPs or TiO(2)NPs alone. This highlights the possibility of nanoparticle transfer to organisms of higher trophic levels via food chains and the associated risks to ecosystem health.

AB  - Social adversity during childhood and adolescence can alter brain development in ways that may increase the likelihood of many prominent mental illnesses. To determine the underlying mechanisms, several animal models have been developed, such as Chronic Early-Life Social Isolation (CELSI), which sees rats isolated for several weeks after weaning. Although such a paradigm does cause many consistent changes in adult behaviour, one area where uncertainty exists concerns its effect upon hippocampal-dependent learning and memory. To help sort out how CELSI affects spatial learning and memory, male and female siblings from 15 Sprague-Dawley rat litters were stratified by sex and then randomly assigned to either group-housing (3 animals/cage), or social isolation (1 animal/cage) for 7 weeks. Spatial learning and memory were then tested over 5 days using the Morris water maze. Next, the animals were euthanised, and stress-sensitive biometrics, including serum corticosterone levels, were collected. Lastly, to determine whether CELSI affected neural cell density, the expression of key neuronal and glial proteins (such as PSD-95 and GFAP, respectively) was assessed in isolated hippocampal tissue using immunoblotting. Notably, both male and female rats that had experienced post-weaning social isolation dis-played stronger spatial learning and memory abilities than their group-housed counterparts. As well, socially isolated male rats exhibited a clear increase in expression of PSD-95. However, housing condition did not seem to affect either stress-sensitive biometrics, or hippocampal GFAP expression. Our results support the possibility that CELSI may enhance some aspects of hippocampal-dependent behaviour in a fashion similar among male and female rats.

AB  - Increasing demands to reduce fertilizer and pesticide input in agriculture has triggered interest in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) that can enhance plant growth and confer mycorrhiza-induced resistance (MIR). MIR can be based on a variety of mechanisms, including induction of defense compounds, and sensitization of the plant's immune system (priming) for enhanced defense against later arriving pests or pathogens signaled through jasmonic acid (JA). However, growth and resistance benefits of AMF highly depend on environmental conditions. Low soil P and non-limiting light conditions are expected to enhance MIR, as these conditions favor AMF colonization and because of observed positive cross-talk between the plant's phosphate starvation response (PSR) and JA-dependent immunity. We therefore tested growth and resistance benefits of the AMF Funneliformis mosseae in Plantago lanceolata plants grown under different levels of soil P and light intensity. Resistance benefits were assessed in bioassays with the leaf chewing herbivore Mamestra brassicae. Half of the plants were induced by jasmonic acid prior to the bioassays to specifically test whether AMF primed plants for JA-signaled defense under different abiotic conditions. AMF reduced biomass production but contrary to prediction, this reduction was not strongest under conditions considered least optimal for carbon-for-nutrient trade (low light, high soil P). JA application induced resistance to M. brassicae, but its extent was independent of soil P and light conditions. Strikingly, in younger plants, JA-induced resistance was annulled by AMF under high resource conditions (high soil P, ample light), indicating that AMF did not prime but repressed JA-induced defense responses. In older plants, low soil P and light enhanced susceptibility to M. brassicae due to enhanced leaf nitrogen levels and reduced leaf levels of the defense metabolite catalpol. By contrast, in younger plants, low soil P enhanced resistance. Our results highlight that defense priming by AMF is not ubiquitous and calls for studies revealing the causes of the increasingly observed repression of JA-mediated defense by AMF. Our study further shows that in our system abiotic factors are significant modulators of defense responses, but more strongly so by directly modulating leaf quality than by modulating the effects of beneficial microbes on resistance.

AB  - The present study was conducted to compare the effect of short-term and long-term progesterone and GnRH-based estrus synchronization protocols on fertility of Beetal goats during low breeding season. The goats (n=63) were divided into three groups to receive intravaginal progesterone sponges for short-term (STP; n = 20; 5days) or long-term (LTP; n = 22; 11days) and Ovsynch estrus synchronization protocols (OVS; n = 21). The STP and LTP treated goats were additionally injected with PGF(2)alpha (75 mu g/doe) and PMSG (300IU/doe) according to schedule for LTP and STP protocol. The OVS goats were administered 1st injection of GnRH (25 mu g/doe) at day 0, PGF(2)alpha at day 7 and 2nd GnRH injection at day 9. The goats were observed for estrus signs and bred at detected estrus using a fertile buck. The results indicated that estrus response, pregnancy rate, litter size, and twining rates were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in STP and LTP than OVS treated groups. In contrast, the variables like intervals from PGF(2)alpha treatment to the onset of estrus or estrus to breeding, pregnancy loss and prolificacy rate were similar (p > 0.05) among groups. In conclusions, the short-term intravaginal progesterone-based sponges successfully synchronized the estrus before breeding and could be an effective alternative to conventional long-term progesterone-based or Ovsynch synchronization protocols in Beetal goats. Also, better pregnancy, and kidding rates, with minimal pregnancy loss, could be achieved by employing progesterone-based protocols in Beetal goats.

AB  - Inflammatory chemokine CCL5 can mediate the occurrence of inflammatory reactions and participate in various disease processes. (Ch)CCL5 gene of Jintang black goat (Capra hircus, C. hircus) was cloned. The CDS (coding sequences) was 276 bp in length and encoded 91 amino acids. The 26.5 kDa recombinant protein was expressed by Escherichia coli system and purified by Ni-Agarose. The viabilities of primary goat lung fibroblasts could be enhanced after treating with ChCCL5 protein (12.5, 25, 50 mu g/mL) (P < 0.05). The expression levels of interleukin-1beta (IL-1 beta), interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha), C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) and heat-shock proteins (Hsp70) genes were upregulated after treating with ChCCL5 protein (12.5, 25, 50 mu g/mL). Besides, the viabilities and phagocytic abilities of primary mouse peritoneal macrophages could be enhanced after treating with ChCCL5 protein (12.5, 25, 50 mu g/mL) (P < 0.05). The expression levels of IL-1 beta, IL6, toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOs) and TNF-alpha genes were upregulated after treating with ChCCL5 protein (12.5, 25, 50 mu g/mL) (P < 0.05). These results indicated that goat CCL5 might play a role in the inflammatory response by regulating the inflammatory cytokines produced by lung fibroblasts and macrophages.

AB  - A single manipulable enrichment is often introduced to the pens of farmed American mink (Neogale vison) to combat stereotypic behaviour and behaviours or temperaments associated with poor welfare (e.g. inactivity, fear, and aggression). This enrichment is provided early in life, but it is unclear the age at which enrichment is most effective at preventing stereotypic behaviour and ameliorating welfare. Here, a group of enriched kits (EK) were provided with multiple enrichments that were periodically exchanged to renew novelty from 4-15 weeks of age, earlier than typical enrichment provision on farms, after which they were housed with a single standard enrichment into adulthood. The effects of EK enrichment on kit behaviours and long-term stereotypic behaviour were compared to that of two groups reared with a single standard enrichment (standard housed; SH and enriched at whelping; EW). Inactivity in the nest-box was decreased in EK kits as juveniles relative to other groups, however, social play was reduced and lying awake was increased compared to EW and SH juveniles, respectively. Stereotypic behaviour in the kits as adults was not prevented by EK interventions; in fact, EK kits may have developed more diverse sub-types of stereotypic behaviour than EW and SH kits. Moreover, kit temperament did not appear to be affected. EK enrichment may have been ineffective in improving welfare due to the timing of its removal or potential frustration induced by its removal. Recommendations are provided for future research regarding critical periods of enrichment to improve welfare in species such as farmed mink.

AB  - A large literature on visual word recognition has examined the role of (apparent) morphological structure by comparing suffixed (such as treatment), pseudo-suffixed (pigment), and non-suffixed (dogma) words with respect to their embeddings (treat, pig, dog). We examined the processing of these word types, as well as semantic controls, in an auditory primed lexical decision paradigm. The results show significant priming in all conditions relative to an unrelated baseline, with larger priming effects for truly suffixed words than for pseudo-suffixed and non-suffixed words. The results suggest that initial embeddings are activated in spoken word processing, and remain active in ways that do not depend on (apparent) morphological structure. We discuss the implications of these findings for models of lexical access that predict inhibition of disfavoured competitors and models that hold that attempted decomposition is driven by meaning relatedness between the carrier word and its possible embedded stem(s).

AB  - Tickborne diseases are an increasing public health problem in the northeastern USA. Bait boxes that apply acaricide to rodents have been shown in small field studies to significantly reduce abundance of Ixodes scapularis ticks as well as their pathogen infection rates in treated areas. The effectiveness of this intervention for preventing human tickborne diseases (TBDs) has not been demonstrated. During 2012-2016, TickNET collaborators conducted a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trial among 622 Connecticut households. Each household received active (containing fipronil wick) or placebo (empty) bait boxes in their yards over two consecutive years. Information on tick encounters and TBDs among household members was collected through biannual surveys. Nymphal ticks were collected from a subset of 100 properties during spring at baseline, during treatment, and in the year post-intervention. Demographic and property characteristics did not differ between treatment groups. There were no significant differences post-intervention between treatment groups with respect to tick density or pathogen infection rates, nor for tick encounters or TBDs among household members. We found no evidence that rodent-targeted bait boxes disrupt pathogen transmission cycles or significantly reduce household risk of tick exposure or TBDs. The effectiveness of this intervention may depend on scale of use or local enzootic cycles.

AB  - Stimuli in reality rarely co-occur with primary reward or punishment to allow direct associative learning of value. Instead, value is thought to be inferred through complex higher-order associations. Rodent research has demonstrated that the formation and maintenance of first-order and higher-order associations are supported by distinct neural substrates. In this study, we explored whether this pattern of findings held true for humans. Participants underwent first-order and subsequent higher-order conditioning using an aversive burst of white noise or neutral tone as the unconditioned stimuli. Four distinct tones, initially neutral, served as first-order and higher-order conditioned stimuli. Autonomic and neural responses were indexed by pupillometry and evoked response potentials (ERPs) respectively. Conditioned aversive values of first-order and higher-order stimuli led to increased autonomic responses, as indexed by pupil dilation. Distinct temporo-spatial auditory evoked response potentials were elicited by first-order and high-order conditioned stimuli. Conditioned first-order responses peaked around 260 ms and source estimation suggested a primary medial prefrontal and amygdala source. Conversely, conditioned higher-order responses peaked around 120 ms with an estimated source in the medial temporal lobe. Interestingly, pupillometry responses to first-order conditioned stimuli were diminished after higher order training, possibly signifying concomitant incidental extinction, while responses to higher-order stimuli remained. This suggests that once formed, higher order associations are at least partially independent of first order conditioned representations. This experiment demonstrates that first-order and higher-order conditioned associations have distinct neural signatures, and like rodents, the medial temporal lobe may be specifically involved with higher-order conditioning.

AB  - In mammals, single blastomeres from as early as 2-cell embryos demonstrate heterogeneous developmental capacity and fate decision into different cell lineages. However, mechanisms underlying blastomere heterogeneity of 2-cell embryos remain largely unresolved. Here, we analysed the molecular heterogeneity of full-length mRNAs and their 3 & PRIME;UTR regions, based on the single-cell RNA-seq data of pig 2-cell embryos generated from in vivo fertilization (in vivo), in vitro fertilization (in vitro) and parthenogenetic activation (PA), respectively. First, unsupervised clustering helped discover two different groups of blastomeres for 2-cell pig embryos. Between these two groups of blastomeres in pig 2-cell embryos, 35, 301 and 428 full-length mRNAs respectively in in vivo, in vitro and PA embryo types were identified to be differentially expressed (p(adj) & LE; .05 and |log(2)[fold change]| & GE;1) (DE mRNAs), while 92, 89 and 42 mRNAs were shown to be with significantly different 3 & PRIME;UTR lengths (3 & PRIME;UTR DE) (p(adj) & LE; .05). Gene enrichment for both DE mRNAs and 3 & PRIME;UTR DE mRNAs found multiple signalling pathways, including cell cycle, RNA processing. Few numbers of common DE mRNAs and 3 & PRIME;UTR DE mRNAs existed between in vitro and in vivo blastomeres derived from 2-cell embryos, indicating the larger differences between in vitro and in vivo fertilized embryos. Integrative genomics viewer analysis further identified that 3 & PRIME;UTRs of HSDL2 and SGTA (in vivo), FAM204A and phosphoserine phosphatase (in vitro), PRPF40A and RPIA (PA) had >100 nt average length changes. Moreover, numbers and locations of regulatory elements (polyadenylation site, cytoplasmic polyadenylation element and microRNA binding sites) within 3 & PRIME;UTRs of these DE mRNAs were predicted. These results indicate that molecular heterogeneity existed among blastomeres from different types of pig 2-cell embryos, providing useful information and novel insights into future functional investigation on its relationship with the subsequent embryo development and differentiation.

AB  - Rhinonycteridae (trident bats) are a small Palaeotropical family of insectivorous bats allied to Hipposideridae. Their taxonomy has been in a state of flux. Here, we use mitochondrial and nuclear sequences to evaluate species relationships, confirming the monophyly of both Triaenops and Paratriaenops. Although most Triaenops afer specimens are recovered as a group, mitochondrial analyses strongly support some Kenyan individuals as members of Triaenops persicus. Analyses of four nuclear introns (ACOX2, COPS7A, RODGI and STAT5A) strongly support the mitochondrial topology. Morphometric analysis of the skull, external morphology and echolocation calls confirm that the Triaenops from the Rift Valley in Kenya (Nakuru, Baringo and Pokot counties) are distinct from typical T. afer in coastal (Kilifi and Kwale counties) or interior (Laikipia and Makueni counties) colonies. We interpret these analyses to indicate that two species of Triaenops occur in East Africa: T. afer in coastal regions along the Indian Ocean and in the highlands of central Kenya and Ethiopia, and T. persicus in the Rift Valley of Kenya. Although they appear widely disjunct from Middle Eastern populations, Kenyan T. persicus might be more widely distributed in the Rift Valley; they are somewhat differentiated from Middle Eastern populations in terms of both cranial morphology and vocalizations.

AB  - Pregnancy toxaemia is a serious disease that occurs during the last trimester of pregnancy in sheep. Yet, in most cases, the disease may have a subclinical course. This study was aimed at comparing blood beta HBA measurement devices for diagnosis of subclinical pregnancy toxaemia in late pregnant sheep. In the study, a total of 50 blood samples were collected from Romanov (n = 30) and cross-bred Hamdani (n = 20) sheep. Blood beta HBA levels were measured using TaiDoc TD-4235 and CentriVet beta HBA hand-held meter. Randox beta HBA (Ranbut) assay was used as a reference laboratory method to compare hand-held meters. beta HBA value of 0.8 mmol/L was set as the cut-off value for diagnosis of subclinical pregnancy toxaemia. Statistical analyses were carried out using Minitab 21 and Jamovi software. In the study, the correlation of Randox-TaiDoc TD-4235 and Randox-CentriVet was .822 (p < .001) and .728 (p < .001), respectively. Based on the Ranbut assay, nine ewes out of 50 were diagnosed with subclinical pregnancy toxaemia. Specificity (detection of healthy ewes) and sensitivity (detection of ewes with subclinical pregnancy toxaemia) for TaiDoc TD-4235 and CentriVet hand-held meters were 100%, 77.8%, and 100%, 66.7%, respectively. In the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, areas under the ROC curve (AUC) were 0.976 and 0.920 for TaiDoc and CentriVet, respectively. Bland-Altman analysis revealed a bias of 0.092 mmol/L for TaiDoc and a bias of 0.132 mmol/L for CentriVet. TaiDoc hand-held meter shows a better correlation with the Randox Ranbut assay and greater sensitivity compared to the CentriVet hand-held meter. In conclusion, both TaiDoc and CentriVet hand-held meters can be securely used in the diagnosis of subclinical pregnancy toxaemia in sheep. For these reasons, subclinical pregnancy toxaemia and these devices will be evaluated within the scope of herd management programme in the sheep industry. It should also be taken into account that these conditions will affect the future fertility of the mother and offspring.

AB  - Simple Summary: Northernmammals and birdswithstand harshwinter conditions by hypometabolism and hypothermia. We investigated in an experimental study with a non-hibernating, but strongly seasonal species, the red deer, whether such seasonal acclimatization is controlled by photoperiod and modulated by the intake of essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), like in hibernators. We used advanced data logging techniques to continuously measure heart rate (f(H)), a proxy of energy expenditure, core and peripheral body temperature (T-b), and activity in adult females fed with pellets ad libitum or with restricted daily rations and either enriched with linoleic acid (LA, C18:2 n-6) or ff-linolenic acid (ALA, C18:3 n-3). Results show strong seasonal variation of measured parameters, exacerbated by restricted feeding, but with only few, mostly inconsistent, effects of supplementation with LA or ALA. By experimentally increasing the amount of circulating melatonin already in early summer to levels about three times higher than the winter peak, we induced a winter phenotype weeks ahead of time, demonstrating photoperiodic control of physiological and behavioral seasonal acclimatization. Hypometabolism and hypothermia are common reactions of birds and mammals to cope with harsh winter conditions. In small mammals, the occurrence of hibernation and daily torpor is entrained by photoperiod, and the magnitude of hypometabolism and decrease of body temperature (Tb) is influenced by the dietary supply of essential polyunsaturated fatty acids. We investigated whether similar effects exist in a non-hibernating large mammal, the red deer (Cervus elaphus). We fed adult females with pellets enriched with either linoleic acid (LA) or ff-linolenic acid (ALA) during alternating periods of ad libitum and restricted feeding in a cross-over experimental design. Further, we scrutinized the role of photoperiod for physiological and behavioral seasonal changes by manipulating the amount of circulating melatonin. The deer were equipped with data loggers recording heart rate, core and peripheral T-b, and locomotor activity. Further, we regularly weighed the animals and measured their daily intake of food pellets. All physiological and behavioral parameters measured varied seasonally, with amplitudes exacerbated by restricted feeding, but with only few and inconsistent effects of supplementation with LA or ALA. Administering melatonin around the summer solstice caused a change into the winter phenotype weeks ahead of time in all traits measured. We conclude that red deer reduce energy expenditure for thermoregulation upon short daylength, a reaction amplified by food restriction.

AB  - Intensive crop production often requires the use of significant amounts of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, leading to negative environmental impacts. Strategies to increase agricultural productivity to meet future demands for food should therefore involve the promotion of ecosystem services, rather than the use of synthetic inputs. Sowing nectarrich flowering plants is an important strategy in conservation biological control that can increase the fitness of the natural enemies of crop pests. In the present study, we conducted lab-based experiments to assess the benefits of passion fruit (Passiflora edulia) and lemon basil (Ocimum basilicum var. citriodorum) as nectar sources for six parasitoid wasp species that are key natural enemies of rice pests. We also examined the potential of these two plants to enhance biocontrol services by parasitoid wasps when planted on the bunds of subtropical rice fields. In the laboratory, both plants and especially passion fruit increased parasitoids' longevity and fecundity. Both plants also increased field abundance of parasitoid wasps and slightly increased pest control services, as shown by a lower herbivorous insects to parasitoid wasps ratio, although pest numbers remained high. This study contributes important new information for ecological intensification in rice cropping systems and should guide the selection of optimal nectar plants to promote biological control services.

AB  - Simple Summary In the winter in northern China, the type of housing or outdoor management may affect the growth and health of sheep, especially if they are young. We compared growth performance, immune function and antioxidant status of female lambs housed there in an enclosed building, a polytunnel or kept outdoors for 28 days. Compared to lambs kept outdoors at -14 degrees C, those in the enclosed house and polytunnel had improved growth rates, immune function and antioxidant status. We conclude that the polytunnel is best for the sheep's welfare, followed by the enclosed house, with the outdoor treatment being the worst.Abstract Cold conditions in northern China during winter may reduce sheep growth and affect their health, especially if they are young, unless housing is provided. We allocated 45 two-month-old female lambs to be housed in an enclosed building, a polytunnel, or kept outdoors, for 28 days. The daily weight gain and scalp and ear skin temperature of outdoor lambs were less than those of lambs that were housed in either a house or polytunnel; however, rectal temperature was unaffected by treatment. There was a progressive change in blood composition over time, and by the end of the experiment, outdoor lambs had reduced total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) and increased malondialdehyde compared to those in the house or polytunnel. In relation to immune responses in the lambs' serum, in the polytunnel, immunoglobulin A (IgA), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) were higher and immunoglobulin G (IgG) lower compared with the concentrations in lambs that were outdoors. Over the course of the experiment, genes expressing heat shock proteins and antioxidant enzymes increased in lambs in the outdoor treatment, whereas they decreased in lambs in the indoor treatments. It is concluded that although there were no treatment effects on core body temperature, the trends for progressive changes in blood composition and gene expression indicate that the outdoor lambs were not physiologically stable; hence, they should not be kept outdoors in these environmental conditions for long periods.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the crude protein (CP) degradation kinetics and degradability (CPD) of cereal and legume fodder species grown at two geographically distant locations. Ten forage species, comprising six cereals (barley, maize, millet, oats, sorghum, and wheat) and four legumes (berseem, jantar, lucerne, and mustard), were evaluated to determine the effects of forage family, species, and location of growth on CP degradation fractions and effective CPD. The forage crops were cultivated under uniform agronomic practices at two distinct agro-ecological locations and were harvested at the booting stage (cereals) and 50% flowering stage (legumes). Dried and ground samples were incubated in the rumen of four Nili-Ravi buffalo fitted with rumen cannula. The incubation periods utilized in the experiment were 0, 4, 8, 16, 24, and 48 h, and a 4 x 2 x 2 split-plot design was employed. The results showed that the CP degradation fractions and CPD were significantly affected by forage family, species, and location of growth. Wide variations in degradation kinetics and degradability existed among and within the cereal and legume fodders, with wheat and jantar ranked at the top. Legume forages had larger soluble fractions, smaller potentially degradable fractions, and rapid rates and extent of degradation of dietary proteins than cereal forages. The cooler climatic conditions at location 2 increased the rapidly degradable protein fraction and overall CPD, whereas the warmer climatic conditions enhanced the slowly degradable protein fractions, thereby reducing the overall protein degradability in tropical forages. It was quite evident that some fodder species, such as maize among the cereal fodders and mustard among the legume fodders, remained quite non-responsive to the effects of the climatic conditions. A moderately positive and linear relationship between the rate of degradation and CPD was established for cereals, whereas a strongly positive and quadratic relationship was established for legume fodders. In conclusion, forage species, family, and location of growth significantly affected the degradation fractions and degradability of tropical cereal and legume fodders.

AB  - The protective effects of yak milk (YM) against chronic alcoholic liver injury in rats were investigated in this study. Histologic and biochemical analyses demonstrated that YM consumption ameliorates alcohol-induced liver injury by increasing the liver antioxidant enzyme activity and reducing inflammation. Furthermore, microbiome and metabolomic analyses exploring YM's impact on gut microbiota and metabolism found that YM administration regulates gut microbiota composition. Specifically, there was a decrease in the relative abundance of Helicobacter, Streptococcus, Peptococcus and Tyzzerella, along with an increase in Turisibacter and Intestinimonas. Moreover, Pearson analysis indicated positive correlations between Peptococcus and Tyzzerella with ALT and AST levels, while showing a negative correlation with ADH levels. Furthermore, differential metabolite analysis of fecal samples from the YM group identified significant increases in the taurine (2-Aminoethanesulfonic acid), hypotaurine (2-Aminoethanesulfonic Acid) and isethionic acid levels. Finally, KEGG topology analysis highlighted taurine and hypotaurine metabolism as the primary pathways influenced by YM intervention. Therefore, these findings collectively suggest that YM may protect alcohol-exposed rats against liver injury by modulating oxidative stress, inflammatory response, gut microbiota disorder, and metabolic regulation.

AB  - Although four major natural estrogens (i.e., estrone (E1), 17 beta-estradiol (E2), estriol (E3) and 17 alpha-estradiol (alpha E2)) have been commonly found in livestock urine, this study reports the occurrence of eight other less studied natural estrogens in urine of swine and cattle, i.e. 2-hydroxyestone (2OHE1), 4-hydroxyestrone (4OHE1), 2-hydroxyestradiol (2OHE2), 4-hydroxyestradiol (4OHE2), 16-epiestriol (16epiE3), 16 alpha-hydroxyestrone (16 alpha E1), 16-ketoestradiol (16ketoE2), and 17epiestriol (17epiE3). Results showed that each estrogen was found in at least one urine sample, and 6 of 8 the less-studied estrogens were present at frequencies of >_90% in boars, >_70% in sows, and >_50% in dairy cattle. Five of eight the less-studied estrogens were present at frequencies of >_33.3% in four beef cattle and one bull. On a concentration basis, the 8 less-studied natural estrogens represented 73.2%, 85.2%, 39.9%, 47.7%, 26.9%, 56.0% and 44.1% of total concentrations of the twelve natural estrogens when combining data from all animals. Similar results were observed based on estrogen equivalence, which indicated these newly detected eight less-studied natural estrogens were not negligible. This work is the first to figure out the importance of these less-studied natural estrogens in livestock urine, and their potential environmental risks associated with discharge of livestock wastewater should be urgently assessed in a holistic manner.

AB  - Hippophae rhamnoides (family Elaeagnaceae) is a deciduous shrub that has become a uniquely advantageous species in the arsenic sandstone area of Inner Mongolia due to its well-developed root system and strong tillering ability. This study, by taking 10-year-old H. rhamnoides in the arsenic sandstone area as the research object and analyzing the morphological traits of their fine roots and their coordination within soil under different stubble heights (0, 10, 15, and 20 cm) and non-stubble treatment, aims to select the optimal stubble height that is most conducive to the rejuvenation of H. rhamnoides and thus improve the decline in the productivity of H. rhamnoides in this region. The results reveal significant differences in fine root and soil properties under different stubble heights (p < 0.05). Among different traits, fine root area density shows the highest total coefficient of variation, making it the most sensitive trait. Principal component analysis results indicate that after stubble treatment, the traits of H. rhamnoides fine roots center on high specific surface area (0.316) + high specific root length (0.312), shifting toward a resource-acquisition ecological strategy with the best foraging efficiency observed under a stubble height of 15 cm. Soil N:P and C:P can explain 66% and 61% of the root morphological traits strategies deployed during stubble treatment, respectively. Fine roots exhibit high adaptability to the breaking of phosphorus limitation and fixation of carbon and nitrogen.

AB  - Feeding pigs diets containing added antibiotics may select for a high carriage of bacterial genes coding for multidrug efflux pumps that can contribute to antibiotic resistance. It has recently been demonstrated that the digestion of chlorophyll in the gut of animals consuming green forage can yield compounds that inhibit efflux pump activity. Considering that commercially reared pigs generally do not eat substantial amounts of feeds containing chlorophyll, this study was conducted to test if feeding pigs a water-soluble chlorophyll product could affect the antibiotic resistance profiles of wild-type populations of fecal bacteria such as Escherichia coli and enterococci. Results from two feeding trials indicate that feeding chlorophyll as a source or precursor of some known efflux pump inhibitors may indeed promote a decrease in antibiotic resistance in the enterococci but not the Escherichia coli. However, under the conditions of the present study, the decrease in enterococcal resistance was likely not enough to warrant development into an inexpensive technology to preserve and enhance the efficacy of currently available antibiotics. However, further research designed to optimize chlorophyll administration could potentially lead to practical applications for the swine industry. Considering that certain catabolic products of anaerobic chlorophyll degradation inhibit efflux pump activity, this study was conducted to test if feeding pigs a water-soluble chlorophyllin product could affect the antibiotic resistance profiles of select wild-type populations of fecal bacteria. Trial 1 evaluated the effects of chlorophyllin supplementation (300 mg/meal) on fecal E. coli and enterococcal populations in pigs fed twice daily diets supplemented without or with ASP 250 (containing chlortetracycline, sulfamethazine and penicillin at 100, 100 and 50 g/ton, respectively). Trial 2, conducted similarly, evaluated chlorophyllin supplementation in pigs fed diets supplemented with or without 100 g tylosin/ton. Each trial lasted 12 days, and fecal samples were collected and selectively cultured at 4-day intervals to enumerate the total numbers of E. coli and enterococci as well as populations of these bacteria phenotypically capable of growing in the presence of the fed antibiotics. Performance results from both studies revealed no adverse effect (p > 0.05) of chlorophyllin, antibiotic or their combined supplementation on average daily feed intake or average daily gain, although the daily fed intake tended to be lower (p = 0.053) for pigs fed diets supplemented with tylosin than those fed diets without tylosin. The results from trial 1 showed that the ASP 250-medicated diets, whether without or with chlorophyllin supplementation, supported higher (p < 0.05) fecal E. coli populations than the non-medicated diets. Enterococcal populations, however, were lower, albeit marginally and not necessarily significantly, in feces from pigs fed the ASP 250-medicated diet than those fed the non-medicated diet. Results from trial 2 likewise revealed an increase (p < 0.05) in E. coli and, to a lesser extent, enterococcal populations in feces collected from pigs fed the tylosin-medicated diet compared with those fed the non-medicated diet. Evidence indicated that the E. coli and enterococcal populations in trial 1 were generally insensitive to penicillin or chlortetracycline, as there were no differences between populations recovered without or with antibiotic selection. Conversely, a treatment x day of treatment interaction observed in trial 2 (p < 0.
   05) provided evidence, albeit slight, of an enrichment of tylosin-insensitive enterococci in feces from the pigs fed the tylosin-medicated but not the non-medicated diet. Under the conditions of the present study, it is unlikely that chlorophyllin-derived efflux pump inhibitors potentially present in the chlorophyllin-fed pigs were able to enhance the efficacy of the available antibiotics. However, further research specifically designed to optimize chlorophyll administration could potentially lead to practical applications for the swine industry.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the effect of varying levels of dietary protein on digestion, metabolism, serum biochemical indexes, and rumen microflora in Lanzhou fat-tailed sheep. A total of twenty 8-month-old healthy rams with an initial average body weight (BW 25.16 +/- 1.09 kg) were selected and randomly divided into four dietary treatments with different protein levels P: 9.47%, MP: 10.53%, HP: 11.56%, and EHP: 12.61%. The rams underwent a 23 day adaptation period, and the experiment was conducted for 7 d. The results showed that with increased dietary protein levels, the apparent digestibility of dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), acid detergent fiber (ADF), and urine energy significantly increased (p < 0.05), increasing by 8.65%, 7.31%, 6.22%, and 0.1%, respectively. In contrast, the digestibility of neutral detergent fiber (NDF) first increased and then plateaued with the increase in protein levels, and the digestibility of NDF in the HP group was the highest (p < 0.05). The Shannon, Simpson, Chao1, and Ace indices of rumen microorganisms in the four groups did not change significantly (p > 0.05). Additionally, at the phylum level, the relative abundance of Bacteroidota, Firmicutes, and Verrucomicrobiota collectively accounted for over 91% of the total phylum composition. At the genus level, there was an increase in the relative abundance of uncultured_rumen_bacterium and Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group in the LP group, whereas the relative abundance of Prevotella decreased. In comparison to the other three groups, the HP group exhibited an increase in the relative abundance of Firmicutes. In summary, dietary protein level had no significant effects on the rumen microflora structure and blood biochemical indexes. However, diets with a high protein level can improve the apparent digestibility of nutrients and energy use efficiency of Lanzhou fat-tailed sheep.

AB  - This study quantifies the exposure of agricultural land in Aotearoa-New Zealand's (A-NZ) flood hazard zones (FHZs). We developed a spatio-temporal flood exposure framework to quantify the extent of the area and yearly earnings before income and tax (EBIT) for arable, forestry, horticulture, sheep and beef, and dairy land in FHZs between 1990 and 2016. In 1990, ~1.57 million hectares of agricultural land were exposed, decreasing slightly to ~1.50 million hectares by 2016. However, there was a change in the lower-value types of agricultural land uses being exposed, such as for sheep and beef farming and forestry, toward dairy farming (from ~364,000 hectares in FHZs in 2008 to ~471,000 hectares in 2016). Dairy farming is more intensively staffed with larger amounts of fixed assets, making them less resilient to flood impacts. Despite this, conversion to dairy farming even within the identified FHZs has been driven by the increasing profitability of the enterprise. As a result of both the production value change and land area increases, the dairy EBIT values within FHZs rose rapidly from NZD 382 million to NZD 1.25 billion between 2008 and 2012, creating significantly more economic exposure for A-NZ. This trend is particularly evident in the Southland, Canterbury, and Waikato regions. Similarly, in the Marlborough, Tasman, and Hawke's Bay regions, there was an increase in high-value horticultural land-predominantly viticulture-in FHZs (a increase of NZD 321 million in annual EBIT for exposed horticulture across the three regions). Identifying sub-national trends in agricultural flood exposure allows for a detailed analysis of the likely impacts in high-risk areas, which can inform emergency management plans and mitigative actions that diminish the economic impacts from flood events.

AB  - Aim of study: To assess the effects of rearing system (extensive, ES; semi-extensive, SES) and feeds (grazed woodland, acorns, chestnuts, compound feed) on the performance, carcass traits and energetic balance of autochthonous Gochu Asturcelta pigs.
   Area of study: Asturias (Spain).
   Material and methods: In two successive years, a total of 58 immunocastrated Gochu Asturcelta pigs (25 females, 33 males), with an initial weight of 93.39 +/- 3.36 kg and mean age of 6.82 +/- 0.24 months, were randomly divided between ES and SES plots from July to December. ES pigs grazed woodland, acorns (Quercus robur L.) and chestnuts (Castanea sativa Mill.) and they were given additionally 1.5 kg compound-feed/pig.day. SES animals received only 2.5 kg compound-feed/pig.day. Chemical composition and metabolizable energy (ME) of feeds, energetic balance, growth performances and pig carcass traits were analysed.
   Main results: Acorns and chestnuts were both very close in their chemical composition, except for the polyphenol content and profile, and had a lower omega-6/omega-3 ratio than compound feeds. Live weight for the ES pigs was 25% lower and carcass weight 30% lower than for SES pigs (p<0.001). Total ME requirement (MJ/day) was lower in ES than in SES pigs.
   Research highlights: The productive and carcass parameters observed are a consequence of a lower energy intake for pigs in ES than in SES, it being necessary to drastically reduce the stocking rate to increase weight gain and to improve carcass traits when Gochu Asturcelta pigs are reared in ES.

AB  - The monophyletic Afro-Palaearctic clade of the horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus) comprises several species groups whose representatives can be morphologically similar to each other across groups. The only Rhinolophus species that occurs in Lesotho was traditionally attributed to the broadly distributed African desert- and savanna-dwelling bat, Rhinolophus clivosus, a member of the ferrumequinum group. In this study, we investigated the horseshoe bats from Lesotho with the help of molecular genetic and morphometric analyses to find their position within the group and the clade as well. The genetic analysis resulted in phylogenetic trees with two different topologies, although in both trees the Lesotho bats were a part of the fumigatus group instead of the ferrumequinum group. In the mitochondrial tree, the Lesotho bats were mixed with Rhinolophus damarensis. On the contrary, the Lesotho bats formed a single distinct lineage on the nuclear tree, closely related to Rhinolophus darlingi, R. fumigatus, and R. damarensis (in a single lineage each). These results indicate introgressions of mtDNA from the Lesotho bats to R. damarensis. Morphologically, the Lesotho bats grouped distinctly from other species of the fumigatus and ferrumequinum groups. We thus consider the Lesotho horseshoe bats to be a new separate species that is here described.

AB  - To investigate the efficiency of psychrotrophic cellulose-degrading fungal strains (PCDFSs) and estrogendegrading bacteria (EDBs) combined with humic acid (HA) on estrone (E1) and 17-0-estradiol (E2) degradation, five compost groups (T, HA, EDB, PCDFS, and CK) were prepared and composted for 32 days at 11-14 degrees C. The results indicated that inoculation increased the temperature to 62.2 degrees C and promoted E1 degradation to the lowest level of 100.1 ng/kg, while E2 was undetected from day 16. Metagenomic analysis revealed that inoculation altered the microbial community structure by increasing the abundance of cellulose-degrading fungi, especially Meyerozyma (16.7%) (among PCDFSs), and of estrogen-degrading bacteria, particularly Microbacterium (13.4%) (involved in EDBs). Moreover, inoculation increased the levels ( 0.500%) of Gene Ontology (GO) associated with estrogen degradation, like 3-0-hydroxy-delta 5-steroid dehydrogenase and monooxygenase. Redundancy analysis demonstrated that temperature and Microbacterium were positively correlated with estrogen degradation. Structural equation model indicated that temperature and estrogen-degrading bacterial genera exhibited positive, significant (p < 0.001) and direct impacts on estrogen degradation. This is the first study to suggest that applying microbial inoculants and HA could accelerate estrogen degradation during composting in cold regions. The research outcomes offer a practical reference for managing compost safety, thereby decreasing its potential environmental and human health impacts.

AB  - In the present study, the mechanism and behavior of heavy metals passivation during the anaerobic fermentation of pig manure mixed with pretreated straw were investigated. The results showed that the alkali-treated straw enhanced the passivation rates of Cu and Zn. The anaerobic fermentation process could promote the migration of heavy metals into the biogas slurry, while the pretreated straw significantly reduced the heavy metals migration rate due to its enhanced adsorption properties. Microbial activity during anaerobic fermentation was the main factor in the passivation of heavy metals. The highest microbial activity and the best passivation effect were found in the alkali-treated group, accompanied by the percentages of residual states of Cu and Zn increasing by 14.95% and 6.45%, respectively. In addition, a significant correlation between humic acid-like substances and Cu forms was observed. The pretreated straw significantly increased the humic acid-like substances in the biogas slurry and decreased the exchangeable state and bioavailability contents of Cu. The findings suggested that straw pretreatment could reduce the potential for heavy metals release during anaerobic fermentation.

AB  - A potential alternative to the use of chemicals for controlling phytophagous arthropods in agricultural environments is the use of biological control agents of natural occurrence. This study evaluated the functional response of first-instar larvae of Chrysoperla externa-fed eggs and nymphs of Aleurodicus cocois, as well as the olfactory response of the third-instar larvae of this predator to the volatiles of two genotypes (CCP 76 and PRO 143/7) of dwarf cashew induced by the herbivory of A. cocois. The volatile compounds emitted by the leaves of the two cashew genotypes, infested and non-infested by A. cocois, were analyzed by solid-phase microextraction coupled to GC-MS. Logistic regression indicated that first-instar larvae of C. externa exhibited a type II response when fed eggs and nymphs of A. cocois. The value of the attack rate (a') did not differ between prey, but the handling time (Th) was longer when the predator fed on nymphs. In the behavioral tests third-instar larvae of C. externa were able to distinguish and select the volatile signals emitted after the infestation of A. cocois, regardless of the cashew genotype evaluated. According to the volatile profiles of cashew genotypes infested by A. cocois, the compounds beta-caryophyllene, allo-ocimene, neo-allo-ocimene, alpha-copaene, gamma-muurolene, and delta-cadinene were released in large amounts by genotypes CCP 76 and PRO 143/7. Therefore, these compounds may be involved in the attractiveness of the predator. The results indicate that C. externa may be an effective biocontrol agent of A. cocois in cashew crop.

AB  - Nematodes are the most significant in terms of prevalence and negative impact on animal health and production. Poor growth, lower productivity, death, and huge economic losses are consequences of their impact. This study aims to determine the relationship between the gastrointestinal parasite and growth performance of male and female Saanen goats fed with Pak Chong Napier supplemented with Azolla microphylla. The study was conducted at Kaprima Hulu Seladang Valley Farm in Setiu, Terengganu. 12 male and 12 female Saanen goats were fed with four different feeding treatment formulations. The feeding treatments that were used were Control (100% Pak Chong Napier), T1 (90% Pak Chong Napier + 10% A. microphylla), T2 (80% Pak Chong Napier + 20% A. microphylla), and T3 (70% Pak Chong Napier + 30% A. microphylla). Each feeding treatment was allocated to three goats with similar body weights and the feeding period was conducted for three weeks. The initial and final body weight and faecal egg count of the goats were measured before and after the feeding treatment. Results show that T2 contributes to the highest percentage reduction of faecal egg count by 38.46% and the highest average daily gain is 0.25 +/- 0.01 kg in male Saanen goats. Meanwhile, T1 contributes to the highest percentage reduction of faecal egg count by 32.67% and the highest average daily gain is 0.48 +/- 0.05 kg in female Saanen goats. In conclusion, it can be stated that the feeding treatment using Pak Chong Napier supplemented with A. microphylla could be able to reduce the presence of gastrointestinal parasites as well as increase the growth performance of female and male Saanen goats.

AB  - Fat deposition is a significant economic trait in livestock animals. Adipose tissues (ATs) developed in subcutaneous and visceral depots are considered waste whereas those within muscle are highly valued. In river buffaloes, lipogenesis is highly active in subcutaneous (especially in the sternum subcutaneous) and visceral depots but not in muscle tissue. Revealing the features and functions of ATs in different depots is significant for the regulation of their development. Here, we characterize the cell size, composition, and function of six AT depots in river buffaloes. Our data support that the subcutaneous AT depots have a larger cell size than visceral AT depots, and the subcutaneous AT depots, especially the sternum subcutaneous AT, are mainly associated with the extracellular matrix whereas the visceral AT depots are mainly associated with immunity. We found that sternum subcutaneous AT is significantly different from ATs in other depots, due to the high unsaturated fatty acid content and the significant association with metabolic protection. The perirenal AT is more active in FA oxidation for energy supply. In addition, the expression of HOX paralogs supports the variable origins of ATs in different depots, indicating that the development of ATs in different depots is mediated by their progenitor cells.

AB  - PurposeThe objective of this work was to quantify and understand the impacts of intensive pig production at family-farm level. A case study from the west of Santa Catarina State was used to identify adverse issues (hotspots) of pig production by integrating the assessment of the environmental, economic, and social aspects of the system. The quantitative and qualitative indicators calculated can guide and support the decision-making processes for a variety of stakeholders and actors.MethodsThe environmental performance of the pig production system was assessed from cradle-to-farm gate using environmental Life Cycle Assessment methodology set out in ISO 14040 (ISO 2006a). The functional unit (FU) was 1 kg of Liveweight (kg-LW). The structure of the Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA) was based on Neugebauer et al. (J Clean Prod 102:165-176, 2015) and Chen and Holden (J Clean Prod 172:1169-1179, 2018), who proposed a tiered framework to evaluate the impacts on the environmental, social, and financial aspects of a product. The economic dimension or Life Cycle Cost (Hunkeler et al. in Environmental life cycle costing. Crc Press, London, 2008) focused on farm-level activities. The social impact was calculated based on the UNEP/SETAC (2009) guidelines.Results and discussionThe environmental performance of the finishing pig production was slightly lower than reference value for climate impacts, acidification, and eutrophication. The economic impacts tended to be positive, reflecting the efforts of the farmer and employee to maintain high productivity and reduce the number of pig losses in comparison with the reference values. However, this effort did not result in greater profitability, causing low farm income. The impacts of low profitability were not transferred to the employee since the wage were above the reference value. There is a need for more education for small farmers, which is known to have a positive correlation with the adoption of new technologies, thus reducing adverse environmental and social impacts and increasing economic return.ConclusionsThe interaction of social and economic factors suggests it is unlikely that the farm can achieve better environmental performance. The limited economic return and low level of education have a negative impact on the farmer's capacity to adopt new technologies to improve environmental outcomes. The use of LCSA, based on a consistent model across the three aspects of sustainability, made it possible to understand the interaction of these factors.

AB  - Interactions between parasitoids and herbivore hosts are complex as parasitism affects multiple components of host behavior and fitness through both consumptive and non-consumptive effects. Understanding how these multiple effects unfold is especially important in applied systems where parasitoids play a role in biological control. In lab-based experiments, we manipulated parasitism in striped cucumber beetles, Acalymma vittatum (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), a major pest of cucurbits in North America, using Celatoria setosa (Diptera: Tachinidae) to assess how parasitism affected multiple components of male and female fitness, including survival, herbivory, oviposition, and reproductive signaling through the emission of vittatalactone, a male-specific aggregation pheromone. In follow-up experiments, we investigated the potential non-consumptive effects of parasitoids on these metrics by exposing beetles to arenas with or without parasitoids. Parasitized female beetles experienced a 4-fold increase in mortality, consumed 49.6% less leaf tissue, and were less likely to oviposit eggs compared to non-parasitized control females. In addition, parasitized males in small groups emitted 52.5% less vittatalactone than non-parasitized control males. Lastly, we found some evidence of non-consumptive effects of parasitoids in which individual females and groups of males, exposure to parasitoids resulted in reduced foliar damage. Our findings highlight broad effects of tachinid parasitoids in a common pest and point to multiple mechanisms for reduced pest performance.

AB  - A series of changes occur in the early embryo that are critical for subsequent development, and the pig is an excellent animal model of human disease, so understanding the regulatory mechanisms of early embryonic development in the pig is of very importance. To find key transcription factors regulating pig early embryonic development, we first profiled the transcriptome of pig early embryos, and confirmed that zygotic gene activation (ZGA) in porcine embryos starts from 4 cell stage. Subsequent enrichment analysis of up-regulated gene motifs during ZGA revealed that the transcription factor ELK1 ranked first. The expression pattern of ELK1 in porcine early embryos was analyzed by immunofluorescence staining and qPCR, and the results showed that the transcript level of ELK1 reached the highest at the 8 cell stage, while the protein level reached the highest at 4 cell stage. To further investigate the effect of ELK1 on early embryo development in pigs, we silenced ELK1 in zygotes and showed that ELK1 silencing significantly reduced cleavage rate, blastocyst rate as well as blastocyst quality. A significant decrease in the expression of the pluripotency gene Oct4 was also observed in blastocysts from the ELK1 silenced group by immunofluorescence staining. Silencing of ELK1 also resulted in decreased H3K9Ac modifica-tion and increased H3K9me3 modification at 4 cell stage. To investigate the effect of ELK1 on ZGA, we analyzed transcriptome changes in 4 cell embryos after ELK1 silencing by RNA seq, which revealed that ELK1 silencing resulted in significant differences in the expression of a total of 1953 genes at the 4 cell stage compared with their normal counterparts, including 1106 genes that were significantly upregu-lated and 847 genes that were significantly downregulated. Through GO and KEGG enrichment, we found that the functions and pathways of down-regulated genes were concentrated in protein synthesis, processing, cell cycle regulation, etc., while the functions of up-regulated genes were focused on aerobic respiration process. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the transcription factor ELK1 plays an important role in regulation of preimplantation embryo development of pigs and deficiency of ELK1 leads to abnormal epigenetic reprogramming as well as zygotic genome activation, thus adversely affecting embryonic development. This study will provide important reference for the regulation of transcription factors in porcine embryo development.(c) 2023 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Simple Summary The price of feed ingredients has been drastically increasing over the last decade, and thus the methods for improving nutrient digestibility and utilization with various feed ingredients have been widely studied in the field of the swine industry. One of the most efficacious approaches to enhancing nutrient digestibility and utilization is the manipulation of feed particle size. Nonetheless, limited research has been conducted on the impact of varying particle sizes of feeds with high fiber content. Dietary fiber is composed of several components, including & beta;-glucan, arabinoxylan, and cellulose, which exhibit distinct physiological effects on the small and large intestines. The compositions and proportions of these components can influence and modulate nutrient digestibility in the small and large intestines of pigs. The objective of the present investigation was to examine the potential for enhanced nutrient and fiber digestibility in growing pigs through the reduction of particle size in barley and wheat diets. Similar ileal and total nutrient digestibility were observed in pigs fed diets containing fine and coarse wheat; however, pigs consuming coarse barley exhibited reduced nutrient digestibility compared to the other diets. Consequently, the present study shows that nutrient digestibility was more influenced by reduced particle size in barley than wheat, most likely because of the rigid fiber structure of barley and barley hull. The objective of this investigation was to study the effects of different cereal types, barley and wheat, with different particle sizes (PS) on the recovery of ileal digesta and fecal excretion, digestion of nutrients and fiber components, mean transit time (MTT), and short-chain fatty acid content and composition in growing pigs studied in two experiments. Five barrows with ileal cannulas (initial BW 35.9 & PLUSMN; 1.5 kg) in Experiment 1 and thirty-two castrated pigs (30.8 & PLUSMN; 1.3 kg) in Experiment 2 were fed four different diets: barley fine, barley coarse, wheat fine and wheat coarse diets. The cereal type and PS did not influence the relative weight of the small and large intestines and pH of digesta, whereas MTT in the large intestine of pigs fed the coarse barley diet was lower compared to pigs fed other diets (p < 0.05). Pigs fed the coarse barley diet had lower apparent ileal digestibility (AID) and apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of nutrients and fiber (p < 0.05), whereas pigs fed the fine barley diet had similar AID and ATTD to pigs fed wheat fine and coarse diets (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the barley diet was more influenced by PS in comparison to wheat, thereby inducing lower AID and ATTD of nutrient.

AB  - Pinus is a genus of great economic and ecological importance, and its members are dominant components of forests throughout the world. During the long evolutionary "arms race," plants have developed complex and diverse systemic defense mechanisms to strategically and intelligently compete with herbivores. To study the alteration pattern and defensive response mechanism triggered by herbivorous feeding stimuli, we firstly built a biological model of the interrelationship between the Chinese pine (Pinus tabuliformis Carr.) and the Chinese pine caterpillar (Dendrolimus tabulaeformis Tsai et Liu). This model integrated proteomic and phosphoproteomic data, which were then normalized and combined with bioinformatics tools to evaluate and analyze changes in the phosphoproteomic profile in response to the caterpillar's feeding stimulus on pine needles. Systematic identification of differentially significant phosphorylated proteins implicated in the pine's defense mechanism against caterpillar stress was conducted. Furthermore, we predicted upstream kinases of phosphorylation sites and their activities. Through an analysis of Motif patterns of phosphorylated proteins, Mfuzz clustering of phosphorylation sites, and kinase regulatory networks, we explored the functional modules of phosphorylated protein interaction networks in response to stress within pine. In general, our study emphasized the significant role of kinase METK2, PTI12, PGK, as well as At3g59480 for the first time. The identification of these phosphorylated proteins was additionally confirmed through parallel reaction monitoring technology. Furthermore, genes associated with differentially expressed proteins were validated through real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction detection. This investigation aids in understanding the mechanisms behind resistance formation and regulation of caterpillar feeding incentives in pine. Breeding more resistant pine varieties may benefit from a fuller understanding of these defense strategies in the future.

AB  - Co-pyrolysis behaviors of peanut shells (PS) and tea plant branches (TPB) were explored with a focus on the physicochemical properties, thermal degradation behavior, synergistic effect, and thermo-kinetic analyses. The differences between individual biomass and the equivalent blend were also highlighted. Results showed that the blend sample showed an enhancement in fixed carbon content but a reduction in moisture and ash contents, when compared to those of the individual PS. The average activation energies (Ea) of the equivalent blend estimated by three isoconversional methods (i.e., Friedman, KAS, and Starink methods) were 181.65, 166.87, and 167.14 kJ/mol, respectively. The average Ea and Delta H of the blend were quite lower than those of the TPB but slightly higher than those of the PS. During pyrolysis, Delta H and Delta G exhibited positive values which showed the decomposition was endothermic and non-spontaneous. Negative Delta S values were first observed, followed by positive Delta S values at late conversion stage.

AB  - Phyllosphere-associated microbes play a crucial role in plant-pathogen interactions while their composition and diversity are strongly influenced by drought stress. As dioecious plant species exhibited secondary dimorphism between the two sexes in response to drought stress, whether such difference will lead to sex-specific differences in phyllosphere microbiome and associated pathogen resistance between male and female conspecifics is still unknown. In this study, we subjected female and male full siblings of a dioecious poplar species to a short period of drought treatment followed by artificial infection of a leaf pathogenic fungus. Our results showed that male plants grew better than females with or without drought stress. Female control plants had more leaf lesion area than males after pathogen infection, whereas drought stress reversed such a difference. Further correlation and in vitro toxicity tests suggested that drought-mediated sexual differences in pathogen resistance between the two plant sexes could be attributed to the shifts in structure and function of phyllosphere-associated microbiome rather than the amount of leaf main defensive chemicals contained in plant leaves. Supportively, the microbiome analysis through high-throughput sequencing indicated that female phyllosphere enriched a higher abundance of ecologically beneficial microbes that serve as biological plant protectants, while males harbored abundant phytopathogens under drought-stressed conditions. The results could provide potential implications for the selection of suitable poplar sex to plants in drought or semi-drought habitats.

AB  - Construction using timber has seen a resurgence in light of global climate mitigation policies. Wood is a renewable resource, and engineered wood products are proving to be competitive against concrete and steel while having several advantages. However, while the renewable nature of wood in construction is a beneficial property for climate mitigation policies, the process of biodegradation introduces a challenge for service life planning. A review of hazard mapping is presented while developing contemporary hazard maps, occurrence maps and projected hazard maps for 2050 using representative concentration pathways (RCP) 2.6 and 8.5. The risk of timber decay is expected to increase in most of Europe as the temperatures rise, with a decrease expected in dryer regions. Termites are likely to experience a range expansion as more areas become suitable, while human activity and an increase in extreme weather events like floods are expected to facilitate dispersion. Marine borer species already present a risk in most European coastal regions; however, the effect of changes in water temperatures are likely to shift the boundaries for individual borer species. Overall, warmer climates are expected to increase the metabolic activity of all of these organisms leading to a general reduction in service life.

AB  - The waters near the Antarctic Peninsula have always been a study hot spot because of their variable and unique oceanographic conditions. To determine the distribution and possible influencing factors on phytoplankton size and abundance near the Antarctic Peninsula, a large-scale survey was conducted during the austral summer of 2018. Samples were collected in 27 stations located in the Drake Passage (DP), South Shetland Islands (SSI), and South Orkney Islands (SOI). Phytoplankton communities were described using chlorophyll a (Chl a), flow cytometry and light microscopy to cover a size range from pico- to microphytoplankton. Nanophytoplankton, especially small nanophytoplankton (2-6 mu m) with abundance ranging from 0.66 x 10(3) cells/mL to 8.46 x 10(3) cells/mL, was predominant throughout the study area. Among different regions, there was an obvious size shift. The proportion of picophytoplankton near the Elephant Island (EI) and DP was higher than other regions, and larger cells were found mainly in east of SOI. The distribution of phytoplankton abundance detected by flow cytometry was not completely consistent with Chl a concentrations due to the contribution of larger cells to Chl a. Possible influencing factors on the phytoplankton size distribution were discussed. The properties of water masses such as temperature and salinity can influence the phytoplankton size distribution. Correlation analysis revealed that only picophytoplankton is significantly correlated with salinity. Light and Fe availability might affect phytoplankton abundance and size distribution especially near the waters of SSI and EI in this study. It was also speculated that the abundance of cryptophytes is possibly related to ice melting.

AB  - Animals respond to inherently rewarding or punishing stimuli with changes in core affective states, which can be investigated with the aid of appropriate biomarkers. In this study we evaluate salivary cortisol (sCORT) and salivary oxytocin (sOXT) concentrations under baseline conditions and in response to two negatively- and two positively-valenced social challenges in 75 young pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus), housed and tested in eight social groups. We predicted that: (1) Relative to baseline, weaning and brief social isolation would be associated with increases in sCORT, due to psychosocial stress, and reductions in sOXT, due to a lack of opportunities for social support; and (2) Opportunities for social play, and reunions with group members after a separation would be associated with weaker sCORT responses, and increases in sOXT concentrations compared to baseline and to negative social challenges. Testing and sample collection occurred between 28 and 65 days of age and involved a within-subject design, in which every subject was sampled multiple times in neutral (baseline), negative and positive social contexts. We also recorded behavioral data and measured rates of agonism, play and affiliative interactions in the different contexts, prior to saliva sampling. As expected, negative social challenges were associated with robust cortisol responses. Relative to baseline, pigs also had higher sCORT responses to positive social challenges, although these differences were only significant during reunions. Salivary oxytocin concentrations did not differ between the different social conditions, although sOXT was lowest during the brief social isolation. Behavioral analyses confirmed predictions about the expected changes in social interactions in different social contexts, with increases in agonism following weaning, increases in coordinated locomotor play in the play context and high rates of affiliative interactions during reunions. Relative sCORT reactivity to different contexts may reflect the intensity of emotional responses, with greater increases occurring in response to challenges that involve more psychosocial stress. Our results suggest that sOXT is not a reliable indicator of emotional valence in pigs, although more research is needed to characterize sOXT responses to various challenges with and without access to social support.

AB  - Simple Summary Since antibiotics are banned in animal feed in many countries, probiotics have received more attention as reliable alternatives. We mainly study the effect of adding Lactobacillus plantarum BG0001 on the performance of weaned piglets for 42 days. The results: weaning pigs fed diet supplementation with L. plantarum BG0001 significantly improved the growth performance and fecal microbiota, and achieved similar effects as antibiotic growth promoters. Therefore, we consider that L. plantarum BG0001 will have a good role in replacing antibiotic growth promoters in swine feed. It can bring potentially huge economic income to the animal husbandry industry. A total of 180, 4-week-old crossbred weaning piglets ((Yorkshire x Landrace) x Duroc; 6.67 +/- 1.40 kg) were used in a 42 day experiment to evaluate the effect of dietary probiotics (Lactobacillus plantarum BG0001) on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, blood profile, fecal microbiota, and noxious gas emission. All pigs were randomly allotted to one of four treatment diets in a completely randomized block design. Each treatment had nine replicates with five pigs/pen (mixed sex) Designated dietary treatments were as: (1) basal diet (NC), (2) NC + 0.2% antibiotics (chlortetracycline) (PC), (3) NC + 0.1% L. plantarum BG0001 (Lactobacillus plantarum BG0001) (NC1), (4) NC + 0.2% L. plantarum BG0001 (NC2). On d 42, BW and G:F were lower (p < 0.05) in pigs fed NC diet compared with PC diet and probiotic diets. Throughout this experiment, the average daily gain increased (p < 0.05) in pigs when fed with PC and probiotic diets than the NC diet. The average daily feed intake was higher (p < 0.05) in pigs fed PC diet during day 0-7 and 22-42, and probiotic diets during day 0-7 compared with NC diet, respectively. The Lactobacillus count was increased and Escherichia coli count was decreased (p < 0.05) in the fecal microbiota of pigs fed probiotic diets, and E. coli were decreased (p < 0.05) when fed a PC diet compared with the NC diet on day 21. Moreover, the apparent total tract nutrient digestibility, blood profile, and the concentration of noxious gas emission had no negative effects by the probiotic treatments. In conclusion, dietary supplementation with L. plantarum BG0001 significantly improved the growth performance, increased fecal Lactobacillus, and decreased E. coli counts in weaning pigs.

AB  - In brief The CD40 ligand-CD40 signaling system expressed at the maternal-conceptus interface in pigs is involved in regulating maternal immunity by modifying endometrial endothelial cell function during early pregnancy. This paper reveals the role of CD40 ligand-CD40 signaling at the maternal-conceptus interface in pigs.Abstract To successfully establish and maintain pregnancy in pigs, a variety of factors must work together at the maternal-conceptus interface to form an immune environment appropriate for both the mother and the conceptus. Our transcriptomics study has shown that cluster of differentiation ligand 40 (CD40L) and its receptor CD40, which are known to play important roles in regulating cell- and antibody-mediated immunity, are expressed in the endometrium during early pregnancy. However, the roles of the CD40L and CD40 signaling system are not well understood. Therefore, we determined the expression, regulation and function of CD40L and CD40 at the maternal-conceptus interface in pigs. The endometrium expressed CD40L and CD40 mRNAs at the greatest levels on day 15 of pregnancy. The CD40L protein was localized predominantly to luminal epithelial cells on day 15 of pregnancy, and the CD40 protein was found in luminal epithelial, stromal and vascular endothelial cells in the endometrium during pregnancy. During early pregnancy, the conceptus expressed CD40 but not CD40L and chorioallantoic tissues during mid- to late pregnancy expressed both CD40L and CD40. Interferon-gamma increased the expression of CD40L and CD40 in endometrial explants. CD40L increased the migration but not the proliferation of cultured porcine uterine endothelial (pENDO) cells in vitro. In addition, CD40L affected the expression of genes related to angiogenesis, cell adhesion, chemokines and immunity in pENDO cells. These results suggest that the CD40L-CD40 system might play an important role in the establishment of pregnancy in pigs by regulating endometrial endothelial cell function during the implantation period.

AB  - Simple Summary Enterocytozoon bieneusi is one of the most common parasites in human and animals, and a threat to public health. So far, no data are available for E. bieneusi prevalence and genotypes in black goats in Yunnan Province, Southwestern China. Therefore, the objective of this study was to detect the prevalence and genotypes of E. bieneusi by examining 907 fecal samples collected from 5 counties in Yunnan Province. Ninety-three fecal samples (10.3%) were E. bieneusi-positive by PCR amplification. Four new genotypes and 11 known genotypes were identified, and all genotypes considered to be the zoonotic potential. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all of these genotypes were allocated into the zoonotic groups of E. bieneusi indicating its zoonotic potential. These results indicated that effective strategies and measures must be taken to prevent and control E. bieneusi transmission to other animals and humans. Enterocytozoon bieneusi is a fungus-like protist that can parasitize in the intestines of humans and various animals causing a threat to public health. However, there has been no data for E. bieneusi prevalence and genotypes in black goats in Yunnan Province, Southwestern China. In this study, 907 fecal samples were collected from black goats in 5 counties from Yunnan Province. The prevalence and genotypes of E. bieneusi were examined by nested PCR amplification targeting the nuclear internal transcribed spacer (ITS). Multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) was used to further examine the potential occurrence of genetic segregation. The overall prevalence of E. bieneusi in black goats in Yunnan Province was 10.3% (93/907). Statistical analysis revealed that E. bieneusi prevalence was significantly associated with the region, age and gender of black goats (p < 0.001). Four new genotypes (CYG-1, CYG-2, CYG-3, CYG-4) and 11 known genotypes (CHG1, CHG2, CHG3, CHG5, CHG28, J, D, BEB6, Wildboar3, CD6, SDD1) of E. bieneusi were identified. At the microsatellite and minisatellite loci, 15, 2, 17, and 33 sequences were obtained, respectively, forming one new multi-locus genotype (MLG27). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all 15 genotypes were clustered into group 1 and group 2, with zoonotic potential. This is the first report of E. bieneusi prevalence and genotypes in black goats in Yunnan Province, China. Effective control strategies and measures should be taken to reduce the risk of E. bieneusi transmission between black goats, other animals, and humans.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of taurine on skeletal muscle glycolysis in pigs. The results showed that dietary supplementation of taurine significantly reduced the activities of hexokinase (HK), phosphofructose kinase (PFK), and pyruvate kinase (PK) in finishing pigs. Meanwhile, taurine reduced the protein and mRNA expression levels of hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) and the mRNA expression of glycolytic enzyme related genes (such as HK type II, HK II; pyruvate kinase M2, PKM2; lactate dehydrogenase A, LDHA). In addition, taurine reduced the expression of HIF-1 alpha, lactate content, and the expression of glycolysis related genes in porcine myotubes. These results suggest that taurine may regulate glycolysis in skeletal muscle of finishing pigs through the HIF-1 alpha signaling pathway. To further investigate the mechanism by which taurine affects skeletal glycolysis, HIF-1 alpha activator dimethyloxalyl glycine (DMOG) was used to treat porcine myotubes, our results showed that DMOG significantly increased the protein and mRNA expression levels of HIF-1 alpha, lactate content, and glycolytic enzyme (HK, PFK, PK, and LDH) activity, but taurine treatment significantly inhibited this effect. Taken together, these results of in vivo and in vitro experiments revealed that taurine reduces skeletal muscle glycolysis by inhibiting HIF-1 alpha signaling.

   Since the widespread adoption of Bt cotton in the late 1990s, the green mirid bug, Apolygus lucorum (Hemiptera: Miridae), has become one of the most important pests in cotton fields and some other crops. To manage this destructive pest, Peristenus spretus (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) has been tested in augmentative biological control. In this study, after cotton plants were damaged by different densities of A. lucorum, the behavioral responses of A. lucorum and P. spretus to cotton plants volatiles were evaluated, and the quality and quantity of volatiles from cotton plants were analyzed. The results demonstrated that HIPVs emitted by plants in response to A. lucorum could be influenced by the pest density and could be identified by P. spretus as a signal of the host. Our results would help understand how P. spretus plays a role in biological control against A. lucorum.
   Plants would release herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) to repel herbivores and attract natural enemies after being damaged by herbivores. In this study, after cotton plants were damaged by different densities of Apolygus lucorum, the behavioral responses of A. lucorum and Peristenus spretus to cotton plants volatiles were evaluated, and the quality and quantity of volatiles from cotton plants were analyzed. Only when cotton plants were damaged by four bugs did both A. lucorum and P. spretus show an obvious response to damaged cotton plants, which indicates that cotton defense is correlated with pest density. The collection and analysis of volatiles reveals that the increase in pest density results in the emission of new compounds and an increase in the total number of volatiles with an alteration in proportions among the compounds in the blend. These changes in volatile profiles might provide wasps and mirids with specific information on host habitat quality and thus could explain the behavioral responses of parasitoids and pests.

AB  - Background: Deer antlers are the only known mammalian structure that undergoes full regeneration. In addition, it is peculiar because when growing, it contains vascularized cartilage. The differentiation of antler stem cells (ASCs) into chondrocytes while inducing endochondral extension of blood vessels is necessary to form antler vascularized cartilage. Therefore, antlers provide an unparalleled opportunity to investigate chondrogenesis, angiogenesis, and regenerative medicine. A study found that Galectin-1 (GAL-1), which can be used as a marker in some tumors, is highly expressed in ASCs. This intrigued us to investigate what role GAL-1 could play in antler regeneration.
   Methods: We measured the expression level of GAL-1 in antler tissues and cells by immunohistochemistry, WB and QPCR. We constructed antlerogenic periosteal cells (APCs, one cell type of ASCs) with the GAL-1 gene knocked out (APC(GAL-1-/-)) using CRISPR-CAS9 gene editing system. The effect of GAL-1 on angiogenesis was determined by stimulating human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) using APC(GAL-1-/-) conditioned medium or adding exogenous deer GAL-1 protein. The effect of APC(GAL-1-/-) on chondrogenic differentiation was evaluated compared with the APCs under micro-mass culture. The gene expression pattern of APC(GAL-1-/-) was analyzed by transcriptome sequencing.
   Results: Immunohistochemistry revealed that GAL-1 was widely expressed in the antlerogenic periosteum (AP), pedicle periosteum (PP) and antler growth center. Western blot and qRT-PCR analysis using deer cell lines further supports this result. The proliferation, migration, and tube formation assays of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) showed that the proangiogenic activity of APC(GAL-1-/-) medium was significantly decreased (P < 0.05) compared with the APCs medium. The proangiogenic activity of deer GAL-1 protein was further confirmed by adding exogenous deer GAL-1 protein (P < 0.05). The chondrogenic differentiation ability of APC(GAL-1-/-) was impeded under micro-mass culture. The terms of GO and KEGG enrichment of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of APC(GAL-1-/-) showed that down-regulated expression of pathways associated with deer antler angiogenesis, osteogenesis and stem cell pluripotency, such as the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, signaling pathways regulating pluripotency of stem cells and TGF-beta signaling pathway.
   Conclusions: Deer GAL-1, has strong angiogenic activity, is widely and highly expressed in deer antler. The APCs can induce angiogenesis by secreting GAL-1. The knockout of GAL-1 gene of APCs damaged its ability to induce angiogenesis and differentiate into chondrocytes. This ability is crucial to the formation of deer antler vascularized cartilage. Moreover, Deer antlers offer a unique model to explore explore how angiogenesis at high levels of GAL-1 expression can be elegantly regulated without becoming cancerous.

AB  - This experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of noni fruit extract (NFE) on growth performance, ruminal and colonic fermentation, nutrient digestion, and subacute rumen acidosis (SARA) of cashmere goats with the high-concentrate diet. Twenty-four cashmere kids (17.9 +/- 1.45 kg of BW +/- SD) were randomly assigned to three treatments: low-concentrate diet, high-concentrate (HC) diet, or HC diet supplemented with NFE at 1 g per kg DM (0.1%). The results showed that although the HC diet improved the average daily gain (ADG) and feed conversion rate (FCR), it was accompanied by SARA with a decreased pH and an increased lactic acid of both rumen and colon, and decreased digestibility of neutral detergent fiber (NDF)and acid detergent fiber (ADF). The supplementation of 0.10% NFE in the HC diet could not only effectively alleviate SARA symptoms and colon fermentation disorders, such as reversing the decrease of pH and alleviating the increase of lactic acid in rumen and colon, but also mitigate the decline of fiber digestibility caused by long-term feeding in the HC diet, and increase the digestibility of crude protein(CP) and dry matter (DM), which improved the ADG and FCR of cashmere kids. Thus, NFE provides new strategies for alleviating SARA and promoting cashmere goat growth.

AB  - Flowering is a key agronomic trait that directly influences the yield of the tea-oil tree (Camellia oleifera). Floral initiation, which precedes flower bud differentiation, represents a critical developmental stage affecting the flowering outcomes. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying floral initiation in C. oleifera remain poorly understood. In this study, buds from five key developmental stages of a 12-year-old C. oleifera cultivar 'changlin53' were collected as experimental samples. Scanning electron microscopy was employed to identify the stage of floral initiation. UPLC-MS/MS was used to analyze endogenous gibberellin (GA) concentrations, while transcriptomic analysis was performed to reveal the underlying transcriptional regulatory network. Six GA types were detected during floral initiation and petal development. GA4 was exclusively detected at the sprouting stage (BII), while GA3 was present in all samples but was significantly lower in BII and the flower bud primordium formation stage (BIII) than in the other samples. A total of 64 differentially expressed genes were concurrently enriched in flower development, reproductive shoot system development, and shoot system development. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) identified eight specific modules significantly associated with different developmental stages. The magenta module, containing Unigene0084708 (CoFT) and Unigene0037067 (CoLEAFY), emerged as a key regulatory module driving floral initiation. Additionally, GA20OX1 and GA2OX8 were identified as candidate genes involved in GA-mediated regulation of floral initiation. Based on morphological and transcriptomic analyses, we conclude that floral initiation of C. oleifera is a continuous regulatory process governed by multiple genes, with the FT-LFY module playing a central role in the transition from apical meristem to floral meristem.

AB  - The main objective of this study was to identify spatial and seasonal variations on the diet of Psalido-don aff. fasciatus from the Tibagi River (South Brazil) before the construction of the Tibagi Montante hydropower plant. Fish were collected quarterly between October 2017 and July 2019. 536 stomachs containing feeding items and identified to the lowest taxonomic level as possible have been analyzed. Results showed that plants, Hymenoptera, and insect parts in general were the most consumed items. The analysis of feeding strategy showed a diet based on rare items but with individuals varying among specialist, generalist, and opportunistic trends depending on the season. The non-metric multidimen-sional scaling (NMDS) revealed diet overlap in both spatial and seasonal terms, which was confir-med by the permutational analysis of variance (PERMANOVA). The indicator value analysis (IndVal) identified 15 items as the most important components of this species' diet such as superior plants, Hymenoptera and insect parts. Therefore, before the formation of the reservoir, P. aff. fasiatus could be characterized as predominantly herbivore with a strong trend for insectivory. Across seasons, this species had a specialized diet all year, although with more specialized preferences in the spring when the consumption of plants was increased.

AB  - Simple Summary Bacteria in the Anaplasma genus are intracellular parasites of mammal blood cells transmitted by ticks of genera Amblyomma, Dermacentor, Hyalomma, Ixodes, and Rhipicephalus. In this study, the presence of Anaplasma marginale and A. phagocytophilum in ticks was molecularly confirmed in Rhipicephalus sanguineus s.l. and Rhipicephalus bursa ticks, suggesting that these tick species are of importance in the transmission of potential zoonotic infections. Due to the nature of the Anaplasma species detected here, our results, together with data obtained to date in Sardinia, suggest that from a public health point of view, the potential zoonotic Anaplasma species should be further investigated in the island. Additional studies are needed to clarify whether these tick species can transmit these zoonotic bacteria both to human and animal hosts. Ticks are hematophagous ectoparasites that are recognized for their ability to vector a wide variety of pathogens of viral, bacterial, protozoal, and helminthic nature to vertebrate hosts. Among the different diseases transmitted by ticks, also called "Tick-Borne Diseases" (TBD), many are zoonotic. Pathogens of the genus Anaplasma refer to obligate intracellular bacteria within the Rickettsiales order transmitted mainly through tick bites and considered as well-established threats to domestic animals, livestock, and humans, worldwide. In this retrospective study, 156 ticks collected from twenty goats, one marten, and one cattle from several Sardinian sites, were examined by molecular analyses to detect the presence of Anaplasma species. A total of 10 (10/156; 6.4%) ticks were shown to be Anaplasma-positive by PCR screening. After sequence analyses, A. phagocytophilum was detected in four Rhipicephalus sanguineus s.l. (3.3%) and four Rh. bursa (11%) ticks from goats, while one Rh. sanguineus s.l. (0.8%) and one Rh. bursa (2.8%) collected from the marten and cattle, respectively, exhibited 100% of identity with A. marginale strains. In this study, we provide the first description and molecular detection of A. marginale and A. phagocytophilum in ticks of the Rhiphicephalus genus in Sardinia. Considering the growing impact of tick-borne Anaplasma pathogens on human health, further studies are necessary to monitor the prevalence of these pathogens in Sardinia.

AB  - The blue antelope or bluebuck (Hippotragus leucophaeus) is an extinct species of antelope that lived in South Africa until ca. 1799-1800. Disappearing only 34 years after it was described, it was the first large African mammal species to have become extinct in recent times. Therefore, current scientific knowledge of the blue antelope is limited to museum specimens. However, these are extremely rare and further complicated by uncertainties surrounding their taxonomic status due to morphological similarity with the closely related extant roan antelope (Hippotragus equinus) and sable antelope (Hippotragus niger). A previous study found that only four (out of ten) genetically analysed historical museum specimens could be confirmed as Hippotragus leucophaeus. Here, we analyse a further five potential blue antelope specimens, two of which had been morphologically identified as blue antelope (one from the Natural History Museum (NHM) in London and one from National Museums Scotland in Edinburgh), plus an additional three specimens identified here as candidate blue antelope specimens (from the NHM). We find that only one of the five specimens can be genetically validated as Hippotragus leucophaeus, whereas the other four specimens were identified as H. equinus. Furthermore, using hybridisation capture, we generated two complete mitochondrial genomes for blue antelope specimens that were formerly known only from partial mitochondrial genomes. The diversity analyses including all newly generated genomes further confirm that the mitochondrial nucleotide diversity across this species was low.

AB  - The concept of equivalence is widely employed to aggregate different types of resource depletion or emissions. The practice offers convenience for reporting and can assist policymaking. However, equivalence is typically established using a model based only on selected criteria. If alternative criteria are used, the relative importance of different types of resource depletion or emissions can change. This communication addresses the subject of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and carbon dioxide equivalence (CO2e). Using the Australian beef cattle and sheep meat sectors as a case study, radiative forcing (RF) footprints were quantified, and a method is presented to express these as CO2e emissions rather than the units W/m2. RF footprints are an alternative way of aggregating GHG emissions. They incorporate RF from current-year emissions and RF from historical emissions that remain in the atmosphere, avoiding the need to choose an arbitrary time horizon. There is simplicity and familiarity associated with the CO2e unit. However, it is concluded that whenever GHG emissions are reported as CO2e emissions, there is a need for transparency about the basis for equivalence, justification of the approach, as well interpretation of the results, and potential implications of selecting other bases of equivalency.

AB  - Mesopelagic fishes, a central component of marine trophic networks, play a fundamental role in marine eco-systems. However, as they live in highly inaccessible environments, little information is currently available on their distribution and abundance. The emergence of biologging technologies has made it possible to use deep-diving predators as bio-samplers of their environment in under-sampled regions. In this work, we deployed an innovative miniaturised sonar tag that combines active acoustics with high-resolution GPS, pressure, movement and light sensors on Southern elephant seals, a deep-diving predator feeding on mesopelagic prey. Seals were also equipped with Conductivity-Temperature-Depth tags. Salinity and temperature depth profiles were used to define oceanographic domains, allowing us to explore distribution and ecology of mesopelagic prey targeted by seals and the seals' foraging behaviour. We highlighted strong vertical differences in prey characteristics and behaviour, with larger, more evasive and less bioluminescent prey in deeper waters. Moreover, prey encountered in warmer waters were found deeper, were more evasive and displayed a more marked diel vertical migration behaviour compared to prey encountered in colder waters, suggesting that prey accessibility and characteristics differ according to oceanographic domains. This study highlights the usefulness of the sonar-bioluminescence tag to infer mesopelagic prey distribution and habitat when deployed on deep-diving predators such as elephant seals.

AB  - Oviposition by specialist herbivores can alter the suitability of the host plant to subsequent infestation by other herbivores. In this study, we tested the effect of previous oviposition on canola, Brassica napus L., by a Brassica specialist, the diamondback moth (DBM), Plutella xylostella (L.) (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae), on subsequent herbivory by the generalist feeder, the bertha armyworm (BAW), Mamestra configurata Walker (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). The effect of DBM oviposition on subsequent BAW oviposition and larval feeding was tested in no-choice and choice experiments. Oviposition of BAW was not altered by DBM eggs on canola plants, however, BAW had increased larval feeding on plants with DBM eggs. These results suggest that oviposition by a specialist herbivore increased the susceptibility of the host plant to generalist herbivory. In a preliminary experiment, salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, and its conjugates were not altered by DBM oviposition on canola, however, further experimentation is needed to determine if oviposition affects expression of plant defense pathways and other plant traits.

AB  - The increasing use of aluminum nanoparticles (nano-Al) leads to increased human exposure and might affect human health. Considering the suggested connection between aluminum exposure and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, there is a concern about the effect of nano-Al on cognitive function and brain health. This study was aimed to assess the effect of a 5-day oral gavage of aluminum oxide nanoparticle (nano-Al) on memory and the phosphorylation levels of hippocampal p38, JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase), ERK (extracellular signal regulated kinase) as well as cleaved caspase-3 in mice. Adult male NMRI mice were treated with nano-Al in doses 5 and 10 mg/kg/oral gavage for 5 days. The test session of novel object recognition (NOR) task was performed on day 5. Following the NOR test, the hippocampi were isolated for western blot analysis to determine the total and phosphorylated levels of p38, JNK, ERK as well as cleaved caspase-3 proteins. The results showed that nano-Al oral gavage in doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg impairs NOR memory in mice. Moreover, the memory impairing effect of nano-Al coincided with a dose dependent increase in phosphorylated p38 and cleaved caspase-3 in the hippocampus. It also increased the ratio of phosphorylated to total content of ERK in the hippocampus while JNK signaling was not affected by nano-Al. This study showed that nano-Al in doses as low as 5 and 10 mg/ kg ingested for 5 days impairs NOR memory and activates p38, ERK and cleaved caspase-3 in the hippocampus.

AB  - Background Oxidative stress is one of the most important factors affecting large-scale breeding, especially the performance of pigs. Oxidative stress plays a role by affecting various genes in pigs, which can cause serious body damage, functional degradation and reduce production performance.
   Objective The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of Toll like receptor 9 (TLR9) pathway on IPEC-J2 cells under oxidative stress and to provide reference for the growth development of Dapulian pigs.
   Methods In this study, Diquat was used as a source of oxidative stress to study the effects on Dapulian pigs by detecting relevant indicators. Then the IPEC-J2 cells were selected to verify the TLR9 signaling pathway in oxidative stress.
   Results Compared with the control group, superoxide dismutase (SOD) in experimental group decreased significantly, malondialdehyde (MDA) was significantly increased, accompanied by inflammatory reaction, and inflammatory factors were significantly increased in the experimental group. Oxidative stress model was constructed by H2O2 incubating IPEC-J2 cells. The interference and overexpression vectors of TLR9 and myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (MyD88) were constructed to detect the activity of antioxidant enzymes and related proteins. The results showed that overexpression of TLR9 enhanced the activity of antioxidant enzymes, decreased the secretion of inflammatory factors, and decreased the activity of MDA, reactive oxygen species (ROS); the results were opposite after TLR9 interference. This study also showed that H2O2 can activate the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) pathway and promote the translocation of NF-kappa B into the nucleus. After co-transfection with TLR9 and MyD88, the results showed that TLR9 regulated the expression of NF-kappa B through MyD88.
   Conclusion The study showed that TLR9 pathway had a significant positive effect on antioxidant.

AB  - Background and aimsIntercropping-induced plant resistance to herbivorous pests is explained by different factors such as pest deterrence, attraction of natural enemies, microclimate, soil fertility, and soil microbial communities. The role of plant chemistry in this context has received less attention. Here, we investigated the impacts of intercropping-induced changes in leaf chemistry on the growth and physiological performance of lepidopteran insect pests.MethodsInsect populations were monitored through two field seasons in three cropping systems: peanut monocropping, maize monocropping, and peanut/maize intercropping. Laboratory experiments were carried out to determine the influence of cropping system on leaf metabolic profiles and to link cropping system-induced leaf chemistry changes with the growth and physiological performance of Spodoptera litura larvae.ResultsIn the field, cropping system influences the distribution and feeding preferences of lepidopteran insects, with peanut plants in monocropping more attractive to these insects. Under laboratory settings, S. litura grow better on the leaves of peanuts grown under monocropping than on the leaves of peanuts grown in maize/peanut intercropping. The observed insect growth effects were accompanied by higher lipase activity, and lower activity of detoxification enzymes in larvae fed on peanut plants grown in intercropping. Untargeted metabolomics revealed clear differences in the metabolic profiles of peanuts from different cropping systems. Amino acid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, and nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism were particularly impacted. Based on the artificial diet supplementation experiments, we show that leaf nicotinamide and isomaltose may explain the observed intercropping-induced resistance to lepidopteran pests.ConclusionIntercropping-induced changes in leaf chemistry mediate plant resistance to agricultural pests.

AB  - The cuticle plays a major role in restricting nonstomatal water transpiration in plants. There is therefore a long-standing interest to understand the structure and function of the plant cuticle. Although many efforts have been devoted, it remains controversial to what degree the various cuticular parameters contribute to the water transpiration barrier. In this study, eight tea germplasms were grown under normal conditions; cuticle thickness, wax coverage, and compositions were analyzed from the epicuticular waxes and the intracuticular waxes of both leaf surfaces. The cuticular transpiration rates were measured from the individual leaf surface as well as the intracuticular wax layer. Epicuticular wax resistances were also calculated from both leaf surfaces. The correlation analysis between the cuticular transpiration rates (or resistances) and various cuticle parameters was conducted. We found that the abaxial cuticular transpiration rates accounted for 64-78% of total cuticular transpiration and were the dominant factor in the variations for the total cuticular transpiration. On the adaxial surface, the major cuticular transpiration barrier was located on the intracuticular waxes; however, on the abaxial surface, the major cuticular transpiration barrier was located on the epicuticular waxes. Cuticle thickness was not a factor affecting cuticular transpiration. However, the abaxial epicuticular wax coverage was found to be significantly and positively correlated with the abaxial epicuticular resistance. Correlation analysis suggested that the very-long-chain aliphatic compounds and glycol esters play major roles in the cuticular transpiration barrier in tea trees grown under normal conditions. Our results provided novel insights about the complex structure-functional relationships in the tea cuticle.

AB  - Culicoides biting midges adversely impact animal health through transmission of multiple orbiviruses, such as bluetongue virus (BTV). This study used light trapping data collected in the Southeastern United States for three Culicoides midge species that are confirmed or suspected BTV vectors: Culicoides insignis, Culicoides stellifer and Culicoides venustus. Midge presence datasets were combined with meteorological data and ecological data to model habitat suitability for each species. Logistic regression and machine learning models were used to generate individual species distribution models (SDMs). Results for each SDM method were combined in an ensemble model to create a distribution model for each midge species. Based on overlay analyses of livestock populations and midge suitable habitat, there is extensive overlap of cattle and goat populations and suitable habitat for C. insignis in Florida. Suitable habitat for C. stellifer intersects with cattle and goat populations in various counties in Alabama, Arkansas, the Carolinas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana and Tennessee; and suitable habitat for C. venustus intersects with cattle and goat populations in the same states as C. stellifer, except for Florida. It is critical for orbivirus and midge surveillance to continue in the Southeastern United States as the habitat of all three midge species intersect with livestock populations.

AB  - Simple Summary Copper (Cu) is one of the essential trace elements for animal growth. Piglet intestinal epithelium undergoes a complete renewal driven by intestinal stem cells located at the crypt base. However, whether Cu improves intestinal morphology and development via modulating intestinal stem cell activity in pigs remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effects of dietary Cu during the weaning period on the intestinal morphology and development of weaned and finished pigs and explored the potential mechanism by culturing the intestinal organoids and treated them with Cu in vitro. The results indicated that Cu supplementation during the weaning period improves the intestinal morphology in finishing pigs by modulating the activity of intestinal stem cells. Copper (Cu) is an essential micronutrient for animals. Many studies have been conducted on the effects of dietary Cu on growth performance, intestinal morphology, and function of piglets. However, the underlying mechanism remains to be explored. Intestinal stem cells (ISC) drive the development and constant renewal of intestinal epithelium. Therefore, we hypothesized that dietary Cu affects piglets' intestinal development via modulating ISC activity. A total of eighty-five 21-day-old piglets were randomly assigned to five groups, where 25, 50, 75, 100, and 125 mg CuSO4/kg on a dry matter basis were supplemented to the basal diet at phase 1 (day 0 to 21). Increasing the dietary Cu concentration decreased (p < 0.05) villus width but increased (p < 0.001) the number of Ki67-positive cells. At phase 2 (day 22 to 163), the other 45 pigs were offered the same diets. Villus height in the 125 mg/kg Cu group was greater (p < 0.001) than in the other groups. Moreover, the effects of Cu on ISC activity in vitro were tested to explore the underlying mechanism. Compared to the control group, 10 mu mol/L CuSO4 center dot 5H(2)O increased (p < 0.001) the organoid budding efficiency, crypt depth, and crypts per organoid. Dietary Cu improved the intestinal morphology of finishing pigs via promoting cell proliferation and modulating ISC activity.

AB  - Introduction In the invaded areas, it is believed that invasive species reduce their investment in defense due to the absence of natural enemies. Methods By field investigation and a series of laboratory assays, This study explored the defense strategies of invasive plants. Results Field investigation indicated that invasive plants have a antifeedant effect on herbivorous pests, and the distribution frequency of wormholes of native plants shows a peak at a distance of 2-3 m from the invasive species. The feeding preference experiment conducted with two generalist herbivorous insects (native insect Spodoptera litura and invasive insect Spodoptera frugiperda) showed that the invasive plants have a stronger antifeedant effect than native plants. By analyzing the content of secondary metabolites in the leaves of three invasive plants (Sphagneticola trilobata, Mikania micrantha, Ipomoea cairica) and three native plants (Ipomoea nil, Paederia foetida, Polygonum chinense), the leaves of invasive plants had higher concentrations of substances associated with defenses, including total phenols, flavonoids, jasmonic acid, tannin, H2O2, and total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and lower soluble protein concentrations than native plants. After leaf damage, compared to native plants, the leaves of invasive plants showed an overall increase in substances associated with defense, except for soluble sugar. Discussion These results suggest that invasive plants maintain active defense strategies in invaded areas, leading to changes in the distribution patterns of herbivorous insects in a manner that facilitates invasion.

AB  - The constant greenhouse gases (GHGs) and ammonia emissions during pig manure (PM) composting have made large contributions to air pollution and global temperature rise. This study aimed to evaluate the addition of biochar (B) and wood vinegar (WV) to reduce GHGs emissions and improve nitrogen retention and microbial activities during PM composting. Different treatments, carried out under a 1:2 ratio (dry weight) of PM and sawdust mixture with the addition of B (5%) and various proportions of WV, include a control treatment (CT) without the addition of B and WV and, B, B+0.5%WV, B+1.0%WV, B+1.5%WV, and B+2.0%WV treatments. The results indicated that the addition of B could accelerate the composting process in contrast to CT. In addition, various amounts of WV with B decreased NH3, CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions by 18.82-35.88%, 1.38-15.39%, 16.98-62.73%, and 4.47-19.91%, respectively. Furthermore, in contrast to the B treatment, WV addition was more effective in decreasing GHGs and NH3 emissions, and the B+1.0% WV treatment displayed the lowest nitrogen loss (2.12%) and GHGs emissions (11.62 g/kg). The bacterial community analysis demonstrated that synergistic application of WV and B can increase the relative abundance of Proteobacteria which can contribute to nitrogen fixation and reduction of nitrogen loss. The results proved that combining B with WV can be a feasible strategy to effectively reduce GHGs emissions and improve nitrogen conservation in the composting industry.

AB  - Piriformospora indica (P. indica) is a mutualistic endophyte that colonizes plant roots. In this study, effects of P. indica on rice resistance against rice leaffolder (Cnaphalocrocis medinalis Guenee) were investigated. Growth inhibition and leaf injury caused by leaffolder larvae infestation in P. indica-colonized rice was significantly alleviated. Moreover, growth retardation was observed in larvae which fed on P. indica-colonized plants. JA-Ile levels and trypsin inhibitor activities in leaf tissues of P. indica-colonized plants were higher than those in noncolonized plants under leaffolder-infested conditions. P. indica effects on increasing trypsin inhibitor expression and reducing larval growth were repressed by aspirin. JA signaling drives P. indica-enhanced insect resistance in rice, and trypsin inhibitors might be candidates involved in this mechanism. Changes in antioxidant enzyme activities and malondialdehyde levels in P. indica-inoculated plants were observed, and it was demonstrated that oxidative stress induced by insect infestation could be reduced in P. indica-colonized plants.

AB  - The present study aimed to understand microplastic (MP) ingestion by five fish species with different feeding habits namely, Schizothorax richardsonii and Crossocheilus latius (herbivore),Cyprinus carpio (omnivore), Tor chelenoid (herbi-omnivore), and Botia horii (carnivore). The fishes were sampled from River Alaknanda (one of the headwaters of River Ganga) patch at Srinagar, Garhwal, Uttarakhand. The fish gut samples were digested with 30% hydrogen peroxide and vacuum filtered through glass microfiber filter. Each filter paper was observed microscopically to count MPs, and then, selected MPs were chemically characterized using Attenuated Total Reflectance-Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR). The results revealed that all the species were contaminated with MPs and the rate of MP ingestion varied with feeding habits. The herbi-omnivore fish, Tor chelenoid, was observed to have the highest MP ingestion. Among the analyzed particles, fibers (66%) were the dominant type of MPs. The MPs were chemically characterized as High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE), Polypropylene (PP), and Polyester. This study contributes as a reference for the forthcoming researches, as it is the pioneer work on the ingestion of MP by fishes of a Himalayan River.

AB  - Microseismic events must be classified to obtain effective disaster precursor information. To further improve the accuracy and efficiency of microseismic event classification, and based on the microseismic data of rockburst monitoring, combined with time-frequency analysis theory, the main factors affecting microseismic event classification were analyzed. For the first time, the rectangle histogram of oriented gradient (R-HOG) and stacking technologies were effectively combined to establish a new stacking integrated learning model (RSREL-stacking) for classifying microseismic events. Finally, the classification performances of RSREL-stacking, a deep learning model, and other models were tested. The results showed the following: 1) noisy signal interference and some events that have similar characteristics are the main factors leading to the high misjudgment rate of events; 2) RSREL-stacking can accurately distinguish the spectrum of useful signals from complex noise interference and effectively extract the contour, region, and spatial position feature information of the useful signal spectrum; and 3) through different experiments, it is confirmed that RSREL-stacking effectively combines the advantages of many independent models, can deeply recognize the subtle differences and features of similar events, and provides increased accuracy of event classification. Compared with other methods, RSREL-stacking combines the advantages of efficient and accurate classification of microseismic events, which guarantees quickly obtaining effective disaster information.

AB  - The high fitness cost of predation selects prey capable of detecting risk cues and responding in ways that reduce their vulnerability. While the impacts of auditory predator cues have been extensively researched in vertebrate prey, much less is known about invertebrate species' responses and their potential to affect the wider food web. We exposed larvae of Spodoptera exigua, a slow-moving and vulnerable herbivore hunted by aerial predators, to recordings of wasp buzzing (risk cue), mosquito buzzing (no-risk cue), or a no-sound control in both laboratory and field settings. In the laboratory, wasp buzzing (but not mosquito buzzing) reduced survival relative to the control; there was, however, no effect on time to or weight at pupation in survivors. In the field, wasp buzzing reduced caterpillar herbivory and increased plant biomass relative to the control treatment. In contrast, mosquito buzzing reduced herbivory less than wasp buzzing and had no effect on plant biomass. The fact that wasp cues evoked strong responses in both experiments, while mosquito buzzing generally did not, indicates that caterpillars were responding to predation risk rather than sound per se. Such auditory cues may have an important but largely unappreciated impacts on terrestrial invertebrate herbivores and their host plants.

AB  - BackgroundLactoferrin is an active protein in breast milk that plays an important role in the growth and development of infants and is implicated as a neuroprotective agent. The incidence of depression is currently increasing, and it is unclear whether the lack of lactoferrin during lactation affects the incidence of depressive-like behavior in adulthood.ResultsLack of lactoferrin feeding during lactation affected the barrier and innate immune functions of the intestine, disrupted the intestinal microflora, and led to neuroimmune dysfunction and neurodevelopmental delay in the hippocampus. When exposed to external stimulation, adult lactoferrin feeding-deficient mice presented with worse depression-like symptoms; the mechanisms involved were activation of the LPS-TLR4 signalling pathway in the intestine and hippocampus, reduced BDNF-CREB signaling pathway in hippocampus, increased abundance of depression-related bacteria, and decreased abundance of beneficial bacteria.ConclusionsOverall, our findings reveal that lactoferrin feeding deficient during lactation can increase the risk of depressive-like behavior in adults. The mechanism is related to the regulatory effect of lactoferrin on the development of the "microbial-intestinal-brain" axis.

AB  - Because of the widespread availability of low-cost printers and scanners, document forgery has become extremely popular. Watermarks or signatures are used to protect important papers such as certificates, passports, and identification cards. Identifying the origins of printed documents is helpful for criminal investigations and also for authenticating digital versions of a document in today???s world. Source printer identification (SPI) has become increasingly popular for identifying frauds in printed documents. This paper provides a proposed algorithm for identifying the source printer and categorizing the questioned document into one of the printer classes. A dataset of 1200 papers from 20 distinct (13) laser and (7) inkjet printers achieved significant identification results. A proposed algorithm based on global features such as the Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) and local features such as Local Binary Pattern (LBP) descriptors has been proposed for printer identification. For classification, Decision Trees (DT), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Random Forests, Aggregate bootstrapping (bagging), Adaptive-boosting (boosting), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and mixtures of these classifiers have been employed. The proposed algorithm can accurately classify the questioned documents into their appropriate printer classes. The adaptive boosting classifier attained a 96% accuracy. The proposed algorithm is compared to four recently published algorithms that used the same dataset and gives better classification accuracy.

AB  - Due to increasing demand, many traditional, grazing-based Mediterranean sheep production systems have introduced intensified feeding regimes, increased investments in infrastructure and drug use to increase milk yields. However, compared to bovine milk production systems, there is limited knowledge about the impact of these intensification practices on animal welfare and health and on the quality of dairy products. The aim of this study was therefore to quantify the effects of management practices and environmental conditions background on udder health, parasitism and milk quantity and quality in Cretan traditional production systems. Milk yields were higher in semi-intensive production systems while concentrations of several nutritionally desirable compounds such as omega-3 fatty acids were found to be higher in milk from extensive systems. Antibiotic and anthelmintic use was relatively low in both extensive and semi-intensive production systems. There was no substantial difference in parasitic burden, somatic cell counts, and microbiological parameters assessed in milk. Recording of flock health parameters showed that animal health and welfare was high in both extensive and semi-intensively managed flocks, and that overall, the health status of extensively managed ewes was slightly better. In contrast, environmental conditions (temperature and rainfall) had a substantial effect on parasitism and milk quality.

AB  - Filtration is a simple ecological process for the treatment of effluents. This research examined the physicochemical properties of micronutrients, macronutrients, and heavy metals (HM) removed after the slow filtration of pig slurry (PS) through multiple media: sands, silt loam soils, fly ash, and zeolite. The objective was to find a new layer that can be added to our constructed wetland (CW) to improve its efficiency and study how the slurry reacts to these natural materials. The filtration achieved an approximate removal rate of 99.99% for total suspended solids (TSS) and nitrogen and 61, 94, 72, and 97%, respectively, for electrical conductivity (EC), turbidity, chemical oxygen demand (COD), and five-day biological oxygen demand (BOD5). The two sands, soil 1, and zeolite, had a macronutrient reduction median of 60%, whereas soil 2, 3, 4, and fly ash released macronutrients such as Na, Ca, and Mg. All the media achieved nearly 99.99% micronutrient removal for Fe and Zn. The Cu removal rate was over 86% except for sand 1 and 2 and soil 1, which reduced it to only 46%; the overall Mn removal rate was more than 80% except for soil 3 and soil 4, where it was only 9%. Zeolite had a 99.99% removal capacity for HM as opposed to sand 2, soil 4, and fly ash, which released some HMs (Ni, Cu). This inexpensive and abundant media filtration process is sound technically and financially sound and seems to be an ideal cost-efficient treatment for pig slurry.

AB  - As a country with abundant genetic resources of pigs, the domestication history of pigs in China and the adaptive evolution of Chinese pig breeds at different latitudes have rarely been elucidated at the genome-wide level. To fill this gap, we first assembled a high-quality chromosome-level genome of the Chenghua pig and used it as a benchmark to analyse the genomes of 272 samples from three genera of three continents. The divergence of the three species belonging to three genera, Phacochoerus africanus , Potamochoerus porcus , and Sus scrofa , was assessed. The introgression of pig breeds redefined that the migration routes were basically from southern China to central and southwestern China, then spread to eastern China, arrived in northern China, and finally reached Europe. The domestication of pigs in China occurred -12,000 years ago, earlier than the available Chinese archaeological domestication evidence. In addition, FBN1 and NR6A1 were identified in our study as candidate genes related to extreme skin thickness differences in Eurasian pig breeds and adaptive evolution at different latitudes in Chinese pig breeds, respectively. Our study provides a new resource for the pig genomic pool and refines our understanding of pig genetic diversity, domestication, migration, and adaptive evolution at different latitudes.

AB  - The contamination of toxic trace metals in the food chain is one of the major threats to human health. Milk is part of a balanced diet, which is essential for proper growth, but the ingestion of contaminated milk may cause chronic health disorders. The present study is focused on the assessment of contamination of toxic trace metals in buffalo milk and the associated health risks to the consumers of Abbottabad, Pakistan. Standard analytical methods were employed to quantify the metal contents in the milk samples collected from various shops and homes in the months from June 2021 to October 2021. Health risk assessment was accomplished by computing estimated daily intake (EDI), health risk index (HRI), target hazard quotient (THQ), hazard index (HI), and target cancer risk (TCR). On a comparative basis, the mean concentration of Cr was found to be highest in both shop and home milk samples (101.3 +/- 45.33 and 54.11 +/- 24.20 mg/L, respectively), followed by Pb, Zn, Ni, and Cd levels. In buffalo milk collected from homes, the highest concentration of the metals was found in October, followed by July, September, June, and August. In shop milk, the increasing trend of metal contents was July > October > September > June > August. Significantly strong positive relationships were noted between the metal concentrations in the milk samples. Multivariate cluster analysis and principal component analysis exhibited significant anthropogenic contributions of the metals in buffalo milk. Mostly, the EDI and HRI values were exceeding the recommended limits; however, THQ, HI, and TCR showed that the intake of these metals through milk consumption was within the safe limit and thus revealed no significant carcinogenic or non-carcinogenic risks to the consumers. It is high time to ensure the continuous monitoring of organic/inorganic toxins in the milk and concerned authorities should take strict measures to control the contamination of milk and other food products.

AB  - Nitrogen loss is an unavoidable problem during organic waste composting, while exogenous microbial inoculation is a promising strategy for reducing nitrogen loss and improving compost quality. This study was designed to probe available nitrogen levels, bacterial community composition, and the levels of nitrogen functional genes present when composting cattle manure with or without the addition of Bacillus coagulans X3. Bacterial supplementation was associated with the prolongation of the thermophilic stage and improved maturity of the resultant compost. At the maturity stage, samples to which B. coagulans X3 had been added exhibited significant increases in ammonium nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, and total nitrogen levels. The dominant bacterial phyla observed in these composting samples were Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteriota, and Chloroflexi. B. coagulans X3 addition resulted in significant increases in relative Firmicutes abundance during the thermophilic and cooling stages while also increasing amoA and nosZ gene abundance and reducing nirS gene levels over the course of composting. Together, these data suggest that B. coagulans X3 supplementation provides an effective means of enhancing nitrogen content in the context of cattle manure composting through the regulation of nitrification and denitrification activity.

AB  - Simple Summary: The transfer of a target directly from pigs or indirectly from the environment into pen-based oral fluid samples was documented using a fluorescent tracer (red food coloring). Pens of similar to 30, similar to 60, and similar to 125 14-week-old pigs (32 pens/size) on commercial swine farms received one of two treatments: (1) pig exposure, i.e., similar to 3.5 mL of tracer solution sprayed into the mouth of 10% of the pigs in the pen; (2) environmental exposure, i.e., 20 mL of tracer solution was poured on the floor in the center of the pen. Oral fluids collected one day prior to treatment (baseline fluorescence control) and immediately after treatment were tested for fluorescence. Data were evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, with Youden's J statistic used to set a threshold. Pretreatment oral fluid samples with fluorescence responses above the ROC threshold were removed from further analysis (7 of 96 samples). Analysis of post-treatment samples showed detectable levels of red food coloring in oral fluid samples from 78 of 89 pens (87.6%), including 43 of 47 (91.5%) pens in which pigs were directly exposed and 35 of 42 (83.3%) pens in which the tracer was placed in the environment. Thus, oral fluid samples contain both pig-derived and environmental targets.
   Laboratory methods for detecting specific pathogens in oral fluids are widely reported, but there is little research on the oral fluid sampling process itself. In this study, a fluorescent tracer (diluted red food coloring) was used to test the transfer of a target directly from pigs or indirectly from the environment to pen-based oral fluid samples. Pens of similar to 30, similar to 60, and similar to 125 14-week-old pigs (32 pens/size) on commercial swine farms received one of two treatments: (1) pig exposure, i.e., similar to 3.5 mL of tracer solution sprayed into the mouth of 10% of the pigs in the pen; (2) environmental exposure, i.e., 20 mL of tracer solution was poured on the floor in the center of the pen. Oral fluids collected one day prior to treatment (baseline fluorescence control) and immediately after treatment were tested for fluorescence. Data were evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, with Youden's J statistic used to set a threshold. Pretreatment oral fluid samples with fluorescence responses above the ROC threshold were removed from further analysis (7 of 96 samples). Based on the ROC analyses, oral fluid samples from 78 of 89 pens (87.6%), contained red food coloring, including 43 of 47 (91.5%) pens receiving pig exposure and 35 of 42 (83.3%) pens receiving environmental exposure. Thus, oral fluid samples contain both pig-derived and environmental targets. This methodology provides a safe and quantifiable method to evaluate oral fluid sampling vis-a-vis pen behavior, pen size, sampling protocol, and target distribution in the pen.

AB  - Background Plant-herbivorous insects are a severe danger to the world's agricultural production of various crops. Insecticides used indiscriminately resulted in habitat destruction due to their high toxicity, as well as disease resistance. In this respect, the development of a sustainable approach to supreme crop production with the least damage is a crucially prerequisite. As a result, the current study was carried out to understand the potential effect of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi along with Beauvaria bassiana silica nanoparticles (Si NPs) as a new approach to increase cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L. Merr.) defense against an insect herbivore, Spodoptera littoralis. AM and non-AM cotton plants were infested with S. littoralis and then sprayed with a biopesticide [B. bassiana Si NPs] or a chemical insecticide (Chlorpyrifos). Results The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of B. bassiana Si NPs fungal extract showed that the major constituents identified were Oleyl alcohol, trifluoroacetate, 11-Dodecen-1-AL and 13-Octadecenal, (Z)-(CAS). Besides, results revealed a highly significant decrease in growth parameters in S. littoralis infested plants, however, with AM fungal inoculation a substantial improvement in growth traits and biochemical parameters such as protein and carbohydrates contents was observed. In addition, stimulation in proline and antioxidant enzymes activity and a decrease in malondialdehyde content were observed after AM inoculation. Conclusion AM fungi mitigate the harmful effects of herbivorous insects by strengthening the cotton plant's health via enhancing both morphological and biochemical traits that can partially or completely replace the application of chemical insecticides.

AB  - Simple Summary The glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3 beta)-interacting protein plays a role in regulating glycogen metabolism, protein synthesis, the cell cycle, and in regulating gene expression. To date, physiological function research into the GSK3 beta-interacting protein has been focused on cell lines, gene 'knockout' models, and over-expression studies, and to our knowledge, there have been no reports on how variation in the GSK3 beta-interacting protein gene (GSKIP) may affect phenotypic traits. In this study, PCR-SSCP methods were used to screen for variation in exon 1 and exon 2 of GSKIP in 840 New Zealand (NZ) Romney sheep. Two variant sequences were identified in exon 1 and this variation in GSKIP was associated with variation in lamb birth weight, hot carcass weight, and fat depth at the 12th rib. The glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3 beta)-interacting protein (encoded by the gene GSKIP) is a small A-kinase anchoring protein, which complexes with GSK3 beta and protein kinase A (PKA) and acts synergistically with cAMP/PKA signaling to inhibit GSK3 beta activity. The protein plays a role in regulating glycogen metabolism, protein synthesis, the cell cycle, and in regulating gene expression. In this study, PCR-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analyses were used to screen for variation in exon 1 and exon 2 of GSKIP in 840 New Zealand (NZ) Romney sheep. Two SSCP banding patterns representing two different nucleotide variants (A and B) were detected in an exon 1 region, whereas in an exon 2 region only one pattern was detected. Variants A and B of exon 1 had one non-synonymous nucleotide difference c.37A/G (p.Met13Val). The birthweight of sheep of genotype AA (5.9 +/- 0.06 kg) was different (p = 0.023) to sheep of genotype AB (5.7 +/- 0.06 kg) and BB (5.7 +/- 0.06 kg). The hot carcass weight (HCW) of sheep of genotype AA (17.2 +/- 0.22 kg) was different (p = 0.012) to sheep of genotype AB (17.6 +/- 0.22 kg) and BB (18.0 +/- 0.29 kg), and the fat depth at the 12th rib (V-GR) of sheep of genotype AA (7.7 +/- 0.31 mm) was different (p = 0.016) to sheep of genotype AB (8.3 +/- 0.30 mm) and BB (8.5 +/- 0.39 mm). The results suggest that the c.37A/G substitution in ovine GSKIP may affect sheep growth and carcass traits.

AB  - Context. Australia has numerous threatened species of terrestrial orchid, with a particularly high incidence of rarity in the genus Prasophyllum R.Br. Although there has been research on mycorrhizal associations and propagation, little is known about the reproductive ecology of threatened Prasophyllum. Understanding which animals are responsible for pollination and the impact of herbivores on reproduction may inform conservation actions. Aims. For the nationally Critically Endangered Prasophyllum innubum, we aimed to determine the pollinator species, test for self-pollination, quantify levels of reproductive success and herbivory, and identify herbivores. Methods. Pollinator observations were undertaken at wild populations of P. innubum, whereas an experiment testing for self-pollination was undertaken in shadehouse conditions. We quantified reproductive success and herbivory at two populations and attempted to identify herbivores using game cameras. Key results. Pollination occurred via three species of bee and a sphecid wasp, all of which attempted feeding on floral nectar. Fruit set averaged 72-84% at wild sites, whereas only 6% of flowers set fruit via self-pollination when insects were excluded. Just 4% of inflorescences were completely consumed by herbivores, and no herbivory was captured on camera. Conclusions. P. innubum has a generalist rewarding pollination system that confers high levels of reproductive success, with herbivory having little impact on reproduction. Implications. Pollinator availability is unlikely to restrict conservation translocation site selection of P. innubum because of a generalist pollination system. If herbivores are a threat for this species, it is likely to be through alteration of habitat rather than direct grazing.

AB  - Simple Summary The mobilization of lipids from adipose tissue increases fatty acids and ketone bodies levels. The & beta;-hydroxybutyrate is the main ketone body used to diagnose ketosis, a metabolic disorder of the transition period, in ruminants. Nevertheless, a specific cut-off for the ketosis of & beta;-hydroxybutyrate in buffaloes and the plasma lipid fractions related to ketone bodies have not been established. The relative concentrations of not only total plasma lipids but also lipid fractions such as phospholipids, free fatty acids, triglycerides, and cholesterol esters are influenced by the mobilization of lipids. Each of these fractions has a different role in animal metabolism, influencing energy redistribution and cell metabolism and function. The present study reveals the relationship between lipid fractions and changes in metabolism and inflammation that is related to variations in lipid classes according to different levels of energy deficits in the early lactation of Mediterranean buffaloes. Furthermore, buffaloes defined as at risk of ketosis showed similarities, with ketotic cows suggesting the necessity of further investigations in these ruminants. Cell function and energy redistribution are influenced by lipid classes (phospholipids (PLs), free fatty acids (FFAs), triglycerides (TGs), and cholesterol esters (CEs)). The aim of this study was to investigate metabolic alterations that are related to changes in lipid classes according to different levels of energy deficits in early lactating Mediterranean buffaloes (MBs). Sixty-three MBs were enrolled at the beginning of lactation using an observational study with a cross-sectional experimental design. Serum & beta;-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) levels were used to group the animals into a healthy group (Group H; n = 38; BHB < 0.70 mmol/L) and hyperketonemia risk group (Group K; n = 25; BHB & GE; 0.70 mmol/L). Statistical analysis was performed using a linear model that included the effect of the group and body condition score to assess differences in fatty acid (FA) concentrations. A total of 40 plasma FAs were assessed in each lipid class. Among the FAs, eight PLs, seven FFAs, four TGs, and four CEs increased according to BHB levels, while three FFAs, three TGs, and one CE decreased. The changes among lipid class profiles suggested the influence of inflammatory response, liver metabolism, and the state of body lipid reserves. In addition, the possible similarities of buffaloes at risk of hyperketonemia with ketotic cows suggest the necessity of further investigations in these ruminants.

AB  - The by-products obtained after the extraction of vitamin B-2 from fermented soybean (VBP), primarily consisting of soybean meal, soybean oil, vitamin B-2, and Bacillus subtilis, may serve as a cost-effective and recycled resource in animal feed. This research aimed to assess the impact of VBP on the growth performance, nutrient utilization, blood parameters, and meat quality of pigs in the growing-finishing phase. In this 16-week feeding experiment, 140 pigs of mixed breed [Duroc x (Landrace x Yorkshire)] were used, with an initial average body weight of 26.05 +/- 1.32 kg. The pigs were assigned randomly to one of four dietary groups, each consisting of five pigs, with two gilts and three barrows per pen, and a total of seven repetitions per treatment. The animals were fed different levels of by-products after vitamin B-2 extraction (0, 10, 20, and 30 g/kg as the CON, VBP10, VBP20, and VBP30 dietary groups, respectively) in a three-phase feeding trial (wk. 0-4, 4-8, and 8-13). When higher levels of VBP were added as supplements, the outcomes indicated that there were no notable variations (p > 0.05) in growth performance and nutrient digestibility among the treatment groups throughout the trial. In phase II (4-8 weeks), the inclusion of VBP in the diets showed a reduction (p = 0.011; with linear and quadratic effects, p = 0.003) in serum norepinephrine concentration. The sensory evaluation of meat color was linearly improved (p = 0.043) in pigs fed with graded levels of VBP supplementation. The percentage of lean meat showed a significant improvement (p = 0.016) with the gradual levels of VBP supplementation. The addition of 30 g/kg (on an as-fed basis) of vitamin B2 by-products in the diet can simultaneously mitigate the negative impacts of acute stress without compromising growth performance and enhance the percentage of lean meat. These findings suggest that VBP could be a viable and economical alternative to corn and soybean meal and partially replace it in pig feed.

AB  - Simple Summary Currently, due to different beneficial properties of lactobionic acid (calcium absorption, prebiotic, antioxidant, and preservative) it may find application in animal feed. However, data about its effect on animal husbandry product quality are limited. Common interest about the effect of feed supplements on pig growth performance and the chemical composition of pork is growing, which is important for farmers, meat processors and consumers. The feed supplemented with lactobionic acid promotes better utilization of feed in the digestive tract of pigs, resulting in a higher bioavailability of nutrients and a significant increase of pig live weight gain. Pork obtained from pigs fed with lactobionic acid supplemented feed had higher essential amino acid content. Fatty acid composition revealed slightly higher proportion of saturated fatty acids over unsaturated fatty acids. Further analysis of fatty acid composition indicated that the control group had better nutritional quality of fat. Lactobionic acid is an innovative product obtained in the fermentation process of cheese or curd whey, and it has several beneficial properties. Therefore, it may have potential application in animal feeding. Currently, lactobionic acid is not widely used yet in feeding farm animals. Therefore, the aim of our study was to evaluate the effect of lactobionic acid (LBA) on pig growth performance and pork quality. Two groups of pigs (control and trial, 26 piglets each) were completed. The control group received compound feed, whereas the trial group's feed was supplemented with LBA (0.17 kg per 100 kg of feed). Carcass weight and meat pH were determined. The subcutaneous fat layer S (mm) was measured. Lean meat content was determined using the SEUROP classification. Amino acids and fatty acids in pork were evaluated. The addition of LBA to pig feed significantly increased the live weight gain and slaughter yield of pigs, but the samples had a slightly thicker backfat layer. Results obtained showed higher concentration of amino acids in the trial group but slightly lower pork fat quality in the same group. Lactobionic acid has the potential for applications in pig feeding.

AB  - In the last decade, the incidence and severity of Clostridioides difficile infections (CDIs) in humans have been increasing and community-associated infections have been described. For these reasons, the interest in C. difficile in food and in food animals has increased, suggesting other possible sources of C. difficile acquisition. This study evaluated the presence of C. difficile on pig carcasses at the slaughterhouse and in pork products in Central Italy. The contamination rate on pig carcasses was 4/179 (2.3%). Regarding food samples, a total of 216 pork products were tested (74 raw meat preparations and 142 ready-to-eat food samples made by cured raw meat). The real-time PCR screening was positive for 1/74 raw meat preparation (1.35%) and for 1/142 ready-to-eat food samples (0.7%) C. difficile was isolated only from the raw meat preparation (pork sausage). All the isolated strains were toxigenic and susceptible to all the tested antibiotics. Strains isolated from carcass samples displayed A+B+CDTa+CDTb+ profile, were toxinotype IV and belonged to the same ribotype arbitrary named TV93, while the one isolated from food samples displayed A+B+CDTa-CDTb- profile and it was not possible to determine ribotype and toxinotype, because it was lost after freeze storage. It was concluded that the prevalence of C. difficile in the pork supply chain is very low.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of three feeding systems, indoor feeding (CONT), indoor feeding with time-restricted grazing artificial pasture (4 h/day, G4H), and indoor feeding with an eight-hour daily grazing artificial pasture (G8H), on the growth performance, serum metabolites, ruminal fermentation, and fecal microbiota composition of lambs. Average daily gain showed a tendency (p = 0.081) to be higher for the G4H group compared with the CONT group. Moreover, feeding systems did not have a significant effect on most of the serum biochemical indicators in lambs. Concentrations of serum glutathione peroxidase and immunoglobulins (IgA, gG, and IgM) were significantly lower (p < 0.01) in the CONT group. Additionally, a tendency towards higher levels of volatile fatty acids, acetate, and butyrate was found in animals of the G4H group compared to the CONT group. Furthermore, fecal microbiota composition was altered in G4H and G8H groups, resulting in the increased relative abundance of Firmicutes and Ruminococcaceae UCG-005, as well as the decreased relative abundance of Ruminobacter compared with the CONT group. Overall, these results suggest that indoor feeding with restricted grazing time does not significantly affect fattening performance or rumen fermentation but enhances antioxidation and immune function activity and also alters fecal microbiota composition.

AB  - Simple Summary Diseases emerging from wildlife represent a growing public health issue. Cervids share many pathogens with domestic species and humans, representing useful spontaneous models to evaluate host-pathogen balance. Histology and immunohistochemistry can help in fully understanding the pathogenesis of infection in these species, but few studies have been conducted to characterize immune cell markers. This study highlights that lymphocytes and macrophagic subsets in roe and fallow deer lymphoid tissue can be identified by a panel of commercial antibodies developed against humans. A description of the main immune cell distribution was provided. These results may support future investigations on immune cell response and pathogenesis in roe and fallow deer diseases. Roe and Fallow deer are common wild ruminants widely distributed in Italy. Infectious diseases of these species can potentially pose health risks to domestic animals and humans. However, few studies have been conducted in which immune system cells in these species were phenotyped. The aims of this study were to determine the cross-reactivity of a wide anti-human panel of commercial antibodies on formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples and to describe the distribution of roe and fallow deer main immune cell subsets in the lymph nodes and spleen. Twenty retromandibular lymph nodes (RLNs) and spleen samples were collected from 10 roe deer and 10 fallow deer and were tested by a panel of 12 commercial anti-human antibodies. The CD79a, CD20, CD3, Iba-1, MAC387, and AM-3K antibodies were successfully labeled cells in cervine tissue, while the Foxp3 and the CD68 did not show suitable immunostaining. This study supplies the first immunohistochemical description of immune cell subpopulations in non-pathological spleen and RLNs from roe and fallow deer and provides an easily repeatable manual IHC protocol to immunolocalize cervine B-, T-cells, and macrophages subsets in FFPE tissue samples.

AB  - Sheep ectoparasites such as chewing lice, fleas and ticks are serious constraints to sheep productivity and are the cause of skin lesions in animals that decrease their market value. This study aims at investigating the ectoparasite fauna infesting small ruminants in the district of Sidi Bouzid (central Tunisia). A total of 1243 Barbarine and Queue Fine de l'Ouest (QFO) sheep were examined every two months for one year. Of the total animals examined, 74 were infested by at least 1 parasite group (5.95%). Three ectoparasite groups were identified as Psoroptes ovis (0.48%; 6/1243), ticks (5.3%; n = 66/1243) and one specimen of Ctenocephalides canis (0.08%; n = 1/1243). The most abundant tick among the 358 specimens was Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato (n = 337; 94.1%), followed by Hyalomma impeltatum (n = 7/358; 1.9%), H. dromedarii (n = 7/358; 1.9%), H. excavatum (n = 5/358; 1.4%) and only two specimens of H. scupense (n = 2/358; 0.55%). The sheep herds showed low infestation prevalence by ectoparasite over the year, with a significant difference according to the seasons (p < 0.05). A higher infestation prevalence was recorded in March (14.36%). Barbarine sheep breed showed significantly higher infestation prevalence (16.8%) compared to QFO (0.8%) (p < 0.01). There were no differences in infestation prevalence according to sex of the animal or age groups. Knowledge of the ectoparasite population harboured by sheep, its activity dynamics and risk factors is required to develop effective ectoparasite control options. The low prevalence of ectoparasite infestation in sheep reported here may be due to possible genetic resistance or simply to successful hygiene measures implemented by farmers.

AB  - The presence of Kisspeptin (Kp) and its receptors in the corpus luteum (CL) of buffalo has recently been demonstrated. In this study, we investigated the role of Kp in the modulation of progesterone (P-4) synthesis in vitro. The primary culture of bubaline luteal cells (LCs) was treated with 10, 50, and 100 nM of Kp and Kp antagonist (KpA) alongside a vehicle control. The combined effect of Kp and KpA was assessed at 100 nM concentration. Intracellular response to Kp treatment in the LCs was assessed by examining transcript profiles (LHR, STAR, CYP11A1, HSD3B1, and ERK1/2) using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). In addition, the immunolocalization of ERK1/2 and phosphorylated ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2) in the LCs was studied using immunocytochemistry. Accumulation of P-4 from the culture supernatant was determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The results indicated that LCs had a greater p-ERK1/2 expression in the Kp treatment groups. A significant increase in the P-4 concentration was recorded at 50 nM and 100 nM Kp, while KpA did not affect the basal concentration of P-4. However, the addition of KpA to the Kp-treated group at 100 nM concentration suppressed the Kp-induced P-4 accumulation into a concentration similar to the control. There was significant upregulation of ERK1/2 and CYP11A1 expressions in the Kp-treated LCs at 100 nM (18.1 and 37fold, respectively, p < 0.01). However, the addition of KpA to Kp-treated LCs modulated ERK1/2, LHR, STAR, CYP11A1, and HSD3B1 at 100 nM concentration. It can be concluded that Kp at 100 nM stimulated P-4 production, while the addition of KpA suppressed Kp-induced P-4 production in the buffalo LCs culture. Furthermore, an increment in p-ERK1/2 expression in the LCs indicated activation of the Kp signaling pathway was associated with luteal steroidogenesis.

AB  - Antibiotics have been the mainstay of infectious disease treatment for decades. However, indiscriminate antibiotic usage has led to resistance in humans and pathogens. Therefore, there is a dire need for alternative antimicrobial drugs to cure infectious illnesses. Different culinary spices, herbs, and aromatic plants are known to possess antimicrobial properties, which are associated with the compounds synthesized during secondary plant metabolism. These products are popular for their active ingredients. This study examined the antimicrobial potential of a medicinal plant (Ocimum basilicum) and its honey produced by an alternative method. Furthermore, the potential of this bioactive honey as a local antimicrobial agent was also examined against antibiotic-resistant bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and other bacterial species. The antioxidant properties of both products (honey and plant extract) were also analyzed. The antioxidant activity of Ocimum basilicum honey remained similar to other types of honey. An Ocimum basilicum honey concentration of 25 % exhibited antimicrobial activity against all the test species except Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which remained resistant to this concentration. The results revealed higher antioxidant and antibacterial efficacy of O. basilicum honey produced during this study. Escherichia coli and S. aureus (including MRSA) are the main infectious pathogens of soft tissues and skin. O. basilicum honey could be topi-cally used to treat skin bacterial infections.(c) 2023 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The decline in sheep health and meat quality caused by seasonal nutritional deficiencies has always been an important problem in the production of naturally grazing sheep. Glucose metabolism is crucial in ruminants for adequate cell function and maintenance of the body tissues and systems. However, whether glucose metabolism, especially gluconeogenesis, is affected by seasonal grazing conditions has not been fully uncovered. Thus, twelve sheep from two seasons (dry and green grass periods) in natural grazing areas of Inner Mongolia, China, were selected for this study. Their serum glucose, insulin, PC, and PEPCK levels and volatile fatty acid (gluconeogenesis material) concentrations in rumen fluid were analyzed. The expression of key enzymes including PC, PEPCK, GLUT2, and G6P of gluconeogenesis and their regulators INSR, PI3K/AKT and p53-SIRT6-Fox01 in the liver was detected by real-time PCR and western blotting. The results revealed significant variances in gluconeogenesis and its indicators and showed p53-SIRT6-Fox01 as having potential regulation in different grazing periods. This study offers new insights into the mechanism of gluconeogenesis and adaptive regulation between dry grass period and green grass period and also provides a reference for maintaining the health of sheep and meat quality despite seasonal nutritional deficiencies.

AB  - Simple Summary The meat production of Hu sheep affects the mutton supply, and how to increase the meat production is the primary focus of genetic breeding. Therefore, in order to explore the key factors affecting the proliferation and differentiation of Hu sheep skeletal muscle cells, we performed functional verification of miRNA at the cellular level. Our findings are helpful to clarify the molecular regulation mechanism of proliferation and differentiation of skeletal muscle cells, which will benefit the molecular breeding of Hu sheep. The growth and development of skeletal muscle require a series of regulatory factors. MiRNA is a non-coding RNA with a length of about 22 nt, which can inhibit the expression of mRNA and plays an important role in the growth and development of muscle cells. The role of miR-22-3p in C2C12 cells and porcine skeletal muscle has been reported, but it has not been verified in Hu sheep skeletal muscle. Through qPCR, CCK-8, EdU and cell cycle studies, we found that overexpression of miR-22-3p inhibited proliferation of skeletal muscle cells (p < 0.01). The results of qPCR and immunofluorescence showed that overexpression of miR-22-3p promoted differentiation of skeletal muscle cells (p < 0.01), while the results of inhibiting the expression of miR-22-3p were the opposite. These results suggested that miR-22-3p functions in growth and development of sheep skeletal muscle cells. Bioinformatic analysis with mirDIP, miRTargets, and RNAhybrid software suggested IGFBP3 was the target of miR-22-3p, which was confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter system assay. IGFBP3 is highly expressed in sheep skeletal muscle cells. Overexpression of IGFBP3 was found to promote proliferation of skeletal muscle cells indicated by qPCR, CCK-8, EdU, and cell cycle studies (p < 0.01). The results of qPCR and immunofluorescence experiments proved that overexpression of IGFBP3 inhibited differentiation of skeletal muscle cells (p < 0.01), while the results of interfering IGFBP3 with siRNA were the opposite. These results indicate that miR-22-3p is involved in proliferation and differentiation of skeletal muscle cells by targeting IGFBP3.

AB  - This study investigates the effects of prenatal stress induced by transient pressure fluctuations. To model this, pregnant rats were exposed to high-speed train indoor pressure (HIP) during the early stage of gestation. To assess the effects of these prenatal stressors, behavioral tests in adult offspring were conducted, focusing on both anxiety-like behaviors and emotional regulation, while hippocampus development was analyzed using histological and molecular techniques. Behavioral assessments revealed significant anxiety-like behaviors in the experimental group, indicating heightened anxiety. Further hippocampus analysis using histological techniques demonstrated a decrease in neuronal density and synaptic plasticity, particularly in the CA1 and dentate gyrus (DG) regions. Molecular analysis revealed down-regulation of glucocorticoid receptors (GR), aberrant activation of the PLC gamma 1 signaling pathway, and up-regulation of NMDAR. These molecular alterations were particularly evident in female offspring. In summary, these findings suggest that maternal exposure to transient pressure fluctuations during early pregnancy disrupts hippocampal development, leading to long-term emotional regulation deficits and anxiety-like behaviors in offspring.

AB  - Spearfishing, a common activity among Pacific Islanders, has been described to strongly modify the behaviour of target fish species. Rapa Nui (Easter Island), a remote Chilean oceanic island, has suffered a serious decline in its nearshore fish stocks through overfishing. In this study, the flight initiation distance (FID) of the Pacific rudderfish Kyphosus sandwicensis was measured at depths normally accessed by free divers and at deeper depths around Rapa Nui and the no-take Motu Motiro Hiva Marine Park (MMHMP). The overall FID at MMHMP was significantly shorter compared with that recorded in shallow waters at Rapa Nui, but did not differ from the FIDs recorded in deeper waters at Rapa Nui. The biomass of K. sandwicensis did not differ among study sites, but was significantly higher at deeper depths, supporting the hypothesis of depth refuge from fishing at Rapa Nui. Based on these findings, spatial and technical management strategies are proposed to help conserve the nearshore fish populations, such as the establishment of no-take zones and the enhancement of regulatory frameworks for coastal fisheries.

AB  - Host shifting in insect-plant systems was historically important to the development of ecological speciation theory, yet surprisingly few studies have examined whether host shifting drives diversification of marine herbivores. When small-bodied consumers feed and also mate on a preferred host, disruptive selection can split a population into host races despite gene flow. Support for host shifts is notably lacking for invertebrates associated with macroalgae, where the scale of dispersal by planktonic larvae often far exceeds the grain of host patchiness, and adults are typically less specialized than terrestrial herbivores. Here, we present a candidate example of ecological speciation in a clade of sea slugs that primarily consume green algae in the genus Caulerpa, including highly invasive species. Ancestral character state reconstructions supported 'sea grapes' (C. racemosa, C. lentillifera) as the ancestral host for a tropical radiation of 12 Elysia spp., with one shift onto alternative Caulerpa spp. in the Indo-Pacific. A Caribbean radiation of three species included symaptric host shifts to Rhipocephalus brevicaulis in the ancestor of E. pratensis Ortea & Espinosa, 1996, and to C. prolifera in E. hamanni Krug, Vendetti & Valdes 2016, plus a niche expansion to a range of Caulerpa spp. in E. subornata Verrill, 1901. All three species are broadly sympatric across the Caribbean but are host-partitioned at a fine grain, and distinct by morphology and at nuclear loci. However, non-recombining mtDNA revealed a history of gene flow between E. pratensis and E. subornata: COI haplotypes from E. subornata were 10.4% divergent from E. pratensis haplotypes from four sites, but closely related to all E. pratensis haplotypes sampled from six Bahamian islands, indicating historical introgression and localized "mitochondrial capture. " Disruptive selective likely fueled divergence and adaptation to distinct host environments, indicating ecological speciation may be an under-appreciated driver of diversification for marine herbivores as well as epibionts and other resource specialists.

AB  - The present study has documented the diversity, way of consumption, and proximate composition of various edible insects by seven tribal communities (namely Boro, Mech, Munda, Nepali, Rabha, Santal, and Toto) of sub-Himalayan West Bengal. Based on semi-structured scheduled questionnaires, 215 respondents have been interviewed, and based on the information provided by them, we have summarised a list of 23 edible insect species belonging to 17 families from 7 orders, viz., Hymenoptera (7 species), Orthoptera (6), Lepidoptera (4), Coleoptera (2), Isoptera (2), Hemiptera (1), and Dictyoptera (1). Out of seven tribes, Santals are used to consume a greater number of insect species (18 species). Locals use to collect those edible insects from various habitats using traditional collection methods. Some insects are available round the year, and some are seasonal in nature. Depending on insect species, either a particular stage of its life cycle or all the developmental stages are consumed after frying, boiling, roasting, cooking, or sometimes completely raw. Out of 23 species, 16 were documented to have therapeutic value and were utilised by the locals as a remedy for various human disorders and diseases. Analysis of the proximate composition of these edible insects depicted a good amount of protein (29.45-59.51% of dry matter), fat (0.71-56.46% of dry matter), and energy (345.75-659.13 kcal/100 g) content that is comparable to that of commercial meat sources. However, with modernisation, a downward trend was noticed among the youths of the communities on entomophagy practice, which raised an urgent issue to conserve this culture.

AB  - Capped hock affects the exterior of pedigree pigs, making them unsalable and resulting in a negative impact on the efficiency of pig-breeding centers. The purpose of this paper was to carry out pilot studies aimed at finding genomic regions and genes linked to the capped hock in pigs. The studies were carried out on Landrace pigs (n = 75) and Duroc pigs (n = 70). To identify genomic regions linked to capped hock in pigs, we used smoothing FST statistics. Genotyping was performed with GeneSeek(R) GGP Porcine HD Genomic Profiler v1 (Illumina Inc, San Diego, CA, USA). The research results showed 70 SNPs linked to capped hock in Landrace (38 SNPs) and Duroc (32 SNPs). The identified regions overlapped with QTLs related with health traits (blood parameters) and meat and carcass traits (fatness). In total, 31 genes were identified (i.e., 17 genes in Landrace, 14 genes in Durocs). Three genes appeared in both the Landrace and Duroc groups, including A2ML1 (SSC5), ROBO2 (SSC13), and MSI1 (SSC14). We identified genomic regions directly or indirectly linked to capped hock, which thus might contribute to identifying genetic variants and using them as genetic markers in pig breeding.

AB  - Background: Modern societies and policymakers increasingly emphasize the advancement of organic farming practices and the preservation of rural culture. Sheep farming faces several challenges, including environmental impacts, antibiotic usage, and public concerns regarding animal welfare. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of Melissa officinalis extract and its principal phenolic acids on the motility of the sheep jejunum and colon, with the goal of assessing their potential as health-promoting feed additives, particularly in animals with dysmotilities. Methods: The trials were performed on isolated jejunum and colon preparations collected from sheep undergoing routine slaughter. The effect of extracts from Melissa Officinalis and three major phenolic acids (rosmarinic, chlorogenic, and lithospermic) was evaluated to identify their ability to modify the spontaneous and pharmacologically-induced contractility of circular and longitudinal smooth muscle. Results: Regarding spontaneous contractions: Melissa officinalis extract, rosmarinic acid, and lithospermic acid caused a significant decrease in spontaneous contractility in the jejunum and colon, while chlorogenic acid exhibited myocontractile effects except for colon circular preparations where the effect was myorelaxant as in the other acids. In the case of ACh-induced contractions, all acids and the Melissa officinalis extract caused mostly a significant decrease in the magnitude of acetylcholine-induced contractions in both longitudinal and circular smooth muscle strips of the colon and jejunum. Conclusions: The findings suggest a predominantly myorelaxant effect of the Melissa officinalis extract and its major phenolic acids on the smooth muscle of the sheep jejunum and colon. These results underscore the potential application of the Melissa officinalis extract as a feed additive to modulate intestinal motility and address challenges in livestock production.

AB  - This study evaluated relationships among reproductive parameters and the bioclimatic indices: temperature and humidity index (THI), equivalent temperature index (ETI), black globe temperature and humidity index (BGTHI), and thermal comfort index (TCI), during the first 45 days of spermatogenesis (SP-45) and during the 15 days of sperm transit through the epididymis (STP-15) that preceded the reproductive assessments (ReA). Such information is useful in determining the optimal breeding season in Northeast Brazil. Santa Ines rams (n = 25) underwent two ReA in three periods of the year (D-P = dry; R-P = rainy and RD-P = rainy/dry transition), and the bioclimatic indices were calculated at the corresponding SP-45 and STP-15 timepoints prior to each ReA. Sperm kinetic parameters in D-P were depressed compared to R-P and RD-P (P < 0.05). The index values had an antagonistic relationship with most parameters and regression analysis demonstrated that the BGTHI and the TCI had a negative association with the progressive motility, curvilinear, straight line, and average path velocities, and a positive association with slow sperm in the ejaculate in SP-45 and STP-15 phases (P < 0.01). Semen quality kinetics is affected throughout the year by the environment and it is apparent that it is impaired in D-P and better in R-P and RD-P seasons. The BGTHI and TCI measured in the sperm production phase classified the environment most coherently and presented better association with the behavior of sperm kinetics.

KW  - PERFORMANCE
AB  - This study evaluated the productive and reproductive performances of Santa Ines sheep and their Dorper crossbreeds during the lactation period amidst the dry season in the semi-arid region of Paraiba, Brazil. Conducted at the experimental goat farm of the State University of Paraiba (UEPB), Campus IV, Catole do Rocha, the investigation included a cohort of 24 ewes (12 Santa Ines and 12 Dorper crossbreeds [comprising 87.5% Dorper and 12.5% Santa Ines]) and 30 lambs (10 males and 20 females). Observations were recorded from birth and continued at 30-day intervals up to 90 days. Using a two-way ANOVA with a 2 x 2 factorial design (two genetic groups and two sexes), the study monitored both ewes and lambs. The animals adhered to traditional regional management, grazing in paddocks by day and secured in shelters by dusk. The study found that both Santa Ines and Dorper crossbred ewes produced similar quantities of milk (P=0.8310) for the first 60 days of lactation. There was no discernible effect of the ewes' genetic backgrounds on their live weights, body condition scores at lambing, throughout the subsequent 30, 60, and 90 days of lactation, or on the overall productive efficiency and total weight of weaned lambs per ewe. In contrast, Dorper lambs demonstrated a higher weaning weight (P=0.0349) and greater weight gain (P=0.0403). The study also noted that the sex of the lambs did not notably influence their performance within the first 90 days of suckling.

AB  - High ammonia nitrogen and a low electron transfer rate result in low methane production efficiency during the pig manure digestion. This study explored the impact of magnetite-modified attapulgite (MMA) on methane production in the anaerobically digested pig manure, and the mechanisms on MMA influencing methane production. The results indicated that low doses of MMA, with loadings ranging from 1.4 to 6.9 g/L, enhanced methane production, achieving values between 146.5 and 212.5 mL/g VS with MMA loadings of 1.4 to 6.9 g/L, increasing by 2.4 % to 33.5 % compared to the control. These low doses of MMA exhibited higher hydrolytic, acidogenic and methanogenic rates, as evidenced by the increase in beta-glucosidase, dehydrogenase, and F420 activities, along with a rise in hydrolytic bacteria and Methanosarcina which facilitates interspecies electron transfer. In contrast, higher doses of MMA decreased methane production by 1.6 % to 14.5 %. This was primarily attributed to high FA and iron reduction.

AB  - Oxandrolone (OXA) is an androgen and anabolic steroid (AAS) that is used to reverse weight loss associated with some medical conditions. One of the side effects of OXA is its potential to induce depressive symptoms. Growing evidence suggested that neuroinflammation and cytokines play crucial roles in sickness behavioral and associated mood disturbances. Previous studies showed that metformin attenuated neuroinflammation. This study investigated the potential protective role of metformin against OXA-induced depression-like behavior and neuroinflammation. Twenty- four Wistar male rats were randomly grouped into four groups: the control group (Control) received only vehicle; the oxandrolone group (OXA) received oxandrolone (0.28 mg/kg, i.p); the metformin group (MET) received metformin (100 mg/kg, i.p); and the oxandrolone / metformin group (OXA + MET) received both oxandrolone (0.28 mg/kg, i.p) and metformin (100 mg/kg, i.p). These treatments were administered for fourteen consecutive days. Behavioral tests to measure depression-like behavior were conducted before and after treatments. qRT-PCR was used to measure the relative expression of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus and hypothalamus. The results showed that oxandrolone induced depression-like behavior and dysregulated pro-/anti-inflammatory cytokines, while metformin attenuated these effects. These findings suggest that metformin is a potential treatment to reverse the depressive effects induced by oxandrolone that involve neuroinflammatory effects.

AB  - Plants growing at high elevations experience different environmental stresses, such as drought, salt, and cold. Among them, cold stress is the most prevalent one that affects the plants differently. Plants undergo bio-chemical, metabolic, molecular, and physiological changes under cold stress; hence, they adopt various mechanisms to tolerate it. The antioxidant defence system, osmotic regulators, and photosynthetic pigments in the plant provide them with stress tolerance. The present study is conducted on a high-altitude plant, Picrorhiza kurroa, which grows in such environmental conditions, to study the physiological parameters that provide a coping mechanism against cold stress. For this study, the leaves were collected from Pothivasa (2200 m.a.s.l) and Tungnath (3600 m.a.s.l) in Rudraprayag, Uttarakhand, India. The photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll a, chloro-phyll b, and carotenoids), lipid peroxidation, antioxidant enzymes, namely, superoxide dismutase, catalase, guaiacol peroxidase, ascorbate peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and osmoprotectants (protein, soluble sugar, and proline) present in the leaves were determined to visualize the impact of cold stress. It was revealed that the concentration of photosynthetic pig-ments increased with elevation. The activity of enzymes was analyzed, and they were observed to decrease with altitude. The malondialdehyde concentration, an indicator of lipid peroxidation, is higher in Pothivasa and lower in Tungnath. There is a significant increase in the osmoprotectants' content along the altitudinal gradient. Therefore, the leaves from both sampling locations revealed the physiological changes that occurred in them to adapt to the cold stress conditions.

AB  - The tea aphid Toxoptera aurantii Boyer, is a devastating pest to the tea plant (Camellia sinensis). Tea plants can emit a broad spectrum of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and patterns of volatile emission are significantly influenced by the type of herbivory. In current work, we examined how the overall profile of volatiles changes in response to varying levels of tea aphid infestation by multivariate and network analysis. Notable changes in multivariate volatile profiles were found upon tea aphid infestation. Multiple dimension reduction methods demonstrated that volatile emissions from tea plants underwent systemic changes in response to varying densities of tea aphid feeding. As infestation intensified, the Shannon entropy and the uniformity of volatile abundances were intricately adjusted, providing key insights into how the tea plant dynamically modulates the response against herbivore attack. The complexity of volatile network was obviously increased, accompanied by decreased modularity and enhanced positive associations. Our current work interprets volatile emission as an integrated system, exploring how the association patterns within the volatile network are intricately rewired in response to varying levels of tea aphid infestation. The combinatorial application of multivariate methods and network analyses offers a novel perspective for studying tea plant volatiles, enhancing our understanding of their roles in tea plant response against tea aphid feeding.

AB  - Whipworms, parasitic worms found in soil, can infect multiple host species. Our research involved collecting five adult female Trichuris from a gerbil (Meriones meridianus) and eight from a ground squirrel (Spermophilus alaschanicus), captured in September 2022 on the eastern slopes of the Helan Mountains in Ningxia Province. We identified 13 whipworms from the two rodents using morphology and molecular markers. No significant egg size variation was found (P>0.05). Phylogenetic analyses, utilizing Cytochrome c Oxidase subunit I (COI) and Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) gene sequences, showed both Trichuris populations belonged to Trichuris arvicolae. Further analysis indicated minimal genetic divergence (Fst=0.23 for COI, 0.00 for ITS) and reproductive isolation (Nm=0.83 for COI, infinite for ITS). Despite gerbils being nocturnal and ground squirrels being diurnal, leading to nonoverlapping activity times, both rodents share overlapping habitats. Consequently, the coexistence of these two rodents infected with the same species of Trichuris arvicolae is not unexpected.

AB  - Simple Summary The study focuses on improving how we feed pigs to reduce costs and be more environmentally friendly. Traditionally, pigs are fed in phases with their diet changing at set growth stages. This often leads to overfeeding and waste. A new method called the daily fit model (DFM), which adjusts the diet daily based on the pigs' needs, was explored. By comparing this new approach with the traditional method, it was found that the DFM significantly reduces the intake of key nutrients like protein and phosphorus without affecting the pigs' growth. This means lower costs for farmers and less environmental impact from pig farming. The simplified approach makes it easier for farmers to adopt precision feeding without advanced technology or extensive training. This method can help farmers save money, reduce waste, and promote sustainable farming practices.Abstract Precision feeding is an excellent alternative to conventional phase feeding systems for growing-finishing pigs, especially with increasing feeding costs and environmental sustainability concerns. However, precision feeding strategies sometimes require advanced technologies such as electronic devices and the modernization of pig facilities. In addition to hardware implementation, precision feeding is frequently related to mathematical difficulties due to a lack of professionals trained in decision making. Therefore, this study compares a conventional phase feeding model (CON) and a daily fit model (DFM) with a simplified approach to the conscious use of nutrients for pig production. A simulation study was conducted using growth curves of barrow pigs, following three nutritional recommendations for conventional phase feeding. Once the nutrient requirements for CON were determined, these diets were used for the DFM by anticipating a proportional percentage of the next phase diet in the current diet. This simple adjustment does not impair the growth performance of pigs. However, in this study, the DFM showed promise during the growing-finishing phases to reduce pigs' costs and nutrient intakes, such as crude protein, lysine, and digestible phosphorus, up to 5.58, 7.11 and 9.13%, respectively. In conclusion, the DFM can effectively reduce costs, minimize environmental impact, and promote sustainable practices. Also, this industry-wide adoption of this simplified precision feeding strategy could play a vital role in swine farmers' challenges, fostering broader environmental benefits and improved resource efficiency.

AB  - In mutualistic symbioses with fungi, herbivorous insects such as bark beetles (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae) gain access to resources that are unavailable in the absence of fungal mutualists, while fungi benefit from insect-vectored dispersal. The most well-studied mutualists of tree-killing bark beetles in conifer systems are certain ophiostomatoid fungi (Ascomycota: Ophiostomatales and Microascales) that benefit beetles through their nutritional and phytopathogenic activities. The alder bark beetle, Alniphagus aspericollis, is a hardwood-infesting bark beetle living with a non-ophiostomatoid associate, Neonectria bordenii, in its red alder, Alnus rubra, host. We evaluated the hypothesis that the alder bark beetle-N. bordenii association represents a symbiosis similar to tree-killing bark beetle-ophiostomatoid mutualisms in conifer systems by assessing the tree-killing ability of the alder bark beetle and testing the prediction that the beetle vectors the fungus among host trees. We tested this prediction according to Leach's postulates for an insect vector of a plant-associated microbe. Emergent alder bark beetles were collected across three dispersal flights and five locations throughout southwestern British Columbia, Canada, in a single season, and assessed for presence/absence of N. bordenii by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and culturing. Phloem samples (beetle-attacked and not attacked) collected from bolts from a laboratory transmission experiment and trees in situ were also analyzed by qPCR for presence/absence of N. bordenii. The alder bark beetle attacked apparently healthy red alders across sites and was determined to have caused mortality of 86% of colonized trees. N. bordenii was detected in 98% (n = 214/218) of individual beetles by qPCR, and viable N. bordenii was recovered from 46% (n = 103/223) of beetles by culturing. qPCR analysis of phloem samples originating from a transmission experiment and trees attacked under natural conditions revealed that alder bark beetles introduce N. bordenii into phloem from healthy red alders (laboratory transmission rate = 42%). Our results indicate that the alder bark beetle vectors N. bordenii among host red alders and that the association between these two organisms is thus symbiotic. The consistent presence of N. bordenii across samples and locations suggests that this symbiosis may represent a unique bark beetle-fungus mutualism in red alder.

AB  - Q fever is an important zoonotic disease perceived to be an occupational hazard for those working with livestock. Outbreaks involving large numbers of people are uncommon, but the increasing case incidence coupled with changing environmental and industry conditions that promote transmission of Q fever has raised concerns that large and serious outbreaks could become more frequent. The aim of this study was to use expert opinion to better understand how large Q fever outbreaks might occur in an Australian context and to document factors believed to be drivers of disease transmission. Focus groups were conducted with human and animal health professionals across several Australian states. All discussions were recorded, transcribed verbatim and imported into NVIVO for thematic analysis. Four anthropogenic risk factors (disease awareness, industry practices, land use, human behaviour) and three ecological risk factors (physical environment, agent dissemination, animal hosts) emerged from the data. Analysis of expert opinions pointed to the existence of numerous scenarios in which Q fever outbreaks could occur, many of which depict acquisition in the wider community outside of traditional at-risk occupations. This perception of the expansion of Q fever from occupational-acquisition to community-acquisition is driven by greater overarching economic, political and socio-cultural influences that govern the way in which people live and work. Findings from this study highlight that outbreaks are complex phenomena that involve the convergence of diverse elements, not just that of the pathogen and host, but also the physical, political and socioeconomic environments in which they interact. A review of the approaches to prevent and manage Q fever outbreaks will require a multisectorial approach and strengthening of community education, communication and engagement so that all stakeholders become an integrated part of outbreak mitigation and response.

AB  - Rosalia funebris (RFUNE; Cerambycidae), the banded alder borer, is a longhorn beetle whose larvae feed on the wood of various economically and ecologically significant trees in western North America. Adults are short-lived and not known to consume plant material substantially. We sequenced, assembled, and annotated the RFUNE genome using HiFi and RNASeq data. We documented genome architecture and gene content, focusing on genes putatively involved in plant feeding (phytophagy). Comparisons were made to the well-studied genome of the Asian longhorned beetle (AGLAB; Anoplophora glabripennis) and other Cerambycidae. The 814 Mb RFUNE genome assembly was distributed across 42 contigs, with an N50 of 30.18 Mb. Repetitive sequences comprised 60.27% of the genome, and 99.0% of expected single-copy orthologous genes were fully assembled. We identified 12,657 genes, fewer than in the four other species studied, and 46.4% fewer than for Aromia moschata (same subfamily as RFUNE). Of the 7,258 orthogroups shared between RFUNE and AGLAB, 1,461 had more copies in AGLAB and 1,023 had more copies in RFUNE. We identified 240 genes in RFUNE that putatively arose via horizontal transfer events. The RFUNE genome encoded substantially fewer putative plant cell wall degrading enzymes than AGLAB, which may relate to the longer-lived plant-feeding adults of the latter species. The RFUNE genome provides new insights into cerambycid genome architecture and gene content and provides a new vantage point from which to study the evolution and genomic basis of phytophagy in beetles.

AB  - Listeria monocytogenes is a pathogen of great concern to the food industry. The present study was aimed to explore the clonal relationships amongst L. monocytogenes strains isolated from foods of animal origin (milk, beef, chevon (goat meat), pork and chicken) and fish. Forty-seven L. monocytogenes strains were characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The PFGE analysis using ApaI and AscI enzymes revealed 37 pulsotypes, with Simpson's discriminatory index of 0.987. This study demonstrated the presence of a few similar L. monocytogenes pulsotypes in different foods of animal origin in different places and years of isolation and this indicates that some L. monocytogenes subtypes may be ubiquitous which are acclimatizing and persisting in different foods of animal origin. This also emphasizes the importance of cross-contamination in local wet markets. Thus, the understanding of genetic diversity will contribute to the development of rational and workable strategies to control this important zoonotic infection.

AB  - The Dromedary camel has a remarkable history amongst cultures across Asia and northern Africa, serving multiple purposes ranging from providing milk, textiles, racing, and acting as pack animals. Recent genetic studies have revealed that many dromedaries are genetically homogenous, indicating that they do not represent different breeds, advocating for camel "type" over camel "breed." In this study, we leveraged whole genome sequencing (WGS) to sequence 15 Jordanian Alia camels for the first time, alongside 9 Jordanian mixed camels from diverse locations within the country. Additionally, we analyzed 48 publicly available whole genomes of dromedary camels from the Arabian Peninsula for comparison. We demonstrate that the Alia camel is a distinct breed of camel, carefully bred in Jordan for racing and milk production. Compared with other dromedary camels, the Alia is genetically distinct and a unique breed that should be conserved. Our data further suggest that WGS of different camel populations may identify additional breeds and inform approaches to optimize traits and preserve genetic diversity.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Growth is a biological phenomenon that usually happens with increased mass or volume over time. The transition from birth to postweaning has a fundamental impact on characteristics specific to the development and growth of the digestive tract. Consequently, the growth performance in goat kids is due to the combined effects of age, rumen development, and feeding system, which controls the growth patterns of each stage. Generally, the development of rumen is in stages. Therefore, modeling informative growth curves is of great importance for a better understanding of effective development patterns for optimizing feeding management systems for improved production efficiency. For the above reasons, this study was conducted to compare the sigmoid and polynomial models which were used to determine the age-related changes in body weight, body size indices, and digestive tract development; and to identify the most appropriate model. These empirical mathematical models of growth patterns are continuous functions of time and have biologically meaningful parameters that can be used to predict growth efficiently. In light of these models which lack sufficient information in literature, further research about different species of goats in different environments is still needed, thereby enabling us to distinguish more accurate results.
   The transition from monogastric to rumination stage is crucial in ruminants' growth to avoid stressors-weaning and neonatal mortalities. Poor growth of the digestive tract could adversely affect the performance of the animal. Modeling informative growth curves is of great importance for a better understanding of the effective development pattern, in order to optimize feeding management system, and to achieve more production efficiency. However, little is known about the digestive tract growth curves. For this reason, one big goat farm of Laiwu black breed was chosen as a basis of this study. Forty-eight kids belonging to eight-time points (1, 7, 14, 28, 42, 56, 70, and 84 d; 6 kids for each) were selected and slaughtered. The body weight, body size indices, rumen pH, and stomach parts were determined and fitted to the polynomial and sigmoidal models. In terms of goodness of fit criteria, the Gompertz model was the best model for body weight, body oblique length, tube, and rumen weight. Moreover, the Logistic model was the best model for carcass weight, body height, and chest circumference. In addition, the Quadratic model showed the best fit for dressing percentage, omasum weight, abomasum weight, and rumen volume. Moreover, the cubic model best fitted the ruminal pH and reticulum percentage. The Weibull model was the best model for the reticulum weight and omasum percentage, while the MMF model was the best model describing the growth of chest depth, rumen percentage, and abomasum percentage. The model parameters, R squared, inflection points, area under curve varied among the different dependent variables. The Pearson correlation showed that the digestive tract development was more correlated with age than body weight, but the other variables were more correlated with body weight than age. The study demonstrated the use of empirical sigmoidal and polynomial models to predict growth rates of the digestive tract at relevant age efficiently.

AB  - The 18th Symposium on Insect-Plant Relationships (SIP-18) took place in Bielefeld, Germany, in August 2024. Since the previous meeting (SIP-17) could be executed only online because of the pandemic, we enjoyed meeting in person even more. The conference has resulted in five exciting contributions to the journal Entomologia Experimentalis et Applicata. Two of these are reviews, one presenting an overview of the arthropod fauna associated with the plant genus Annona and the other providing an ecological and evolutionary perspective on pharmacophagy-that is, the attraction of insects to plant specialized metabolites and their use for purposes other than nutrition in insects. Three research articles show original work on differential gene expression in larvae sequestering plant metabolites, resistance to thrips in several Chrysanthemum accessions, and the role of light intensity in physical defense against native and invasive caterpillar species in trees, respectively. These articles are presented in this themed issue as the proceedings of SIP-18, in addition to nine other articles relevant to the research field of insect-plant relationships.

AB  - Identifying pests associated with novel crops is important for forecasting impacts on their production and determining if they could be reservoirs of pests moving over onto cash crops. We carried out preliminary pest surveys in two bioenergy crops, carinata (Brassica carinata Alexander Braun (Brassicaceae)) and camelina (Camelina sativa (Linnaeus) Crantz (Brassicaceae)), and a cover crop mix under evaluation to replace fallow in rotations with wheat. Insect pests were sampled in each of the three crops over two years. Crucifer flea beetles, Phyllotreta cruciferae Goeze (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), dominated the pest complex associated with carinata and the cover crop mix, comprising more than 70% of the insects sampled. In contrast, the pest complex associated with camelina was dominated (40-91%) by generalist Lygus spp. (Heteroptera: Miridae). Crucifer flea beetles were 200-1000 times more abundant in carinata than in camelina, suggesting that they could be a serious pest of carinata. Camelina, in contrast, appears less likely to be attacked by, or serve as a reservoir for, crucifer flea beetles. Future work to assess feeding damage and population buildup of pests in these crops is needed to determine impacts on their production and the extent to which they may be reservoirs of canola pests over broader spatial scales.

AB  - The present study aimed to investigate the Doppler indices and mRNA transcripts of hormone receptors in relation to the response of dilatation therapy in incomplete cervical dilatation (ICD) associated with uterine torsion in buffaloes. Out of 36 successfully detorted uterine torsion cases, eight buffaloes revealed a fully dilated cervix, while the remaining 28 had ICD, and subjected to dilatation therapy (500 mu g cloprostenol + 2 mg estradiol benzoate + 80 mg valethamate bromide + 50 IU oxytocin + 250 mL calcium borogluconate). The responses of dilatation therapy were assessed in 26 buffaloes as one died, and one could not follow up. Doppler indices of middle uterine arteries on trans-rectal ultrasound were evaluated pre- and 30-60 min post-detorsion. Cervical tissue biopsies were collected from 16 buffaloes to study mRNA transcripts of hormone receptors. The duration, degree, location of uterine torsion, fetal viability, consistency of the cervix, relaxation of pelvic ligaments, udder engorgement, and gestation length were also recorded to evaluate the response of dilatation therapy. The 73.08% (19/26) buffaloes responded to the therapy with a duration ranging from 2 to 56 hrs (18.41 +/- 4.11). The significantly increased blood flow volume (BFV) and time-average peak velocity (TAP) while the significantly reduced resistive index (RI) and pulsatility index (PI) in an ipsilateral middle uterine artery (MUA) at post-detorsion were observed in dilation therapy responded than the not-responded group. The mRNA transcripts of estradiol receptors-alpha (ESR1), prostaglandin receptors (PTGFR), and oxytocin receptors (OXTR) were upregulated by 7.47, 6.63, and 8.72-fold in the ICD group, respectively. The Doppler indices along with duration of illness, location of uterine torsion, consistency of the cervix, and udder engorgement can be used to predict the response of dilatation therapy in ICD associated with uterine torsion. The upregulated mRNA expression of ESR1, PTGFR and OXTR is mandatory for success of dilatation therapy.

AB  - The present study evaluated the presence of Anaplasma species in questing ticks from six sites with opposing land usage (i.e., protected natural areas or livestock establishments) within the Ibera wetlands ecoregion in Argentina. The ticks were determined as Amblyomma dubitatum (n = 15,096), Rhipicephalus microplus (n = 399), Amblyomma triste (n = 134), Haemaphysalis juxtakochi (n = 5), and Amblyomma tigrinum (n = 1). Using a real-time PCR assay targeting the 16S rRNA gene, Anaplasma sp. was detected in A. dubitatum samples (one nymph, three nymph pools and one larvae pool) and one R. microplus larvae pool. The overall minimum infection rate (MIR) for Anaplasma sp. in questing A. dubitatum nymphs was 0.169% (0.175% in protected natural areas and 0% in livestock establishments). For R. microplus, overall Anaplasma sp. MIR was 0.25% (0.52% in protected natural areas and 0% in livestock establishments). Phylogenetic analysis positioned the Anaplasma sp. from A. dubitatum in the same clade as Anaplasma odocoilei, whereas the Anaplasma sp. from R. microplus was related to Anaplasma platys. In conclusion, these results support a possible role of A. dubitatum in the ecology of the Anaplasma agent reported to infect capybaras in the region.

AB  - Agroforestry systems (AFS) offer sustainable alternatives to monoculture for crops such as yerba mate (Ilex paraguariensis). This study assessed the impact of AFS and monoculture on yield, secondary metabolites, and physiological responses of yerba mate plants, alongside seasonal variations in microclimatic conditions and herbivory attacks. The AFS, featuring Toona ciliata intercropped with yerba mate, provided approximately 45% shade, reducing extreme temperatures and thermal fluctuations. While yerba mate in monoculture exhibited higher photosynthetic capacity, plants in AFS developed morphological adaptations, such as thinner leaves, enhancing performance under shade. Herbivory was initially higher in AFS during spring but equalized between systems later in the season. Secondary metabolite profiles were similar across both systems, indicating no compromise in product quality. Despite distinct microclimatic conditions, crop yields were comparable between systems. These results highlight the capacity of AFS to buffer environmental stress, enhance plant resilience, and maintain productivity, reinforcing its potential as a sustainable cultivation strategy in a changing climate. Adaptive management that integrates seasonal and phenological dynamics could further optimize system performance.

AB  - Rodents use direct and/or indirect cues of predators to assess predation risk. The responses to these cues are well studied with regard to mammalian predators, but less understood with regard to reptilian predators. These responses are of particular importance in tropical and subtropical regions where reptile diversity is high and the likelihood of establishment of invasive reptilian predators also is high. We hypothesized that rodents would respond to direct scent cues of snake predators and that rodents would show greater aversion to scents of native snake predators than non-native snake predators. To assess this, scents of three snake species, two native and one non-native, and a non-snake control odor were distributed in Sherman live traps using a randomized block design. A total of 69 rodents representing four species were captured. Responses varied by species reinforcing that some species utilize indirect cues to assess predation risk, whereas others use direct cues. Moreover, one species (Neotoma floridana) showed a preference for non-native Python scent, indicating a lack of the appropriate anti-predator behavior, suggesting that some native rodents are more at risk of attack from invasive snakes than other native rodents.

AB  - A new method for calculating the population density of terrestrial animals, which are not amenable to individual identification, using photos or video images obtained by automatic cameras is proposed for discussion. The method is based on the continuous registration of animals on sites formed by the detection zones of camera traps with subsequent extrapolation of the results to the entire study area. A much simpler mathematical apparatus is the significant difference between our proposed method and other methods of accounting by camera traps, which allows it to be applied by a wide range of users. Both the positional measures and the scattering measures necessary for subsequent statistical analysis are calculated quite easily. Furthermore, one of our method's advantages is that it is not necessary to know the speed of animal movement, the most difficult parameter to calculate, especially in the snowless period of the year. An example of using the bootstrap method is given for the case when the input data distribution parameters do not correspond to the normal ones. Using the de Moivre-Laplace theorem, the probability that the animals resting in their beds would get into the detection zone of the camera trap matrices is estimated, which is necessary for the correct use of the method proposed. Solutions are proposed for cases when this probability is low. The problems of our proposed method and possible solutions are described. An example of calculating the density of roe deer in the open oak forest of Khingan Nature Reserve is given on the basis of our data obtained from four camera traps.

AB  - Probiotics have been proven to improve the growth performance of livestock and poultry. The aim of this experiment was to investigate the effects of probiotic supplementation on the growth performance; rumen and intestinal microbiota; rumen fluid, serum, and urine metabolism; and rumen epithelial cell transcriptomics of fattening meat sheep. Twelve Hu sheep were selected and randomly divided into two groups. They were fed a basal diet (CON) or a basal diet supplemented with 1.5 x 10(8) CFU/g probiotics (PRB). The results show that the average daily weight gain, and volatile fatty acid and serum antioxidant capacity concentrations of the PRB group were significantly higher than those of the CON group (p < 0.05). Compared to the CON group, the thickness of the rumen muscle layer in the PRB group was significantly decreased (p < 0.01); the thickness of the duodenal muscle layer in the fattening sheep was significantly reduced; and the length of the duodenal villi, the thickness of the cecal and rectal mucosal muscle layers, and the thickness of the cecal, colon, and rectal mucosal layers (p < 0.05) were significantly increased. At the genus level, the addition of probiotics altered the composition of the rumen and intestinal microbiota, significantly upregulating the relative abundance of Subdivision5_genera_incertae_sedis and Acinetobacter in the rumen microbiota, and significantly downregulating the relative abundance of Butyrivibrio, Saccharofermentans, and Fibrobacter. The relative abundance of faecalicoccus was significantly upregulated in the intestinal microbiota, while the relative abundance of Coprococcus, Porphyromonas, and Anaerobacterium were significantly downregulated (p < 0.05). There were significant differences in the rumen, serum, and urine metabolites between the PRB group and the CON group, with 188, 138, and 104 metabolites (p < 0.05), mainly affecting pathways such as vitamin B2, vitamin B3, vitamin B6, and a series of amino acid metabolisms. The differential genes in the transcriptome sequencing were mainly enriched in protein modification regulation (especially histone modification), immune function regulation, and energy metabolism. Therefore, adding probiotics improved the growth performance of fattening sheep by altering the rumen and intestinal microbiota; the rumen, serum, and urine metabolome; and the transcriptome.

AB  - Simple Summary During pig production, organic chromium is usually added to the feed to supplement the chromium needed for pig growth and metabolism. However, different types of organic chromium have different effects on the addition period and dosage. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to analyze the effect of adding organic chromium in pig feed by means of meta-analysis. The results show that organic chromium can improve the average daily gain and average daily intake of pigs. At the same time, the effect of adding in the weaning stage is better than that in the growing and finishing stage. Many factors influence the effects of exogenous organic chromium (EO-Cr) on the growth performance and carcass qualities of weaned and growing-finishing pigs, such as pig growth stages, types of EO-Cr, period of supplementation, and farm management. However, it is challenging to comprehensively consider all factors in one study. To solve this problem, we searched all relative literature published from 1 January 2000 to 1 January 2023, to systematically analyze and review the effects of EO-Cr on pig growth performance and carcass qualities via meta-analysis. Thirty-five papers were filtered and analyzed, which involved 4366 pigs. The results showed that, for weaned piglets, EO-Cr diets significantly increased the average daily gain (ADG, p < 0.001) and average daily feed intake (ADFI, p = 0.022) but reduced the feed-gain ratio (p = 0.004). In addition, for growing-finishing pigs, EO-Cr supplementation significantly increased the ADG (p < 0.001), carcass lean ratio (p = 0.020), and loin muscle area (p < 0.001), but had no significant effect on the ADFI (p = 0.071), feed-gain ratio (p = 0.692), dressing percent (p = 0.989), or back fat thickness (p = 0.142). Moreover, the effect of EO-Cr was greater in weaned piglets than in growing-finishing pigs. In terms of the dose effect of the supplement, chromium nicotinate is the most suitable EO-Cr type for weaned piglets with an optimal dosage range of 0.125-0.150 mg/kg. On the other hand, chromium picolinate is the most suitable EO-Cr type for growing-finishing pigs with an optimal dosage range of 0.250-0.300 mg/kg. In conclusion, EO-Cr supplementation is beneficial for enhancing the growth performance and carcass qualities of both weaned and growing-finishing pigs.

AB  - Shooting ranges contain copper (Cu) and lead (Pb) contamination, which can be a risk for grazing ruminants. This study examines the accumulation of lead and copper in blood of lambs and calves, as well as in the liver of lambs. It compares these results with those of a previous study, which calculated the ingested dose of copper and lead based on soil ingestion and concentration in soil and plants. Blood samples were collected both before and after the grazing period that lasted from late May to mid-September. Liver samples were obtained during the slaughter of the lambs in the fall. Out of 61 liver samples, only one (3.7 mg Pb/kg dw) exceeding the presumed normal level in lamb liver of 3 mg/kg (dw). Copper concentrations exceeding the normal (300 mg/kg dw) concentration was found in 14 of the liver samples (341-1877 mg Cu/kg dw). Among these, two liver samples (1069 and 1877 mg Cu/kg dw) exceeded the level at which sheep are poisoned (1000 mg/kg dw). There was no statistically significant difference in the copper and lead concentration in liver of lambs that did and did not have the shooting range as part of their pasture. The average concentration of copper (lamb: 1.1 +/- 0.37 mu g Cu/g, calves: 0.6 +/- 0.16 mu g Cu/g) and lead (lamb: 0.010 +/- 0.008 mu g Pb/g calves: 0.01 +/- 0.014 mu g Pb/g) in the blood samples collected from the lambs and calves did not exceed the upper limit of what is considered normal (sheep: 1.35 mg Cu/kg and 0.3 mg Pb/kg, cattle: 1.7 mg Cu/kg and 0.35 mg Pb/kg). Copper concentration in the blood was notably higher in samples collected from the sheep before (1.3 +/- 0.35 mu g Cu/g) compared to after (0.8 +/- 0.22 mu g Cu/g) the grazing period. No statistically significant difference was found in lead and copper concentrations in the blood of lambs and calves grazing inside (lamb: 0.7 +/- 0.21 mu g Cu/g and 0.01 +/- 0.008 mu g Pb/g, calves: 0.6 +/- 0.16 mu g Cu/g and 0.02 +/- 0.020 mu g Pb/g) and outside (lamb: 0.9 +/- 0.21 mu g Cu/g and 0.13 +/- 0.008 mu g Pb/g, calves: 0.6 +/- 0.17 mu g Cu/g and 0.009 mu g Pb/g) the shooting range. Grazing on areas contaminated by shooting activity did not appear to have any major implications for the accumulation of copper and lead in blood of cattle and sheep, as well as in the liver of sheep. The findings from this study indicate that employing site specific risk assessments for ruminants incorporating soil ingestion represents a viable approach.

AB  - Plants may compensate for herbivory damage by reallocating resources and altering growth patterns, which may be further influenced by environmental variables like nutrient availability. We compared the impacts of fertilizer applications on the growth attributes of Brazilian peppertree before and after releasing Pseudophilothrips ichini (Thysanoptera: Phlaeothripidae), an approved biological control agent. A garden plot containing 96-103 saplings was established at two research sites in Florida: one site with high background soil nitrogen and one with 1/ 4 the background soil nitrogen. Each plant was randomly assigned a permanent fertilizer supplement (24N-8P16K) administered bimonthly: no fertilizer n = 69 (0 g/L), medium fertilizer n = 66 (0.8 g/L), or high fertilizer n = 66 (3.6 g/L). Thrips were released after 22 months and releases continued every 1-3 months. Plant growth attributes were collected approximately monthly from October 2017 to April 2021. Crown volume and height steadily increased at both plots, but greater rates of increase were observed for plants with higher supplemental fertilizer at the lower nitrogen site. Thrips had negligible impact on plant attributes at the high nitrogen site. In contrast, the density of stem tips at the low nitrogen site increased dramatically following thrips release and was greatest for plants with high supplemental fertilizer. Additionally, the percentage of dead tips quadrupled during the second year of thrips releases, but tip mortality was greatest for plants with medium supplemental fertilizer. Fertilized plants produced more unseasonal axillary vegetative buds after thrips attack at the low nitrogen site, providing new resources to sustain thrips numbers. Soil nitrogen levels at natural field sites may therefore impact thrips performance.

AB  - The co-digestion of Scenedesmus obliquus-the raw (RB), the mechanically disrupted (DB) and the residual microalgal biomass after protein extraction (PEB)-with coffee processing wastewater (CPW) was assessed. Mono-digestion of microalgae biomass yielded 18.2, 70.6 and 39.6 mLCH(4) gVS(-1) for RB, DB and PEB, respectively. However, alkaline conditions used to increase protein extraction also promoted an enrichment of biogas (90% methane). The co-digestion presented maximum production of 269.6 mLCH(4) gVS(-1)(DB: CPW 75: 25), attributed to the higher anaerobic biodegradability of the CPW (343.3 mLCH(4) gVS(-1)) and the pH of substrates. In the kinetic study, the Cone model presented a good fit. Mono-digestion of PEB and CPW exhibited higher values for k (1st order coefficient), while co-digestion improve k values for RB and DB. Results suggest that co-digestion contributed to the anaerobic digestion stability in terms of alkalinity, increased microalgae biodegradability and, particularly with PEB, enables an integrated waste management.

AB  - Knowledge of the body composition of growing pigs is of interest to breeding companies and producers, as it can be used to optimize production. As an emerging noninvasive technology computed tomography (CT) has been extensively applied in animal production studies. Recently, deep learning has generated new insights in medical image segmentation. In this paper, we describe a noninvasive method to automatically divide and quantify the composition of live pigs based on CT imaging and the application of deep neural network. The method consists of torso segmentation, visceral tissue removal, and identification and quantification of bone, lean meat, and fat using CT scans. The challenge addressed by this method is to identify the internal organs with complex structures and variable densities, the heart, lung, liver, stomach, spleen, kidney, colon, cecum, esophagus, jejunum, uterine horn, bladder, ureter, and rectum. We developed a bidirectional convolutional residual (BCR) framework to automatically and precisely segment the internal organs in a set of CT scans, and all internal organs share one label to remove these organs at once. To facilitate comparison with previous models, we tested BCR framework and found that it outperforms the classical approaches U-Net, residual U-Net (Res-U-Net) and dense U-Net (Dense-U-Net). We experimented on 40 pigs and compared our method with manual dissection. The results correlated well, and demonstrate that our method can accurately estimate the body composition proportion of fat, lean meat and bone?of live pigs, so the method will be valuable for livestock production.

AB  - African swine fever, caused by the African swine fever virus (ASFV), is a viral hemorrhagic disease that affects domestic pigs and wild boars. ASFV infection causes extensive tissue damage, and the associated mechanism is poorly understood. Pyroptosis is characterized by the activation of inflammatory caspases and pore formation in the cellular plasma membrane, resulting in the release of inflammatory cytokines and cell damage. How ASFV infection regulates pyroptosis remains unclear. Here, using siRNA assay and overexpression methods, we report that ASFV infection regulated pyroptosis by cleaving the pyroptosis execution protein gasdermin A (GSDMA). ASFV infection activated caspase-3 and caspase-4, which specifically cleaved GSDMA at D75-P76 and D241-V242 to produce GSDMA into five fragments, including GSDMA-N1-75, GSDMA-N1-241, and GSDMA-N76-241 fragments at the N-terminal end of GSDMA. Only GSDMA-N1-241, which was produced in the late stage of ASFV infection, triggered pyroptosis and inhibited ASFV replication. The fragments, GSDMA-N1-75 and GSDMA-N76-241, lose the ability to induce pyroptosis. anism for the regulation of pyroptosis.

AB  - The experiment was designed to evaluate the consequence of a blend of garlic oil and cinnamon bark powder administration on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, immunity, antioxidant status and methane emission in Murrah buffalo (Bubalus bubalis). Sixteen buffalo calves were divided into two groups in a completely randomised design. The first group (CONT) was fed a basal diet of wheat straw, green oats and concentrate mixture, whereas the second group (GOCB) received feeds as per the CONT along with a blend of garlic oil and cinnamon bark powder (0.5 mL + 1.0 g/head/day) by mixing it with the concentrate mixture for a period of 170 days. The growth rate and feed efficiency in GOCB group buffalo calves were improved (20%) with better (p < 0.05) digestibility of organic matter and crude proteins. Buffaloes of the GOCB group revealed enhanced (p < 0.05) immunity and antioxidant enzymes with reduced (p < 0.05) lipid peroxidation (26% less MDA production). The methane concentration in the eructed gas of the GOCB buffaloes was reduced (33.88%) in comparison with the CONT (p < 0.01). Thus, feed formulated with a blend of garlic oil-cinnamon bark powder demonstrates improvements in the health and production performances of buffalo calves.

AB  - Procainamide (PA) and its in vivo metabolite, N-acetylprocainamide (NAPA), display some pharmacological differences. Although it is agreed that PA is a class IA antiarrhythmic, it has been reported that NAPA is a pure class III antiarrhythmic that affects only the repolarizing phase of the cardiac action potential. This last concept, observed exclusively in dogs, gained wide acceptance, appearing in classic pharmacology textbooks. However, evidence in species such as mice and rats indicates that NAPA can affect cardiac Na+ channels, which is unexpected for a pure class III antiarrhythmic drug. To further clarify this issue, the effects of PA (used as a reference drug) and NAPA on the maximum upstroke velocity (Vmax) and half-decay time (HDT) of the cardiac action potential were examined in the isolated right papillans magnus of the guinea pig heart. Both PA and NAPA affected Vmax at lower concentrations than required to affect HDT, and NAPA had weaker effects on both variables. Thus, NAPA displayed typical class IA antiarrhythmic behavior. Therefore, the concept that NAPA is a pure class III antiarrhythmic drug is more species-dependent than previously envisioned. In addition, we demonstrated that the differential pharmacology of PA and NAPA is explainable, in molecular terms, by steric hindrance of the effects of NAPA and the greater number of potent aromatic-aromatic and cation p interactions with Na+ or K+ cardiac channels for PA.

AB  - 1. One potential predictor of adult reproductive success is physical condition, which can be influenced by earlier developmental stages, such as nutritional limitations during juvenile growth. Sodium is a vital element for animals, essential for physiological function and individual-level development and behaviour. When animals are sodium-limited, they at times engage in behaviours such as cannibalism or geophagy to obtain sodium. At high levels, sodium may be toxic and result in adverse physiological effects. How dietary variation in sodium availability during larval stages influences adult mating behaviour and reproductive output has received relatively little attention. Previous studies within Lepidoptera have reported varied results. 2. We used the bordered patch butterfly, Chlosyne lacinia (Geyer, 1837; Nymphalidae), to investigate the role of larval dietary sodium uptake on adult body size, lifespan, mating behaviour and reproductive success. 3. Body size did not differ between treatments. Individuals raised on host plants with high-sodium concentrations had shorter lifespans than those reared on low-sodium host plants, indicating that sodium in high concentrations in larval diets can be harmful. Females raised on lower sodium diets took longer to start mating regardless of males' larval access to sodium, but copulation durations did not differ. Males and females raised on host plants with higher sodium concentrations mostly did not pair differently than individuals raised on host plants with lower sodium concentrations and did not differ in their immediate reproductive success. Females raised on high-sodium host plants avoided mating with males raised on high-sodium host treatments, suggesting that larval sodium acquisition could influence reproductive decisions made by adults. 4. Reproductive success in insects is shaped by both intrinsic behavioural strategies and extrinsic environmental factors. During mating, individuals make complex choices to maximise fitness, and environmental conditions experienced during juvenile stages-such as dietary sodium exposure-can influence reproductive decisions in adulthood. Understanding the role of sodium in these life-history traits is increasingly important in light of global ecological change: drought-driven reliance on saline irrigation is accelerating soil salinisation worldwide, which may in turn disrupt insect-plant interactions and destabilise multi-trophic dynamics. Collectively, these findings underscore how adaptive behaviours and environmental stressors interact to shape insect populations in a rapidly changing world.

AB  - Antarctic ice velocity maps describe the ice flow dynamics of the ice sheet and are one of the primary components used to estimate the Antarctic mass balance and contribution to global sea level changes. In comparison to velocity maps derived from recent satellite images of monthly to weekly time spans, historical maps, from before the 1990s, generally cover longer time spans, e.g., over 10 years, due to the scarce spatial and temporal coverage of earlier satellite image data. We found velocity overestimations (OEs) in such long-span maps that can be mainly attributed to velocity gradients and time span of the images used. In general, they are less significant in slow-flowing grounded regions with low spatial accelerations. Instead, they take effect in places of high ice dynamics, for example, near grounding lines and often in ice shelf fronts. Velocities in these areas are important for estimating ice sheet mass balance and analyzing ice shelf instability. We propose an innovative Lagrangian velocity-based method for OE correction without the use of field observations or additional image data. The method is validated by using a set of ground truth velocity maps for the Totten Glacier and Pine Island Glacier which are produced from high-quality Landsat 8 images from 2013 to 2020. Subsequently, the validated method is applied to a historical velocity map of the David Glacier region from images from 1972-1989 acquired during Landsat 1, 4, and 5 satellite missions. It is demonstrated that velocity overestimations of up to 39 m a(-1) for David Glacier and 195 m a(-1) for Pine Island Glacier can be effectively corrected. Furthermore, temporal acceleration information, e.g., on basal melting and calving activities, is preserved in the corrected velocity maps and can be used for long-term ice flow dynamics analysis. Our ex periment results in the Pine Island Glacier (PIG) show that OEs of a 15-year span can reach up to 1300 m a(-1) along the grounding line and cause an overestimated grounding line (GL) flux of 11.5 Gt a(-1) if not corrected. The magnitudes of the OEs contained in both velocity and mass balance estimates are significant. When used alongside recent velocity maps of 1990s-2010s, they may lead to underestimated long-term changes for assessment and forecast modeling of the global climate change impact on the Antarctic ice sheet. Therefore, the OEs in the long-span historical maps must be seriously examined and corrected. We recommend that overestimations of more than the velocity mapping uncertainty (1 sigma) be corrected. This velocity overestimation correction method can be applied to the production of regional and icesheet-wide historical velocity maps from long-term satellite images.

AB  - Large variabilities in ammonia (NH3) released from animal manure and emitted from different livestock buildings were frequently reported, but the factors influencing the emissions were not sufficiently investigated. In this paper, continuously monitored data of NH3 emissions and other relevant environmental variables under controlled conditions in a 12-room experimental swine building for a 155-d complete wean-to-finish cycle were studied. Measurement data mining was conducted at both spatial and temporal dimensions using panel data analysis with heterogeneous time trends. The pig diet, total pig weight, and the pit air temperature were identified as the major influencing factors for the variabilities by using multivariate linear regression. Two unidentified factors that imposed substantial influences on the NH3 emission variabilities were predicted. They were most possibly related to variations in microenvironment and microbial activity inside the manure in the pit. The results suggest necessary future research to identify physical properties of the new NH3 emissions factors in microbiological and biochemical processes.

AB  - This study utilized annual Fuding Dabaicha cuttings as the experimental subject, employing a nutrient solution cultivation technique to establish three distinct treatments: (1) CK: reference processing; (2) Cd: 20 mg/L CdSO4 nutrient solution culture; (3) Cd + Se: 20 mg/L CdSO4 + 1.5 mg/L Na2SeO3 nutrient solution culture. We measured and analyzed the electrolyte permeability, proline content, malondialdehyde (MDA) content, antioxidant-related indicators, photosynthesis-related indicators, Cd content in various organs, and transmission electron microscopy images depicting the distribution of Cd and Se elements within different organs of tea plants under these treatments after 30 days of processing, studying the regulatory role of selenium on the resistance mechanism of tea plants (Camellia sinensis) under cadmium stress. The findings are as follows: (1) Cd stress notably elevated the electrical conductivity, MDA content, and proline content of tea plants, whereas the Cd + Se-1 treatment significantly reduced the MDA and proline content under Cd stress; (2) the Cd stress treatment significantly increased the content of peroxides in the tea tree leaves and significantly decreased the activities of four antioxidant enzymes, SOD, POD, CAT, and Apx; the Cd + Se treatment significantly reduced the peroxide content in tea trees under cadmium stress and significantly increased the activities of SOD, POD, CAT, and Apx; (3) the Cd stress treatment significantly increased the values of certain chlorophyll fluorescence parameters and had no significant impact on the distribution of light energy, whereas the Cd + Se treatment significantly elevated the values of some chlorophyll fluorescence parameters and induced an uneven distribution of light energy; (4) the order of accumulation of Cd in different organs of the tea plants was as follows: root > stem > leaf, and the Cd + Se treatment significantly reduced the Cd content in various organs under Cd stress. In root cells, Cd and Se were predominantly located in the cell wall, plasma membrane, and vacuole membrane; in stem cells, they were primarily found in the cell wall and cytoplasm adjacent to the cell wall; in leaf cells, they were mainly distributed in the plasma membrane, cytoplasm, and vacuole. In conclusion, Cd treatment induced stress in tea plants, which resulted in a certain stimulatory effect on photosynthesis, but caused some damage to the photosynthetic apparatus in chloroplasts. The results of the Cd + Se treatment suggest that the interaction between Se and Cd can mitigate the toxicity experienced by tea plants under Cd stress.

AB  - In the present study, three-dimensional numerical analyses have been conducted to understand the behavior of large piled rafts on stiff clay. The effects of pile number, pile spacing, pile length and loading intensity have been examined. For the same soil, the raft thickness is varied such that the its stiffness changes from flexible to in-termediate flexible and to rigid. The load-settlement behavior, load-sharing ratio, raft bending moment and pile axial load distribution are presented and discussed in detail. For a higher pile number, locating piles over a larger central raft area is necessary for the effective reduction of differential settlement. For the intermediate flexible raft, addition of piles covering the maximum raft area is not beneficial in decreasing the differential settlement or the raft bending moment. With the intermediate flexible raft, decreasing the pile length can prove to be ad-vantageous in removing hogging differential settlement. Based on the loading intensity and serviceability limit considerations, the appropriate pile configuration can be determined from the results of the parametric study in the cyclical sequence of firstly the selection of pile number, secondly the adjustment of pile spacing, and finally the reduction of pile length.

Here, we provide a state-of-the-art overview of research trends and the most challenging issues in chamois research and conservation, focusing on taxonomy and systematics, genetics, life history, ecology and behavior, physiology and disease, management and conservation. Research on Rupicapra has a longstanding history and has contributed substantially to the biological and ecological knowledge of mountain ungulates. Although the number of publications on this genus has markedly increased over the past two decades, major differences persist with respect to knowledge of species and subspecies, with research mostly focusing on the Alpine chamois R. r. rupicapra and, to a lesser extent, the Pyrenean chamois R. p. pyrenaica. In addition, a scarcity of replicate studies of populations of different subspecies and/or geographic areas limits the advancement of chamois science. Since environmental heterogeneity impacts behavioral, physiological and life history traits, understanding the underlying processes would be of great value from both an evolutionary and conservation/management standpoint, especially in the light of ongoing climatic change. Substantial contributions to this challenge may derive from a quantitative assessment of reproductive success, investigation of fine-scale foraging patterns, and a mechanistic understanding of disease outbreak and resilience. For improving conservation status, resolving taxonomic disputes, identifying subspecies hybridization, assessing the impact of hunting and establishing reliable methods of abundance estimation are of primary concern. Despite being one of the most well-known mountain ungulates, substantial field efforts to collect paleontological, behavioral, ecological, morphological, physiological and genetic data on different populations and subspecies are still needed to ensure a successful future for chamois research and conservation.

AB  - The effect of deaeration, Cl- ion content and strong oxidizer on the active behavior of the high phosphorus pig iron (HPPI) samples was studied in 3.5% NaCl and 1 N HNO3 solutions. Deaerating the 3.5% NaCl solution could effectively shift the corrosion potential of the HPPI below the protective potential of the steel in seawater [- 0.778 V vs saturated calomel electrode (SCE)], which has not been observed in the freely aerated 3.5% NaCl solution. Both the Cl- ion content and the deaerated conditions restrict the formation of the stable iron phosphate on the surface and promote the dissolution of the pig iron as soluble iron phosphate hydrate (FePO4 center dot 2H(2)O). However, in the case of the freely aerated nitric acid solution, even with deaeration, the HPPI samples have shown more noble behavior as compared to the mild steel due to the strong oxidizing nature of nitric acid and the formation of a stable iron phosphate on the surface.

AB  - The ability to predict animal space use patterns is a fundamental concern in changing environments. Such predictions require a detailed understanding of the movement mechanisms from which spatial distributions emerge. However, these are typically complex, multifaceted, and therefore difficult to uncover. Here, we provide a methodological framework for uncovering the movement mechanisms necessary for building predictive models of animal space use. Our procedure begins by parametrising a movement model of each individual in a population using step selection analysis, from which we build an individual-based model (IBM) of interacting individuals, derive predicted broad-scale space use patterns from the IBM and then compare the predicted and empirical patterns. Importantly, discrepancies between these predicted and empirical patterns are used to formulate new hypotheses about the drivers of animal movement decisions and thus iteratively improve the model's predictive power. We demonstrate our method on a population of feral pigs in Mississippi, USA. Our technique incorporates both social interactions between individuals and environmental drivers of movement. At each iteration of model construction, we were able to identify missing features to improve model prediction by analysing the IBM output. These include overuse-avoidance effects of self-attractive mechanisms (i.e. attraction to previously visited sites becomes repulsion if there have been multiple visits in quick succession), which were vital for ensuring predicted occurrence distributions do not become vanishingly small. Overall, we have provided a general method for iteratively improving the predictive power of step selection models. This will enable future researchers to maximise the information obtained from step selection analyses and to highlight potentially missing data for uncovering the drivers of movement decisions and emergent space use patterns. Ultimately, this provides a fundamental step towards the general aim of constructing predictive models of animal space use.

AB  - Intramuscular adipogenesis plays an important role in muscle development, which determines the quality of goat meat. However, its underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, we provided detailed cellular atlases of goat longissimus dorsi during muscle development at single-nucleus resolution, and identified the subpopulations of fibroblasts/fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) and muscle satellite cell (MuSC), as well as the differentiation trajectory of FAPs subpopulations. Cellular ligand-receptor interaction analysis revealed enriched BMP and IGF pathways implicated in within-tissue crosstalk centered around FAPs. Through single-nucleus gene regulatory network analysis and in vitro interference verification, we found that TCF7L2 was a critical transcriptional factor (TF) in early adipogenesis in skeletal muscle. Overall, our work reveals the cellular intricacies and diversity of goat longissimus dorsi during muscle development, implementing insights into the critical roles of BMP, IGF pathways and TCF7L2 TF in intramuscular adipogenesis.

AB  - The study investigated the effects of ensiling and brown juice-assisted ensiling of wheat straw and press cake from a green biorefinery plant prior to anaerobic co-digestion (Aco-D) with cattle manure on methane yield and nutrient availability in the digestates. Straw was ensiled with and without brown juice at field-scale and lab-scale levels, followed by Aco-D with manure using continuous stirred-tank reactors (CSTR) and batch tests. The digestates from CSTR were incorporated into the soil to study nitrogen and sulphur dynamics and availability over 80 days. Results show that ensiling of straw increased net inorganic nitrogen release in soil and reduced net inorganic sulphur immobilisation compared to the non-ensiled straw. Brown juice-assisted ensiling of straw at the lab-scale level significantly increased methane production by 14 % and increased hydrolysis and methane production rates compared to non-ensiled straw. These results demonstrate that ensiling of straw has the potential as a pre-treatment technique for enhanced biogas production and higher nutrient availability in digestates for crop production and provides an opportunity to valorise brown juice as an ensiling additive.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Simple Summary This paper describes pathological findings in small ruminants with ovine pulmonary adenocarcinoma, a contagious respiratory tumor caused by the jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus. Infection with JSRV leads to the formation of lung tumors, progressive respiratory failure and, ultimately, the death or culling of the affected animals. OPA has traditionally been divided into two forms: classical and atypical. However, in this study, we examined 27 animals with OPA, and found that most of the observed tumors displayed a mix of characteristics from both the classical and the atypical form, and were classified as mixed. Grossly, the lesions were found mostly in the cranial lobes of the lungs, appearing as firm, flat-to-slightly-raised masses that varied in size and color. Histologically, the cases were categorized based on the predominant architectural patterns, with the mixed pattern being the most common. The objective of this study was to provide a detailed description of the gross and microscopic spectrum of ovine pulmonary adenocarcinoma in small ruminants from Spain, focusing on the mixed form. It is important to note that the mixed form of OPA is less frequently reported, and can be mistaken for other concurrent lung diseases.Abstract Ovine pulmonary adenocarcinoma (OPA) is a contagious respiratory tumor of small ruminants, manifesting in chronic weight loss and respiratory failure. Infection with the betaretrovirus jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV) is the cause of OPA. Here, we describe the gross and microscopic features of twenty-six sheep and one goat with naturally occurring JSRV-associated OPA. All the animals included in this study had pulmonary lesions morphologically consistent with OPA, but the majority of the observed lesions demonstrated features of both the classical and the atypical form of OPA, and were, therefore, classified grossly as mixed. The gross lesions were located mainly in the cranial pulmonary lobes, were multifocal to coalescing, variable in number and size, flat to slightly raised, firm, and white to grey. Histologically, the cases were classified according to the predominant architectural patterns as lepidic, papillary, acinar, or mixed; the mixed histological pattern was the most prevalent. The aim of this study was to describe the gross and microscopic spectrum of OPA in naturally infected small ruminants from Spain. The mixed form of OPA is less commonly reported, and can be confused with other concurrent pulmonary pathologies (such as BALT hyperplasia in SRLV-associated pneumonia or lungworm granulomas).

AB  - In order to understand the mechanism of action of oil and fatty acid accumulation and desaturase gene expression in how oilseed flax responds to different fertilization conditions, a three-factor split-plot experiment was conducted to investigate the accumulation trends of oil and fatty acids. The results revealed that soluble sugar (SS) and sucrose (SUC) contents decreased, and the starch (ST) content increased gradually with the grain development and maturity of oilseed flax. The application of sheep manure promoted the accumulation of nonstructural carbohydrates in the grains. Soluble sugar (SS) and sucrose (SUC) contents were negatively correlated with the oil content. Compared with chemical fertilizer, organic manure decreased the total saturated fatty acid but increased the unsaturated fatty acid. Organic manure significantly upregulated the expression of various genes, and fad2a gene expression was higher with the 5.8 t ha-1 chicken manure treatment. The 25 t ha-1 sheep manure treatment was more conducive to the expression of fad3a and fad3b genes and promoted the accumulation of linolenic acid (LIN), and the LIN content increased by 0.64-3.90% compared with other treatments. Consequently, an ongoing anthropogenic sheep manure input may impact the regulation of grain oil quality and yield per unit area.

AB  - Linear appraisal systems (LAS) are effective strategies to systematically collect zoometric information from animal populations. Traditionally applied LAS in goats was developed considering the variability and scales found in highly selected breeds. As a result, traditional LAS may no longer cover the different contexts of goat breeds widespread throughout the world, and departures from normality may be indicative of the different stages of selection at which a certain population can be found. The present study aimed to evaluate the distribution and symmetry properties of twenty-eight zoometric traits. After symmetry analysis was performed, the scale readjustment proposal suggested specific strategies should be implemented such as scale reduction of lower or upper levels, determination of a setup moment to evaluate and collect information from young (up to 2 years) and adult bucks (over 2 years), the addition of upper categories in males due to upper values in the scale being incorrectly clustered together. The particular analysis of each variable permits determining specific strategies for each trait and serve as a model for other breeds, either selected or in terms of selection.

AB  - Stocking hatchery propagated long-spined sea urchins Diadema antillarum is a priority option for recovery of this keystone herbivore on Caribbean reefs. However, information on captive culture of D. antillarum is very limited due to historical lack of successful juvenile production from gametes in the hatchery. In this study, hatchery propagated D. antillarum juveniles were cultured using two diets, commercially available herbivore pellets and dried nori, with the presence/absence of stony coral Acropora cervicornis skeleton to understand how diet and habitat complexity affect growth and behavior of juveniles. Juvenile urchin growth, and the diel pattern of feeding and foraging behavior were significantly affected by diet type. Juveniles fed dried nori gained signifi-cantly higher live weight and test diameter than those fed herbivore pellets. Juvenile urchins displayed nocturnal feeding and foraging behavior irrespective of diet types and presence/absence of coral structure. Presence/ absence of coral structure did not affect growth and diel pattern of feeding and foraging behavior, but modulated habitat usage patterns. Survival of juveniles was neither affected by diet types nor the presence/absence of coral structure. This study concludes that dried nori is a superior diet to herbivore pellets for juvenile urchin culture. Since the presence of coral structure influenced habitat usage patterns, provision of rugose structure in captivity has the potential to convey the innate shelter seeking behavior of juvenile urchins.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is fatal interstitial lung disease characterized by excessive scarring of the lung tissue and declining respiratory function. Given its short prognosis and limited treatment options, novel strategies to investigate emerging experimental treatments are urgently needed. Macrophages, as the most abundant immune cell in the lung, have key implications in wound healing and lung fibrosis. However, they are highly plastic and adaptive to their surrounding microenvironment, and thus to maximize translation of research to lung disease, there is a need to study macrophages in multifaceted, complex systems that are representative of the lung. Precision-cut lung slices (PCLS) are living tissue preparations derived from the lung that are cultured ex vivo, which bypass the need for artificial recapitulation of the lung milieu and architecture. Macrophage programming studies are traditionally conducted using isolated cells in vitro, thus our objective was to establish and validate a moderate-throughput, biologically-translational, viable model to study profibrotic polarization of pulmonary-resident macrophages using murine PCLS. To achieve this, we used a polarization cocktail (PC), consisting of IL-4, IL-13, and IL-6, over a 72-h time course. We first demonstrated no adverse effects of the PC on PCLS viability and architecture. Next, we showed that multiple markers of macrophage profibrotic polarization, including Arginase-1, CD206, YM1, and CCL17 were induced in PCLS following PC treatment. Through tissue microarray-based histological assessments, we directly visualized and quantified Arginase-1 and CD206 staining in PCLS in a moderate-throughput manner. We further delineated phenotype of polarized macrophages, and using high-plex immunolabelling with the Iterative Bleaching Extends Multiplexity (IBEX) method, showed that the PC effects both interstitial and alveolar macrophages. Substantiating the profibrotic properties of the system, we also showed expression of extracellular matrix components and fibrotic markers in stimulated PCLS. Finally, we demonstrated that clodronate treatment diminishes the PC effects on profibrotic macrophage readouts. Overall, our findings support a suitable complex model for studying ex vivo profibrotic macrophage programming in the lung, with future capacity for investigating experimental therapeutic candidates and disease mechanisms in pulmonary fibrosis.

AB  - Simple Summary Forensic entomology applies the knowledge of arthropods to obtain useful information for the resolution of forensic investigations. In legal medicine, one of the methods used for the dating of death is the faunal succession, which is based on the orderly and predictable changes of the species associated with a corpse over time. The potential of insects for this purpose has been known for more than seven centuries, but mites are only currently being incorporated. Mites can provide useful information on the time and place of death because: they are a very diverse group, ubiquitous, abundant, and frequent; they contribute to the faunal succession; they are indicators of location and transfer of the corpse; they can be present in unfavorable conditions or environments for insects; they complement the information obtained from insects; and they are tracking evidence. Due to the absence of knowledge regarding the sarcosaprophagous fauna in the Mediterranean region, it is necessary to highlight the diversity of insects, together with their phoretic mites, present in decomposing animal organic matter, and their interaction network in this region, in order that the results obtained can be applied in future forensic investigations and contribute to the estimation of the time and place of death. The potential of insects for forensic investigations has been known for more than 700 years. However, arthropods such as mites could also play a role in these investigations. The information obtained from insects, together with their phoretic mites, is of special interest in terms of estimating the time and geographical location of death. This paper presents the first interaction network between phoretic mites and their host insects in Navarra. It also reports the first time that an interaction network was applied to animal remains of forensic relevance. The data reveal the degrees of specificity of the interactions established, the biological and ecological characteristics of the mites at the time of association, and factors that played important roles in the mites' dispersion. Fauna was collected using 657 traps baited with 20 g of pig carrion over a year. Only 0.6% of insects collected carried phoretic mites. The network comprised 312 insects (275 beetles, 37 flies) and 1533 mites and was analyzed using various packages of the R programming language. We contribute new host insect records for 15 mites, 3 new records of insects as hosts, 5 new mite records for the Iberian Peninsula, and 2 new mites records and 8 new insect records for Navarra.

AB  - Ammonia (NH3) concentration in livestock barns is a crucial environmental parameter affecting the well-being of animals and workers' health. Effective management and prediction of NH3 levels are essential for maintaining an efficient and enduring swine production system. This study investigated the application of machine learning algorithms, namely support vector regression (SVR), random forest regression (RFR), and multiple linear regression (MLR), to predict NH3 concentrations in pig barns and examined the impact of individual input variables on prediction accuracy. In this study, three datasets, each comprising five key biophysical variables, i.e., feed intake (FI), mass of pig (MP), carbon dioxide (CO2) levels, temperature (T), and relative humidity (RH), were utilized for training and testing these algorithms. The data were collected from three barns during the growing-finishing stage of pigs in 2022 and 2023. The study results revealed a strong positive relationship between FI and MP with NH3 concentrations. Among the three machine learning models, the SVR outperformed the MLR and RFR in predicting NH3 concentration. The result exhibited that the SVR obtained the maximum performance in both training (R-2 >0.95) and testing (R-2 >0.85), with R-2 improvements of up to 5.43 % and 14.02 % and RMSE decreases of up to 15.97 % and 28.98 %, in comparison to the RFR and MLR across the three input datasets in NH3 prediction. The study also emphasized the importance of dataset size, with the large dataset containing all five input indicators achieving the highest accuracy compared to smaller datasets. In addition, the MLR demonstrated maximum stability, followed by the SVR, whereas the RFR exhibited minimum stability. Sensitivity analysis revealed that FI was the most influential input variable for NH3 concentration prediction. The study ranked the impact of individual input variables as FI > MP > CO2 > T > RH. The combination of FI, MP, CO2, and T as input indicators achieved the highest model performance, accounting for a substantial portion of the variance between observed and predicted data. This study demonstrated the potential of machine learning models, particularly SVR, for predicting NH3 concentrations using relevant input variables in pig barns. These findings significantly enhance understanding of NH3 concentration dynamics in pig barns, providing crucial insights into swine production and environmental management with data-driven modeling.

AB  - VHHs or nanobodies are single antigen binding domains originating from camelid heavy-chain antibodies. They are used as diagnostic and research tools and in a variety of therapeutic molecules. Analyzing variable domain structures from llama and alpaca we found that VHHs can be classified into two large structural clusters based on their CDR-H3 conformation. Extended CDR-H3 loops protrude into the solvent, whereas kinked CDR-H3 loops fold back onto framework regions. Both major families have distinct properties in terms of their CDR-H3 secondary structure, how their CDR-H3 interacts with the framework region and how they bind to antigens. We show that the CDR-H3 conformation of VHHs correlates with the germline from which the antibodies are derived: IGHV3-3 derived antibodies almost exclusively adopt a kinked CDR-H3 conformation while the CDR-H3 adopts an extended structure in most IGHV3S53 derived antibodies. We do not observe any bias stemming from V(D)J recombination in llama immune repertoires, suggesting that the correlation is the result of selection processes during B-cell development. Our findings demonstrate a previously undescribed impact of germline usage on antigen interaction and contribute to a better understanding on how properties of the antibody framework shape the immune repertoire.
   Analysis of existing structures of VHHs (nanobodies) in combination with deep sequencing of the immune repertoire of Llamas provides evidence for the impact of VH gene usage on the VHH CDR-H3 conformation.

AB  - Sheep farming is a strategic sector of livestock husbandry, and its production has large market demand in many countries. The live weight of sheep provides important information about the health state and the time point for marketing. Manual weighing sheep is time-consuming for farmers even with the help of a ground scale. With the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and smart sensors, non-contact sheep weighing methods have gradually been used to estimate weight. However, the performance of prior studies tends to degenerate with varying postures and light conditions in practical natural environments. In this study, we propose a sheep live weight estimation approach based on LiteHRNet (a Lightweight High-Resolution Network) using RGB-D images. Class Activation Mapping (CAM) guided the design of efficient network heads embracing visual explanation and applicability in practical natural environments. Experiments are conducted on our challenging dataset (of 726 sheep RGB-D images, weight range between 19.5 to 94 kg). Comparative experiment results reveal that the lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on RGB-D images can reach an acceptable weight estimation result, Mean Average Percentage Error (MAPE) is 14.605% (95% confidence interval: [13.821%, 15.390%], t test) with only 1.06M parameters. Our works can be viewed as preliminary work that confirms the ability to use lightweight CNNs for sheep weight estimation on RGB-D data. The results of this study are potential to develop an embedded device to automatically estimate sheep live weight and would contribute to the development of precision livestock farming.

AB  - Adding organic wastes to chicken manure (CM) for co-digestion by black soldier fly (BSF) larvae is an effective means to improve the efficiency of manure degradation and bioconversion, but the trade-off in carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) distribution and environmental impact is still unclear. Six substrates were provided for BSF bioconversion: CM (control), vegetable waste (VEG), slaughtered chicken waste (SCH), discarded fish organs (DFI), the mixture of CM, VEG, and SCH with a 1:1:1 ratio (Mix1) and the mixture of CM, VEG, and DFI with a 1:1:1 ratio (Mix2). The effects on BSF growth performance, nutrient accumulation and environmental emissions were examined. In comparison with CM, VEG reduced 29.65 % of NH3 emission, but the larvae yield (13.04 %) and nutrient accumulation were also decreased. Final larvae weight (16.20 % and 41.52 %) and survival ratio (26.00 % and 25.78 %) in animal-waste (SCH and DFI) treatments were improved, whereas the NH3 (SCH) and CO2 (DFI) emissions were significantly increased. Mix1 and Mix2 greatly improved the larval conversion efficiency and frass maturity, while reducing NH3 emission (24.45 % and 14.08 %) and GHG emissions (38.42 % and 56.38 %). In addition, the mixed substrates (Mix1 and Mix2) exhibited superior performance in enhancing larval protein (2.93 % and 14.52 %) and biomass yield (75.99 % and 101.07 %) compared to CM. The quantitative distribution of C and N nutrients indicated that Mix1 was functional in gas mitigation, while Mix2 in insect biomass accumulation. In conclusion, co-conversion of CM with VEG and DFI is critical for synergistic emission reduction and nutrient accumulation in the BSF system.

AB  - During pigging operations in offshore pipelines, severe slugging can block the pig or cause sudden velocity changes. Therefore, this paper proposed a method involving bypass pigs to mitigate the influence of severe slugging on the pigging process. The impact of different inlet mass flow rates and pig bypass fractions on the characteristic parameters, such as the pressure in the riser bottom, pig velocity, and liquid-phase distribution patterns, were analyzed by combining OLGA and CFD simulations. Furthermore, the accuracy of the simulations was verified by the comparisons of OLGA and CFD, as well as the transient indoor experiments. The results show that the bypass pig significantly reduces pressure fluctuations in the riser bottom and pig velocity in severe slugging conditions, compared with the conventional pig. Consequently, the bypass pig dissipates downstream liquid slugs, reducing the mass flow rate and liquid holdup in the riser outlet. In addition, an increase in bypass fraction reduces the pressure fluctuations in the riser bottom and pig velocity, increases the ability to dissipate the downstream liquid slug, and decreases the mass flow rate and liquid holdup in the riser outlet. Increasing the inlet mass flow rate improves the ability to dissipate the downstream liquid slug. However, the inlet mass flow rate has a lower mitigation effect on severe slugging than the bypass fraction.

AB  - The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I region of cattle is both highly polymorphic and, unlike many species, highly variable in gene content between haplotypes. Cattle MHC class I alleles were historically grouped by sequence similarity in the more conserved 3 ' end of the coding sequence to form phylogenetic allele groups. This has formed the basis of current cattle MHC class I nomenclature. We presently describe and compare five fully assembled MHC class I haplotypes using the latest cattle and yak genome assemblies. Of the five previously described "pseudogenes" in the cattle MHC class I region, Pseudogene 3 is putatively functional in all haplotypes and Pseudogene 6 and Pseudogene 7 are putatively functional in some haplotypes. This was reinforced by evidence of transcription. Based on full gene sequences as well as 3 ' coding sequence, we identified distinct subgroups of BoLA-3 and BoLA-6 that represent distinct genetic loci. We further examined allele-specific expression using transcriptomic data revealing that certain alleles are consistently weakly expressed compared to others. These observations will help to inform further studies into how MHC class I region variability influences T cell and natural killer cell functions in cattle.

AB  - Depression is one of the most common mental illnesses and seriously affects all aspects of life. Running exercise has been suggested to prevent or alleviate the occurrence and development of depression; however, the underlying mechanisms of these effects remain unclear. Independent studies have indicated that astrocytes play essential roles and that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is an important brain region involved in the pathology underlying depression. However, it is unknown whether running exercise achieves antidepressant effects by affecting the number of astrocytes and glutamate transport function in the mPFC. Here, animal models of depression were established using chronic unpredictable stress (CUS), and depression-like behavior was assessed by the sucrose preference test. After successfully establishing the depression model, experimental animals performed running exercise. Glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive (GFAP(+)) cell number in the mPFC was precisely quantified using immunohistochemical and stereological methods, and the densities of bromodeoxyuridine-positive (BrdU(+)) and BrdU(+)/GFAP(+) cells in the mPFC were measured using a semiquantitative immunofluorescence assay. Changes in glutamate transporter gene expression in mPFC astrocytes were detected by mRNA sequencing and qRT-PCR. We found that running exercise reversed CUS-induced decreases in sucrose preference, increased astrocyte number and the density of newborn astrocytes, and reversed decreases in gene expression levels of GFAP, S100b, and the glutamate transporters GLT-1 and GLAST in the mPFC of CUS animals. These results suggested that changes in astrocyte number and glutamate transporter function may be potential meditators of the effects of running exercise in the treatment of depression.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of two commercial extenders, AndroMed (R) (AM) and Androstar (R) Plus (AS) both with and without the addition of egg-yolk (EY), for cooling llama semen. A total of sixteen ejaculates were collected from four males. Each ejaculate was divided into four aliquots and diluted with: AM, AM with 20 % EY (AM-EY), AS and AS with 20 % EY (AS-EY) and then cooled to 5 degrees C in an Equitainer (R). Evaluations were carried out in raw semen, after dilution (0 h) and after 24 and 48 h of cooling. Data were analysed using either Friedman or ANOVA. Although total motility decreased in all cooled samples compared to the corresponding 0 h (P < 0.05), the highest percentages were observed in AM-EY being significantly higher than all other cooled samples after 24 h and higher than AS and AS-EY after 48 h. No significant differences were observed in the percentages of live acrosome-intact sperm between extenders at all times tested. A significant decrease in the percentage of sperm membrane osmotic function was observed in samples cooled with AS and AS-EY after 24 and 48 h vs. raw semen and in AM 48 h vs. raw semen. Finally, a significant increase in the percentage of sperm with abnormal tails was observed in the samples cooled with AS and AS-EY. Of all the extenders used, AndroMed (R) could be considered an option for cooling llama semen and the addition of EY to this extender improves its effectiveness.

AB  - The busulfan, an alkylating agent, suppresses endogenous spermatogenesis in recipient testes. However, considering a wide variation in the effects of busulfan among animal species, its dosage and route of infusion need optimization to prepare effective and safe recipients. Thus, the current study aimed to create a suitable recipient goat model for germ cell (Gc) transplantation through a single intra-testicular (i.t.) busulfan infusion under ultrasonographic (USG) guidance. As observed through the infusion of trypan blue under USG guidance into mediastinum testis (MT) of pre-pubertal Barbari bucks, 3-5 mL of trypan blue solution could fill almost 80% of seminiferous tubules. Thereafter, in Experiment-1, the effect of different busulfan doses (mg/kg) i.e. 0 [negative control, Group (Gr) 1; 0 mg/kg-MT], 1 (Gr 2; 1 mg/kg-MT), 2 (Gr 3; 2 mg/kg-MT), and 3 (Gr 4; 3 mg/kg-MT) were studied. Further, in Experiment-2, sterilizing effects of busulfan infusion through two different routes [MT or cavum vaginale (CV)] were compared. Following i.t. busulfan treatment, no adverse physiological effects or body weight loss were detected. The histological analyses demonstrate a dose-dependent depletion of Gc with almost complete loss of Gc and spermatogenic activities in Gr 3 and 4, and extensive fibrosis in Gr 4. A considerable suppression of spermatogenesis marked with devoid of endogenous spermatogonial population and absence of significant (P > 0.05) effect on key hematological variables were observed in 2 mg/kg-MT Gr. These findings coupled with the results of significant (P < 0.05) down-regulation of marker genes of undifferentiated spermatogonia (THY-1 and PLZF), Gc pluripotency (UCHL-1, OCT-4, and DDX-4), and adhesion (E-cadherin and beta-integrin); up-regulation of apoptotic genes (ID -4 and BCL-6), and unchanged expression of Sertoli cell marker (vimentin), confirmed the safe and efficient depletion of endogenous Gc in 2 mg/kg-MT Gr. Furthermore, the effect of busulfan infusion on scrotal-testicular biometry, endocrine variables (plasma cortisol and testosterone), and Gc removal was more evident when busulfan was infused into MT than into CV. Overall, the results demonstrated that 2.0 mg/kg is an optimal single dose of busulfan when infused into the MT under USG guidance for the preparation of pre-pubertal recipient bucks. Overall, this study provides a basis to prepare suitable recipients through providing an available niche for efficient Gc transplantation in goats. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - An RNA-seq dataset of 68-day-old lambs from two sheep breeds was analysed to identify differentially expressed genes involved in biological processes, molecular functions, cellular components, and pathways associated with resistance against Haemonchus contortus. Na & iuml;ve Santa Ines (resistant breed) and Ile de France (susceptible breed) suckling lambs were serially infected with increasing numbers of H. contortus infective larvae (5400 in total) and had their abomasal mucosa sampled for sequencing. Gene Ontology annotation and enrichment analysis generated a list of 312 biological processes, 56 cellular components, and 106 molecular functions significantly enriched terms. Santa Ines lambs had significantly higher expression of genes involved in inflammatory responses, B-cell activation and receptor signalling pathways, complement activation, and angiogenesis. Most of the cellular components were associated with B-cell receptor complex, Fc-epsilon receptor I complex, and MHC class II protein (MHCII) complex terms. Additionally, most of the molecular functions were associated with IgE binding and receptor activity, IgA and immunoglobulin receptor binding. Santa Ines lambs showed a robust tissue repair mechanism, mediated mainly by fibroblast proliferation and collagen biosynthesis, epithelial cell maturation and structure maintenance, and strong smooth muscle contraction. Here, we present a detailed picture of the biological processes, and a comprehensive understanding of the gene architecture involved in the resistance trait of young lambs against H. contortus. The cluster of genes reported here might be useful for identifying target-based markers that could provide early selection of resistant sheep to H. contortus infection.

AB  - Decades of research studying the behavioral effects of damage to structures in medial temporal lobe of rhesus monkeys have documented that such damage, particularly damage to the amygdala, causes animals to become hyporesponsive to threat and hyper-social. This phenotype, a subset of the behaviors known as "Klfiver-Bucy Syndrome," is one of the most well-known phenomena in behavioral neuroscience. Carrying on the tradition of evaluating hyposensitivity to threat in monkeys with temporal lobe lesions, we evaluated the responses of rhesus monkeys with bilateral ibotenic acid lesions of the amygdala or hippocampus and 4 procedure-matched control animals to the presentation of an unfamiliar human intruder and threatening objects of varying complexity. All animals behaved as expected calibrating their responses to the ostensible threat value of the stimuli such that they were most responsive to the most potent stimuli and least responsive to the least potent stimuli. Contrary to an earlier report (Mason et al.. 2006), lesion status did not impact the pattern of responses across multiple dependent measures (overt behaviors, position in cage, etc.). The only lesion induced difference consistent with hyposensitivity to threat was that monkeys with amygdala lesions retrieved food rewards placed near reptile-like objects more rapidly than did control animals. These findings call into question the assumption that amygdala damage causes robust, stereotyped changes to affective behavior. They also highlight the importance of replication in neuroscientific studies using nonhuman primates.

AB  - Simple Summary The Chipmunk (Tamias Sibiricus) plays a vital role in seed dispersal, but its seasonal diet, intestinal microflora structure, and metabolism profile are not clear at present, which is the main content of this study. Understanding the above contents is helpful in understanding further the factors affecting the chipmunk's stability and population change. Our results showed significant differences in dietary habits, intestinal microflora structure, and nutrient absorption of chipmunks in different seasons. This study demonstrated that food in different seasons had essential effects on chipmunk's intestinal microbe structure and metabolism profile. Tamias Sibiricus is the only member of the genus Tamias, a significant and vigorous seed distributor and vital food for their predators. No information is known about the strict diet, gut microbiota structure, and metabolism profile of chipmunks and how they diversify seasonally. The above factors, as well as flexibility toward seasonal shifts, are critical in defining its growth rates, health, survivorship, and population stability. This study explored the diet, gut microbiota composition, and chipmunk metabolism. Additionally, the influence of different seasons was also investigated by using next-generation sequencing. Results revealed that seasons strongly affected a diet: streptophyte accounted for 37% in spring, which was lower than in summer (34.3%) and autumn (31.4%). Further, Ascomycota was observed at 43.8% in spring, which reduced to 36.6% in summer and the lowest (31.3%) in autumn. Whereas, nematodes showed maximum abundance from spring (15.8%) to summer (20.6%) and autumn (24.1%). These results signify the insectivorous nature of the chipmunk in summer and autumn. While herbivorous and fungivorous nature in spring. The DNA analysis revealed that chipmunk mainly feeds on fungi, including Aspergillus and Penicillium genus. Similar to diet composition, the microbiome also exhibited highly significant dissimilarity (p < 0.001, R = 0.235) between spring/autumn and spring/summer seasons. Proteobacteria (35.45%), Firmicutes (26.7%), and Bacteroidetes (23.59%) were shown to be the better discriminators as they contributed the most to causing differences between seasons. Moreover, PICRUSt showed that the assimilation of nutrients were also varied seasonally. The abundance of carbohydrates, lipids, nucleotides, xenobiotics, energy, terpenoids, and polyketides metabolism was higher in spring than in other seasons. Our study illustrates that seasonal reconstruction in the chipmunk diet has a significant role in shaping temporal variations in gut microbial community structure and metabolism profile.

AB  - In vitro fertilization (IVF) has been considered as an effective infertility treatment, oocyte quality is important for the success of IVF, there are many factors affecting oocyte quality including oxidative stress, melatonin has a role in oocyte maturation and protection from oxidative stress. This study aimed to find correlations between oocyte quality and oxidative stress. Follicular fluids were collected from 100 women undergoing IVF or ICSI at the time of oocyte retrieval. Oxidative stress markers 8-OHdG, MDA and H2O2 and the antioxidant melatonin were measured in each sample. Buffalo oocytes were incubated in in vitro maturation media with different concentrations of melatonin in presence of H2O2. Follicular fluid 8-OHdG was significantly higher in the high percentage of degenerated oocytes group, while follicular fluid melatonin was lower significantly in the high percentage group. Correlations between oxidative stress and the antioxidant melatonin showed that 8-OHdG had a significant inverse correlation with melatonin (p=0.00) while MDA had a significant positive correlation with melatonin (p=0.00). In vitro maturation of buffalo oocytes in maturation media containing different concentrations of melatonin in presence of H2O2, melatonin improved oocyte maturation depending on the dose, the highest percentage of oocyte maturation was obtained with 10 ng/ml melatonin. The study concluded that 8-OHdG may be used as a marker in predicting oocyte quality. Melatonin can protect oocytes from the toxic effects of oxidative stress in vitro.

AB  - Agricultural organic wastes can leach dissolved organic matter (DOM) into surrounding water bodies, establishing them as significant sources of aquatic DOM. Given the importance of DOM in biogeochemical cycling of mercury (Hg), this DOM may mediate divalent Hg (Hg(II)) reduction, a process that remains poorly understood. This study investigated Hg(II) reduction using DOM derived from six representative agricultural wastes, categorized into livestock manure (chicken, pig, cow) and crop straw (rice, corn, rapeseed), with systematic considerations of the kinetics of reduction processes and the involvement of key free radicals. Results revealed that photoreduction was the primary pathway for Hg(II) reduction, with pig manure DOM exhibiting the highest efficiency at 36%. Key DOM quality parameters, such as protein-like components, have been identified as critical determinants of Hg(II) photoreduction capacity. Furthermore, free radicals induced by DOM could either enhance or inhibit Hg(II) reduction capacities. Specifically, in livestock manure, the superoxide anion (O2 center dot-)& sdot;was identified as the primary radical promoting Hg(II) photoreduction of pig manure DOM. In crop straw, hydroxyl radicals (& sdot;OH) were found to inhibit Hg(II) photoreduction, whereas O 2 center dot- promoted the Hg(II) photoreduction of rice straw DOM. These findings provide valuable insights into the role of agricultural organic wastes in biogeochemical cycling of Hg within aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - The degree of forage lignification is a key factor affecting its digestibility by ruminants such as cattle and sheep. Sudan grass (Sorghum sudanense S.) is a high-quality sorghum forage, and its lignocellulose is mostly stored in the secondary cell wall. However, the secondary cell wall synthesis mechanism of Sudan grass has not yet been studied in depth. To further study the secondary cell wall synthesis mechanism of Sudan grass using established transcriptome data, this study found that CcNAC6, a homologous gene of Arabidopsis AtSND2, is related to the secondary cell wall synthesis of Sudan grass. Accordingly, we constructed a CcNAC6-overexpressing line of Arabidopsis to investigate the function of the CcNAC6 gene in secondary cell wall synthesis. The results showed that the overexpression of the CcNAC6 gene could significantly increase the lignin content of Arabidopsis. Based on subcellular localization analysis, CcNAC6 is found in the nucleus. In addition, yeast two-hybridization screening showed that CcCP1, associated with secondary cell wall synthesis, can interact with CcNAC6. Therefore, the above results indicate that CcNAC6 has a positive regulatory effect on the secondary cell wall synthesis of Sudan grass, and it is speculated that CcNAC6 may be the main regulator of the secondary cell wall synthesis of Sudan grass through its interaction with another regulatory protein, CcCP1. This study provides a theoretical basis and new genetic resources for the creation of new Sudan grass germplasm with a low lignin content.

AB  - Sixty Duroc x (Landrace x Yorkshire) castrated male finishing pigs were randomly divided into negative control (NC) and gracilaria lemaneiformis polysaccharides (GLP) groups to study the effects of GLP on the fecal microbiota and fecal metabolites of fattening pigs. The NC group was fed a basic diet, and the GLP group was fed a basic diet supplemented with 0.1% GLP. The diversity of the species and the fecal metabolites were analyzed using 16S rDNA sequencing and metabolome sequencing, respectively. The serum immune and antioxidant indices were analyzed using the ELISA assay. The abundances of hazardous bacteria such as Proteobacteria at the phylum level and Shigella at the genus level were extremely significantly decreased (p < 0.01) and those of beneficial bacteria such as Firmicutes at the phylum level (p < 0.01), Clostridium at the genus level (p < 0.01), and Lactobacillus at the genus level (p < 0.05) were significantly increased in the GLP group compared with the NC group. A total of 41 differentially expressed metabolites were identified. The expression of anti-inflammatory and antioxidant active substances, such as methyl cinnamate, protopanaxatriol, and isovanillic acid, was elevated in the GLP group. The ELISA assay showed increased GSH-Px activity (p < 0.01), T-AOC (p < 0.01), IgG (p < 0.01), IgA (p < 0.05), and IgM (p < 0.05) in the GLP group. These results indicate that dietary GLP supplementation can improve the antioxidant ability, anti-inflammatory ability, and immune level of fattening pigs by regulating fecal flora and metabolites and could be used as a functional feed additive.

AB  - Body movements are known to play an active role in sensing. However, it is not fully understood what information is provided by these movements. The Peter's elephantnose fish, Gnathonemus petersii, sense their environment through active electrolocation during which they use epidermal electroreceptors to perceive object-induced distortions of a self-produced electric field. The analysis of electric images projected on their skin enables them to discriminate between three-dimensional objects. While we know the electric image parameters used to encode numerous object properties, we do not understand how these images encode object shape. We hypothesized that 'movement-induced modulations' (MIMs) elicited by body movements might be involved in shape discrimination during active electrolocation. To test this, we trained fish to complete a shape discrimination task in a two-alternative forced-choice setup, and then manipulated the space available to individuals for scanning movements to see whether this led to a change in their discrimination performance. We found that if enough space was available, fish were very good at discriminating objects of different shapes. However, performance decreased when the space was reduced so that scanning movements were impaired. Our study demonstrates the importance of body movements for gaining complex environmental information such as object shape through active electrolocation. Movement can enhance perception by allowing the extraction of certain kinds of information. Similar observations have been made in other animals using different senses, suggesting that the core principles of sensory-motor integration might be valid for various sensory modalities.

AB  - A first compilation of georeferenced tick locations in Austria and South Tyrol, Italy, is presented here. This allows the tick fauna to be examined in the various climatic regions of the European Alps. The dataset comprises 424 tick locations of Austria and 48 tick locations of South Tyrol, which were digitized from literature and visualized in the form of geographical maps. The tick fauna of Austria includes two species of Argasidae in the genera Argas and Carios and 15 species of Ixodidae in the genera Dermacentor, Haemaphysalis, and Ixodes, altogether 17 tick species. In addition, two species of Ixodidae in the genera Hyalomma (each spring imported by migratory birds) and Rhipicephalus (occasionally imported by dogs returning from abroad with their owners) are included in the tick atlas. Of these, the georeferenced locations of 18 tick species are depicted in maps. The occurrence of the one remaining tick species, Ixodes inopinatus, is given at the level of the federal states. The first Austrian distribution map of the long-legged bat tick Ixodes vespertilionis, which was reported from 21 caves, deserves special mention. The most common and widespread tick species is Ixodes ricinus, with records in all nine federal states of Austria, followed by Ixodes canisuga, Ixodes hexagonus, and I. vespertilionis in six federal states each. Haemaphysalis concinna and Dermacentor reticulatus are only endemic in the eastern plains, while Dermacentor marginatus only occurs in the west, in the Tyrolean Alpine valleys. Eight tick species were reported from South Tyrol, Italy. There, the most frequently flagged tick from the vegetation is also I. ricinus, while D. marginatus and Haemaphysalis punctata are often collected from sheep. The locations are shown together with those from North and East Tyrol on a separate Tyrol map. The tick atlas in Austria and South Tyrol as well as the underlying digital dataset in the supplement contribute to the closing of data gaps in global distribution maps of ticks and improve the data basis for new species distribution models.

AB  - Across the prehistoric period in Mainland Southeast Asia (MSEA), very few architectural remains and settlements have been identified and there is an absence of evidence for dwellings and domestic spaces. Loc Giang (3980-3270 cal BP) in Long An Province, southern Vietnam is one of the few prehistoric settlements excavated in the region, revealing compacted, laterally extensive layers hypothesised to be floors in association with several other occupation deposit types. Due to the complex occupation stra-tigraphy encountered in the field, as well as intensive post-depositional processes of tropical environ-ments, a state-of-the-art micro-geoarchaeological approach was used to identify site formation processes. Here, we present a description and depositional history of eight major deposit types (microfacies); among these, we identify constructed lime mortar floors, pile dwellings, evidence for the systematic treatment of waste, and prepared organic deposits likely associated with the management of dog and pig populations. Through the study of site formation we reconstruct at high resolution the nature of dwellings and organisation of domestic spaces within one of the earliest neolithic and sedentary settlements in the region. We demonstrate that within destructive burial environments of the tropics, micro-geoarchaeology offers an effective scientific toolkit for detecting settlement features with low macro-archaeological visibility, thereby enabling us to reconstruct pile dwellings and associated lime floors that were poorly characterised previously in MSEA prehistory.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Simple Summary
   The Murciano-Granadina is one of the main goat breeds dedicated to milk production worldwide. However, kids of this breed are born with low birth weight and do not grow rapidly, so farmers have little interest in raising them for meat because of the low profitability they obtain. The aim of this work is to improve the growth characteristics of these kids by crossbreeding Murciano-Granadina goats with males of the Boer breed, which is considered the best meat goat breed. The results showed that crossbred kids have a higher birth weight (+24%) and, in artificial rearing until 9 kg live weight, have lower mortality (-37%), higher growth rate (+32%) and a better milk powder conversion rate (16%). However, when this crossbreeding is carried out in the anoestrous season (experiments conducted at latitude 38-39 degrees N), the reproductive performance of Murciano-Granadina females worsens slightly. It is concluded that the terminal crossbreeding of Murciano-Granadina goats to Boer bucks (those not used to produce replacement kids) could be an interesting option for ethical goat production.
   The aim of this work was to improve the growth characteristics of Murciano-Granadina (MG) kids through terminal crossbreeding of MG goats to Boer bucks. Four experiments were carried out, using a total of 354 MG goats, half of which were mated with MG bucks (n = 12) and the other half with Boer bucks (n = 12). The kids were raised in artificial rearing until slaughter weight (9 kg). The birth weight and average daily gain were recorded in crossed kids (n = 197 and 145, respectively) and purebred kids (n = 257 and 169, respectively). Crossed kids presented significant differences (p < 0.001) compared to MG purebred kids in birth weight (+ 24%), mortality in artificial rearing (-37%), average daily gain (+32%) and milk powder conversion rate (-16%). However, the reproductive performance rates of MG goats mated with Boer bucks were slightly worse (pregnancy rate: 78.5% vs. 86.6%, p < 0.05; kidding rate: 62.0% vs. 75.7%; p < 0.01; prolificacy: 1.9 vs. 2.1 kids/parturition), especially when the matings took place in non-breeding season (experiments conducted at latitude 38-39 degrees N). It is concluded that the terminal crossbreeding of MG goats to Boer bucks (those not used to produce replacement kids) could be an interesting option for ethical goat production.

AB  - Continuous monitoring of pig posture is important for better understanding animal behavior. Previous studies focused on day recordings and did not investigate how deep learning models could be applied during longer periods including night recordings under near-infrared light from several pens. Therefore, the objective of this research was to study how a suitable deep learning model for continuous 24/7 pig posture detection could be achieved. We selected a deep learning model from over 150 different model configurations covering experiments concerning 3 detection heads, 4 base networks, 5 transfer datasets and 12 data augmentations. For this purpose, we test and validate our models using 4690 annotations of randomly drawn images from 24/7 video recordings covering 2 fattening periods from 10 pens. Our results indicate that pig position and posture was detected on the test set with 84% mAP@0.50 (49% mAP@[0.50:0.05:0.95]) for day recordings and for night recordings 58% mAP@0.50 (29% mAP@[0.50:0.05:0.95]) was achieved. The main reason for lower mAP during night recordings was degraded near-infrared image quality. Our work reports important findings concerning the applicability of deep learning models on night near-infrared recordings for posture detection. The dataset is publicly available for further research and industrial applications.

AB  - The pathogen Colletotrichum gloeosporioides causes anthracnose, a serious threat to tea trees around the world, particularly in warm and humid regions. RNA-Seq data have previously indicated NAC transcription factors are involved in anthracnose resistance, but underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The BiFC, Split-LUC, and Co-IP assays validated the interaction between CsbHLH62 and CsNAC17 identified through yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screening. CsNAC17 or CsbHLH62 overexpression enhanced anthracnose resistance, as well as enhanced levels of H2O2, hypersensitivity, and cell death in Nicotiana benthamiana. The NBS-LRR gene CsRPM1 is regulated by CsNAC17 by binding directly to its promoter (i.e. CACG, CATGTG), while CsbHLH62 facilitates CsNAC17's binding and increases transcriptional activity of CsRPM1. Additionally, transient silencing of CsNAC17 and CsbHLH62 in tea plant leaves using the virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) system resulted in decreased resistance to anthracnose. Conversely, transient overexpression of CsNAC17 and CsbHLH62 in tea leaves significantly enhanced the resistance against anthracnose. Based on these results, it appears that CsbHLH62 facilitates the activity of CsNAC17 on CsRPM1, contributing to increased anthracnose resistance.

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the most important risk factors that influence productive life (PL) and to estimate genetic parameters for PL using a Weibull proportional hazards model in two Spanish dairy goat breeds belonging to different production systems. The dataset consisted of 70,695 and 49,176 lactation records of Florida and Payoya females, respectively, collected over the last two decades. A total of 6,227 (24.21%) Florida and 3,452 (20.42%) Payoya females had censored information. The pedigree included a total of 56,901 animals for Florida and 59,957 for Payoya. The effects included in the model for both breeds were the age at first kidding and the herd-year-season of birth of the doe as time-independent effects; and the age at kidding, the herd-year-season of kidding, the within-herd class of milk production deviation and the combination between the lactation number and the duration of lactation as time-dependent effects. Estimation of genetic parameters was made using a Weibull proportional hazards model using Survival Kit V6.0 software. The results from the Weibull animal models gave estimates of additive genetic variances of 0.99 +/- 0.0003 and 0.156 +/- 0.021, which corresponds to a heritability of 0.43 +/- 0.025 and 0.11 +/- 0.021 for Florida and Payoya, respectively. The magnitude of heritability obtained for PL suggests that a substantial response to selection may be expected for longevity, especially in the Florida breed. These results may contribute to the development of a routine genetic evaluation to improve PL in Spanish dairy goat breeds.
   A Weibull proportional hazards model has been used to analyse productive life in Spanish goat breeds raised under different production systems.Productive life is influenced by many factors, with milk production the most important.According to the heritability estimated, a significant genetic response could be obtained by direct selection for productive life, especially in the Florida breed.

AB  - Background: The link between maternal immune activation (MIA) and the risk of developing schizophrenia (SCZ) later in life has been of major focus in recent years. This link could be bridged by activated inflammatory pathways and excessive cytokine release resulting in adverse effects on behavior, histology, and cytoarchitecture. The down-regulatory effects of immunomodulatory agents on the activated glial cells and their therapeutic effects on schizophrenic patients are consistent with this hypothesis. Objective: We investigated whether treatment with the anti-inflammatory drug dimethyl fumarate (DMF) could rescue impacts of prenatal exposure to polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid [poly (I:C)]. Methods: Pregnant dams were administered poly(I:C) at gestational day 9.5. Offspring born from these mothers were treated with DMF for fourteen consecutive days from postnatal day 80 and were assessed behaviorally before and after treatment. The brains were then stained with Cresyl Violet or Golgi-Cox. In addition to the estimation of stereological parameters, cytoarchitectural changes were also evaluated in the medial prefrontal cortex. Results: MIA caused some abnormalities in behavior, as well as changes in the number of neurons and non neurons. These alterations were also extended to pyramidal layer III neurons with a significant decrease in dendritic complexity and spine density which DMF treatment could prevent these changes. Furthermore, DMF treatment was also effective against abnormal exploratory and depression-related behavior, but not the changes in the number of cells. Conclusion: These findings support the idea of using anti-inflammatory agents as adjunctive therapy in patients with SCZ.

AB  - The potential of Melaleuca quinquenervia (Cav.) S.T. Blake to reinvade cleared areas was evaluated over a 13-yr period that included two wildfires and the introduction of biological control agents. The first wildfire occurred in 1998 and was followed by a mean of 591.5 recruited seedlings m(-2). Recruits from that fire were cleared 7 yr later in July 2005 for a second experiment to evaluate seedling recruitment into cleared areas. Seed rain, seedling recruitment and mortality, and sapling growth rates were measured in four plots located around individual large reproductive trees. A second natural wildfire in 2007 burned through those plots, leading to increases in seed rain followed by a pulse in recruitment of 21.04 seedlings m(-2), 96.5% fewer than after the 1998 fire. Recruits in half of the plots around each tree were then treated with regular applications of an insecticide to restrict herbivory by biological control agents, while herbivory was not restricted in the other half. There was no difference in seedling mortality between treatments 1,083 d post-fire (2007) with 96.6% seedling mortality in the unrestricted herbivory treatment and 89.4% mortality in the restricted herbivory treatment. Recruits subjected to the restricted herbivory treatment grew taller than those in the unrestricted herbivory treatment, 101.3 cm versus 37.4 cm. Many of the recruits were attacked by the biological control agents, which slowed their growth. Although solitary M. quinquenervia trees retain some capacity to reinvade areas under specific circumstances, there was a downward trend in their overall invasiveness at this site, with progressively smaller recruitment cohorts due to biological control agents. Land managers should prioritize removing large reproductive trees over treating recently recruited populations, which can be left for many years for the biological control agents to suppress before any additional treatment would be needed.

AB  - Croplands have become a hotspot for antibiotic and microplastic (MP) pollution. However, little is known regarding their combined effects on crops. In this study, the individual and combined effects of oxytetracycline (OTC) and three MPs (i.e., polypropylene (PP), polyamide (PA), and polyvinylchloride (PVC)) on cherry radish were investigated using pot experiments. Individually, OTC (50 mg kg-1), PA (2%, w/w), and PP (2%, w/w) induced negligible effects on cherry radish biomass and the root/shoot ratio. However, PVC (2%, w/w) signif-icantly inhibited cherry radish growth; that is, its shoot and root fresh weight decreased by 46.2% and 81.1%, respectively. In the combined exposure groups, OTC alleviated the adverse effects of PVC on the cherry radish leaf number and shoot fresh weight. This was linked to that OTC increased the content of photosynthetic pig-ments. Superoxide dismutase activity in cherry radish roots was inhibited to different extents in all treatment groups except for the PA and PVC treatments. Malondialdehyde (MDA) content in cherry radish roots increased in all treatment groups, suggesting that both OTC and MPs caused oxidative damage to cherry radish root cells, therefore inhibiting cherry radish root growth. However, the presence of OTC non-significantly changed the effects of MPs on cherry radish roots. Irrespective of OTC presence, MPs induced a reduction in the root/shoot ratio of cherry radish, suggesting that the inhibitory effect of MPs on cherry radish roots was stronger than that on shoots. These findings contribute to the evaluation of the phytotoxicity of antibiotics and MPs in soil -vegetable systems.

AB  - The successful establishment of bark beetle-fungus symbionts on plants is required to overcome host defenses. However, little is known about how different bark beetle-fungus symbionts adapt to different niches on the same host plant. Here, we investigated the niche partitioning mechanism of two co-occurring bark beetle-fungus symbiotic systems, Ips nitidus-Ophiostoma bicolor and Dendroctonus micans-Endoconidiophora laricicola, on Qinghai spruce (Picea crassifolia) tree. The lower niche of the spruce trunk inhabited by D. micans showed a higher content of monoterpenes than the upper niche of the trunk inhabited by I. nitidus. Dendroctonus micans showed greater tolerance and higher metabolic efficiency toward monoterpenes than I. nitidus. However, both beetle species showed a similar metabolic profile toward alpha-pinene, albeit with different levels of metabolites. Additionally, O. bicolor, transmitted by I. nitidus, showed a significantly higher tolerance to monoterpenes and pathogenicity to spruce trees than E. laricicola, transmitted by D. micans. In particular, monoterpenoid metabolites were observed to attenuate the inhibitory effect of high-dose alpha-pinene on E. laricicola, thus increasing its fitness in a high-dose monoterpene microhabitat. These results show that these two bark beetle-fungus symbionts have adapted to different niches, leading to fitness differences in niche distribution that are at least partly related to the different distribution of monoterpene concentration in the spruce trunk. This research provides a novel perspective for understanding the coevolution between bark beetle-fungus symbionts and their host plants.

AB  - 1. Airborne plant communication is a widespread phenomenon in which volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from damaged plants boost herbivore resistance in neighbouring, undamaged plants. Although this form of plant signalling has been reported in more than 30 plant species, there is still a considerable knowledge gap on how abiotic factors (e.g. water availability) alter its outcomes. We performed a greenhouse experiment to test for communication between potato plants Solanum tuberosum in response to herbivory by the generalist insect Spodoptera exigua and whether communication was affected by water availability.
   2. We paired emitter and receiver potato plants, with half of the emitters damaged by S. exigua larvae and half serving as undamaged controls. Both emitter and receiver plants were factorially subjected to one of two watering treatments: high (i.e. well-watered) vs. low (i.e. reduced watering) availability, thus effectively teasing apart water availability effects on the emission and reception components of signalling. After 4 days of herbivore feeding, we collected emitter VOCs and receivers were subjected to feeding by S. exigua to test for effects of signalling on induced resistance.
   3. Herbivory by S. exigua led to increased VOCs emissions as well as changes in VOCs composition in emitter plants. Furthermore, emitters subjected to low water availability exhibited a weaker induction of VOCs in response to herbivory relative to well-watered emitters. Results from the feeding bioassay indicated that receivers exposed to VOCs from herbivore-induced emitters showed lower S. exigua damage (i.e. induced resistance) compared to receivers exposed to undamaged emitters. However, we did not observe a significant effect of water availability in either emitters or receivers on plant signalling effects on receiver resistance.
   4. Overall, our study contributes to understanding how the abiotic context affects plant communication by providing evidence of water availability effects on the induction of VOCs that act as airborne signals between plants. The observed changes in induced VOCs due to the water treatment had no detectable consequences for plant communication. Accordingly, the induction of key compounds mediating communication was apparently not compromised by our experimental conditions.

AB  - The pig is an increasingly popular biomedical model, but only a few in depth data exist on its studies in hair follicle (HF) morphogenesis and development. Hence, the objective of this study was to identify the suitability of the pig as an animal model for human hair research. We performed a classification of pig HF morphogenesis stages and hair types. All four different hair types sampled from 17 different body parts in pig were similar to those of human. The Guard_2 sub-type was more similar to type II human scalp hair while Guard_1, Awl, Auchene, and Zigzag were similar to type I scalp hair. Based on morphological observation and marker gene expression of HF at 11 different embryonic days and six postnatal days, we classified pig HF morphogenesis development from E41 to P45 into three main periods - induction (E37-E41), organogenesis (E41-E85), and cytodifferentiation (>E85). Furthermore, we demonstrated that human and pig share high similarities in HF morphogenesis occurrence time (early/mid gestational) and marker gene expression patterns. Our findings will facilitate the study of human follicle morphogenesis and research on complex hair diseases and offer researchers a suitable model for human hair research.

AB  - Biochar from waste has emerged as a vital solution for multiple contemporary issues. While the organic content and porous structure of biochar have granted it multiple benefits. Where the use of biochar is proven to be beneficial for enhancing the soil structure and water and nutrients retention ability, therefore, saving water and boosting yields in arid regions. Moreover, biochar is capable to sequester carbon from the atmosphere and permanently store it within the soil. As such, this study evaluates the potential for carbon sequestration through biochar obtained from the pyrolysis of feedstock mixtures including camel manure, date pits, high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and low-density polyethylene (LDPE), and how it can enhance water and food security. Multiple energy and water supplying sources have been considered for different project scenarios to provide a broader understanding of biochar potentials. The lifecycle analysis (LCA) approach is utilized for the assessment of net emissions, while an economic study is conducted in Aspen Process Economic Analyser (APEA) to evaluate the feasibility of the different scenarios. Finally, single-objective optimization and multi-objective optimizations were carried out using excel and MATLAB genetic algorithm respectively to select optimal biomass blending and utilities options to fulfill the low cost and negative emissions targets. The assessment conducted for a Qatar case study indicates that the best waste blending scenario for maximum carbon sequestration potential was obtained at a mixing ratio of 20.4% Camel manure: 27% date pits: 26.3% LDPE: 26.4% HDPE. Furthermore, the optimum char blend for maximum carbon sequestration corresponding to the minimum cost of char mix was computed. The optimal biochar mixing percentage for highest net emission was obtained at a feedstock mixing ratio of 96.8% of date pits, 1.5% of LDPE, and 1.7% of HDPE with 0% of camel manure with an optimal cost of 313.55 $/kg biochar. Solar PV was selected as the best energy source in this pyrolysis study due to its reduced carbon emissions in comparison to other sources studied such as natural gas, coal and diesel. However, natural gas is selected to fulfill the economic objective. Moreover, the optimal water source was investigated including wastewater treatment, multi-stage flash and reverse osmosis desalination, where treated wastewater is selected as the optimal supply to fulfill both, economic and environmental objectives.

AB  - Globalization has spread thousands of invasive insect species into new world regions,1-3 causing severe losses in ecosystem services. Previous work proposed that plant invasions facilitate insect invasions through the creation of niches for non-native herbivores.3-6 Despite the impact of insect invasions, a comprehensive understanding is lacking on how invasion success varies among insect feeding groups. We therefore compiled the predominant larval trophic groups (herbivores, predators, parasites, detritivores, and brood- carers) for 5,839 non-native insect species in nine world regions to compare (1) proportions of species in each group between non-native species and the world's fauna, (2) how invasion success for each trophic group has changed over the last three centuries, and (3) how historical herbivore invasions are related to plant invasions over time and parasite invasions are related to herbivores. We find that herbivores represent a significantly larger proportion (52.4%) among non-native insects compared with the world fauna (38.4%), whereas proportions of non-native detritivores (including fungivores), predators, and brood-carers are significantly lower; parasite proportions do not significantly differ. Predators and detritivores dominated among invasions in the 18th century but subsequently diminished, likely due to changing invasion pathways, whereas proportions of herbivores, parasites, and brood-carers increased over time. We found herbivore invasions to lag 80 years behind plant invasions, whereas parasitoids appear to co-invade with their herbivore hosts. The dominance of herbivores among non-native insects and their strong cross-correlation with plant invasions further strengthens the hypothesis that plant invasions drive the global rise in numbers of nonnative insects.

AB  - The mucosal barriers of a lamb's nasal cavity are composed of a multi-layer barrier designed to protect against the invasion of harmful microorganisms. However, despite the protective measures, respiratory pathogens still infect the sheep from the nasal cavity. Therefore, our study aimed to investigate the characteristics of lamb's nasal cavity barrier at different developmental stages. For nasal histological characteristics, our study revealed that the conchoidal curvature of the inferior nasal conch and the number of glands significantly increased with lamb development. For nasal mucosal barrier characteristics, physical and immune barriers were carefully explored. Initially, we observed that the thickness and proliferative capacity of nasal epithelial significantly increased from fetal to 21 days, which then decreased at 60 days. Then, our study showed that the number of goblet cells (GCs) of 21 days old lamb was significantly higher than in other stages of development. Besides, we found that the number of nasal immune cells, such as dendritic cells, CD3+ T cells, IgA+ B cells, and nasalassociated lymphoid tissue (NALT), were all significantly increased not only from the proximal to distal side in the nasal cavity but also with their age. Totally, our study revealed various characteristics of the mucosal barriers of a lamb's nasal cavity, which provide a reference for explaining the susceptibility of respiratory tract infection in lambs.

AB  - Although abundant lncRNAs have been found to be highly expressed in early embryos, the functions and mechanisms of most lncRNAs in regulating embryonic development remain unclear. This study was conducted to identify the key lncRNAs during embryonic genome activation (EGA) for promoting embryonic development after somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) in goats. We screened and characterized lncRNAs from transcriptome data of in vitro-fertilized, two-cell (IVF-2c) and eight-cell embryos (IVF-8c) and eight-cell SCNT embryos (SCNT-8c). We obtained 12 differentially expressed lncRNAs that were highly expressed in IVF-8c embryos compared to IVF-2c and less expressed in SCNT-8c embryos. After target gene prediction, expression verification, and functional deletion experiments, we found that the expression level of lncRNA3720 affected the early embryonic development in goats. We cloned full-length lncRNA3720 and over-expressed it in goat fetal fibroblasts (GFFs). We identified histone variants by analyzing the transcriptome data from both GFFs and embryos. Gene annotation of the gene library and the literature search revealed that histone variants may have important roles in early embryo development, so we selected them as the potential target genes for lncRNA3720. Lastly, we compensated for the low expression of lncRNA3720 in SCNT embryos by microinjection and showed that the development rate and quality of SCNT embryos were significantly improved. We speculate that lncRNA3720 is a key promoter of embryonic development in goats by interacting with histone variants.

AB  - The objective of this research was to evaluate in vitro ovicidal activity of aqueous extract (Aq-E) of 12, 6, and 3 pg/ml concentrations of Carica papaya L. (Caricaceae) latex against the sheep parasite Haemonchus contortus. The data were analyzed in a completely randomized design. Morphostructural changes of eggs exposed to the extract were observed by optical microscopy, and secondary compounds in latex were analyzed using qualitative phytochemical tests. Results showed high egg hatch inhibition activity (EHI ovicidal test) in vitro, with values near 100% (P < 0.05) at 12 pg/ml, very similar to the check. Inhibition decreased to 55.4% with 3 pg/ml concentration, indicating concentration-dependent effect. Phytochemical analysis of Aq-E showed alkaloids, and micrographs revealed significant cell damage in eggs exposed to extract compared to nonexposed eggs. Results suggested Aq-E from papaya had bioactive compounds with strong ovicidal activity in vitro, which could be a good and affordable option to control gastrointestinal nematodes in small ruminants.

AB  - The purpose of our work was to study the polymorphism of genes associated with disease resistance and to search for their associations with productive traits in the population of the Ukrainian Large White pigs. For this study, 50 pigs were used, observations and measurements were carried out at the age from birth to 180 days. Genetic studies were carried out in a certified laboratory of the Institute of Pig Breeding and Agroindustrial Production. In the study of fucosyltransferase 1 and solute carrier family 11 member 1 genes, polymorphism was found in three of the five analyzed loci. In the Ukrainian Large White subpopulation of pigs the informativeness of these gene polymorphisms was at the optimal level for associative analysis, Polymorphism Information Content was greater than 0.3 in two loci. A sufficiently high level of Polymorphism Information Content indicates the value of this breed to preserve the biodiversity of pigs. The distribution of genotypes at some loci of the solute carrier family 11 member 1 gene was characterized by a deviation from the theoretically expected one due to the increase in the frequency of the heterozygous genotype. There was also a statistically confirmed deviation of the genotypes' distribution from the normal and polymorphism fucosyltransferase 1 gene, but in this case in the direction of increasing the frequency of both homozygous variants. These results indicate the presence of a certain selection pressure on the mentioned polymorphisms and their possible impact on productive traits. The influence of solute carrier family 11 member 1 gene polymorphism on the weight of pigs at the age of 120 and 180 days, the average daily gain recorded in the period 28-120 days and from birth to 180 days, as well as on the backfat thickness, was established. The preferred genotype is TT, which can be used in breeding to obtain more productive animals with increased disease resistance, but in the selection of animals at this locus, it is necessary to control the backfat thickness and prevent breeding of pigs that may worsen this trait.

AB  - The swine industry is one of the industries that progressively incorporates smart livestock farming (SLF) to monitor the grouped-housed pigs' welfare. In recent years, pigs' positive welfare has gained much attention. One of the evident behavioral indicators of positive welfare is playing behaviors. However, playing behavior is spontaneous and temporary, which makes the detection of playing behaviors difficult. The most direct method to monitor the pigs' behaviors is a video surveillance system, for which no comprehensive classification framework exists. In this work, we develop a comprehensive pig playing behavior classification framework and build a new video-based classification model of pig playing behaviors using deep learning. We base our deep learning framework on an end-to-end trainable CNN-LSTM network, with ResNet34 as the CNN backbone model. With its high classification accuracy of over 92% and superior performances over the existing models, our proposed model highlights the importance of applying the global maximum pooling method on the CNN final layer's feature map and leveraging a temporal attention layer as an input to the fully connected layer for final prediction. Our work has direct implications on advancing the welfare assessment of group-housed pigs and the current practice of SLF.

AB  - Flower addition is commonly used worldwide to benefit parasitoids and improve conservation biological control of pests. However, biological control enhancement via flower addition depends on both flower attractiveness and the responses of parasitoid and pest species to flower resources. Here, we experimentally compared the effects of two Apiaceae flowering species (Conium maculatum and Coriandrum sativum) with those of water, honey and no resource treatments on longevity and survival of adults of the leafminer Liriomyza huidobrensis and two hymenopteran parasitoids (Chrysocharis flacilla and Phaedrotoma scabriventris). We also examined the attractiveness of flowers of both plant species to the leafminer and P. scabriventris adults. The provision of flowers increased longevity and survival of the three insect species with respect to water and no resource treatments. The effects of honey on longevity were similar to or even higher than those of flowers, depending on the insect species, whereas water only increased the longevity of P. scabriventris in relation to no resource treatments. In attractiveness trials, P. scabriventris preferred C. maculatum flowers, whereas L. huidobrensis showed no preference for flower species. Our findings indicate that both plant species have potential as floral resources in biological control, since two parasitoid species benefited from flowers. However, these plant species must be cautiously considered because L. huidobrensis also improved its fitness when provided with both floral resources. The present work highlights the need to simultaneously study parasitoid and herbivore food needs and flower attractiveness, especially in dipteran pests, in order to achieve a successful biological control.

AB  - Spent mushroom substrate (SMS) from Pleurotus ostreatus is high in salinity, susceptible to deterioration caused by mold, and not suitable for direct application in soil. Its high C/N ratio and low pH inhibit the humification process during composting. Pig manure (PM) possesses high density and low porosity, impeding microbial metabolism. Co-composting SMS and PM can overcome these challenges. A 120-day composting experiment was conducted with varying mass ratios of SMS and PM, supplemented with calcium bentonite and microbial inoculum. After composting, there was observed a significant rise in the N and K 2 O contents, ranging from 11.1% to 84.1% and 55.1% - 296.8%, respectively. Additionally, there was a decrease in the C/N ratio by a range of 18.9% - 60.1%. The total nutrient content of SMS post-composting solely was a mere 4.9%, failing to meet the 5% required by China ' s Professional Standard outlined for organic fertilizers (NY/T525-2021). Composting PM alone simplified the molecular structure of humic-extracted acid (HE) and reduced the C content of humic acid (HA) by up to 18.1%. In contrast, co-composting SMS and PM in equal proportions stimulated microbial consumption of water-soluble substances, resulting in increase in C contents of HE and HA by 11.5% and 18.7%, respectively, along with a 15.4% rise in the polymerization level of the composted materials. Furthermore, this combination facilitated the conversion of inert humic component, reducing C content of humin by 79.3%, lowering the electrical conductivity (EC) value by 23.0%, and boosting GI value by 154.1%. Increasing the proportion of SMS in co-compost proved advantageous in enriching its organic matter content. The composting process involved bio-degradation of O-containing functional groups like phenols and alcohols, utilization of polysaccharides by microorganisms, and development of carboxyl groups in the HA. Based on the above index analysis, the most effective compost ratio to achieve higher humification level and compost quality was determined to be a mass ratio of SMS to PM of 5:5, followed by 6:4.

AB  - Conservation strategies that use sustainable use of natural resources through green-labelled markets generally do not recognize the legal sale of wild meat as appropriate due to potential overexploitation and zoonotic disease risks. Wildlife hunting is important to the livelihoods of rural communities living in tropical forests for protein and income. Wildlife management plans in the Peruvian Amazon permit hunting of wild meat species for subsistence and sale at sustainable levels, that include peccaries, deer, and large rodents. These species have fast reproduction making them less vulnerable to overhunting than other species. This study assessed the sustainability of a wildlife management plan. Populations of species were estimated using camera traps and distance transect surveys, and sustainability analysis used hunting pressure from community hunting registers. Interviews were conducted to understand hunters, perceptions of the management plan. Long-term time-series showed increases in collared peccary (3.0 individual/km2 to 5.41 individual/km2) and white-lipped peccary (3.50 individual/km2 to 7.00 individual/km2) populations and short-term time series showed a decline in paca populations from 8.5 individual/km2 to 3.01 individual/km2. The unified harvest analysis showed permitted species populations were greater than 60% of their carrying capacities and hunted at less than 40% of their production, which shows sustainable hunting. The wildlife management plan achieved its general objective of sustainable hunting and improving livelihoods. The broader question is whether sustainable wildlife use plans that allow Amazonian communities to sell limited amounts of wild meat can be a way to change illegal wild meat trade to a legal, green labelled trade with added value.

AB  - The supplementation of sperm culture media with serum is quite common, and improves both sperm survival and motility. However, the link between serum and sperm remains poorly understood. The present study is the first investigation of the effects on sperm quality and function of endogenous porcine serum exosomes in medium used for culturing boar sperm. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) confirmed that serum-derived exosomes from both castrated boars (cbsExos) and sows (ssExos) exhibited typical nanostructural morphology and expressed CD63, CD9, and Alix, as shown by Western blotting. At 17 degrees C, the progressive motility and membrane integrity of sperm were significantly increased after incubation of fresh boar semen for 7 days with cbsExos-4 (8 x 1010 particles/mL) or ssExos-16 (32 x 1010 particles/mL). Moreover, cbsExos-4 and ssExos-16 were found to be effective sperm additives, improving mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Delta Psi m) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content, total antioxidant activity (T-AOC), superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity while reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and malondialdehyde (MDA) content following preservation at 17 degrees C after a 5-day incubation. Both fluorescence and SEM showed that the serum exosomes bound directly to the sperm membrane, suggesting an interaction that could influence sperm-zona pellucida binding. Overall, this study provides new insights into the potential benefits of adding cbsExos and ssExos to enhance the quality of boar sperm during ambient temperature preservation, which may lead to advancements in sperm preservation strategies.

AB  - Fishery catch records offer limited data to assess the status of rare, non-commercial species, including some sharks. Despite marine megafauna creating an important source of revenue though tourism, basic spatial information required to create conservation strategies is not available for many of these species. A cost-effective approach to assess the distribution of rare, non-commercial species is required to manage resources and inform conservation strategies in data-deficient areas. This study provides new information on the distribution and abundance of the zebra shark in southern Africa and examines if local ecological knowledge can be used to identify spatial and temporal trends of rare, non-commercial elasmobranchs. Trends identified from fisher interviews at two locations were compared to those collected using structured dive surveys. Both fisher interviews and structured surveys identified similar hotspot areas and temporal changes in the zebra shark population. Photographs of zebra sharks taken by researchers, dive operators, and recreational scuba divers between Pomene and Sodwana Bay were used to identify and provide information on the size, sex and movement of individuals. A combination of geo-located data gathered from one hundred interviews conducted with fishers at four different locations within Mozambique and sightings information from scuba divers were used in a species distribution model to determine the relative importance of environmental predictors and identify further areas of suitable habitat. Sea surface temperature was the most important factor in the coldest months, with distance from shore most limiting habitat suitability at other times of year. This approach could be applied in data-deficient regions to highlight areas of interest, prioritise research activities and inform conservation actions for rare, noncommercial marine megafauna.

AB  - It is generally accepted that microbial digestion contributes little to digesta particle size reduction in herbivores, and that faecal particle size reflects mainly chewing efficiency, and may vary with diet. Nevertheless, a decrease in mean particle size (MPS) along the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) has been reported, especially in hindgut fermenters. However, to what degree the very fine particle fraction (non-food origin, especially microbes) affects MPS is unclear. Fat sand rats (Psammomys obesus, diurnal herbivores, n = 23, 175 +/- sd 24 g) consumed one of four chenopods (natural dietary items in the wild) for 30 days. Digestibility was related negatively to dietary fibre content. We determined digesta MPS in the forestomach, glandular stomach, small intestine, caecum, colon and faeces by wet sieving, including (MPSfines) or excluding (MPSnofines) particles < 0.25 mm. The proportions of fines were higher and of MPSfines were correspondingly lower in GIT sections that harbour microbes (forestomach, hindgut), whereas MPSnofines did not differ between forestomach and glandular stomach. However, MPSnofines decreased along the GIT, indicating MPS reduction due to digestive (enzymatic and microbial) processes. The four different diets led to different MPS, but the magnitude of MPS reduction in the GIT was not correlated with dietary fibre fractions or dry matter digestibility. These results indicate that within a species, MPS cannot be used as a proxy for diet quality or digestibility, and raise the hypothesis that MPS reduction along the GIT may be more pronounced in smaller than in larger mammalian terrestrial herbivores, possibly due to the fine initial particles produced by chewing in small species.

AB  - Unpiggable pipelines, often inaccessible for traditional pigging operations, pose significant risks due to residual hydrocarbons and limited inspection options. This paper presents an optimized methodology for flushing, deoiling, and abandoning unpiggable subsea pipelines, specifically designed to address the unique environmental and regulatory challenges in the Arabian Gulf. The paper introduces an innovative approach that integrates advanced modeling tools - OLGA for internal flow assurance and CORMIX for pollutant dispersion analysis - to manage oil-in-water (OIW) concentrations effectively, ensuring compliance with the stringent 15ppm discharge limit. The proposed methodology not only mitigates residual contamination risks but also enhances operational efficiency and regulatory compliance through adaptive measures. By addressing plateauing contaminant removal rates and leveraging region-specific environmental data, the current study provides actionable guidance for sustainable decommissioning of subsea pipelines. The findings hold broad applicability for projects in environmentally sensitive marine ecosystems, hence, supporting global efforts toward environmentally responsible decommissioning practices.

AB  - Oocyte-secreted factors (OSFs), such as BMP15 and GDF9, are soluble paracrine factors that drive cumulus cell differentiation and function, sustaining oocyte competence acquisition and embryo development. This study aimed to assess the effect of BMP15 and GDF9 on IVM medium of prepubertal goat oocytes. COCs were in vitro matured in absence (control group) or presence of 100 ng/mL of BMP15, GDF9, or both. To determine cumulusoocyte communication, transzonal projections (TZP) density at 0h, 6h, 12h and 24h of IVM were evaluated. After IVM, mitochondrial activity, intracellular ROS and glutathione (GSH) levels, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression in oocytes and cumulus cells, and cumulus expansion were assessed. Blastocyst production and quality were evaluated after parthenogenetic activation (PA) and IVF. IVM supplementation with BMP15 increased the TZP density during the first 6 h of culture. After IVM, BMP15 increased mitochondrial activity, EGFR expression in oocytes and cumulus cells, and cumulus expansion compared to control, but ROS and GSH levels were similar to control. BMP15 improved blastocyst production following PA (15.5% vs 6.3 %) and the number of cells in the blastocyst inner cell mass. No differences were observed on blastocyst production or quality following IVF. IVM supplementation with GDF9 did not improve results from control group in any parameters studied. Additionally, GDF9 in combination with BMP15 only improved mitochondrial activity and cumulus expansion over control. In conclusion, IVM medium supplementation with BMP15 (100 ng/ml) improves COCs quality parameters and PA-blastocyst production and quality of prepubertal goat oocytes. However, GDF9 (100 ng/mL) did not have any beneficial effect in this study and was possibly antagonistic to BMP15.

AB  - In female increase urea intake may affect negatively in fertility as a result of the change in oviduct acidity this effect of urea noticed also in male semen quality. We expect that inclusion urea instead of soya protein may not affect in semen qualities in male duo to high starch ratio in the ration. The study aimed to find out the effect of partial or total replacement urea as a substitute for soybean meal on the reproductive performance of Awassi male sheep. In this study, 15 Awassi lambs were used with an average initial weight of 60.30 kg, aged 11-13 months. Lambs were randomly divided according to their weight into three groups. The first group (T1) animals were fed a ration containing soybean meal, the second group (T2) 50% of soybean meal was replaced by urea, and the third group (T3) urea was totally replaced with soybean meal. The results showed a feed intake decrease consumed 1.14 kg, in the second treatment compared with the first and third treatments (1.34, 1.34 kg). The average daily and total weight gain 0.116 and 7.00 kg, decreased significantly (P < 0.05) in total replacement of urea compared with partial replacement of urea and control treatment 0.191 and 11.50 kg and 0.174 and 10.50 kg, respectively. Partial replacement urea for soybean meal led to a significant decrease (P < 0.05) in semen characteristics compared with T1 and T2. On the other hand, partial urea replacement led to a significant (P < 0.05) increase in the concentration of blood plasma cholesterol 172.48 mg/dl, compared to the second and third treatments, 134.28 and 137.14 mg/dl, respectively. with feeding starch diets inclusion urea Partially are totally instead of soybean meal has determine effect in semen quality.

AB  - The combined effects of the cellular environment on proteins led to the definition of a fifth level of protein structural organization termed quinary structure. To explore the implication of potential quinary structure for globular proteins, we studied the dynamics and conformations of Escherichia coli (E. coli) peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase B (PpiB) in E. coli cells. PpiB plays a major role in maturation and regulation of folded proteins by catalyzing the cis/trans isomerization of the proline imidic peptide bond. We applied electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) techniques, utilizing both Gadolinium (Gd(III)) and nitroxide spin labels. In addition to using standard spin labeling approaches with genetically engineered cysteines, we incorporated an unnatural amino acid to achieve Gd(III)-nitroxide orthogonal labeling. We probed PpiB's residue-specific dynamics by X-band continuous wave EPR at ambient temperatures and its structure by double electron-electron resonance (DEER) on frozen samples. PpiB was delivered to E. coli cells by electroporation. We report a significant decrease in the dynamics induced by the cellular environment for two chosen labeling positions. These changes could not be reproduced by adding crowding agents and cell extracts. Concomitantly, we report a broadening of the distance distribution in E. coli, determined by Gd(III)-Gd(III) DEER measurements, as compared with solution and human HeLa cells. This suggests an increase in the number of PpiB conformations present in E. coli cells, possibly due to interactions with other cell components, which also contributes to the reduction in mobility and suggests the presence of a quinary structure.

AB  - Background Animal personality has emerged as a key concept in behavioral ecology. While many studies have demonstrated the influence of personality traits on behavioral patterns, its quantification, especially in wild animal populations, remains a challenge. Only a few studies have established a link between personality and recurring movements within home ranges, although these small-scale movements are of key importance for identifying ecological interactions and forming individual niches. In this regard, differences in space use among individuals might reflect different exploration styles between behavioral types along the shy-bold continuum. Methods We assessed among-individual differences in behavior in the European hare (Lepus europaeus), a characteristic mammalian herbivore in agricultural landscapes using a standardized box emergence test for captive and wild hares. We determined an individuals' degree of boldness by measuring the latencies of behavioral responses in repeated emergence tests in captivity. During capture events of wild hares, we conducted a single emergence test and recorded behavioral responses proven to be stable over time in captive hares. Applying repeated novel environment tests in a near-natural enclosure, we further quantified aspects of exploration and activity in captive hares. Finally, we investigated whether and how this among-individual behavioral variation is related to general activity and space use in a wild hare population. Wild and captive hares were treated similarly and GPS-collared with internal accelerometers prior to release to the wild or the outdoor enclosure, respectively. General activity was quantified as overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA) obtained from accelerometers. Finally, we tested whether boldness explained variation in (i) ODBA in both settings and (ii) variation in home ranges and core areas across different time scales of GPS-collared hares in a wild population. Results We found three behavioral responses to be consistent over time in captive hares. ODBA was positively related to boldness (i.e., short latencies to make first contact with the new environment) in both captive and wild hares. Space use in wild hares also varied with boldness, with shy individuals having smaller core areas and larger home ranges than bold conspecifics (yet in some of the parameter space, this association was just marginally significant). Conclusions Against our prediction, shy individuals occupied relatively large home ranges but with small core areas. We suggest that this space use pattern is due to them avoiding risky, and energy-demanding competition for valuable resources. Carefully validated, activity measurements (ODBA) from accelerometers provide a valuable tool to quantify aspects of animal personality along the shy-bold continuum remotely. Without directly observing-and possibly disturbing-focal individuals, this approach allows measuring variability in animal personality, especially in species that are difficult to assess with experiments. Considering that accelerometers are often already built into GPS units, we recommend activating them at least during the initial days of tracking to estimate individual variation in general activity and, if possible, match them with a simple novelty experiment. Furthermore, information on individual behavioral types will help to facilitate mechanistic understanding of processes that drive spatial and ecological dynamics in heterogeneous landscapes.

AB  - Simple Summary Newly weaned pigs are typically fed combinations of cereals and proteins to maximise performance. In the absence of the use of certain antimicrobial compounds, combinations of cereals and protein sources can also be used strategically to reduce dysbiosis in the gastrointestinal tract. This experiment examined the impacts of offering either medium-grain or long-grain extruded rice or wheat, in combination with animal or vegetable protein sources, on postweaning performance, shedding of beta-haemolytic Escherichia coli, and the coefficient of total tract apparent digestibility (CTTAD) in the 21 days after weaning. The experimental findings confirmed that extruded rice is an excellent cereal for young pigs but that vegetable protein sources decreased production in weeks two and three compared to the use of animal protein sources. Vegetable protein sources decreased the faecal E. coli score. The CTTAD of dietary components differed according to interactions between cereal and protein sources. Different cereal types, in combination with different protein sources, are fed to pigs after weaning, but their interactions and possible implications are not well researched. In this study, 84 male weaned piglets were used in a 21-day feeding trial to investigate the effects of feeding either medium-grain or long-grain extruded rice or wheat, in a factorial combination with protein sources of either vegetable or animal origin, on postweaning performance, shedding of beta-haemolytic Escherichia coli, and the coefficient of total tract apparent digestibility (CTTAD). Pigs fed either rice type performed the same (p > 0.05) as wheat-fed pigs after weaning. The use of vegetable protein sources reduced growth rate (p < 0.001) and feed intake (p = 0.007) and deteriorated the feed conversion ratio (p = 0.028) in weeks two and three compared to pigs fed animal protein sources. The number of antibiotic treatments given for clinical diarrhoea was similar (p > 0.05). However, the faecal E. coli score showed a trend for the main effect of protein source, with pigs fed animal proteins showing a higher E. coli score than pigs fed vegetable proteins (0.63 vs. 0.43, p = 0.057). There was also a tendency for an interaction (p = 0.069) between cereal type and protein source (p = 0.069), with this difference being associated with a greater faecal score in pigs fed diets with long-grain rice plus animal proteins and wheat plus animal proteins. Significant interactions occurred for the CTTAD when assessed in week three. In general, pigs fed diets with medium-grain rice or long-grain rice with animal proteins had a higher (p < 0.001) CTTAD for dietary components than pigs fed all other diets, and vegetable proteins depressed (p < 0.001) CTTAD compared to animal proteins (main effect of protein: p < 0.001). In summary, pigs tolerated the extruded rice-based diets well and performed equivalently to pigs fed wheat as the sole cereal, and the use of vegetable proteins decreased the E. coli score.

AB  - Processes of killing wild game meat animals could introduce toxic metals into the animal's meat, which subsequently may pose a risk of consumer exposure to toxins during ingestion. In most cases, toxic metals occur naturally in the environment and may be found in traces in different parts of a game meat animal. However, some of these metals are also introduced to meat animals by bullets used during the hunting and killing of game meat animals. These bullets are generally made from metals such as lead, arsenic, and copper, all of which have strictly regulated limits in food products including meat. Samples of helicopter-killed impala in the area around the bullet/pellets' wound (n = 9) and from animals killed by a single projectile (n = 9) were analysed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The type of bullet used influenced the mean concentration of some of these toxic metals (mg/Kg) in meat samples; helicopter killing resulted in the following levels of As (0.665, SD = 1.95); Cd (0.000, SD = 0.000); Pb (620.18, SD = 1247.6); and Hg (0.017 SD = 0.033) compared to single projectile killing that resulted in the following levels: As (0.123, SD = 0.221); Cd (0.008, SD = 0.021); Pb (1610.79, SD = 1384.5); and Hg (0.028, SD = 0.085). The number of samples per metal with levels above the EU products' limits were Pb = 18/18 samples from both killing methods, As = 2/18 samples from helicopter killing, Cd- = 1/18 from rifle killing and Hg = 0/18. To minimise the risks of toxic metals posed by bullets, the use of lead (Pb) free bullets should be encouraged, and the control of meat animal killing methods must always be performed, especially for meat contamination prevention.

AB  - Simple Summary It is widely recognized that the assessment of animal welfare should include measures of positive emotional (affective) state. Existing behavioral and physiological indicators of a positive affective state frequently lack sensitivity, objectivity or are unsuitable in a production environment. Therefore, there is a need to develop new approaches to accurately and objectively measure a positive emotional state in animals, including novel molecular markers such a miRNA. These biomarkers must be measurable in the peripheral circulation and provide an accurate account of the physiological and molecular activity in regions of the brain associated with emotional processing. Further, such markers require validation against established behavioral and physiological indices. Here we investigated the efficacy of circulating miRNA as biomarkers of emotional state in the pig. The ability to assess the welfare of animals is dependent on our ability to accurately determine their emotional (affective) state, with particular emphasis being placed on the identification of positive emotions. The challenge remains that current physiological and behavioral indices are either unable to distinguish between positive and negative emotional states, or they are simply not suitable for a production environment. Therefore, the development of novel measures of animal emotion is a necessity. Here we investigated the efficacy of microRNA (miRNA) in the brain and blood as biomarkers of emotional state in the pig. Female Large White x Landrace pigs (n = 24) were selected at weaning and trained to perform a judgment bias test (JBT), before being exposed for 5 weeks to either enriched (n = 12) or barren housing (n = 12) conditions. Pigs were tested on the JBT once prior to treatment, and immediately following treatment. MiRNA and neurotransmitters were analyzed in blood and brain tissue after euthanasia. Treatment had no effect on the outcomes of the JBT. There was also no effect of treatment on miRNA expression in blood or the brain (FDR p > 0.05). However, pigs exposed to enriched housing had elevated dopamine within the striatum compared to pigs in barren housing (p = 0.02). The results imply that either (a) miRNAs are not likely to be valid biomarkers of a positive affective state, at least under the type of conditions employed in this study, or (b) that the study design used to modify affective state was not able to create differential affective states, and therefore establish the validity of miRNA as biomarkers.

TI  - A water contact glass@PiG film color converter with superhigh brightness and ultralong durability for wide-area underwater lighting and communication
T2  - JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C
LA  - English
AB  - Laser-driven light possesses exceptional brightness, rendering it particularly suitable for underwater lighting (UL) and underwater wireless optical communication (UWOC). However, achieving high-brightness light remains a challenge due to significant luminescence quenching in color converters caused by heat accumulation from high-power laser excitation. This study proposes an innovative approach for utilizing laser lighting in UL and UWOC applications by directly immersing color converters in water to eliminate thermal-induced luminescence saturation. To develop color converters capable of prolonged contact with water, we significantly enhanced the water stability of a Y3Al5O12:Ce phosphor-in-glass (PiG) film through Si-N co-doping and a novel waterproof structure. Due to direct contact with water, the underwater illuminance of the PiG film could reach as high as similar to 2.94 x 105 lux at a distance of 15 cm from the source under 34.9 W mm-2 blue laser excitation, with no luminescence saturation observed. Due to the optimized phosphor stability and waterproof design, the illuminance of the PiG film remained at 98.56% and 98.70% of its original intensity after 50 days in clear water and seawater, respectively. Finally, a portable underwater laser light source with a 60 degrees divergence angle was developed in a simple transmissive excitation mode based on the PiG film. This light source could illuminate wide-area underwater environments at distances exceeding 20 m and facilitate wide-area UWOC over distances greater than 40 m. These findings pave the new way for the commercial application of laser-driven lighting devices in wide-area UL and UWOC.

AB  - Background Gene expression programs are intimately linked to the interplay of active cis regulatory elements mediated by chromatin contacts and associated RNAs. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified many variants in these regulatory elements that can contribute to phenotypic diversity. However, the functional interpretation of these variants remains nontrivial due to the lack of chromatin contact information or limited contact resolution. Furthermore, the distribution and role of chromatin-associated RNAs in gene expression and chromatin conformation remain poorly understood. To address this, we first present a comprehensive interaction map of nuclear dynamics of 3D chromatin-chromatin interactions (H3K27ac BL-HiChIP) and RNA-chromatin interactions (GRID-seq) to reveal genomic variants that contribute to complex skeletal muscle traits. Results In a genome-wide scan, we provide systematic fine mapping and gene prioritization from GWAS leading signals that underlie phenotypic variability of growth rate, meat quality, and carcass performance. A set of candidate functional variants and 54 target genes previously not detected were identified, with 71% of these candidate functional variants choosing to skip over their nearest gene to regulate the target gene in a long-range manner. The effects of three functional variants regulating KLF6 (related to days to 100 kg), MXRA8 (related to lean meat percentage), and TAF11 (related to loin muscle depth) were observed in two pig populations. Moreover, we find that this multi-omics interaction map consists of functional communities that are enriched in specific biological functions, and GWAS target genes can serve as core genes for exploring peripheral trait-relevant genes. Conclusions Our results provide a valuable resource of candidate functional variants for complex skeletal muscle-related traits and establish an integrated approach to complement existing 3D genomics by exploiting RNA-chromatin and chromatin-chromatin interactions for future association studies.

AB  - The small semi -fossorial herbivore bioturbation has been verified to affect available soil nitrogen in grasslands, but the effects of small semi -fossorial herbivore bioturbation on soil organic nitrogen (SON) fractions that are main compositions of soil total nitrogen and sources of soil available nitrogen remain poorly known. The plateau pika ( Ochotona curzoniae ) bioturbation creates numerous bare patches, which intersperse within vegetated surfaces in grasslands. In this study, plateau pika was considered as an example animal to examine the differences of SON fractions between bare patches and vegetated surfaces under the small semi -fossorial herbivore bioturbation across six sites. This study demonstrated that acid -hydrolysable nitrogen (AHN) was 27.58% lower in bare patches than in vegetated surfaces. Amino acid nitrogen (AAN), ammonium nitrogen (AN), amino sugar nitrogen (ASN) and unknown nitrogen (UN) in bare patches were 35.23%, 17.07%, 17.70% and 19.87% lower than those in vegetated surfaces, respectively. The contribution of AAN to AHN was 5.3% lower in bare patches than in vegetated surfaces, but the contributions of AN, ASN and UN to AHN were 2.42%, 1.11%, and 1.77% higher, respectively. The response of AAN to plateau pika bioturbation was more sensitive than AN, ASN and UN. These findings verify the plateau pika bioturbation leads to a lower potential capacity of soil nitrogen supply in bare patches than in vegetated surfaces, and present a possible pattern of SON fractions in relation to small semi -fossorial herbivore bioturbation in grasslands.

AB  - Translocation is commonly used in the conservation of threatened species to help mitigate the risk of local extinctions. However, translocations are often limited by knowledge of the species ecological requirements that promote persistence in the landscape. Small translocation trials with a strong experimental design can help to address species knowledge gaps and identify effective strategies for the successful establishment of a threatened species prior to implementing full-scale planting regimes. In this study, we experimentally translocated 128 plants of the endangered Persoonia hirsuta (Proteaceae) at a dry sclerophyll mining offset in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, and investigated the effects of propagation type (seeds and vegetative cuttings), plant guards, and mulching on short-term plant growth and survival. Transplants were impacted by herbivory and unprecedented extreme temperatures over summer 2019-2020 with 25 of the 128 plants surviving after 20 months of monitoring. Among the surviving individuals, all but one were seed propagated and 72% of survivors were protected by a plant guard. Short-term survival and establishment of P. hirsuta translocants was increased by producing plants from seeds, and the use of plant guards with localized mulch. We also identified significantly greater root volume, projected area, and diameter for seedlings than cuttings grown plants. Our study successfully identified several key factors that should be considered for the ongoing management of P. hirsuta and vindicates the importance of small experimental trials when planning threatened plant translocations.

AB  - Exopolysaccharides (EPSs) produced by probiotic bacteria have garnered attention due to their effects on the gut health of humans and animals. The nutrients that probiotics access during their growth are essential for producing beneficial effects on host health. Direct immunomodulatory effects of graminan-type fructans (GTFs) from Agave tequilana through toll-like receptors (TLRs) have been demonstrated. However, the immunomodulatory effects of these fructans, mediated through the EPSs produced by the probiotics cultivated with them, remain unexplored. We explored the immunomodulatory effects of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains isolated from swine and their EPSs, based on the GTFs used as carbon sources during their growth. While the LAB strains activated the NF-kappa B pathway independently of the GTF source, their EPSs activated it in a GTF source-dependent manner. LAB activation through TLR2 showed a GTF source dependency, whereas their EPSs activated TLR2 independently of the GTF source. The LAB and their EPSs activated TLR4 in a GTF source-dependent manner. Both the LAB and their EPSs inhibited the activation of TLR2 and TLR4 agonists, which exhibited a strong dependence on the GTF source. The strength of GTF C's immunomodulatory effects on LAB illustrates its specificity, its impact on the EPS structure, and its biological effects. Our results support the promising health benefits of this synbiotic model for swine health and lowering inflammation.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the effect of L-carnitine on in vitro maturation and subsequent in vitro embryo production of buffalo oocytes.
   Methods: Cumulus oocyte complexes (COCs) were aspirated from ovaries of slaughtered buffaloes. COCs were classified into good and fair qualities based on morphological observation of numbers and integrity of cumulus cells surrounding the oocyte. Both categories of COCs were placed in in vitro maturation medium with supplementation of different concentrations (0, 0.250, 0.375 or 0.500 mg/mL) of L-carnitine. Oocytes from both qualities were in vitro fertilized and in vitro cultured for 7 days, to examine the developmental competence.
   Results: Supplementation of L-carnitine to in vitro maturation medium increased the cumulus cell expansion rate of COCs to grade A, and reduced the cumulus cell expansion of COCs to grade B and grade C in both good and fair quality oocytes. Similarly, L-carnitine induced the in vitro meiotic progression of buffalo oocytes to metaphase Pi in both good and fair quality oocytes. Additionally, L-carnitine reduced the rate of oocyte degeneration in both good and fair quality oocytes. L-carnitine increased the rate of cleaved formation at day 2 and blastocyst formation at day 7 during in vitro culture in both qualities of oocytes. Moreover, a higher rate of blastocyst production was observed in L-carnitine-treated fair quality oocytes, which was higher than the results in the untreated good quality oocytes.
   Conclusions: L-carnitine enhances meiotic maturation and subsequent embryo development from both good and fair quality buffalo oocytes.

AB  - Simple Summary Genome editing is a well-known method for introducing targeted genetic alterations into livestock genomes. These changes must be transferable in the germline in order to be effective in animal breeding. Conventional methods of delivering CRISPR-Cas9 components, such as microinjection in the zygote or editing somatic cells followed by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT), have demonstrated success in various species, including mice and certain domestic animals. However, these methods are often labour-intensive, technically demanding, and associated with variable efficiencies. Electroporation is a more recently described way of delivering Cas9 and sgRNAs into zygotes since it requires less expensive equipment than microinjection and takes less time. In the present study, we have developed an efficient method called CRISPR RNP electroporation of zygote (CRISPR-EP) to reduce mosaicism rates and increase biallelic mutations in buffalo. The developed easy and straightforward protocol for gene editing could serve as a useful method for studying the functional genomics of the buffalo embryos.Abstract Somatic cell nuclear transfer or cytoplasm microinjection has widely been used to produce genome-edited farm animals; however, these methods have several drawbacks which reduce their efficiency. In the present study, we describe an easy adaptable approach for the introduction of mutations using CRISPR-Cas9 electroporation of zygote (CRISPR-EP) in buffalo. The goal of the study was to determine the optimal conditions for an experimental method in which the CRISPR/Cas9 system is introduced into in vitro-produced buffalo zygotes by electroporation. Electroporation was performed using different combinations of voltage, pulse and time, and we observed that the electroporation in buffalo zygote at 20 V/mm, 5 pulses, 3 msec at 10 h post insemination (hpi) resulted in increased membrane permeability and higher knockout efficiency without altering embryonic developmental potential. Using the above parameters, we targeted buffalo POU5F1 gene as a proof of concept and found no variations in embryonic developmental competence at cleavage or blastocyst formation rate between control, POU5F1-KO, and electroporated control (EC) embryos. To elucidate the effect of POU5F1-KO on other pluripotent genes, we determined the relative expression of SOX2, NANOG, and GATA2 in the control (POU5F1 intact) and POU5F1-KO-confirmed blastocyst. POU5F1-KO significantly (p <= 0.05) altered the expression of SOX2, NANOG, and GATA2 in blastocyst stage embryos. In conclusion, we standardized an easy and straightforward protocol CRISPR-EP method that could be served as a useful method for studying the functional genomics of buffalo embryos.

AB  - Simple Summary In livestock, a low birth weight (LBW) has a broad impact on neonatal survival, growth performance, and metabolic health in adult life. The liver plays an important role to regulate lipid metabolism, but the development of hepatic dyslipidemia associated with LBW is still unknown in goats. Herein, we evaluated lipid and metabolic status of LBW livers in contrast to those of newborns with normal birth weight. RNA sequencing was used to screen potential dysregulated functional genes involved in hepatosteatosis. Results showed lower antioxidant capacity, enhanced pro-inflammatory cytokine, and increased hepatic lipid accumulation in LBW goats associated with impaired regulatory machineries. Understanding the knowledge of intrinsic mechanism underlying hepatic dyslipidemia in LBW goats could provide important implications for promoting efficiency of production and health in their later life. Occurrence of low birth weight (LBW) is a major concern in livestock production, resulting in poor postnatal growth, lowered efficiency of feed utilization, and impaired metabolic health in adult life. In the southwest region of China, birth weight of indigenous strains of goats varies seasonally with lower weights in summer and winter, but the metabolic regulation of the LBW offspring is still unknown. In this study, by comparing LBW goats to normal birth weight group, we examined hepatic lipid content in association with regulatory mechanisms. Histological studies showed higher microvesicular morphology in the liver of LBW goats in accompany with a significantly higher level of hepatic free fatty acids, total triglycerides, and cholesterols. Lipid metabolism impairment, increased oxidative stress, and inflammation were observed by transcriptome analysis. Meanwhile, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) annotation further demonstrated lipid peroxidation, antioxidant pathway, and pro-inflammatory response involved in the hepatic lipid dysregulation from LBW group. Therefore, dysregulations of hepatic lipid metabolism, including fatty acid biosynthesis and degradation, lipid transportation, and oxidative stress, played important roles to contribute the lipid accumulation in LBW goats. Moreover, due to impaired antioxidant capacity, the oxidative damage could interact with persisting pro-inflammatory responses, leading to a higher risk of liver injury and metabolic syndromes in their adult life.

AB  - Simple Summary Competition for high-quality arable land has prompted a search for alternative forage crops. For example, Virginia fanpetals is a high-yielding perennial plant with low soil requirements. Due to its chemical composition, it can be a valuable component of ruminant diets. Previous research has shown that it cannot be used for hay production, and the natural moisture content of silage was unsatisfactory. Laboratory analyses suggest that the quality and feed value of Virginia fanpetals silage may be affected by harvesting and preservation methods. However, to date, most studies have focused on the nutritional value of Virginia fanpetals silage and its inclusion in animal diets. Therefore, the present study investigated different harvesting and preservation methods, such as direct-cut harvesting with a forage harvester, and harvesting after field wilting with a forage harvester or a round baler. The quality parameters, intake and digestibility of silage, and the performance of growing bulls, fed the experimental silage, as the sole forage was evaluated. It was discovered that the highest-quality silage was produced when herbage was harvested with a forage harvester after field wilting. Different harvesting and preservation methods of Virginia fanpetals herbage were evaluated, based on the chemical composition and digestible organic matter (OM) content (D-value) of silage fed to adult sheep, the intake and digestibility of silage, and the performance of young cattle. The following harvesting methods were compared: direct-cut harvesting with a precision-cut forage harvester (DC), harvesting after field wilting with a precision-cut forage harvester (WC) or a round baler (WRB). The silage was fed for 81 days to 24 Polish Holstein Friesian (HF) bulls, as the sole forage supplemented with 3.0 kg of concentrate/head/day. Harvesting methods affected the density (p < 0.001) and water-soluble carbohydrate (WSC) content (p = 0.047). Differences were found among the groups in the digestibility coefficients of OM (DC-73.7, WC-78.9, WRB-79.9%) (p = 0.007), and crude protein (CP) (69.8%, 77.1%, 78.5%, respectively) (p < 0.001). Dry matter intake (DMI) reached 8.38 kg (DC), 8.74 kg (WC) and 7.21 kg (WRB). Live weight gain (LWG) differed (p < 0.001) among groups (0.939, 1.033, 0.813 kg/day, respectively). The feed conversion ratio (FCR) tended to improve in WC (8.66 kg DMI/kg LWG) (p = 0.08). The highest-quality silage was produced in group WC, and it could be successfully fed to growing bulls as the sole forage.

AB  - During cryopreservation, spermatozoa produce excess reactive oxygen species (ROS), which attack the plasma membrane, disrupt the physiological structure of the sperm, and ultimately decrease semen quality. This study investigated the effects of different N-acetylcysteine (NAC) concentrations on the cryopreservation of semen from Qianbei Ma goats. Semen samples were collected from five bucks with motility rates above 80 %. The treatment groups were diluted 20-fold in extenders containing 3 or 9 mM NAC and cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen, whereas the control group did not include NAC. After thawing, the sperm motility, antioxidant gene expression, enzyme activity, and cell structure were analysed. The NAC-treated groups showed improved post-thaw sperm motility. The 9 mM NAC group presented the highest catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase activities, lowest ROS levels, and fewest apoptotic sperms. Moreover, the 3 mM NAC group presented the highest superoxide dismutase activity and L-cysteine levels and the lowest malondialdehyde levels. Additionally, sperm membrane integrity and mitochondrial membrane potential were significantly higher in the NAC-treated group than that in the control. Further analysis of antioxidant and apoptotic gene expression in the treated sperm revealed that the 9 mM NAC group presented significantly greater CAT and GPX4 expression than the control and 3 mM NAC groups, whereas the apoptotic genes BAX and Caspase3 were elevated in the control group compared to both the NAC groups. In summary, adding NAC to semen extenders enhanced antioxidant gene expression, increased enzyme activity, and improved post-thaw semen quality, with the 9 mM NAC treatment showing the optimal effects.

AB  - Background: Xenotransplantation is associated with an inflammatory response. The proinflammatory cytokine, TNF-alpha, downregulates the expression of thrombomodulin (TBM), and induces coagulation dysfunction. Although human (h) TBM-transgenic pigs (p) have been developed to reduce coagulation dysfunction, the effect of TNF-alpha on the expression of hTBM and its functional activity has not been fully investigated. The aims of this study were to investigate (i) whether the expression of hTBM on pig (p) cells is down-regulated during TNF-alpha stimulation, and (ii) whether cells from hTBM pigs regulate the inflammatory response. Methods: TNF-alpha-producing T, B, and natural killer cells in blood from baboons with pig heart or kidney xenografts were investigated by flow cytometry. TNF-alpha staining in the grafts was detected by immunohistochemistry. Aortic endothelial cells (AECs) from GTKO/CD46 and GTKO/CD46/hTBM pigs were stimulated by hTNF-alpha, and the expression of the inflammatory/coagulation regulatory protein, TBM, was investigated. Results: After pig organ xenotransplantation, there was a trend to increases in TNF-alpha-producing T and natural killer cells in the blood of baboons. In vitro observations demonstrated that after hTNF-alpha stimulation, there was a significant reduction in the expression of endogenous pTBM on pAECs, and a significant increase in the expression of inflammatory molecules. Blocking of NF-kappa B signaling significantly up-regulated pTBM expression, and suppressed the inflammatory response induced by hTNF-alpha in pAECs. Whereas the expression of pTBM mRNA was significantly reduced by hTNF-alpha stimulation, hTBM expression on the GTKO/CD46/hTBM pAECs was not affected. Furthermore, after hTNF-alpha stimulation, there was significant suppression of expression of inflammatory molecules on GTKO/CD46/hTBM pAECs compared to GTKO/CD46 pAECs. Conclusions: The stable expression of hTBM in pig cells may locally regulate the inflammatory response. This will help suppress the inflammatory response and prevent coagulation dysregulation after xenotransplantation.

AB  - Plants can perceive and respond to external stimuli by activating both direct and indirect defences against herbivores. Soil-dwelling entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs), natural enemies of root-feeding herbivores, carry symbiotic bacteria that grow and reproduce once inside arthropod hosts. We hypothesized that the metabolites produced by EPN-infected insect cadavers could be perceived by plants, thereby activating plant defences systemically. We tested this hypothesis by adding three EPN-infected Galleria mellonella cadavers to maize plants and testing plant responses against a major maize pest (Spodoptera frugiperda) and one of its parasitoids (Trichogramma dendrolimi). We found that S. frugiperda females deposited fewer, and caterpillars fed less on maize plants growing near EPN-infected cadavers than on control plants. Accordingly, EPN-infected cadavers triggered the systemic accumulation of defence hormones (SA), genes (PR1), and enzymes (SOD, POD, and CAT) in maize leaves. Furthermore, four volatile organic compounds produced by plants exposed to EPN-infected cadavers deterred S. frugiperda caterpillars and female adults. However, these compounds were more attractive to T. dendrolimi parasitoids. Our study enhances the understanding of the intricate relationships within the above- and belowground ecosystems and provides crucial insights for advancing sustainable pest management strategies.
   This study aimed to explore the interplays between maize plants and entomopathogenic nematodes-killed Galleria mellonella cadavers. We found plants near EPN-killed cadavers elicited defences, deterring herbivore Spodoptera frugiperda and attracting natural enemies Trichogramma dendrolimi parasitoids.

AB  - Egg and larval fish investigation can be deduced the distribution and reproductive characteristics of adult fish. Ganjiang River is the longest river flowing into the Poyang Lake, and one of the important tributaries of the Yangtze River. Due to the construction of cascade water conservancy projects on the mainstream of the river, the fish resources have been affected. In order to correctly design protection measures of fish resources, egg and larval fish species composition and abundance at Fengcheng section in lower reaches of the river were investigated between May and June 2019. The results indicated that: (a) of the 29 species of egg and larval fish collected, and the individuals of Hemiculter bleekeri, Rhinogobius giurinus, Parabramis pekinensis, Squalidus argentatus and Xenocypris argentea were most abundant; (b) egg abundance was higher through May while larval abundance was higher during June; (c) the egg abundance of the four carps further declined and two new spawning grounds were found. Therefore, we suggested that the ecological regulation of the Ganjiang River should be managed to create flood peaks and make the daily increment of water level greater than 0.55 m when water temperature was between 18-24 degrees C during May to July.

AB  - Ovarian reserve is a reflection of the overall female reproductive potential. Vitamin D status has been suspected to influence fetal development and female fertility. As maternal diet during pregnancy can affect fetal development and future fertility, we hypothesised that periconceptional and gestational Vitamin D restriction could affect folliculogenesis and AMH secretion in the offspring. Nineteen sexually mature Welsh mountain ewes were randomly assigned to Vitamin D3 deficient (VDD, n = 10) and Vitamin D3 control (VDC, n = 9) diets from 17 days (d) before mating, up to 127-130 days of gestation, when fetal ovaries were collected (3 from VDC and 6 from VDD). Serum 25(OH)D3 concentrations were lower in VDD compared with VDC (p < 0.05). Relative to total follicle number, the percentage of primordial follicles was higher (p < 0.05), while the percentage of primary follicles was lower (p < 0.05) in VDD group compared with VDC group fetal ovaries. The integrated density value and percentage of affected area in TUNEL staining in VDD group did not vary from VDC group fetal ovaries (p > 0.05). Relative expression of AMH mRNA and AMH protein in VDD fetal ovaries were not statistically different compared with controls (p > 0.05). The relative expression of VDR mRNA were lower in VDD compared with VDC group fetal ovaries (p < 0.05). These data indicate that maternal Vitamin D dietary restriction is associated with ovarian tissue stemness and increased primordial follicle number but does not promote normal follicle recruitment or development in sheep fetal ovaries.

AB  - Background Ovine anaplasmosis (sensu stricto) is a rickettsial blood disease caused by the tick-borne species Anaplasma ovis. The disease is characterized by mild anemia, fever, and icterus. A more severe clinical presentation is possible in non-endemic areas. There is no existing data on the presence of Anaplasma ovis in Bosnia and Herzegovina. However, given the country's location within the Mediterranean Basin and the recent molecular detection of Babesia ovis, it is plausible that sheep in the region could naturally be infected with this tick-borne pathogen. Methods and results Blood samples from 81 sheep in the Podrinje and Herzegovina areas were examined by PCR. PCR positivity was found in 38 (46.9%) cases indicating a high number of infected sheep. Mixed infections with Babesia ovis and A.ovis were observed in 63.3% of cases. A higher number of positive sheep was recorded in the area of Herzegovina. Phylogenetic analysis of the gltA, groEL, and msp4 genes of A. ovis revealed numerous genotypes and significant genetic variability. This diversity was not related to geographic origin, tick-borne infection status, or sheep breeding practices in Podrinje and Herzegovina. Conclusions The data obtained in this study suggest that the emergence of new genotypes and the high genetic variability of A. ovis are driven by specific local and micro-environmental factors.

AB  - This study assessed the effects of egg selenium (Se) concentrations derived via maternal transfer on early life stage survival, growth, and development of mountain whitefish (Prosopium williamsoni), a species not previously assessed for Se sensitivity. Over four reproductive seasons, fish gametes were collected from multiple locations in the Elk Valley watershed in British Columbia, Canada which has elevated Se concentrations associated with mining activities. Eggs were collected from 65 females with egg Se concentrations ranging from 15.5-54.0 mg kg(-1) (dry wt). Fertilized eggs were reared in the laboratory from hatch through post-swim-up. Larvae were assessed for survival, length, weight, developmental deformities, and edema. Integrating data from all 4 years, a 10% effect concentration (EC10) of > 54 mg kg(-1) (dry wt) egg Se was determined for the embryo-larval deformity endpoint, which is characteristic of maternally transferred Se effects. However, a statistically significant relationship between larval growth (length and weight) and egg Se was observed, with a shallow linear response relationship over the entire egg Se concentration range evaluated. An EC10 of 34 mg kg(-1) (dry wt) was estimated but is uncertain because the lower limit of the apparent effect is undefined (nonconservative error), there is evidence a size-dependent maternal provisioning effect could be contributing or driving the relationship (conservative error), and this endpoint has not been diagnostic of Se-induced effects in other fish species tested. Overall, the weight of evidence provides more support for size-dependent effects on maternal provisioning of eggs as the cause of these observations, but an effect of Se cannot be ruled out. Regardless of which endpoint is used, this study demonstrates that mountain whitefish are less sensitive than generic Se guidelines.

AB  - Excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation result in decreased motility, fertility, farrowing rate and litter size during boar sperm cryopreservation. Our previous study reported that cryopreservation leads to differential expression of genes (SIRT5 and IDH2) which regulate the energy metabolism and quality of sperm. But how SIRT5 regulates the metabolism and oxidative stress in boar sperm are still unknown. In the present study, we first determined the regulation of IDH2 and SOD2 by SIRT5 after its knockdown and then determined the role of SIRT5 in regulation of oxidative stress, metabolic activities, motility and fertility potential by its specific inhibitor (Suramin, SUR) and activator (Resveratrol, RSV). Then the effect of cryopreservation was evaluated on mRNA and protein expressions of SIRT5, IDH2 and SOD2 in boar sperm. A decrease in expressions was observed at both mRNA and protein for all these genes. Additionally, RSV and SUR treatment led to up and downregulation of mRNA and protein of both IDH2 and SOD2. A significant decrease (P < 0.05) in ROS levels and improvement in sperm motility, acrosomal integrity, MMP, PMI and ATP were observed in post-thaw sperm after activation of SIRT5 with RSV. Additionally, BAX and 4HNE levels were significantly (P < 0.05) reduced in RSV treated sperm. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that SIRT5 activator (RSV) improved the quality of boar sperm by upregulation of IDH2 and SOD2. At the same time, the oxidative stress was reduced via interaction among SIRT5, IDH2 and SOD2.

AB  - A two-month growth experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of the total fish meal replacement by plant meal on growth performance, nutrient utilization and intestinal microbiota in an improved bream (BBTB) obtained by multistep breeding technologies. Three diets were formulated to replace 0 (FM), 65% (MM) and 100% (PM) of dietary fish meal protein by plant meal (soybean meal and rapeseed meal), respectively. The results showed that the fish meal and plant meal diets could significantly increase the weight gain rate (WGR), specific growth rate (SGR) and feed efficiency ratio (FER) of BBTB compared to their mixed diet. Besides, BBTB fed with PM could significantly decrease the liver lipid contents, but the fish fed with FM showed the more complete microscopic structure in the intestine. Nevertheless, there was no significant difference between FM and PM groups in trypsin activity. In additional, the fish fed with PM showed the higher expression levels in ACC alpha, PPAR alpha, PPAR gamma, CPT1a, PepT1 and APN genes, which might affect its nutrient utilization. The results in intestinal microbiota showed that BBTB possessed the herbivorous fish characteristics of intestinal microbiota. These results indicated that BBTB possessed herbivorous characteristics. It is of great significance for the sustainable development of aquaculture.

AB  - Nitrogen is an essential element for life on Earth. It is necessary for the production of food and feed, but excess nitrogen in nature leads to environmental problems such as eutrophication and climate change. To mitigate the negative impact of excess nitrogen, it is crucial to adopt sustainable and circular nitrogen management practices, such as nitrogen recycling from biowaste. Black soldier fly (BSF) biowaste treatment offers new possibilities for sustainable waste management and protein production, converting biowaste into protein-rich biomass and nutrient-rich residue. Understanding the nitrogen conversion efficiency (NCE) of BSF during biowaste treatment is essential for optimizing the process and minimizing nitrogen losses. Additionally, this review examines nitrogen emissions during BSF biowaste treatment, particularly NH3 and N2O, emphasizing the importance of adopting mitigation strategies for sustainable waste management practices. The potential of insects, especially BSF, in N recycling and waste management holds promise for addressing the challenges of sustainable agriculture and environmental conservation.

AB  - Besides classical semen parameters, semen stress tests (SSTs) are helpful tools to assess the fertilizing capacity of sperm. However, valid studies on SSTs in relation to fertility are rare because several cor-rections of common fertility parameters for female and male effects are required. Therefore, over a one -year period, we analyzed semen parameters of 260 ejaculates obtained from 130 Pietrain boars aged between 8 and 9 months in one AI center as well as 1521 corresponding insemination records for these ejaculates. Two consecutive ejaculates (4th and 5th) were collected from each boar and extended in DiluPorcTM BTS. In addition to routine semen evaluation, sperm motility was assessed after heat-resistance test (300 min incubation at 38 degrees C after seven days storage at 16 degrees C, HRT) and cold-resistance test (10 min incubation at 38 degrees C after three days storage at 6 degrees C, CRT). Generalized linear models (GLMs) were applied to analyze effects for the following predictors of farrowing rate (FR), number of total born (NTB) and live born (NLB) piglets: farm (P = 0.013 [FR], P = 0.001 [NTB], P = 0.023 [NLB]), parity (P = 0.679, P = 0.01, P < 0.001), weekday (P = 0.012, P = 0.08, P = 0.009) and year x season (P < 0.001, P = 0.688, P = 0.574). On boar level, GLMs revealed significant effects on FR, NTB and NLB for the predictors sow (all P < 0.001), total sperm number per dose (P = 0.007, P = 0.002, P < 0.001), total sperm motility (P = 0.002, P = 0.2, P = 0.003) and mitochondrial activity (P = 0.004, P < 0.001, P = 0.002). Moreover, FR and NTB were influenced by membrane integrity (both P < 0.001), FR and NLB by cold-resistance (P < 0.001, P = 0.043), and NTB and NLB by sperm morphology (P = 0.001, P < 0.001) and boar (both P < 0.001). NLB was additionally influenced by heat-resistance (P = 0.004) and farm (P = 0.018) and solely NTB was influenced by sperm output (P = 0.03). Boar and semen related factors explained 9% of the total variation in NTB and 7% of the total variation in NLB. Only 14.2% (n = 37) of the samples were both cold-and heat-resistant (>65% of motile sperm). Cold-and heat-resistance were dependent factors (Chi-square, P = 0.001) and sperm motility after CRT and HRT showed a moderate positive correlation (rs = 0.40, P < 0.001, Spearman's rho). Finally, ROC curves demonstrated that neither SST can be used as a sole test for predicting the fertilizing capacity of boar ejaculates. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Pancreatic lipase serves as a primary trigger for hyperlipidemia and is also a crucial target in the inhibition of hypercholesterolemia. By synthesizing anti-hypercholesterolemic drugs such as atorvastatin, which are used to treat hypercholesterolemia, there were some side effects associated with the long-term use of statins. Based on this idea, in the present study, we identified peptides that inhibited PL by virtual screening and in vitro activity assays. In addition, to delve into the underlying mechanisms, we undertook a dual investigative approach involving both molecular docking analyses and molecular dynamics simulations. The results showed that peptides RK7, KQ7, and TL9, all with molecular weights of <1000 Da and a high proportion of hydrophobic amino acids, inhibited PL well. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics showed that peptides RK7, KQ7, and TL9 bound to important amino acid residues of PL, such as Pro and Leu, through hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions, salt bridges, and pi-pi stacking to occupy the substrate-binding site, which inhibited PL and identified them as potential PL inhibitors. In vitro tests showed that the IC50 of RK7 and KQ7 on PL were 0.690 mg/mL and 0.593 mg/mL, respectively, and the inhibitory effects of RK7 and KQ7 on PL were significantly enhanced after simulated gastrointestinal digestion. Our results suggested that peptides RK7 and KQ7 from yak milk cheese can be identified as a novel class of potential PL inhibitors.

AB  - Bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs)-engineered cartilage (BEC) shows promise for clinically repairing cartilage defects. However, when implanted in immunocompetent large animals, BEC becomes susceptible to ossification due to inflammatory infiltration. To address this, a nanofilm isolation approach is developed to enhance BEC's chondrogenic stability. Tacrolimus (FK506), known for its immunosuppressive effect, is integrated into adipic dihydrazide (ADH)-modified hyaluronic acid (HA), creating an acid-responsive macromolecular prodrug called FK506@HA-ADH. This prodrug is then blended with poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) to form electrospun FK506@HA/PLGA nanofilm. Goat-derived BMSCs are induced in vitro to form BEC, which is enclosed within the FK506@HA/PLGA nanofilm and subcutaneously implanted in autologous goats. The nanofilm acted as a physical barrier, preventing immunocyte infiltration. Additionally, in response to the acidic environment triggered by inflammation and the gradual degradation of PLGA, the FK506@HA-ADH prodrug is cleaved, releasing FK506 as needed. The released FK506 effectively countered inflammatory cytokines and promoted cartilaginous maturity. These combined mechanisms significantly inhibited BEC hypertrophy and improved its chondrogenic stability within an immunocompetent goat model. This nanofilm-based isolation strategy established an immunosuppressive niche, successfully preventing endochondral ossification and promoting stable cartilage formation in BEC. These advancements are crucial for translating stem cell-based therapies into clinical use for cartilage repair.

AB  - Substantial quantities of solid livestock waste are potential sources of nutrients for agroecological production on small-scale farms. However, processes used to manage and dispose of this type of waste must be able to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms. This work aimed to evaluate composting and vermicomposting processes by inoculating efficient microorganisms (EMs) at the field level. Composting and vermicomposting were performed with a mixture of cattle and goat manure and sawdust (2:1:1), with the inoculation of EMs at concentrations of 0, 2, and 4 mL L-1. In vermicomposting experiments, Lumbricus rubellus (100 g 250 dm-3 substrate) were inoculated. After the maturation and stabilization phases of the compost, concentrations of organic carbon, macronutrients, micronutrients, heavy metals, thermotolerant coliforms, and Salmonella spp. were analyzed. The composting experiments, regardless of the presence of EMs, have been shown to have higher humidity. Also, the final compost had a lower pH value. Macronutrients, such as P, K, Ca, and S, were observed to a greater extent in the composting experiments associated with 4 mL of EMs (EM4); while organic carbon and Mg were higher in vermicomposting. The vermicomposting process also allowed for more effective elimination of pathogens, such as thermotolerant coliforms, especially when associated with 2 mL of EMs (EM2). The compost products produced allowed waste with potential agroecological use to be recognized as important.

AB  - Dietary protein and digestible carbohydrates are two key macronutrients for insect herbivores, but the amounts and ratios of these two macronutrients in plant vegetative tissues can be highly variable. Typically, insect herbivores regulate their protein-carbohydrate intake by feeding selectively on nutritionally complementary plant tissues, but this may not always be possible. Interestingly, lab experiments consistently demonstrate that performance - especially growth and survival - does not vary greatly when caterpillars and nymphal grasshoppers are reared on diets that differ in their protein-carbohydrate content. This suggests insect herbivores employ postingestive physiological mechanisms to compensate for variation in diet protein-carbohydrate profile. However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie this compensation are not well understood. Here we explore, for the first time in an insect herbivore, the transcriptional effects of two dietary factors: protein-to-carbohydrate ratio (p:c) and total macronutrient (p + c) content. Specifically, we reared Helicoverpa zea caterpillars on three diets that varied in diet p:c ratio and one diet that varied in total p + c concentration, all within an ecologically-relevant range. We observed two key findings. Caterpillars reared on diets with elevated total p + c content showed large differences in gene expression. In contrast, only small differences in gene expression were observed when caterpillars were reared on diets with different p:c ratios (spanning from protein-biased to carbohydrate-biased). The invariable expression of many metabolic genes across these variable diets suggests that H. zea caterpillars employ a strategy of constitutive expression to deal with protein-carbohydrate imbalances rather than dietspecific changes. This is further supported by two findings. First, few genes were uniquely associated with feeding on a protein- and carbohydrate-biased diet. Second, many differentially-expressed genes were shared across protein-biased, carbohydrate-biased, and concentrated diet treatments. Our study provides insights into the post-ingestive physiological mechanisms insect herbivores employ to regulate protein-carbohydrate intake. Most notably, it suggests that H. zea, and perhaps other generalist species, use similar post-ingestive mechanisms to deal with protein-carbohydrate imbalances - regardless of the direction of the imbalance.

AB  - Meat consumption by early hominins is a hotly debated issue. A key question concerns their access to large mammal carcasses, including megafauna. Currently, the evidence of anthropic cut marks on proboscidean bones older than -or close to- 1.0 Ma are restricted to the archaeological sites of Dmanisi (Georgia), Olduvai (Tanzania), Gona (Ethiopia), Olorgesailie (Kenya) and La Boella (Spain). During an inspection of the almost complete carcass of Mammuthus meridionalis (FN3-5-MPS) from the Oldowan site of Fuente Nueva 3 (Orce, Spain, c. 1.2 Ma), a few traces compatible with human-made cut marks and carnivore tooth marks were found. From this finding and previous interpretations the following questions arise: When and under what conditions was FN3-5-MPS deposited? What is the nature of the marks found on the surface of the bones of this mammoth? To answer, we have conducted a high-resolution analysis of these remains, combining both taphonomic and microstratigraphic data. Our results, using microstratigraphic and micromorphological analyses of sediments based on thinsections, show that this individual was deposited in a marshy environment. Subsequently, the carcass was exploited by hominins and large felids that left their marks on the surface of some of its bones. For this purpose, the identification and characterisation of both cut marks and tooth marks were performed using high-resolution 3D modelling, geometric morphometrics, and artificially intelligent algorithms. Based on the anatomical position of both the cut and tooth marks, we propose that both the hominins and the saber-toothed cats had early access to the animal. Finally, this paper shows how an interdisciplinary approach can shed detailed light on the particular story regarding the death and processing of the carcass of a female mammoth, deposited at Fuente Nueva 3.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of roscovitine pretreatment on the number of matured oocytes per ovary available for somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) and their developmental competence. Irrespective of reproduction status (prepuberty/puberty), the average number of small follicles per ovary (19.3/17.2) was higher than that of medium follicles (1.5/ 2.7). In the small follicle group, the in vitro maturation rate of COCs pretreated with 50 mu M roscovitine (56.1%) was significantly (P < 0.05) higher than that of the control, 25 or 75 mu M treatment (15.5%, 23.7% and 35.2%, respectively), while, in the medium follicle group, there was no significant difference between the control, 25, 50 and 75 mu M treatment (76.4%, 78.3%, 80.9% and 60.6%, respectively). As a result, a total number of matured oocytes per ovary was greater for 50 mu M treatment (11.8) than for the control, 25 or 75 mu M treatment (4.4, 5.0 and 6.3, respectively). In the small follicle group, COCs pretreated with 50 mu M roscovitine showed dramatically increased blastocyst rate (16.0%) compared to the control (2.9%) (P < 0.05), whereas, in the medium follicle group, there was no significant difference between groups independent of roscovitine treatment (20.8 vs 23.0%). The cloning efficiency in the roscovitine-treated group was not significantly different from that in the control (2.6 vs 1.4%). In conclusion, the present study indicates that roscovitine treatment increased the number of matured oocytes per ovary available for SCNT and did not have any adverse effect on cloning efficiency in pigs.

AB  - In the present study, the quality of aerated (A), non-aerated (NA) and bioslurry (B) as potential bio-fertilizers were evaluated. Aerated and non-aerated compost teas were brewed from two different compost: exhausted grape marc (G); and a mixture of residues (M): goat manure, grape marc, garden raking leaves and alfalfa cutting hay. Bioslurry was prepared from fresh organic material in anaerobic digestion, according to FAO. Aeration, with shorter extraction time, resulted in higher pH (8.25 and 7.44 regarding 7.32 and 6.98, respectively, for AM, NAM, AG and NAG), but in general with lower nutrient concentration than non-aerated. B presented higher nitrogen content (7.86 mg L-1 N-NO3- and 40.77 mg L-1 N-NH4+). No pathogens or phytotoxic effects were detected. To our knowledge, this is the first time that B has been evaluated, and our results suggest that the use of fresh organic matter may generate a high-quality product to be used as a biostimulant. Agricultural bio-inputs, elaborated from organic residues, represent a cheaper and safer alternative to traditional fertilizers, while residues are reduced and reused.

AB  - Herbivore population dynamics are strongly influenced by the interactions established through their shared host. Such plant-mediated interactions can occur between different herbivore species and different life developmental stages of the same herbivore. However, whether these interactions occur between leaf-feeding herbivores and their soil-dwelling pupae is unknown. We studied whether tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) leaf herbivory by the American serpentine leafminer Liriomyza trifolii affects the performance of conspecific pupae exposed to the soil headspace of the plant. To gain mechanistic insights, we performed insect bioassays with the jasmonate-deficient tomato mutant def-1 and its wild-type, along with phytohormones, gene expression and root volatiles analyses. Belowground volatiles accelerated leafminer metamorphosis when wild-type plants were attacked aboveground by conspecifics. The opposite pattern was observed for def-1 plants, in which aboveground herbivory slowed metamorphosis. Leafminer attack induced jasmonate and abscisic acid accumulation and modulated volatile production in tomato roots in a def-1-dependent manner. Our results demonstrate that aboveground herbivory triggers changes in root defence signalling and expression, which can directly or indirectly via changes in soil or microbial volatiles, alter pupal development time. This finding expands the repertoire of plant-herbivore interactions to herbivory-induced modulation of metamorphosis, with potential consequences for plant and herbivore community dynamics.

AB  - While termites play important ecological roles, a fraction of species have strong invasive capabilities and represent urban pests of economic importance worldwide. Their invasive potential is exacerbated by human activities such as maritime transport, with privately owned boats serving as key vectors for local and global termite dispersal, particularly for Cryptotermes and Coptotermes pest species. Land establishment by invasive termites can remain undetected for decades, often making eradication attempts too late to succeed. Ultimately, invasive termite species will likely continue to spread at the global scale, and recent new invasive records point toward an underestimation of their actual current invasive status.

AB  - BackgroundNeonatal Fc receptors (FcRn) mediate the transcytosis of IgG present in colostrum across absorptive gut epithelium of newborn calves. FcRn receptor is a heterodimer composed of two polypeptides encoded by FCGRT (Fc fragment of IgG Receptor Transporter neonatal) and B2M (Beta 2 microglobulin) genes. Polymorphism in FCGRT gene may have a bearing on absorption of colostral immunoglobulins by neonatal buffalo calves, thereby affecting their immune status and susceptibility to diseases. The primary aim of our study was to mine alleles and single nucleotide polymorphs in the FCGRT gene and determine their association with the levels of IgG in serum of neonatal buffalo calves.Methods and resultsOn the basis of serum IgG levels estimated by indirect ELISA in 80 newborn calves, 20 calves each with highest and lowest IgG concentration were selected to study polymorphism in the FCGRT gene. The exonic regions of this gene were amplified in nine fragments which were subjected to PCR-SSCP to detect variations followed by the sequencing of variants to locate the SNPs. A total of nine SNPs (7 in introns and 2 in exons) were detected in four polymorphic fragments. Association study based on Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% Confidence Interval (CIs) established that the SNP G40T in fragment 3 has a significant (P < 0.05) bearing on IgG level in serum of neonatal buffalo calves.ConclusionGenetic variation in FCGRT gene in buffalo calves was found to be associated with their serum IgG levels in neonatal stage which may have implications in calf survival and growth vis-a-vis inadequate transfer of passive immunity.

AB  - Simple Summary Welfare requirements from an animal point of view are the same regardless of the country. However, differing requirements of animal welfare schemes make it hard for consumers to make informed choices. Therefore, an open and coherent labeling scheme that provides information on farm animal welfare will be beneficial from the consumer perspective. We reviewed 12 pig welfare schemes. We aimed to identify consistencies and differences in welfare requirements between these schemes. The studied welfare requirements were heterogeneous in the potential each scheme had to advance pig welfare. Certain requirements barely exceeded the minimum standards for the protection of pigs in European Union (EU) legislation, but the more demanding tiers of multitier schemes had the potential to enhance animal welfare. The most ambitious tiers could improve animal welfare substantially and, in terms of resources available to the animal, they often were convergent with organic animal farming standards. Because of variation of welfare requirements between the labels, it was challenging to compare existing labeling schemes. Adopting a harmonized labeling terminology and standard, increased use of animal-based measures, and open communication will make labeling more reliable and transparent, which will contribute to the availability of standardized animal-friendly products and will be equitable from an animal welfare perspective. Animal welfare labeling schemes have been developed to respond to consumers' expectations regarding farm animal welfare. They are designed to certify that labeled products comply with certain animal welfare standards. In this study, 12 pig welfare labeling schemes were reviewed, and their criteria related to pig welfare were compared. Information regarding farrowing criteria, space allowance, outdoor access, mutilations, and provision of enrichments and bedding material were gathered from the labels' internet pages and documentation. The results indicated a substantial variation between the labels in terms of the level of animal welfare they ensure. While certain schemes barely exceeded the minimum standards for the protection of pigs in the European Union, more demanding tiers of the multitier schemes had the potential to improve animal welfare substantially. The most ambitious tiers of multistage schemes were often comparable to organic standards providing outdoor facilities and additional space. The heterogeneity of the labels' standards complicates the comparison of labels.

AB  - Phytostabilization of metal-contaminated soils can be enabled or improved by biochar application. However, biochar-aided effects vary on biochar types, and little attention has been paid to plant management (time and cutting) to enhance phytostabilization efficiency in synergy with biochar. Therefore, biochars derived from pig manure (PM), Japanese knotweed (JK), and a mixture of both (P1J1) were applied to Pb and As mining soil with ryegrass cultivation to assess the biochar-induced effects on plant growth, dissolved organic matter (DOM), As and Pb mobility, and bioaccumulation within a phytostabilization strategy. Additional treatments involving the combined biochar (P1J1) and ryegrass were conducted to explore the influence of sequential cutting and growing time on facilitating phytostabilization efficacy. Biochar applications promoted plant growth, progressively increasing over time, but were not enhanced by cutting. Short and long-wavelength humic-like DOM substances identified in the soil pore water after biochar application varied depending on the biochar types used, providing evidence for the correlation among DOM changes, biochar origin, and metal immobilization. Biochar-treated soils exhibited reduced Pb availability and enhanced As mobility, with P1J1 stabilizing Pb significantly similar to PM while causing less As mobilization as JK did. The mobilized As did not result in increased plant As uptake; instead, all biochar-added plants showed a significant decrease in As and Pb concentrations compared to those without biochar. Soil available As decreased while available Pb increased with time, and cutting did not influence soil As behavior but did reduce soil Pb release. Nevertheless, plant As and Pb concentrations decreased over time, whereas those in multiple -cut plants were generally higher than those without cuts. Biochar, especially P1J1, along with growth time, holds promise in promoting plant biomass, reducing plant Pb and As concentrations, and minimizing the migration of Pb-As within the soil.

AB  - Metallic fuel has an important historical significance in the development of nuclear reactors and contin-ues to be relevant to the progression of advanced test and power reactors. A number of models, ranging from empirical to mechanistic, have been developed and implemented in various fuel performance codes to describe U-Zr and U-Pu-Zr fuel and typical fast reactor cladding materials. One challenge of using these models to simulate fuel performance is the inevitable tangling of coupled phenomena that can cloud proper implementation, calibration, and eventual utilization of new models. In an effort to pro-vide a baseline capability that will facilitate the use of advanced models, new capabilities have been implemented into the fuel performance code BISON specific to metallic fuel simulations, ranging from materials properties, fission gas release and swelling calculations, coolant channel models, and cladding correlations. These models have been applied to the X4 41/X4 41A EBR-II experimental assembly data, a set of irradiated metallic UPuZr fuel rods of varying pin designs. The models implemented in BISON are able to capture the general trend of the expected response of the fuel and cladding to irradiation in EBR-II, especially when considering the spread in experimental measurements and the uncertainties inherited from the historical material models. Ultimately, the models outlined here provide the baseline capabili-ties on which new models can build upon in order to improve the prediction of metallic fuel performance simulations in off-normal designs or operations.Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study investigated the effectiveness of bio-augmenting aerobic cell culture to mitigate ammonia and hydrogen sulfide emission in sewage sludge composting amended with reed straw (with the weight ratio of 1:0.3-0.4). During the 20-day aerated lab-scale composting, adding 200-mL culture (56.80 NTU) reduced ammonia and hydrogen sulfide emissions by 38.00% and 54.32%, and conserved total nitrogen and sulfate by 39.42% and 70.75%, respectively. Organic matters degradation was quick started 1 day ahead. Comparing to the control, nitrate content increased 38.75% at the end of the compost. Bioaugmentation evened the distributions of bacterial communities in the thermophilic phase. The shift was mainly due to 22.97% of relative abundance of Proteobacteria depressed and 157.16% of Bacteroidetes increased, which were beneficial for nitrogen conservation and glycan breakdown, respectively. In summary, the results demonstrated that bioaugmentation addition could be an effective strategy for enhanced sludge composting.

AB  - Simple Summary Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas also released by ruminants due to their physiological digestive process. A strong knowledge of the emission level of each species and on the variability, factors is needed to target the best mitigation strategy for the livestock sector. To assess these emissions, non-invasive and feasible technologies, such as Laser Methane Detectors (LMD), are now available. The present study represents the first assessment of methane emissions in Italian Mediterranean buffaloes with LMD and investigates the effect of the season on these emissions. The results obtained showed that the season significantly influenced emissions, since lower values were found in summer when compared to the winter period; therefore, this should be considered when setting up a measurement protocol with LMD. A direct assessment of the methane (CH4) emission level and its variability factors is needed in each animal species in order to target the best mitigation strategy for the livestock sector. Therefore, the present study aimed to (1) test a laser methane detector (LMD) for the first time in Italian Mediterranean buffaloes (IMB), a non-invasive tool to quantify CH4 emissions; (2) test the effect of season on the emissions; and (3) compare the results measured directly with the ones estimated with the existing equations. CH4 emissions of twenty non-productive IMB, under the same feeding regimen, were monitored for 12 days in summer and winter. Significantly higher THI (74.46 +/- 1.88 vs. 49.62 +/- 4.87; p < 0.001), lower DMI (2.24 +/- 0.04 vs. 2.51 +/- 0.03% DMI/kg live weight; p < 0.001) and lower emission intensities (0.61 +/- 0.15 vs. 0.75 +/- 0.13; p < 0.001) were found during the summer period when compared with winter. LMD was found to be a versatile tool to be used in buffaloes, and it was clear that a summer increase in THI could act as a stressor for the animals, influencing their emissions. In addition, measured emissions were significantly higher than when estimated with the existing equations (p < 0.001), suggesting the need for further research in this area.

AB  - The family Elateridae, known as click beetles, is a mega-diverse lineage of Coleoptera. Wireworms are the larval stage of click beetles, which are generalist herbivores and which are recognized as economically important pests of crops. To more effectively control and monitor wireworms, it is crucial to understand the genetics, taxonomy and phylogenetics of Elateridae. Here, we sequenced and characterized three complete mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) from the subfamily Elaterinae using a next-generation sequencing approach. In addition, we provided the annotated mitogenomes of the newly sequenced species, namely Parasilesis musculus (Cand & egrave;ze, 1873), Melanotus cribricollis Cand & egrave;ze, 1860 and Glyphonyx sp., and compared their arrangement with other closely related species. The secondary structures of tRNA genes and rRNA genes were predicted. Combined with the published mitogenomes of elaterid species, we reconstructed the phylogenetic framework for Elateridae under maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference methods using nucleotide and amino acid sequence datasets separately. The results from the Bayesian analysis based on the nucleotide dataset PCGRNA including all 37 mitochondrial genes were congruent with previous studies. Within the monophyletic Elateridae, two main clades were recovered. The first clade included Elaterinae and Melanotus. The second clade consisted of the remaining subfamilies. Physodactylinae and Cardiophorinae formed a sister group. Agrypninae was monophyletic. A subclade comprised Negastriinae and Dendrometrinae.

AB  - Background: There is a need for functional genome-wide annotation of the protein-coding genes to get a deeper understanding of mammalian biology. Here, a new annotation strategy is introduced based on dimensionality reduction and density-based clustering of whole-body co-expression patterns. This strategy has been used to explore the gene expression landscape in pig, and we present a whole-body map of all protein-coding genes in all major pig tissues and organs.
   Results: An open-access pig expression map (www.rnaatlas.org ) is presented based on the expression of 350 samples across 98 well-defined pig tissues divided into 44 tissue groups. A new UMAP-based classification scheme is introduced, in which all protein-coding genes are stratified into tissue expression clusters based on body-wide expression profiles. The distribution and tissue specificity of all 22,342 protein-coding pig genes are presented.
   Conclusions: Here, we present a new genome-wide annotation strategy based on dimensionality reduction and density-based clustering. A genome-wide resource of the transcriptome map across all major tissues and organs in pig is presented, and the data is available as an open-access resource (www.rnaatlas.org), including a comparison to the expression of human orthologs.

AB  - Simple Summary Goats are important domestic animals that provide meat, milk, fur, and other products for humans. The demand for these products has increased in recent years. Disease resistance among goat breeds is different, but the genetic basis of the differences in resistance to diseases is still unclear and needs to be further studied. In this study, many genes and pathways related to immunity and diseases were identified to be under positive selection between Yunling and Nubian goats using RAD-seq technology. This study on the selection signatures of Yunling goats provides the scientific basis and technical support for the breeding of domestic goats for disease resistance, which has important social and economic significance. Animal diseases impose a huge burden on the countries where diseases are endemic. Conventional control strategies of vaccines and veterinary drugs are to control diseases from a pharmaceutical perspective. Another alternative approach is using pre-existing genetic disease resistance or tolerance. We know that the Yunling goat is an excellent local breed from Yunnan, southwestern China, which has characteristics of strong disease resistance and remarkable adaptability. However, genetic information about the selection signatures of Yunling goats is limited. We reasoned that the genes underlying the observed difference in disease resistance might be identified by investigating selection signatures between two different goat breeds. Herein, we selected the Nubian goat as the reference group to perform the population structure and selection signature analysis by using RAD-seq technology. The results showed that two goat breeds were divided into two clusters, but there also existed gene flow. We used Fst (F-statistics) and pi (pi/theta pi) methods to carry out selection signature analysis. Eight selected regions and 91 candidate genes were identified, in which some genes such as DOK2, TIMM17A, MAVS, and DOCK8 related to disease and immunity and some genes such as SPEFI, CDC25B, and MIR103 were associated with reproduction. Four GO (Gene Ontology) terms (GO:0010591, GO:001601, GO:0038023, and GO:0017166) were associated with cell migration, signal transduction, and immune responses. The KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) signaling pathways were mainly associated with immune responses, inflammatory responses, and stress reactions. This study preliminarily revealed the genetic basis of strong disease resistance and adaptability of Yunling goats. It provides a theoretical basis for the subsequent genetic breeding of disease resistance of goats.

AB  - Plant-mediated interactions between herbivores play an important role in regulating the composition of herbivore community. The fall armyworm (FAW), Spodoptera frugiperda, which has become one of the most serious pests on corn in China since it invaded in 2018, has been found feeding rice in the field. However, how FAW interacts with native rice insect pests remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated the interaction between FAW and a resident herbivore, striped stem borer (SSB, Chilo suppressalis) on rice. The infestation of rice leaf sheaths (LSs) by SSB larvae systemically enhanced the level of jasmonic acid (JA), abscisic acid (ABA), and trypsin proteinase inhibitors (TPIs), reduced relative water content (RWC) in leaf blades (LBs), and suppressed the growth of FAW larvae. In contrast, because FAW larvae infested LBs and did not affect defence responses in LSs, they did not influence the performance of SSB larvae. Using different mutants, together with bioassays and chemical analysis, we revealed that SSB-induced suppression of FAW larvae growth depended on both the SSB-activated JA pathway and RWC in LBs, whereas the ABA pathway activated by SSB larvae promoted the growth of FAW larvae by impeding water loss. These results provide new insights into mechanisms underlying plant-mediated interactions between herbivores.

AB  - The endangered Pyrenean Capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus aquitanicus) inhabits perennial forests of the Pyrenees (Spain, France and Andorre). Feces of domestic animals (e.g., horses and cattle) are often found in this species' habitat as evidence of land use overlapping, especially during spring and summer. As a result, pharmaceutical residues found in feces of these domestic ungulates may be absorbed by plants and insects that are part of the diet of Pyrenean Capercaillies (e.g., blueberries [Vaccinium uliginosum, Vaccinium myrtillus], red wood ants [Formica rufa]). Based on the absence of data regarding the exposure of Pyrenean Capercaillie to residues of veterinary medicinal products (VMP), we selected 71 compounds as indicators of anthropogenically-related environmental contamination, analyzed in 90 samples collected in several subalpine forests, northwestern Spain. Residues of several VMP were detected in feces (capercaillie [ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin, tetracycline and florfenicol], horse [ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin, tetracycline and ivermectin], and cattle [ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin]), and in entomofauna (ciprofloxacin and ivermectin). No VMP residues were detected in blueberry plants. Herein, we present novel data about the presence of VMP residues in the Pyrenean Capercaillie's environment, and identify potential VMP sources (i.e., livestock feces and entomofauna) and an exposure route (i.e., food chain) for Capercaillie chicks. Further studies are necessary to investigate the potential indirect or chronic effects of VMP residues in the species' breeding success and adult fitness, which must be taken into account by managers and policy makers to improve management and conservation actions.

AB  - Animals have evolved diverse comminuting tools. While vertebrates possess mineralized teeth, insect mandibles often bear metal-inclusion-hardened serrated cusps. Microscopic dental enamel wear (microwear) is known to be caused by contact with ingesta. To test if insect mandible microwear is also diet-dependent, we kept newly moulted adult two-spotted crickets (Gryllus bimaculatus) for four weeks on alfalfa-based rodent pellets with and without added mineral abrasives (loess, quartz, volcanic ash). Six crickets per diet were examined after 1, 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days. All diets induced progressive mandible wear, affecting specific locations along the distal tooth cusps differently. The depth of furrows increased on most abrasive-containing diets until day 21, while wear mark complexity increased from day 1 to 3 and 14 to 21. After 28 days, these parameter values for large volcanic ash and large quartz diets significantly exceeded those for the control diet. These results are comparable to observations from guinea pig feeding experiments with the same diets. Cricket mandible wear was affected by all abrasives. Notably, large volcanic ash and large quartz induced the deepest, most complex lesions, akin to observations in guinea pigs. This suggests a universal wear process, supporting that microwear analyses are suitable for inferring invertebrate diets.

AB  - Placental insufficiency is a known consequence of maternal heat stress during gestation in farm animals. The molecular regulation of placentae during the stress response is little known in pigs. This study aims to identify differential gene expression in pig placentae caused by maternal heat exposure during early to mid-gestation. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed on female placental samples from pregnant pigs exposed to thermoneutral control (CON; constant 20 degrees C; n = 5) or cyclic heat stress (HS; cyclic 28 to 33 degrees C; n = 5) conditions between d40 and d60 of gestation. On d60 of gestation, placental efficiency (fetal/placental weight) was decreased (p = 0.023) by maternal HS. A total of 169 genes were differentially expressed (FDR <= 0.1) between CON and HS placentae of female fetuses, of which 35 genes were upregulated and 134 genes were downregulated by maternal HS. The current data revealed transport activity (FDR = 0.027), glycoprotein biosynthetic process (FDR = 0.044), and carbohydrate metabolic process (FDR = 0.049) among the terms enriched by the downregulated genes (HS vs. CON). In addition, solute carrier (SLC)-mediated transmembrane transport (FDR = 0.008) and glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis (FDR = 0.027), which modulates placental stroma synthesis, were identified among the pathways enriched by the downregulated genes. These findings provide evidence that heat-stress induced placental inefficiency may be underpinned by altered expression of genes associated with placental nutrient transport capacity and metabolism. A further understanding of the molecular mechanism contributes to the identification of placental gene signatures of summer infertility in pigs.

AB  - Chronic wasting disease (CWD) has been identified in 30 states in the United States, four provinces in Canada, and recently emerged in Scandinavia. The association of CWD prions with environmental materials such as soil, plants, and surfaces may enhance the persistence of CWD prion infectivity in the environment exacerbating disease transmission. Identifying and quantifying CWD prions in the environment is significant for prion monitoring and disease transmission control. A systematic method for CWD prion quantification from associated environmental materials, however, does not exist. In this study, we developed an innovative method for extracting prions from swabs and recovering CWD prions swabbed from different types of surfaces including glass, stainless steel, and wood. We found that samples dried on swabs were unfavorable for prion extraction, with the greatest prion recovery from wet swabs. Using this swabbing technique, the recovery of CWD prions dried to glass or stainless steel was approximately 30% in most cases, whereas that from wood was undetectable by conventional prion immunodetection techniques. Real-time quake-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) analysis of these same samples resulted in an increase of the detection limit of CWD prions from stainless steel by 4 orders of magnitude. More importantly, the RT-QuIC detection of CWD prions recovered from stainless steel surfaces using this method was similar to the original CWD prion load applied to the surface. This combined surface swabbing and RT-QuIC detection method provides an ultrasensitive means for prion detection across many settings and applications.

AB  - Carbon-supported single-atom catalysts (C-SACs) are promising candidates for numerous electrocatalysis reactions. However, the controllable and economical synthesis of C-SACs remains a challenge since most of the examples were synthesized via multi-procedures and required elaborate selection of precursors, as well as severe sintering of the metal atoms as well. Herein, through high temperature carbonization in molten salts, we for the first time demonstrate a facile and low-cost strategy for the direct transformation of raw biomass into porous C-SACs with well-defined Fe-N-4 sites (termed as Fe-N/C-SAC). The high polarity of molten salts mentioned above can provide a unique environment in which the aggregation of metal atoms is strictly restricted, and instead they are trapped by N atoms from the precursor of pig liver, a cheap raw biomass containing abundant proteins. As an ORR catalyst in an alkaline medium, Fe-N/C-SAC not only exhibits a considerable onset potential (E-onset = 0.89 V vs. RHE) but also gives a high limiting current density (5.64 mA cm(-2) at 0.6 V), which is comparable to that of commercial Pt/C (5.80 mA cm(-2)). In addition, this C-SACs also illustrate excellent stability and methanol tolerance.

AB  - A Capsicum spp.-based phytogenic solution (PHY) improved the performance and thermal tolerance of heat-stressed (HS) growing pigs. Two trials were conducted to further evaluate the HS pig response to supplemental PHY. Trial 1: The effects on the serum concentrations of amino acids (AAs) and the gene expression of tight junction proteins in the jejunum and ileum were assessed with 42 pigs (Landrace-Hampshire-Duroc; 27.0 +/- 4.5 kg BW). There were three treatments (14 replicates): pigs under thermoneutral (TN) conditions fed control diet (TN-C); and HS pigs fed control diet without (HS-C) or with PHY (HS-PHY). Trial 2: Two-period digestion trial with eight ileal-cannulated pigs to analyze apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of AAs. Period 1: All TN pigs, fed the control (TN-C) or PHY-supplemented (TN-PHY) diet. Period 2: All HS pigs, fed the same diet as in period 1 (HS-C and HS-PHY). The control diet was based on wheat-soybean meal. In the jejunum, HS-C pigs had reduced occludin gene expression (p < 0.01) compared to TN-C pigs. HS-PHY pigs increased claudin-2 and tight-junction-protein-1 gene expression compared to HS-C (p < 0.05). In the ileum, HS-C and HS-PHY pigs had reduced occludin gene expression (p < 0.01). The serum concentrations of AAs decreased in HS-C compared to TN-C pigs (p < 0.05); except for arginine and isoleucine, HS-PHY pigs partially recovered serum AA levels. HS tended to reduce (p < 0.10; lysine and methionine) and reduced (p < 0.05) the AID of essential AAs. PHY did not mitigate the HS-associated reduced AA digestibility. In conclusion, these results support the concept that a phytogenic solution improves intestinal integrity and partially restores the post-absorption metabolism of amino acids, independent of the amino acid digestibility of heat-stressed pigs.

AB  - Simple Summary Research since the discovery of leptin has mainly focused on the long form of the leptin receptor. Currently, experiments on the short form of the leptin receptor have confirmed that not only is short form of leptin receptor present in the hypothalamus, but also expanded knowledge with information documenting the specific expression of that form of leptin receptor in selected areas of the hypothalamus and in the pituitary gland. In addition, we have shown that short form of leptin receptor expression levels are affected by day length, adiposity and resistin in sheep. The short form of the leptin receptor (LRa) plays a key role in the transport of leptin to the central nervous system (CNS). Here, the resistin (RSTN)-mediated expression of LRa in the preoptic area (POA), ventromedial and dorsomedial nuclei (VMH/DMH),arcuate nucleus (ARC) and the anterior pituitary gland (AP)was analyzed considering the photoperiodic (experiment 1) and nutritional status (experiment 2) of ewes. In experiment 1, 30 sheep were fed normally and received one injection of saline or two doses of RSTN one hour prior to euthanasia. RSTN increased LRa expression mainly in the ARC and AP during long days (LD) and only in the AP during short days (SD). In experiment 2, an altered diet for 5 months created lean or fat sheep. Twenty sheep were divided into four groups: the lean and fat groups were given saline, while the lean-R and fat-R groups received RSTN one hour prior to euthanasia. Changes in adiposity influenced the effect of RSTN on LRa mRNA transcript levels in the POA, ARC and AP and without detection of LRa in the VMH/DMH. Overall, both photoperiodic and nutritional signals influence the effects of RSTN on leptin transport to the CNS and are involved in the adaptive/pathological phenomenon of leptin resistance in sheep.

AB  - Pollen morphological traits are mostly used in resolving taxonomic problems at various taxonomic ranks to define species boundaries for long in the systematics and evolution. This study aims to provide new and useful information regarding the extent of pollen morphological diversity among the Asteraceae taxa and thus to contribute a better understanding of the taxonomy of studied species. These species belonged to three subfamilies Asteroideae having eight tribes (Senecioneae, Heliantheae, Milleriae, Eupatorieae, Coreopsideae, Inulaceae, Plucheeae, Tageteae, followed by Cichorioideae (Cichorieae) and the Vernonioideae (Vernonieae). Both light and scanning electron microscopy were used to investigate the ultrastructure of the exine. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to show the relationship among the Asteraceae taxa. The results showed two main types the echinolophate and echinate pollen. The echinate and echinolophate features were found to have a significant taxonomic value at the family level that delimits the Asteraceae from rest of the families. Besides, the ehinolophate feature was found to be the diagnostic trait of the tribe Vernonieae (Elephantopus tomentosus), Cichorieae (Youngia japonica) and echinate mixed with other morphological features in the inter-spinal area i.e. perforate, verrucate, scabrate, micro-reticulate and psilate were found in rest of the tribes. Aperture traits were found useful to differentiate between tribes. The maximum spines length was found in Bidens pilosa (5.43 mu m) while maximum pollen size was observed in Elephantopus tomentosus (28.43 x 21.93 mu m) followed by Tagetes erecta (28.36 x 19.51 mu m). Furthermore, the size, spines length, density, arrangement and number of the spines at the apocolpium region were found useful taxonomically important to discriminate the species. The overlapped features showed interspecies relationships because to be in the same families while the interspecies variation in pollen traits validate their existence as distinct species. The PCA analysis showed that the spine length, polar axis, equatorial diameter, colpus length and width, P/E ratio and inter-spinal area were found useful pollen morphological traits. In conclusion, our results showed that pollen morphology has a significant taxonomic potential to identify and define species boundaries at the tribe and generic levels. Hence, the pollen features can be used as an additional tool for regrouping taxa within the family Asteraceae by using both light and scanning electron microscopic techniques.

AB  - Adrenomedullin (ADM) is an evolutionarily conserved multifunctional peptide hormone that regulates implantation, embryo spacing, and placentation in humans and rodents. However, the potential roles of ADM in implantation and placentation in pigs, as a litter-bearing species, are not known. This study determined abundances of ADM in uterine lumina) fluid, and the patterns of expression of ADM and its receptor components (CALCRL, RAMP2, RAMP3, and ACKR3) in uteri from cyclic and pregnant gilts, as well as conceptuses (embryonic/fetus and its extra-embryonic membranes) during the peri-implantation period of pregnancy. Total recoverable ADM was greater in the uterine fluid of pregnant compared with cyclic gilts between Days 10 and 16 post-estrus and was from uterine luminal epithelial (LE) and conceptus trophectoderm (Tr) cells. Uterine expression of CALCRL, RAMP2, and ACKR3 were affected by day (P < 0.05), pregnant status (P < 0.01) and/or day x status (P < 0.05). Within porcine conceptuses, the expression of CALCRL, RAMP2, and ACKR3 increased between Days 10 and 16 of pregnancy. Using an established porcine trophectoderm (pTr1) cell line, it was determined that 10 -7 M ADM stimulated proliferation of pTr1 cells (P < 0.05) at 48 h, and increased phosphorylated mechanistic target of rapamycin (p-MTOR) and 4E binding protein 1 (p-4EBP1) by 6.1- and 4.9-fold (P < 0.0001 ), respectively. These novel results indicate a significant role for ADM in uterine receptivity for implantation and conceptus growth and development in pigs. They also provide a framework for future studies of ADM signaling to affect proliferation and migration of Tr cells, spacing of blastocysts, implantation, and placentation in pigs.

AB  - Food caching and haying can help species to survive extreme environmental conditions and cope with seasonal fluctuations in resource availability. We documented the food caching/haying behavior of the Ladakh Pika (Ochotona ladacensis) and the Nubra Pika (O. nubrica) from the cold desert of the Changthang biotic province, Ladakh, India, and contrasted their haying strategies under differing conditions of sociality and niche occupation. We found that the more social and larger species, O. ladacensis-which lives in open microhabitats-built larger and more conspicuous haypiles compared to O. nubrica-which built smaller, concealed haypiles in less open microhabitats. Ochotona ladacensis collected a different set of plants with greater overall richness than O. nubrica. Both species collected distasteful, toxic plants that are known to discourage herbivory. Ochotona nubrica placed haypiles closer to burrows in comparison to O. ladacensis. Haypiles in O. ladacensis colonies were clumped rather than uniformly distributed, not meeting predictions of the theory of cache defensibility associated with theft by conspecifics. The present study provides insights into haypile characteristics and associated behavioral responses of high-elevation pikas to variation in the availability of resources.
   This study documented and contrasted food caching behavior of the Ladakh Pika and Nubra Pika for the first time from the Changthang Biotic Province of the Trans-Himalayas in the context of sociality and the microhabitats they occupy. The Ladakh Pika-which lives in large social groups at high densities in open landscapes, constructed large haypiles and guarded them against conspecific theft (larder-hoarding), while the Nubra Pika-which lives in smaller social groups at lower densities in closed landscapes, constructed small haypiles and scattered them on colonies (scatter-hoarding). While there was variability in the expression of the behavior, contents, and sizes of caches, we believe that food caching behavior is a flexible bet-hedging strategy in pikas that likely increases winter survival.

AB  - The genus Elephantopus L. is a valuable resource rich in sesquiterpenoids with structural diversity and various bioactivities, showing great potential for applications in medicinal field and biological industry. Up to now, over 129 sesquiterpenoids have been isolated and identified from this plant genus, including 114 germacrane-type, 7 guaianolide-type, 5 eudesmane-type, 1 elemanolide-type, and 2 bis-sesquiterpenoids. These sesquiterpenoids were reported to show a diverse range of pharmacological properties, including cytotoxic, anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antiprotozoal. Consequently, some of them were identified as active scaffolds in the design and development of drugs. Considering that there is currently no overview available that covers the sesquiterpenoids and their biological activities in the Elephantopus genus, this article aims to comprehensively review the chemical structures, biosynthetic pathways, pharmacological properties, and structure-activity relationship of sesquiterpenoids found in the Elephantopus genus, which will establish a theoretical framework that can guide further research and exploration of sesquiterpenoids from Elephantopus plants as promising therapeutic agents.

AB  - This three years field study examined the influence of application rates of manure from sheep and goat (S/G) and their mixture with wood-based or farm yard manure-based biochars (FYMB) on growth performance of Foeniculum vulgare (fennel) and Cuminum cyminum (cumin). The fertilizer amendment rates were 1.66, 3.32 and 6.64 t ha(-1), which were applied for three consecutive years in field. The nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and phosphorus use efficiency (PUE) in seeds and stover of test crops were analyzed for third year cropping only. Results demonstrated that in general, fertilizers did not influence yield of first and second year crops. The significant (P <= 0.05) positive influences of organic fertilizers were observed for third year crops and were of higher magnitude for C. cyminum than F. vulgare (126-306.6% increase for C. cyminum and 24.5-48.4% increase for F. vulgare than control). As compared to S/G applied at 6.64 t ha(-1) rate, its co-amendment with wood-derived biochar at all application rates significantly reduced P in seeds; whereas, its co-amendment with both biochar types and at all application rates significantly reduced P in the stover of F. vulgare (Table 3; P <= 0.05). For the crop C. cyminum, there was no difference between treatments for the concentration of P in stover. The phosphorus use efficiency (PUE) of stover of F. vulgare was significantly improved by 80-108% and by 60-79% in response to the application of S/G and its co-amendment with FYMB respectively than control. The PUE of seeds of F. vulgare was increased by 100% than control in response to the co-amendment of manure with wood-derived biochar at high application rate (P <= 0.05). More profound significant improvement in PUE was observed for third year crop of C. cyminum, as most of the treatments improved PUE of seeds by171 - 561% and stover by 196-294% than control with no significant differences between fertilizer treatments. Results show no relationship between fertilizer application rates and life history trait of crops in space and time, since there was non-consistent and in general non-significant differences between fertilizer treatments for both crops.

AB  - The efficiency of the composting process for tomato residues and chicken manure was estimated after monitoring of the rotary composting system. Physicochemical parameters and Compost Quality Index were evaluated. The tomato residues (leaves, stems, and some green and damaged fruits) were collected, cut into small pieces, moistened approximately (60-65%), and mixed with 20% chicken manure then distributed into three rotary drum bioreactors. The obtained results showed that, the temperature above 50 degrees C was maintained for more than two days. Carbon: nitrogen (C:N) ratio was reduced from 30:1 to 19.13:1. The pH value ranged between 7 and 8.80 during the composting process, while the electrical conductivity (EC) ranged between 2.67 to 4.53 dS/m. Both compost quality parameters (Dewar and germination index) and (Solvita-CO2 and Solvita-NH3) indicated that, the final compost is stable and mature.
   Implications: The idea of this research revolves around assessing the maturity and stability of the compost resulting from mixing tomato residues with chicken manure, using a rotary drum bioreactor which is characterized by reducing the time of the active phase to several hours or days instead of weeks or months. Several tests related to the maturity and stability of mixture have been used to judge its quality. Also, many parameters related to this topic were monitored and discussed with many previous researches to determine the importance of benefiting from mixing the different wastes together and obtaining a good fertilizer ready for application as an agricultural substrate or a soil conditioner.

AB  - Simple Summary: A critical environmental factor that affects the growth and development of insect herbivores is food quality, and insect herbivores require the correct blend and balance of different nutrients in order to meet their physiological demands. For the first time, we investigated the nutritional regulation of the oriental armyworm, Mythimna separata (walker), and the association between insect performance (i.e., developmental time, insect mass, and reproductive response) and nutrients. Caterpillars had different intake targets for two macronutrients, proteins and carbohydrates, at two larval stages, and food consumption and nutrient intake were closely correlated with the content of protein and carbohydrate, respectively. Interestingly, we also found that the trade-off between nutritional regulation and fecundity, a phenomenon often seen in this migrating species, may be attributed to food quality and, subsequently, physiological preparation. These results help us better understand the behavior of this economically important pest in the field. In nature, plants can contain variable nutrients depending upon the species, tissue, and developmental stage. Insect herbivores may regulate their nutrient intake behaviorally and physio- logically when encountering different foods. This study examined the nutritional regulation of the oriental armyworm, Mythimna separata, for the first time. In one experiment, we allowed the cater-pillars to choose between two nutritionally balanced but complementary diets. The caterpillars did not randomly consume the paired foods, but instead chose between the nutritionally balanced but complementary diets. This intake behavior was found to change with their developmental stages. Furthermore, the nutrient concentrations in food significantly impacted the insect's performance. In the other experiment, caterpillars were given one of eleven diets that reflected the different nutrient conditions in the field. The results showed that proteins were significantly associated with developmental time and fecundity. For example, by consuming protein-biased food, the caterpillars developed faster and produced more eggs. In contrast, carbohydrates were more strongly linked to lipid accumulation, and caterpillars accumulated more lipids when consuming the carbohydrate-biased food. Moreover, the caterpillars were also found to actively regulate their intake of proteins and carbohydrates based on food quality and to physiologically prepare for subsequent life stages. These findings enhance our understanding of how M. separata feeds and responds to different nutritional environments in the field, which could have implications for managing insect herbivores in agricultural settings.

AB  - DNA methylation plays an important role in biological processes by affecting gene expression. However, how DNA methylation regulates phenotypic variation in Hu sheep remains unclear. Therefore, we generated genome-wide DNA methylation and transcriptomic profiles in the ovaries of Hu sheep with different prolificacies and genotypes (FecBB and FecB+). Results showed that ovary DNA methylome and transcriptome were significantly different between high prolificacy and low prolificacy Hu sheep. Comparative methylome analyses identified 10,644, 9,594, and 12,214 differentially methylated regions and 87, 1,121, and 2,375 genes, respectively, showing differential expression levels in three different comparison groups. Female reproduction-associated differentially methylated regions-related genes and differentially expressed genes were enriched, thereby the respective interaction networks were constructed. Furthermore, systematical integrative analyses revealed a negative correlation between DNA methylation around the transcriptional start site and gene expression levels, which was confirmed by testing the expression of integrin beta 2 subunit (ITGB2) and lysosome-associated protein transmembrane-4 beta (LAPTM4B) in vivo and in vitro. These findings demonstrated that DNA methylation influences the propensity for prolificacy by affecting gene expression in the ovaries, which may contribute to a greater understanding of the epigenome and transcriptome that will be useful for animal breeding.

AB  - Insect herbivores frequently cospeciate with symbionts that enable them to survive on nutritionally unbalanced diets. While ancient symbiont gain and loss events have been pivotal for insect diversification and feeding niche specialization, evidence of recent events is scarce. We examine the recent loss of nutritional symbionts (in as little as 1 MY) in sap-feeding Pariaconus, an endemic Hawaiian insect genus that has undergone adaptive radiation, evolving various galling and free-living ecologies on a single host-plant species, Metrosideros polymorpha within the last similar to 5 MY. Using 16S rRNA sequencing, we investigated the bacterial microbiomes of 19 Pariaconus species and identified distinct symbiont profiles associated with specific host-plant ecologies. Phylogenetic analyses and metagenomic reconstructions revealed significant differences in microbial diversity and functions among psyllids with different host-plant ecologies. Within a few millions of years, Pariaconus species convergently evolved the closed-gall habit twice. This shift to enclosed galls coincided with the loss of the Morganella-like symbiont that provides the essential amino acid arginine to free-living and open-gall sister species. After the Pariaconus lineage left Kauai and colonized younger islands, both open- and closed-gall species lost the Dickeya-like symbiont. This symbiont is crucial for synthesizing essential amino acids (phenylalanine, tyrosine, and lysine) as well as B vitamins in free-living species. The recurrent loss of these symbionts in galling species reinforces evidence that galls are nutrient sinks and, combined with the rapidity of the evolutionary timeline, highlights the dynamic role of insect-symbiont relationships during the diversification of feeding ecologies. We propose new Candidatus names for the novel Morganella-like and Dickeya-like symbionts.

AB  - In this article, we propose to explore the chemical interaction between Pseudosphinx tetrio L. and Allamanda cathartica L. using different analytical methods, including an innovative electrochemical approach (called electrochemical ecology) and multivariate analysis, and we investigate the potential antimicrobial effects (antibacterial and antifungal activities) of this interaction in order to gain a better understanding of their specific interaction. The analytical study presents a similar chemical profile between the leaves of healthy and herbivorous A. cathartica and the excretions of the caterpillars. The similar analytical profile of the leaves of A. cathartica and the excretions of P. tetrio, and the difference with the caterpillar bodies, suggests a selective excretion of compounds by the caterpillar. The measured antimicrobial activities support the physicochemical tests. The natural products found selectively in the excretions (rather than in the body) could explain the ability of P. tetrio to feed on this toxic Apocynaceae species.

AB  - Liaoning cashmere goat (LCG) is the world's highest cashmere producing white cashmere goat. It has the characteristics of long cashmere fiber, high net cashmere rate, moderate cashmere fineness, white cashmere, strong size, strong adaptability, stable genetic performance, and good effect in improving middle and low production cashmere goat. It is known as "National treasure of China". With LCG as the paternal parent, five new local breeds have been cultivated, which has made outstanding contributions to the improvement and breeding of Chinese cashmere goat breeds. LCG cashmere has moderate fineness (the average fineness of cashmere of LCG population is about 16 mu m).However, as a slightly coarse textile raw material, we hope to identify the key genes regulating cashmere fineness through PCR-seq and MLR, in order to reduce cashmere fineness.We collected and extracted DNA from the blood of Liaoning cashmere goats, designed primers, PCR amplification, and Statistical analysis. It was found that the the AA genotype of the G3667A locus of the KRT35 gene, CT genotype of the T615C locus of the TCHHL1 gene in bucks and the CC genotype of does, as well as CT genotype of the T615C locus of the TCHHL1 gene in bucks and the CC genotype of does are dominant genotypes in cashmere fineness. The dominant haplotype combination with multiple factors and effects of cashmere fineness has been determined to be CTGG in bucks and TTGG in does. There was a significant linear regression relationship between the fineness of cashmere in LCG and the cashmere rate and cashmere quantity. There is a significant linear regression relationship between the fineness of LCG and the cashmere rate and cashmere quantity. CF = 0.001SQ-0.71CY + 20.784 (R2 = 0.818) in buck and CF = 0.001SQ-0.767CY + 22.009 (R2 = 0.863) in doe. Conclusion: The AA genotype of KRT35 gene, CT genotype of TCHHL1 gene in bucks and CC genotype of does can be used as molecular markers to assist in the selection of cashmere fineness.

AB  - Recent research on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) has focused on the human-land relationship and its evolution through time; fossil fungal spores are promising proxies for recovering information on paleoecological changes and ancient anthropogenic activity. Modern analog fungal spore datasets are crucial for accurate paleoecological interpretation of fossil fungal spores, however, these are lacking for the QTP. In this study, we analyzed 130 modern samples of topsoil and herbivore dung from eastern QTP to assess fungal assemblages in different habitats and vegetational communities. The results indicate that fungal spores in different types of domestic herbivore dung samples are quite similar and dominated by Sporormiella spp., Urocystis sp., Sordaria spp., Pleospora spp., QTPF-01 (Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau Fungi). Topsoil samples, collected from different vegetation zones, show more variation. Savoryella spp. is the dominant taxon in cropland samples, while Meliola spp. and Coniochaeta spp. are well associated with alpine forest environments. Fungal spore assemblages in alpine shrub, alpine meadow, and alpine steppe are mostly dominated by Glomus spp., together with Savoryella spp., Valsaria sp., Entorrhiza spp., and QTPF-03. Comparison of fungal assemblages in herbivore dung and topsoil samples suggests that Sporormiella spp., Urocystis sp., Sordaria spp., Pleospora spp., QTPF-01, Podospora spp., Delitschia A., and QTPF-07 are the most reliable dung indicators. The total concentration of coprophilous fungal spores is sensitive to grazing pressure and can be used to diagnose the intensity of pastoralism on the QTP. Our work provides vital modern analog data for fossil fungal spore studies on the QTP.

AB  - Background Opuntia ficus-indica (L.) Miller is dominantly growing on degraded soils in arid and semi-arid areas. The plants might establish a strong association with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) to adapt to nutrient, drought, and herbivore insect stress. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of AMF inoculations and variable soil water levels (SWA) on the biomass, nutrient concentration, nutritional composition, and nutrient digestibility of the spiny and spineless O. ficus-indica by inducing resistance to cochineal stress. One mother Opuntia ficus-indica cladode was planted in a single pot in each field with 24 kg mixed soil. AMF inoculums were cultured in sorghum plants in a greenhouse and were inoculated in the planted cladodes. The planted cladodes were arranged using a completely randomized design (CRD) with three factors: AMF (present and absent); O. ficus-indica type (spiny and spineless) and four water treatments with 0-25% of plant available soil water (SWA), 25-50% of SWA, 50-75% of SWA, and 75-100% of SWA. Results Drought stress reduced the below and above-ground biomass, cladode nutrient content, nutritional composition, and in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) and in vitro organic matter digestibility (IVOMD). AMF colonization significantly increased biomass production with significant changes in the macro and micro-nutrient concentrations of O. ficus-indica. AMF inoculation significantly increased the IVDMD and IVOMD of both O. ficus-indica types by improving the biomass, organic matter (OM), crude protein (CP), and reduced fiber and ash contents. AMF-inoculated cladodes improved the nutrient concentrations of the cladodes. AMF caused an increase in biomass production, increased tolerance to cochineal stress, and improved nutrient concentration, nutritional composition, and nutrient digestibility performance of O. ficus-indica plants. Conclusions AMF improved the performance of the O. ficus-indica plant to resist drought and cochineal stress and increased the biomass, nutrient concentration, nutritional composition, and nutrient digestibility. The potential of O. ficus-indica to adapt to cochineal stress is controlled by the macro and micro-nutrient concentration brought by the AMF association.

AB  - The industrial ecological transformation of the iron and steel industry toward green and low-carbon is crucial for reduction in pollutants and carbon emission. However, there is a lack of comprehensive frameworks to quantitatively assess this transformation. To address this problem, quantitative indicators based on the network analysis of exergy metabolism, including flow cycling indicators, trophic structure indicators and flow-based information indicators, were identified to track and assess industrial ecological transformation of the iron and steel industrial symbiosis network. The cycling capacity of the iron and steel industry is still at an immature stage. However, there have been significant positive effects of measures on the structure and function, e.g., the overall Detritivory: Herbivory ratio has improved from 0.18 to 0.47, meaning reduced environmental dependency. The role of external environment and waste management is being strengthened, which are the main drivers of network recycling. A comparative analysis with iron and carbon metabolism highlights the advantages of exergy metabolism, providing a comprehensive perspective for quantifying the transformation process. It is essential for managers to focus on the impact of rolling equipment on structure and function, and policy direction should prioritize carbon and iron recycling. The methods and findings in this study can inform the development and management of transformation in the iron and steel industry.

AB  - Simple Summary: Circular exercise is a common practice in many disciplines, whether it be in the form of lunging, a mechanical walker, or ridden exercise. However, how horses adapt to circular exercise may put their bone and joint health at risk. To evaluate how the musculoskeletal system responds to circular exercise, juvenile sheep were used as a model for young horses. Circular exercise was found to influence traits of bone quality, including density and fracture force. Speed and circle diameter also influenced markers of bone formation and bone resorption. Though no joint damage was found, it is possible that joint changes were undetected and tighter or faster circles would have produced different results. It is important for one to consider factors such as speed and circle diameter in their exercise programs to help ensure the musculoskeletal health of equine athletes. Though circular exercise is commonly used in equestrian disciplines, it may be at the detriment of horses' musculoskeletal system. To investigate the effects of circular exercise on bone and joint health, 42 lambs were randomly assigned to a non-exercised control, straight-line, small circle, or large circle exercise regime at a slow (1.3 m/s) or fast (2.0 m/s) speed for 12 wk. Blood samples were taken biweekly. Animals were humanely euthanized upon study completion, and the fused third and fourth metacarpals were collected for biomechanical testing and bone density analysis. Fast groups were found to have more bone formation and less resorption activity than slow groups as evidenced by serum biomarker concentrations (p < 0.05). Sheep in the large fast group tended to have greater flexural rigidity and fracture force for the outside leg compared to the inside leg (p < 0.1). Sheep in the small slow group tended to have increased bone mineral density of the outside leg compared to the inside leg, whereas the opposite occurred in the large slow group (p < 0.1). These results provide further evidence for potential asymmetric musculoskeletal adaptations to circular exercise while emphasizing the importance of speed as a positive influence on bone metabolism and strength.

AB  - Simple Summary Rectal thermometry is still standard practice in the measurement of body temperature in livestock because of its low cost. However, there are situations where this method is contraindicated or impractical, and a less invasive method is required. Non-contact devices have been used in livestock production; however, there are few studies about the variation and correlations in body temperature between rectal temperature and non-contact devices. The present work aims to compare rectal temperature with two types of non-contact devices (non-contact infrared thermometers and thermal imaging/infrared thermography) for the assessment of body temperature in healthy sheep. Except for the temperature taken by non-contact infrared thermometers at the muzzle, the correlation between rectal temperature vs. non-contact infrared thermometers or thermal imaging/infrared thermography showed a low significance or was difficult to use for practical flock management purposes. In addition, the variability between devices was high, which implies that measurements should be interpreted with caution in warm climates and open pens, such as most sheep farms in the Spanish Mediterranean area.Abstract Non-contact devices have been used in the measurement of body temperature in livestock production as a tool for testing disease in different species. However, there are few studies about the variation and correlations in body temperature between rectal temperature (RT) and non-contact devices such as non-contact infrared thermometers (NCIT) and thermal imaging/infrared thermography (IRT). The objective of this work was to evaluate the accuracy of non-contact devices to measure the body temperature in sheep, considering six body regions and the possibility of implementing these systems in herd management. The experiment was carried out at the experimental farm of the Catholic University of Valencia, located in the municipality of Massanassa in July of 2021, with 72 dry manchega ewes, and we compared the rectal temperature with two types of non-contact infrared devices for the assessment of body temperature in healthy sheep. Except for the temperature taken by NCIT at the muzzle, the correlation between RT vs. NCIT or IRT showed a low significance or was difficult to use for practical flock management purposes. In addition, the variability between devices was high, which implies that measurements should be interpreted with caution in warm climates and open pens, such as most sheep farms in the Spanish Mediterranean area. The use of infrared cameras devices to assess body temperature may have a promising future, but in order to be widely applied as a routine management method on farms, the system needs to become cheaper, simpler in terms of measurements and quicker in terms of analyzing results.

AB  - The co-evolution between plants and herbivorous insects has led to a continuous arms race on defense and anti-defense mechanisms. In this process, insect-derived effectors are crucial for suppressing plant defense. Despite considerable progress in plant-insect interaction studies, the functional role of heat shock cognate protein 70 (HSC70) as an effector in herbivorous insects remains poorly characterized. This study provides evidence that HSC70-3 functions as an effector in interactions between the cruciferous specialist diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella) and its host plant radish (Raphanus sativus 'Nanpan Prefecture'). Using immunofluorescence labeling and in situ Western blot (WB), we demonstrated that HSC70-3 is secreted into plant wound sites through larval gut regurgitant during feeding. Short-term host transfer experiments revealed tissue-specific hsc70-3 expression changes, indicating a dynamic response to plant-derived challenges. These findings suggest hsc70-3 is differentially regulated at transcriptional and translational levels to facilitate insect adaptation to host plant shifts. Knockout of hsc70-3 using CRISPR/Cas9 technology significantly impaired larval growth, prolonged development duration, and reduced pupal weight on host plants, indicating its involvement in host adaptation. However, knockout mutants exhibited no significant developmental defects when reared on an artificial diet, suggesting that hsc70-3 primarily functions in modulating plant-induced defense responses rather than directly affecting insect physiology. Collectively, these findings provide evidence for the functional roles of HSC70-3 in P. xylostella and plant interactions, laying a foundation for further investigations into insect effectors and their mechanisms in modulating plant defense responses.

KW  - CONTEXT
AB  - Rhinocerotidae represents a common element in the Eurasian Pleistocene faunas. Origin, dispersal route, and biochronology of several species are still poorly understood due to gaps in the fossil record, in particular from central Eurasia. A remarkable collection of rhinoceros remains was recovered from the Early Pleistocene site of Dmanisi (Georgia). This collection is unique for the Early Pleistocene Rhinocerotidae records due to its abundance in remains, its age (ca 1.8 Ma) and geographic position (between Eastern and Western Eurasia). Two crania, which display some different morphological traits, are assigned to two different morphotypes and investigated by means of geometric morphometrics using landmarks and semilandmarks. Shapes in lateral and dorsal views of different Rhinocerotini species are compared with the studied crania to infer paleoecological information. The shape in the lateral view reflects ecological niche, in particular feeding type from browsing to grazing, and it also represent taxonomic discrimination. Morphotypes 1 and 2 from Dmanisi fall in two different clusters, corresponding to two different species, notably in lateral view. The results suggest a niche partitioning during the Early Pleistocene of Dmanisi between a browse-dominated and a grass-dominated mixed feeders, or possibly the presence of two ecomorphotypes of the same species. A comprehensive update of the Early Pleistocene occurrences of Eurasian Rhinocerotidae is reported in the discussion on the paleoecology of the extinct Northern Eurasian rhinocerotines.

AB  - Microorganisms, especially viruses, cause disease in both humans and animals. Environmental chemical pollutants including microplastics, pesticides, antibiotics sand air pollutants arisen from human activities affect both animal and human health. This review assesses the impact of chemical and biological contaminants (virus and bacteria) on viruses including its life cycle, survival, mutations, loads and titers, shedding, transmission, infection, re-assortment, interference, abundance, viral transfer between cells, and the susceptibility of the host to viruses. It summarizes the sources of environmental contaminants, interactions between contaminants and viruses, and methods used to mitigate such interactions. Overall, this review provides a perspective of environmentally co-occurring contaminants on animal viruses that would be useful for future research on virus-animalhuman-ecosystem harmony studies to safeguard human and animal health.

AB  - The speed control of a pipeline inspection gauge (PIG) directly affects the quality of the comprehensive inspection of submarine pipelines. However, the mechanism of the gas flow behavior in a pipeline under the influence of a pig speed control valve is not well understood. In this study, the driving differential pressure of a pig was modeled based on the building block method and numerical simulations. For the first time, the influence of the pressure and flow rate of the gas in a pipeline on the torque of the speed control valve opening process was studied. The results show that when the opening angle of the speed control valve increased from 4.5 degrees to 22 degrees, the gas differential pressure reduced from 1325 to 73 kPa, realizing a 94.5% pressure reduction. In addition, the torque of the bypass valve increased from 7.7 to 2470 Nm during the closing process. The pressure and flow rate increases were directly correlated with increased torque. The established experimental system for torque measurement confirmed the numerical analysis results. By clarifying the law of torque variation, this study provides theoretical guidance for the structural design and control scheme of a pig speed control unit.

AB  - Simple Summary Carbonic anhydrases (CAs) play a crucial role in numerous physiological and pathological processes in animals. Specifically, carbonic anhydrase VB (CA5B) is integral to both gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis. Structural variations, particularly retrotransposon insertion polymorphisms (RIPs), can contribute significantly to these processes. When an RIP is inserted into a genome region containing functional elements (such as promoters, enhancers, and insulators), it can have an impact on both the expression and phenotypic changes of target genes. In this study, we identified an RIP located in the first intron of the CA5B gene, inserted by the SINE element, which enhanced the core promoter activity of the target gene. Through experimental analysis and growth data provided by the pig breeding farm (Anhui academy of agriculture sciences), we found that the SINE insertion improved the expression of the porcine CA5B gene in adipose tissue. Additionally, the number of (ATTT) repeats within the SINE insertion at this site was inconsistent across breeds and individuals. This study provides insight into the role RIPs play in genetic variation of CA5B genes and its phenotypic expression in pigs. Transposons are genetic elements that are present in mammalian genomes and occupy a large proportion of the pig genome, with retrotransposons being the most abundant. In a previous study, it was found that a SINE retrotransposon was inserted in the 1(st) intron of the CA5B gene in pigs, and the present study aimed to investigate the SINE insertion polymorphism in this gene in different pig breeds. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to confirm the polymorphism in 11 pig breeds and wild boars), and it was found that there was moderate polymorphism information content in 9 of the breeds. Further investigation in cell experiments revealed that the 330 bp SINE insertion in the RIP-CA5B site promoted expression activity in the weak promoter region of this site. Additionally, an enhancer verification vector experiment showed that the 330 bp SINE sequence acted as an enhancer on the core promoter region upstream of the CA5B gene region. The expression of CA5B in adipose tissue (back fat and leaf fat) in individuals with the (SINE+/+) genotype was significantly higher than those with (SINE+/-) and (SINE-/-) genotypes. The association analysis revealed that the (SINE+/+) genotype was significantly associated with a higher back fat thickness than the (SINE-/-) genotype. Moreover, it was observed that the insertion of SINE at the RIP-CA5B site carried ATTT repeats, and three types of (ATTT) repeats were identified among different individuals/breeds (i.e., (ATTT)(4), (ATTT)(6) and (ATTT)(9)). Overall, the study provides insights into the genetic basis of adipose tissue development in pigs and highlights the role of a SINE insertion in the CA5B gene in this process.

AB  - The recent exploitation of marine species is relatively well documented and understood in terms of impacts on species abundance, distribution, and resource use. In contrast, ancient exploitation of marine mammals remains poorly documented; in part, because a detailed meta-analysis of their presence in the zooarchaeological record is lacking. This is true in the Black Sea, where cetaceans are reported in the zooarchaeological record but have not yet been studied comprehensively. Here, we synthesize all available published and unpublished zooarchaeological data from 27 sites around the Black Sea, dating from the Mesolithic and Neolithic periods (6500-6000 BCE) to the Medieval period (641e1475 CE), to document the extent and nature of the exploitation of the Black Sea cetacean species. The results suggest that cetacean exploitation was practised continuously in the Black Sea over a period of 8500 years from the Neolithic through to the Medieval period. This suggests a much longer history of marine mammal exploitation in the Black Sea than previously understood, pushing back the timeline of human impacts on the Black Sea marine fauna.& COPY; 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Aim: Variation in total soluble proteins and protease inhibitor levels were investigated to determine nutritional and plant defense status in different leaf types of Terminalia arjuna (Roxb.) Wight and Arn., and Schleichera oleosa (Lou.) Oken, two host tree species of the economically important, nonmulberry Tasar silkworm, A. mylitta.
   Methodology: Quantitative spectrophotometric assays based on diagnostic amidolytic substrates were conducted to assess serine protease inhibitor activities in young, semi-mature and mature leaf types. A microplate quantification assay for total protein estimations was used with leaf types sampled over a year. Efficacy of total trypsin inhibitor and chymotrypsin inhibitor activities detected in T. arjuna (a primary host plant) was further evaluated on gut extracts of fourth instar A. mylitta and Pieris brassicae L. (a Pierid pest of crucifers) to assess the physiological adaptation of larvae to dietary antifeedants. Molecular provenances with rbcL genes were obtained that are available as NCBI accessions #MN460810 for T. arjuna and #MT010554 for S. oleosa.
   Results: Intra-specific variations were evident in leaf phenology of two tree species. Generally, young leaf type of both tree species had high levels of total protein and trypsin inhibitory activities, while mature leaf type of T. arjuna had low total protein content and trypsin inhibitor levels. Mature leaf type of S. oleosa had low trypsin inhibitor levels during the months of July and August. Midgut proteases of A. mylitta and P. brassicae were significantly more susceptible (p=0.05) to both trypsin and chymotrypsin inhibitors detected in young and semi-mature leaf types of T. arjuna than the mature leaf type.
   Interpretation: In this study, differential inhibition of digestive proteases in A. mylitta and P. brassicae by protease inhibitors from different leaf types of T. arjuna, suggested adaptation to dietary antifeedants. Such reports on nutritional quality, foliar antifeedants, phenology and host plant utilization are relevant for strategies to domesticate the tropical Tasar silkworm, A. mylitta.

AB  - Simple Summary: Lumpy skin disease (LSD) caused by the LSD virus (LSDV) severely impacts the economy of a country and its cattle industry. After the first outbreak in October 2023, South Korea decided to vaccinate cattle nationwide. This study specifically investigated the efficacy of the vaccination campaign against lumpy skin disease (LSD) and analyzed the seropositivity rates of LSD antibodies 2-3 months after vaccination to provide guidance regarding future vaccination strategies and biosecurity measures. In total, 3910 cattle were tested from four Korean provinces, with an overall seropositivity rate of 30.59 percent. Dairy cattle had higher seropositivity rates (42.97%) than Korean native cattle (29.21%). The availability of appropriate restraining facilities and vaccination methods has an influence on vaccine effectiveness. Although vaccination produces an adequate immune response, upgrading vaccination procedures, such as strengthening restraint facilities and employing professionals, can improve outcomes even more. This study offers useful insights into how to improve LSD control strategies in Korea and other affected countries.<br /> Lumpy skin disease (LSD), caused by the LSD virus (LSDV), a dsDNA virus of the genus Capripoxvirus, represents a significant cross-border infectious threat, particularly impacting cattle and water buffaloes through transmission by blood-feeding insects. Traditionally endemic to Southern Africa, LSD has rapidly spread over the past decade through the Middle East to Eastern Europe and China, reaching Korea in October 2023. This outbreak prompted a nationwide vaccination campaign, addressing both the disease's severe economic impact and its status as a notifiable disease under the World Organisation for Animal Health. This study assesses the seropositivity of the LSD vaccine in cattle across four Korean provinces 2-3 months post-vaccination, aiming to inform improvements in biosecurity and vaccination strategies. Overall, 30.59% of the cattle tested (1196 out of 3910) exhibited positive antibody responses, comparable to international post-vaccination findings. Analysis further revealed differences in the antibody positivity between farm types and management practices. Specifically, farms where vaccines were administered by veterinarians showed no significant difference in antibody positivity between Korean native cattle and dairy cattle, regardless of the presence of restraint facilities. However, on farms where vaccinations were conducted by the owners, dairy cattle demonstrated a higher seropositivity (43.30 +/- 33.39%) compared to Korean native cattle (21.97 +/- 20.79%) in the absence of restraint facilities. Further comparisons underscored the impact of restraint facilities on vaccination efficacy, with dairy farms generally achieving higher antibody positivity (29.43 +/- 30.61%) than farms with Korean native cattle (23.02 +/- 23.33%) (p < 0.05), suggesting that consistent vaccine delivery methods enhance immunogenic responses. Contrarily, no significant difference was noted in antibody positivity between large- and small-scale farms, indicating that farm size did not notably impact the effectiveness of the vaccinator. These findings emphasize that while current vaccines are sufficiently inducing immunity, enhancing vaccination strategies, particularly through trained personnel and improved restraint facilities, is crucial.
   This study's insights into the impact of vaccination and farm management practices provide valuable guidance for refining LSD control measures in Korea and potentially other affected regions.
