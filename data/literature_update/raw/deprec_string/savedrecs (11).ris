AB  - Bat flies (Nycteribiidae and Streblidae) have been used to study co-evolutionary patterns between ectoparasites and bats. In the world, Nycteribiidae and Streblidae are represented by approximately 276 and 237 species, respectively. In regions such as the Orinoquia located in the north of South America (Colombia and Venezuela), the richness of bats is high (more than 100 documented species), but studies on Nycteribiidae and Streblidae are scarce and discontinuous. To contribute to the knowledge of ectoparasitic flies in the Orinoquia, records of flies and their interactions with bats were reviewed, including new records and associations using interaction networks. We documented 124 species of Streblidae and only 12 of Nycteribiidae for the Orinoquia in approximately 102 bat species reported in Colombia and Venezuela. New records for six species of bat flies in Colombia were found (Mastoptera guimaraesi, Noctiliostrebla maai, Paradyschiria parvuloides, Trichobius jubatus, Trichobius parasiticus, and Basilia ferrisi) associated with six species of bats (Cynomops planirostris, Desmodus rotundus, Myotis handleyi, Molossus rufus, Noctilio albiventris, and Phyllostomus hastatus). The bat-ectoparasite interaction networks in the Orinoquia revealed a pattern of antagonistic relationships, with high specialization, modularity, and low connectivity and nesting. The identified networks are between bat fly species belonging to different ecomorphological groups with unique host species. This supports the idea of ecological niche partitioning among ectoparasitic bat flies and hosts. Our study expanded the knowledge of the distribution of some fly species and the associations with bat hosts in Colombia, by presenting morphological descriptions and new observations, which are key to understanding the ecology, diversity, and distribution of these species.

AB  - Several secondary metabolites are associated with plant resistance against herbivores. Cassava genotypes present a wide variety of metabolites with insecticidal potential, but little is known about the identity of these compounds. The present work was conducted for the identification of insecticidal molecules present in cassava genotypes. To this purpose, we firstly evaluated the development of the generalist herbivore Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith, 1797) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) fed with leaves from six cassava genotypes (IAC-14, IAC-90, IAC-12, IAC-Caapora, Baianinha and MEcu 72). Following bioassays, we measured the levels of two anti-herbivory related groups of compounds (phenolics and steroidal saponins) in all genotypes using colorimetric methods. The metabolic fingerprinting (GC-MS) of three contrasting cassava genotypes selected by their biological interferences over S. frugiperda was performed. The most unsuitable nutritional indices were observed for larvae fed with MEcu 72. Lower reproductive indices were observed for adults in which larval stages were fed with Baianinha or MEcu 72. Steroidal saponin content was similar in all genotypes, but phenolic content was 25% higher in MEcu 72. GC-MS metabolite fingerprinting of MEcu 72, Baianinha and IAC-Caapora resulted in the annotation of 53 metabolites in which 20 presented different relative abundance among the evaluated genotypes. Molecules such as myo-inositol-2-monophosphate, p-coumaric acid, chlorogenic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, octadecadienoic acid and n-hexacosane were more abundant in MEcu 72 or Baianinha than in IAC-Caapora. The possible roles of these molecules in the development of S. frugiperda are discussed.

AB  - In a context of climate change and circular economy, it is fundamental to produce animal manure-based fertilizers attractive to farmers who are reluctant to use heterogeneous materials, poorly characterized and with unbalanced nutrient contents, namely N:P ratios different from plant requirements. Hence, the aim of the present study was to assess the potential of different treated and non-treated animal manures to produce tailor-made manure-based fertilizers with known N:P ratios. Seven manures were considered: cattle, caprine and poultry solid manures, two contrasting cattle slurries and two contrasting swine slurries. Slurries were further treated by solid-liquid separation, acidification, and acidification followed by solid-liquid separation. Raw and treated manures were fully characterized to assess the effect of manure type and treatment on their nutrient contents and N:P ratios, to incorporate them in manure-based fertilizers with selected N:P ratio. The present results were essential to support the manure-based fertilizer production and identify which materials could be considered: it appears clearly that the pig slurry with all stages of production and the correspondent liquid fraction cannot be used due to their low nutrients content. It was shown that the solid fractions rich in P and with a NT:N-NH4+ ratio close to 1 are an excellent material to prepare manure-based fertilizers. Acidification, combined with solid liquid separation, produced a liquid fraction rich in both N and P and with a NT:PT ratio close to 1, with the additional benefit of a slow N-release material. Some of the manures or sub-products obtained after treatment provided the usual N:P ratio required by farmers and could be used directly as substitutes of mineral fertilizers. Nevertheless, the blending of some of these materials has a stronger potential to the production of specific manure-based fertilizer.

AB  - Simple Summary African Swine fever is present on the African, European and Asian continents, causing devastating economic impact due to the mandatory mass depopulation in confirmed outbreaks. Using the data reported by the Romanian National Sanitary Veterinary and Food Safety Authority, we created a database with all the localities from Romania where the outbreaks were confirmed between 2020 and 2021 as well as the geoclimatic features of those areas. The database was then used to statistically analyze the frequency of confirmed outbreaks in relation with specific climatic and environmental factors. Our results show that such studies need to be continued in order to have a better understanding of the geoclimatic risk factors in the transmission of African swine fever virus. African swine fever has a significant economic, social and environmental impact due to official regulation of the disease, namely the mass depopulation of all pigs in confirmed outbreaks. The main objective of the present study was to statistically analyze the possible correlation between the number of outbreaks and infected pigs from backyard farms with the altitude, seasonal average annual humidity, and average temperature during spring, summer, autumn and winter, as well as the distance from forests, rivers, and lakes in Romania. The study included all infected backyard pigs with African swine fever virus (n = 7764) and outbreaks (n = 404) that occurred in Romania between 6 February 2020 and 2 March 2021. The number of infected pigs and ASF outbreaks were significantly higher in localities at altitudes between 100 and 500 m, average annual humidity between 60% and 80%, average spring temperature between 10 and 14 degrees C, average summer temperature between 16 and 22 degrees C, average autumn temperature between 10 and 13 degrees C, average winter temperatures between -1 and 2 degrees C, and at distances of less than 5 km from the forests, less than 15 km from lakes and less than 5 km from the rivers. The number of affected pigs decreased significantly at summer temperatures below 16 degrees C.

KW  - FILMS
AB  - Biodegradable electronics dissolve in vivo, eliminating retention risks, but they are often not self-contained due to limited energy storage, relying on tethered or wireless power. Here, we report a biodegradable flexible supercapacitor (BFSC) that can be completely dissolved to achieve symbiosis with the body and modulate neural excitation and inhibition without external energy. Its low stiffness and favorable biocompatibility allow it to minimize interface mismatch and rejection to be integrated with the body like a biological tissue. The BFSC has a farad surface capacitance (0.36 F/cm2), high energy density (73.1 mWh/cm2), and 1-month operating life in vivo due to the MXene nanolayered electrode and solid-state hydrogel electrolyte. The BFSC can drive bioelectric stimulation circuits to enable neuromodulation and cardiac pacing in rats and pigs. The scaffold-like BFSC almost completely inhibits neural activity. These advances are expected to facilitate the development of self-contained biodegradable and symbiotic bioelectronics.

AB  - The current study was designed to investigate the existing status of Boophilus microplus and its associated risk factors in two ecological zones viz: Zone-1 (Swat &Dir) and Zone-2 (Charsadda & Nowshehra) districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Pakistan. A total of 600 ticks were collected from (n=400) animals (Cattle n=200 & Buffalo n=200) of mixed breed, age and sex from local dairy farms and domestic livestock owners. The overall percentage (33.33%) of Boophilus microplus in all four districts was found significant (P<0.05). Similarly the percentage of Boophilus microplus in Zone-1 i.e. (26.33%) and in zone 2 i.e. (40.33%) were significant (P<0.05). The overall percentage of Boophilus microplus was found higher in Zone-2 as compared to zone-1 however this was significant (P<0.05). Keeping in view of prevalence in the infested animals (gender wise and age wise), a significant (P<0.05) difference was observed in female and young animals in both zones. The specie wise infestation rate was recorded significant (P<0.05) for cattle as compared to buffalo. Among the risk factors involved as a result of the data collected based on questionnaire, a significant (P<0.05) increase was observed in muddy houses, grazing stock and animal owners with little or no awareness towards ticks and their associated problems. It may be concluded that damp, warm and unhygienic farm practices, young stock, female animals, grazing animals and those living in muddy houses were at higher risk of getting tick infestation and ultimately other related consequences.

AB  - Veterinary antibiotics (VAs) are not completely metabolized in the animal body. Hence, when animal excretes are used as soil manures, VA residues are dispersed with potential implications for environmental quality and human health. We studied the persistence of tiamulin (TIA) and tilmicosin (TLM) along their route from pig administration to fecal excretion and to agricultural soils. TLM was detected in feces at levels folds higher (4.27-749.6 mu g g-1) than TIA (0.55-5.99 mu g g-1). Different administration regimes (feed or water) showed different excretion patterns and residual levels for TIA and TLM, respectively. TIA and TLM (0.5, 5 and 50 mu g g-1) dissipated gradually from feces when stored at ambient conditions (DT50 5.85-35.9 and 23.5-49.8 days respectively), while they persisted longer during anaerobic digestion (DT90 >365 days) with biomethanation being adversely affected at VA levels > 5 mu g g-1. When applied directly in soils, TLM was more persistent than TIA with soil fumigation extending their persistence suggesting microbial degradation, while soil application through feces increased their persistence, probably due to increased sorption to the fecal organic matter. The use of TIA- and TLM-contaminated feces as manures is expected to lead to VAs dispersal with unexplored consequences for the environment and human health.

AB  - Seahorse embryos are brooded in the enclosed nutrient-rich environment of the male brood pouch, which may be prone to bacterial infection. The immune responses of interleukin (IL) genes in the brood pouch have not been well studied. We identified 13 interleukins in the lined seahorse Hippocampus erectus. Tissue-specific expression analysis revealed increased mRNA expression levels of il-1 beta, il-18, and il-8 in the brood pouch. When challenged with lipopolysaccharide or Vibrio parahaemolyticus, il-1 beta and il-18 were active as part of the acute and chronic inflammatory responses, respectively. Importantly, il-8 may be involved in powerful antibacterial immune responses and may be induced by il-1 beta and il-18 via a process involving the nuclear factor-kappa B signaling pathway. These results suggest that il-1 beta, il-18, and il-8 may play key roles in the antibacterial immune defense of the brood pouch in male seahorses.

AB  - Simple Summary The vomeronasal organ plays a key role in intraspecific animal behavior since it is able to detect pheromones. Induced and spontaneous lesions of this structure have been previously associated with various social behavior alterations in animals. In cats, the inflammation of this organ, named vomeronasalitis, has been associated with the presence of aggression towards other cats. The aim of this study was to describe this pathology in farm pigs and to evaluate if it is associated with social alterations as described in cats. Our study showed that farm pigs can be affected by the inflammation of the vomeronasal organ and that the pigs with this alteration present an increased number of skin lesions induced by fights with other pigs. These results open an interesting perspective that links the alteration of this organ to the presence of aggressive behaviors in farm animals, which implicates an important issue in animal welfare. The vomeronasal organ (VNO) is a bilateral chemosensory structure strongly involved in animal behaviour, thanks to its sensory epithelium (VNSE) that detects pheromones. Experimental VNO lesions can impair social, reproductive and maternal behaviour, while feline spontaneous vomeronasalitis has been associated with aggression. This study aimed to describe vomeronasalitis in farm pigs and explore its association with intraspecific behavioural alterations. Using 38 six-month-old pigs, the skin lesion score based on Welfare Quality(R) protocols was obtained during the fattening period. The seventy-six VNOs from these pigs were stained in haematoxylin-eosin for histological examinations. VNSE inflammation was classified considering its intensity. Skin lesions data were compared to vomeronasalitis. There were 34% of pigs that showed unilateral VNSE inflammation, while 66% were bilaterally affected. The mean +/- SD number of skin lesions/animal was 4.4 +/- 2.82, and 34% of pigs scored 1 (moderately wounded animals) at least once during the fattening period. Statistical analysis showed an association between bilateral vomeronasalitis and skin lesion score (p < 0.05) and between bilateral moderate vomeronasalitis and skin lesions number (p < 0.01). This is the first report linking vomeronasalitis to social life in farm animals. Considering the role of social life in animal welfare, our data opens a research field linking pathology to animal behaviour.

AB  - The aims of this study were 1) to investigate the effect of MTNR1A gene polymorphisms on reproductive performance in ewes of one Italian and two Slovenian dairy sheep breeds (Sarda, Istrian Premenka and Boska, respectively) which were located at different latitudes, and 2) to highlight if the different season of the male placement with females that was utilized in the different breeding systems in Sardinia (Italy) and Slovenia resulted in different effects of these polymorphisms on reproductive functions. Reproductively mature ewes (n = 100) from each breed were utilized to conduct the study. To evaluate the reproductive efficiency, lambing dates and number of lambs born were recorded per ewe; additionally, the duration in days from ram placement with ewes to lambing (DRPEL), litter size and the fertility rate were determined based on lambing dates. In each breed, there were eight nucleotide variations within the MTNR1A gene exon II, two of which (g.17355358 and g.17355171), respectively, resulted in a valine to isoleucine, and alanine to aspartic acid substitution, in amino acid sequence. The SNPs at position g.17355452 and g.17355458 were determined to have effects on reproductive performance. Genotypes C/C and C/T at g.17355452 in Bovska and Sarda and genotype A/A at g.17355458 in Istrian Pramenka were associated with a greater fertility and a lesser duration in days from ram placement with ewes to lambing. These findings confirmed that the nucleotide sequences of the MTNR1A gene could affect reproductive functions of Mediterranean sheep.

AB  - Boar sperm is highly susceptible to cold damage. When temperature drops to 5 degrees C, the plasmatic membrane is destabilized. The freezing process causes a reduction of the fertility window because frozen/thawed boar sperm has less survivability. The aim of this work was to analyze the effect on sperm characteristics and response to capacitation stimuli of cooling to 5 degrees C using a controlled protocol. Also, we evaluated if the addition of Glycerol 2% or 3% at 5 degrees C was able to modify these parameters. For this purpose, we assessed motility, plasmatic membrane integrity and acrosomal membrane status. Capacitation was induced using Tyrode<acute accent>s capacitating medium (TCM) and assessed by chlortetracycline stain and induction of acrosomal reaction with Progesterone. Motility patterns were analyzed using a CASA system. These tests were performed at three different points of the freezing curve: 37 degrees C; 17 degrees C and 5 degrees C. Response to TCM vs TBM was only significant at 37 degrees C. While at 37 degrees C and 17 degrees C capacitated sperm was below 20%, at 5 degrees C reached 50% both in the TBM and TCM. CASA analysis showed that spermatozoa exposed to TCM had higher LIN and WOB than those in TBM. All parameters were similar in the Glycerol concentrations studied. These results suggest that the chilling process may be causing an effect similar to cryocapacitation along the cooling curve, starting subtle at 17 degrees C and reaching 50% of the sperm population at 5 degrees C, being independent of Glycerol concentration.

AB  - Simple Summary Enterocytozoon bieneusi is a fungus-like protist that is distributed worldwide and can cause malabsorption and diarrhea in sheep, other animals, and humans, threatening the development of animal husbandry and public health. However, little is known of the prevalence and genotypes of E. bieneusi in sheep in Shanxi Province, North China. Thus, 492 fecal samples were collected from sheep in three representative counties in northern, central, and southern Shanxi Province, and nested PCR amplification targeting the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the rRNA gene was carried out to detect the prevalence and identify the genotypes of E. bieneusi. The overall E. bieneusi prevalence in the examined sheep in Shanxi Province was 34.2% (168/492). Four known genotypes (BEB6, COS-I, CHS7, and CHC8) and one novel genotype (SY-1) were detected, and the prevalent genotype was BEB6. The five genotypes observed in this study belong to the host-adapted Group 2. This is the first report on the occurrence and genotypes of E. bieneusi in sheep in Shanxi Province, which enhances an understanding of the global distribution and genetic diversity of E. bieneusi and has implications for the better control of E. bieneusi in animals and humans. Enterocytozoon bieneusi is a fungus-like protist that can cause malabsorption and diarrhea in sheep, other animals, and humans, threatening the development of animal husbandry and public health. To date, there are no data about the prevalence and genotypes of E. bieneusi in sheep in Shanxi Province, North China. In this study, 492 fecal samples were collected from sheep in three representative counties in northern, central, and southern Shanxi Province. Nested PCR amplification was performed to detect the prevalence and identify the genotypes of E. bieneusi based on the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the rRNA gene. Overall, 168 of 492 examined samples were E. bieneusi-positive, with a prevalence of 34.2% (168/492). Significant differences in the prevalence of E. bieneusi were observed among the three sampled regions (chi 2 = 95.859, df = 2, p < 0.001), but the differences in E. bieneusi prevalence were not statistically significant between different genders and age groups (p > 0.05). Sequence analysis showed that four known genotypes (BEB6, COS-I, CHS7, and CHC8) and one novel genotype (named SY-1) were identified. BEB6 was the prevalent genotype found within the three counties. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the five genotypes observed in this study belong to Group 2. The present study reported the presence and genotypes of E. bieneusi infection in sheep in Shanxi Province for the first time, which enriches the knowledge of the genetic diversity of E. bieneusi and provides baseline data for the prevention and control of E. bieneusi infection in animals and humans.

AB  - Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and dibutyl phthalate (DBP) exist extensively in the environment, and they are easy to form compound pollution through pi-pi interactions in the environment. We investigate whether DBP, an environmental hormone disruptor, mediated by CNTs can more easily cross the blood-brain barrier, and whether DBP entering the brain has neurotoxic effects on the cells in the brain. Experimental subjects were 40 male Kunming (KM) mice randomly divided into 4 groups: the control group; the MWCNTs group; the DBP group; and the MWCNTs+DBP group. The mice were exposed via tail intravenous injection once every 3 days for 21 days, following which toxicology studies were carried out. The results of behavioral experiments showed that the mice in the com-bined exposure group (MWCNTs+DBP) exhibited spatial learning and memory impairment, and anxiety-like behav-ior. Staining of hippocampal sections of mouse brain tissue showed that, in the CA1, CA2, and DG areas, the number of neurons decreased, the nucleus was pyknotic, the cell body was atrophied, and levels of the microglia marker Iba-1 increased. By proteomic KEGG analysis, we found that the DEPs were mainly those related to neurodegenerative dis-eases. Immunohistochemistry in the hippocampus indicated that the level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the DG region was significantly increased. RT-PCR results revealed that the expression levels of P53, caspase3, and Bax genes related to apoptosis were up-regulated. The experimental results demonstrated that the mechanism of the combined-exposure injury to neurons in the hippocampus of mice may be that MWCNTs with adsorbed DBP can induce the release of BDNF, accelerate the apoptosis of neurons, and reduce the number of nerve cells, which activates microglia, causing neuroinflammation and nervous system toxicity.

AB  - This study evaluated the effect of zero-valent iron nanoparticles (NZVI) on the anaerobic digestion of swine manure. A wide range of doses of NZVI was evaluated (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50, and 100 mgFe degrees/gVS). The maximum methane yield of 0.4506 L/gVSremoved was obtained with the concentration of 10 mgFe degrees/gVS representing an increase of 58.99% than the control system with 0.2834 L/gVSremoved, indicating that Fe degrees improves the methanogenic activity. However, when using doses greater than 20 mgFe degrees/gVS, there were decreases in the methane yield of 34.4-47.98%. Also, to observe the effect of NZVI in anaerobes was evaluated the activity in the electron transport system (ETS), where the control reactor showed an activity of 31.91 mu g INTred/gVS center dot h, while in reactors with NZVI showed values of 39.48 mu g INTred/gVS center dot h (10 Fe degrees mg/gVS), observing a stimulation of Fe degrees in microbial activity. However, the dose of 100 mgFe degrees/gVS showed the greatest decrease in methane yield (0.1474 L/gVSremoved) and a reduction in ETS was observed by 8.5% compared to the control. The effect on the composition of the volatile fatty acids was observed, where the control system obtained a maximum production of acetic acid of 639 mg/L, which was exceeded with the dose of 10 mg Fe degrees/gVS by 215% and a decrease of 41.15% with the inhibitory concentration of 100 mg Fe degrees/gVS. As a result, higher doses of NZVI affect the metabolic activity of anaerobes as well as the acetoclastic pathway causing a decrease in the methane production.

AB  - It is by now well known that the physical living environment has a major impact on people's life, but the neural structures involved in this relationship remain to be explored. Most studies investigating this relationship only focus on single environmental predictors. In order to understand how the multitude of factors constituting the living environment relate to brain structure we used data from the UK Biobank (n = 21,094; age Mean = 63.35 years; SD = 7.46; range = 45-82) to examine how individuals' immediate characteristics around the home address (e.g., green space; air pollution in the neighborhood) are associated with hippocampal volume, a brain region known to be highly plastic. We accounted for common demographic factors that have been shown to be associated with brain structure and known factors such as sex, income, education, and age. We made use of an analytical paradigm based on the feature importance estimation and recursive feature elimination with decision tree ensembles as well as linear regression analysis. Results identified a subset of environmental measures (e.g., pollution, green space, noise) most strongly associated with hippocampal volume across adulthood. Findings highlight the importance of the environment for individuals' brain structure.

AB  - Candelilla wax (CW) oleogels were developed as an alternative bolus material for delivering phosphorus into the rumen of goats. The systems were studied at three CW concentrations (10%, 15% and 20%) in vegetable oil. Each oleogel was added with a specific amount of calcium orthophosphate as a phosphorus source. The thermomechanical properties of the oleogels were characterized by DSC and rheology, and the viability of phosphorus delivery was evaluated using a laboratory model in two mediums (one aqueous and another with ruminal fluid). The results showed that the oleogels had a higher melting point (similar to 52.8 degrees C) than the temperature of the ruminal environment and greater G' values (1.6 x 10(6) Pa in 20% CW oleogel with phosphorus). Such characteristics guaranteed the integrity of the materials during the process in the model systems studied. It was demonstrated that when using the 20% CW oleogel, the phosphorus was slowly released for 84 h, completing a maximum of 83.3-98% of the total amount of phosphorus added to the bolus (in the aqueous and ruminal fluid models, respectively). These results enable us to propose this material as a delivery system for phosphorus supplementation in goats. Its effectivity in goats will be evaluated in future in vivo investigations.

AB  - The aim of the study is to assess the lacrimal gland tear production, using the Schirmer Tear Test (STT), in healthy sheep under general anesthesia and to explore the effects of applying 1% hyaluronic acid ophthalmic gel during general anesthesia. While STT values during anesthesia have been well documented in small animals such as cats and dogs, there seems to be a lack of information available for ruminants like sheep. This gap in the literature highlights the need for further research and exploration into tear production in sheep under anesthesia. The experimental research conducted on twelve adults female sheep provided valuable insights into tear production under anesthesia. By assessing tear production at various key time points the study was able to capture the changes in tear production throughout anesthesia and revealed a significant decrease in Schirmer Tear Test values in all sheep, following general anesthesia. The results showed that closing and taping the eye yielded determined better outcomes compared to administering a 1% lubricant ophthalmic gel. This finding suggests that eye care during anesthesia can impact tear production in sheep.

AB  - This paper describes the results of a systematic sensitivity analysis for silver diffusional release from Tristructural Isotropic (TRISO) fuel particles in the AGR-1 base irradiation test and high temperature safety test database. The BISON code was used to model the diffusional release of silver through the coated particle for a wide range of the irradiation and the high temperature conditions conducted in the AGR-1 tests. The current BISON results agree well with other computations and measurements. We then conducted the systematic sensitivity analysis to identify the impact of Ag diffusion coefficient in the TRISO layer materials on the prediction of Ag release. Sobol indices were computed to indicate the contribution of each input, and the scatter plots were analyzed to investigate the correlations between diffusivity parameters and predicted Ag release. Informed by the Sobol sensitivity analysis, a calibrated set of diffusion coefficients were obtained which gave better predictions. The result of this best-estimate calibration indicates a Ag diffusion pre-factor in the SiC from 3.85 x10(-10) to 3.19 x10(-9) m(2)/s and Ag activation energy in SiC between 178 and 185 kJ/mole. The outputs are expected to provide the systematic approach for better understanding of Ag transport inside TRISO particle. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Simple Summary
   The bacteria that contaminate meat after the death of the animal can come from multiple sources, such as the animal itself, the external environment and the operator who handles it. The prompt refrigeration of hunted game is generally considered an important step to prevent spoilage and meat alterations, although many logistic hindrances, such as animal weight and distance from the hunting area to the refrigerators, limit the meticulous adoption of the best procedures. We show that the bacterial population of wild boar carcasses is not correlated to the mere time from shot to refrigeration but is correlated to the refrigeration time from chilling to analysis. The results of our study revealed a correlation between the time from shot to analysis and from refrigeration to analysis but a lack of correlation between the time from shot to refrigeration.
   The immediate refrigeration of meat after slaughter is a key issue for the proper storage and aging of meat. The industry standard cold chain relies on low temperatures and ventilation to lower the internal carcass temperature to 0-4 degrees C within the first 48 h, i.e., within four times the so-called semi-cooling time. On the other hand, for games, once bled and eviscerated, the carcass must be sent to a point where it can be sectioned or kept on air for maturation at refrigeration temperature. The precautions to observe are few and simple but essential: protect the meat and start the cooling process quickly. After preparing the animal (bleeding and evisceration), it may be necessary to face a period of transport that is sometimes long and not very easy; while small animals can be easily transported in a backpack, larger ones must necessarily be carried by several people or sometimes dragged to the vehicle capable of transporting them. It is obvious that a wild boar opened from the jaws to the pelvis and dragged for hundreds of meters will tend to be contaminated, although these contaminations are to be considered secondary for the preservation of the meat, compared to contamination by the intestinal contents. In an attempt to investigate the effect of delayed refrigeration on wild boar carcass contamination, the aim of this work was to determine a correlation between several hunting and logistic parameters (age, sex, animal weight, shooting distance, number of shots, weather and temperature and time from shot to refrigeration and to analysis) and bacterial contamination of the carcass. The correlation coefficient, r, was found to be 0.038 for the eviscerated body weight (p < 0.05), 0.091 for the external temperature on the day of hunting (p < 0.05), 0.027 for the time from shot to refrigeration (p = 0.081), 0.038 for the time from refrigeration to analysis (p < 0.05) and 0.043 for the time from shot to analysis (p < 0.05). These results stand for a negative correlation between the bacterial population and eviscerated carcass weight and between the bacterial population and external temperature and for a positive correlation between the time from shot to analysis and from refrigeration to analysis. No association was demonstrated between the bacterial population and the time from shot to refrigeration.

AB  - Pigs are especially vulnerable to intestinal pathogens and dysbiosis in the first two weeks after weaning. Infection with enterotoxigenic strains of Escherichia coli (ETEC) in combination with poor nutrition and hygiene can lead to diarrhea, poor growth and increased mortality. While neomycin and zinc oxide can prevent post-weaning diarrhea (PWD), their broad-spectrum activity also kills commensal microbiota and can lead to the emergence of heavy metal and antimicrobial resistance. Bromelain prevents attachment of F4 ETEC to intestinal enterocytes by cleaving the host receptor. In controlled environmental facilities, weaned pigs treated with either therapeutic levels of neomycin sulfate, zinc oxide, bromelain or non-treated were monitored for diarrhea, weight gain, feed intake, feed efficiency, excretion of F4 ETEC, changes to their intestinal microbiomes and antimicrobial resistance in E. coli. The treatment effects were evaluated at weaning, during two weeks of treatment and for three weeks after treatments ceased. Minimal clinical signs of PWD were observed, except in zinc-treated pigs post treatment. Intestinal dysbiosis was observed in response to diarrhea and in pigs treated with both neomycin and zinc. Antimicrobial resistance increased in commensal E. coli isolated from neomycin- and zinc-treated pigs. In contrast, bromelain controlled PWD and prevented intestinal dysbiosis without inducing antimicrobial resistance.

AB  - The galling insects, host plants and all gall-interacting organisms may depend on environmental conditions and stochasticity to establish and maintain their life cycles and trophic interactions. The micromoth Palaeomystella oligophaga (Lepidoptera: Momphidae) induces galls on Macairea radula (Melastomataceae) and its populations suffer mortality caused by direct and indirect negative interactions. Herein, we hypothesized that (i) the occurrence of galls should be greater during the dry period, when arthropods may depend more on microhabitats during the larval stage. However, (ii) P. oligophaga can face different kinds and frequencies of enemies during different cycles of the year. In addition, (iii) stochastic events such as fire may reduce the occurrence of natural enemies and thus increase the galling insects frequency. We quantified the galling insect survival rates, the proportion and kinds of natural enemies for 16 months (February 2017 - May 2018), detecting two life cycles of these gall-inducing insects by year. We analyzed galls in these 2 cycles and 1 cycle in the second year after a fire event. We confirmed the bivoltine cycle of P. oligophaga, with more galls induced during the first cycle (Feb - May) but with a higher frequency during the second cycle (Aug-Oct), following the post-fire period (Feb - May). The survival rates of P. oligophaga were higher during the post-fire cycle compared to the same period of the previous year, but lower than during the second. The enemies were more abundant during the first cycle. The bivoltine life cycle may constitute a strategy for P. oligophaga to use the galls during different periods of the year because the maturation and emergence of adults depend on the fluctuation of the occurrence of enemies, which varies according to abiotic conditions. Furthermore, this strategy offers shelter and food resources to all other organisms whose life cycles are synchronized with the availability of this microhabitat.

AB  - In the climate change scenario, studying greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions and measures of mitigation in the Caatinga biome are strategic and may provide a basis for mitigation plans. This study aimed to evaluate the soil CO2, CH4 and N2O fluxes, as well as determining an annual baseline for GHG emissions, in a reference site of silvopastoral production system in the Brazilian semiarid region, in order to provide subsidies for future studies on GHG emissions mitigation. The GHG fluxes were monitored over one year, in a buffel grass pasture and in grazed and native Caatinga areas, which are components of a long-term silvopastoral system. The CO2 fluxes ranged from-19.98 to 179.12 mg m(-2) h(-1) of CO2-C, CH4 fluxes from-76.21 to 113.87 mu g m(-2) h(-1) of CH4-C, N2O fluxes from-1,043.12 to 471.37 mu g m-2 h(-1) of N2O-N and the soil moisture was the main factor limiting the GHG fluxes. The total emissions converted to CO2-equivalent in the anthropized areas were lower than in the native area (65 % for the buffel grass pasture and 741 % for the grazed Caatinga). Therefore, it is possible to affirm that the GHG soil emissions from grazed areas in the Caatinga biome are not as high as in the native Caatinga, what is an important indication of the environmental sustainability of the evaluated silvopastoral system.

AB  - The development of mammalian skeletal muscle is a highly complex process involving multiple molecular interactions. As a prevalent RNA modification, N6-methyladenosine (m(6)A) regulates the expression of target genes to affect mammalian development. Nevertheless, it remains unclear how m(6)A participates in the development of goat muscle. In this study, methyltransferase 3 (METTL3) was significantly enriched in goat longissimus dorsi (LD) tissue. In addition, the global m(6)A modification level and differentiation of skeletal muscle satellite cells (MuSCs) were regulated by METTL3. By performing mRNA-seq analysis, 8050 candidate genes exhibited significant changes in expression level after the knockdown of METTL3 in MuSCs. Additionally, methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-seq) illustrated that myocyte enhancer factor 2c (MEF2C) mRNA contained m(6)A modification. Further experiments demonstrated that METTL3 enhanced the differentiation of MuSCs by upregulating m6A levels and expression of MEF2C. Moreover, the m(6)A reader YTH N6-methyladenosine RNA binding protein C1 (YTHDC1) was bound and stabilized to MEF2C mRNA. The present study reveals that METTL3 enhances myogenic differentiation in MuSCs by regulating MEF2C and provides evidence of a post-transcriptional mechanism in the development of goat skeletal muscle.

AB  - Maintaining healthy skeletal tissue is essential for overall well-being and quality of life. Skeletal muscle plays a key role in this process, yet models for studying its detailed function are limited. While RNA-binding motif protein 20 (RBM20) is primarily associated with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), its role in skeletal muscle remains largely unexplored. This study investigates RBM20 function in skeletal muscle using an RBM20 exon 9 deletion pig model (RBM20E9D). The deletion of exon 9 resulted in loosely arranged muscle fibers, large interfiber gaps, and irregular organization, leading to impaired muscle growth and development. Analysis of skeletal muscle satellite cells revealed significantly reduced proliferation, diminished myotube formation in vitro, and disrupted sarcomere structure due to exon 9 deletion. Given the critical role of satellite cell proliferation and differentiation in muscle repair, RBM20E9D pigs offer a novel model for studying the mechanisms underlying skeletal muscle injury, repair, and growth.

AB  - Migratory herbivores often time spring migration to coincide with the green-up of plants. When the timing of green-up changes across years, herbivores can respond directly and be plastic to changing conditions or populations may adapt via inherent differences among individuals that may allow for an evolutionary response. We quantified plasticity and individual variation in the timing of spring migration and selection for high-quality forage as a function of the timing of spring green-up using behavioural reaction norms for three North American ungulate species. The timing of arrival to summer range (but not departure from winter range) was plastic to the timing of green-up, and both arrival and departure timing were repeatable. Our results suggest that herbivores synchronise migration with the timing of green-up by adjusting the pace of migration and may be buffered against change via individual differences. Quantifying plasticity and differences in responses represents a crucial step to elucidating the fate of species in a changing world.

AB  - This paper reports the discovery of a new mammalian assemblage at Mocun cave in 2000 by the Natural History Museum of Guangxi. The Mocun site is located in a residual karst peak in southwest Guangxi, south China. Abundant mammalian fossil teeth and bones were extracted from relatively thick deposits, well constrained stratigraphically. The results show that 1) the Mocun fauna is composed of typical species of the "Ailuropoda-Stegodon association", including Stegodon, Ailuropoda, Rhinoceros, Pongo, Tapirus, Megatapirus, and Elephas, common in the Middle to the Late Pleistocene, with a larger portion of modern species; 2) By employing U-series dating (MC-ICP-MS) method on both the soda straw stalactites and mammalian teeth collected from deposits, the age of the Mocun fauna has been constrained between 66 and 101 ka, a transitional period from the interglacial stage MIS5 to the beginning of the last glacial stage (MIS4), representing one of the securely dated Late Pleistocene sites in southern China so far; 3) The composition in large mammals suggests a forested environment which harboured a great biodiversity in large species; 4) The taphonomic analysis indicates that the fossil accumulation is mainly due to activities of porcupines and to water flows; 5) Interestingly, our taxonomic study reveals some changes in the occurrence of Tapirus sinensis and Megatapirus augustus between similar to 66 and similar to 86 Ka, along with a change in the abundance of artiodactyls versus primates. It remains to demonstrate with more comprehensive records if these changes may be related to the mid-Late Pleistocene climatic transition. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - 1. The ability of marine mammals to accumulate sufficient lipid energy reserves is vital for mammals' survival and successful reproduction. However, long-term monitoring of at-sea changes in body condition, specifically lipid stores, has only been possible in elephant seals performing prolonged drift dives (low-density lipids alter the rates of depth change while drifting). This approach has limited applicability to other species.
   2. Using hydrodynamic performance analysis during transit glides, we developed and validated a novel satellite-linked data logger that calculates real-time changes in body density (proportional to lipid stores). As gliding is ubiquitous amongst divers, the system can assess body condition in a broad array of diving animals. The tag processes high sampling rate depth and three-axis acceleration data to identify 5 s high pitch angle glide segments at depths >100 m. Body density is estimated for each glide using gliding speed and pitch to quantify drag versus buoyancy forces acting on the gliding animal.
   3. We used tag data from 24 elephant seals (Mirounga spp.) to validate the onboard calculation of body density relative to drift rate. The new tags relayed body density estimates over 200 days and documented lipid store accumulation during migration with good correspondence between changes in body density and drift rate. Our study provided updated drag coefficient values for gliding (C-d,C-f = 0.03) and drifting (C-d,C-s = 0.12) elephant seals, both substantially lower than previous estimates. We also demonstrated post-hoc estimation of the gliding drag coefficient and body density using transmitted data, which is especially useful when drag parameters cannot be estimated with sufficient accuracy before tag deployment.
   4. Our method has the potential to advance the field of marine biology by switching the research paradigm from indirectly inferring animal body condition from foraging effort to directly measuring changes in body condition relative to foraging effort, habitat, ecological factors and anthropogenic stressors in the changing oceans. Expanding the method to account for diving air volumes will expand the system's applicability to shallower-diving (<100 m) species, facilitating real-time monitoring of body condition in a broad range of breath-hold divers.

AB  - This study explored the impact of licorice stem and leaf forage in the diet of meat sheep on their growth performance, physiological parameters, immunity, and gut microbiota. Conducted in the Hotan region of Xinjiang, the experiment involved 40 healthy local Hotan sheep (5-6 months old) that were randomly assigned to four groups, with both corn stalks and corn grain partially substituted at varying levels (30%, 40%, and 50%) by licorice stems and leaves for 80 days. Daily feed intake and refusal were recorded to assess feeding behavior and efficiency, while body weight was measured every 20 days to monitor growth performance. On day 80, blood samples were collected via venipuncture for biochemical and immune function analysis, followed by slaughter to obtain meat samples for quality assessment. Results showed that dietary licorice supplementation significantly improved growth performance. Sheep in the 40% replacement group had the highest final body weight and average daily gain (p < 0.05), indicating better feed efficiency. These findings suggest that replacing corn stalks and grain with licorice stems and leaves at a 40% ratio can significantly improve growth performance. Biochemical results showed improved protein metabolism and lipid profiles, with increased TP and ALB and decreased TC and TG levels. Immune indicators, including IgG, IgM, IgA, and IL-6, were also elevated in licorice-fed groups. In summary, licorice stems and leaves demonstrated clear nutritional and immunological benefits, especially at the 40% inclusion level. Gut microbiota analysis showed that licorice stems and leaves increased the relative abundance of Firmicutes while reducing Bacteroidota. At the genus level, UCG_005 and Bacteroides increased with higher licorice concentrations, whereas Treponema decreased. Pearson correlation analysis indicated that UCG_005 was positively correlated with TP, ALB, IgM, and IL-6 and negatively correlated with TG and TNF-alpha. These findings suggest that using licorice stems and leaves as a replacement for both corn stalks and corn grain modulates gut microbiota composition and is closely associated with immune and biochemical responses in sheep.

AB  - Rhinopristioid rays are among the most globally threatened cartilaginous fishes, almost all of which are Critically Endangered. Fishery pressure and lack of knowledge, especially where these elasmobranch fish overlap their habitats off developing countries in the Indo-West Pacific, impede their biological conservation which in turns result in unnoticed population depletion. Rhino rays are an important component of the Bangladeshi artisanal fishery; however, an understanding of these fisheries and their trade is limited. Fishers and traders were interviewed between June 2018 and June 2019 in four areas of southeast Bangladesh to characterize rhino ray fishing, trade and fishers' perception of population trends. All interviewed fishers reported life-long rhino ray catch in sizable numbers and noted a steep decline in the catch over time, especially for Rhynchobatus spp. Seven species were documented- not only targeted by un-baited longlines but also by-caught in gillnets and set-bag nets. Unregulated and undocumented catch fuelled by substantial international trade to Myanmar on highquality skin, meat and fins; and national usages of meat, liver, cartilages and intestines. Between 9000 and 33000 kg (avg. 23000 kg) of rhino rays were bought annually by each trader during 2015-2018. Southcentral shallow-water char (sand island) areas are perceived as essential habitats, hence providing important fishing grounds. The predominant threats are overexploitation by unselective gear use, bottom trawling, target catch, international trade and source of protein and income. Compliance with international trade control treaties or the Bangladeshi law was low, with most fishers (78%) unaware of specific regulation regarding rhino rays. It is crucial to adopt precautionary principles to prevent further rhino ray population declines. We propose a combination of actions rooted in sustainability and inclusiveness in this regard; e.g. a) trade mitigation, monitoring and enforcement, b) need for sustainable fisheries management regimes, c) need for habitat protection; finally, d) the importance of fishers' inclusiveness in conservation decision making.

AB  - The chemical arms race between plants and insects is foundational to the generation and maintenance of biological diversity. We asked how the evolution of a novel defensive compound in an already well-defended plant lineage impacts interactions with diverse herbivores. Erysimum cheiranthoides (Brassicaceae), which produces both ancestral glucosinolates and novel cardiac glycosides, served as a model. We analyzed gene expression to identify cardiac glycoside biosynthetic enzymes in E. cheiranthoides and characterized these enzymes via heterologous expression and CRISPR/Cas9 knockout. Using E. cheiranthoides cardiac glycoside-deficient lines, we conducted insect experiments in both the laboratory and field. EcCYP87A126 initiates cardiac glycoside biosynthesis via sterol side-chain cleavage, and EcCYP716A418 has a role in cardiac glycoside hydroxylation. In EcCYP87A126 knockout lines, cardiac glycoside production was eliminated. Laboratory experiments with these lines revealed that cardiac glycosides were highly effective defenses against two species of glucosinolate-tolerant specialist herbivores, but did not protect against all crucifer-feeding specialist herbivores in the field. Cardiac glycosides had lesser to no effect on two broad generalist herbivores. These results begin elucidation of the E. cheiranthoides cardiac glycoside biosynthetic pathway and demonstrate in vivo that cardiac glycoside production allows Erysimum to escape from some, but not all, specialist herbivores.

AB  - Silicon (Si) enhances rice resistance to various insect herbivores. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Whereas the salicylic acid (SA) signaling pathway plays a vital role in plant defense responses to sucking insects, its role in Si-enhanced rice resistance has not been investigated. Si transporter mutant OsLsi1 and mutants with antisense expression of ICS (as-ics) and NPR1 (as-npr1) in the SA pathway and their corresponding wild types (WT) were treated with and without Si to determine Si effects on rice resistance to brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens (Stal), as well as on SA accumulation, defense-related enzyme activity and gene expression. Si application significantly affected host preference of BPH, significantly reduced honeydew secretion and inhibited oviposition and hatch rate. Upon BPH infestation, SA content, transcript levels of BPH3, ICS1 and PAL4, and activities of POD, SOD, PPO and PAL were significantly higher in Si-treated than untreated plants. The defense responses were also faster. However, OsLsi1 mutant plants displayed higher susceptibility to BPH and minimal defense responses. Furthermore, simultaneous application of SA and Si in WT plants showed the highest resistance to BPH, but had no obvious effect on OsLsi1, antisense as-ics and as-npr1 plants. Our results suggest that Si enhances rice defense against the sucking insect BPH by defense priming and the Si-mediated priming involves SA signaling pathway.

AB  - Stress exposure has been shown to induce a variety of molecular and functional alterations associated with anxiety and depression. Some studies suggest that microglia, the immune cells of the brain, play a significant role in determining neuronal and behavioral responses to chronic stress and also contribute to the development of stress-related psychopathologies. However, little is known about the impact of the duration of stress exposure upon microglia and neurons morphology, particularly considering sex differences. This issue deserves particular investigation, considering that the process of morphologic remodeling of neurons and microglia is usually accompanied by functional changes with behavioral expression. Here, we examine the effects of short and long unpredictable chronic mild stress (uCMS) protocols on behavior, evaluating in parallel microglia and neurons morphology in the dorsal hippocampus (dHIP) and in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), two brain regions involved in the etiology of depression. We report that long-term uCMS induced more behavioral alterations in males, which present anxiety and depression-like phenotypes (anhedonia and helplessness behavior), while females only display anxiety-like behavior. After short-term uCMS, both sexes presented anxiety-like behavior. Microglia cells undergo a process of morphologic adaptation to short-term uCMS, dependent on sex, in the NAc: we observed a hypertrophy in males and an atrophy in females, transient effects that do not persist after long-term uCMS. In the dHIP, the morphologic adaptation of microglia is only observed in females (hypertrophy) and after the protocol of long uCMS. Interestingly, males are more vulnerable to neuronal morphological alterations in a region-specific manner: dendritic atrophy in granule neurons of the dHIP and hypertrophy in the medium spiny neurons of the NAc, both after short- or long-term uCMS. The morphology of neurons in these brain regions were not affected in females. These findings raise the possibility that, by differentially affecting neurons and microglia in dHIP and NAc, chronic stress may contribute for differences in the clinical presentation of stress-related disorders under the control of sex-specific mechanisms.

AB  - Wide-scale emergence of glyphosate-resistant weeds has led to an increase in the simultaneous application of herbicide mixtures exacerbated by the introduction of crops tolerant to glyphosate plus dicamba or glyphosate plus 2,4-D. This raises serious concerns regarding the environmental and health risks resulting from increased exposure to a mixture of herbicide active ingredients. We evaluated hepatotoxic effects following perinatal exposure to glyphosate alone or in combination with 2,4-D and dicamba from gestational day-6 until adulthood in Wistar rats. Animals were administered with glyphosate at the European Union (EU) acceptable daily intake (ADI; 0.5 mg/kg bw/day) and no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL; 50 mg/kg bw/day). A mixture of glyphosate with 2,4-D (0.3 mg/kg bw/day) and dicamba (0.02 mg/kg bw/day) with each at their EU ADI was evaluated. Redox status was determined by measuring levels of reduced glutathione, decomposition rate of H2 Omicron 2, glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase, total antioxidant capacity, thiobarbituric reactive substances, and protein carbonyls. Gene expression analysis of Nr1d1, Nr1d2, Clec2g, Ier3, and Gadd45g associated with oxidative damage to DNA, was also performed. Analysis of liver samples showed that exposure to the mixture of the three herbicides induced a marked increase in the concentration of glutathione and malondialdehyde indicative of a disturbance in redox balance. Nevertheless, the effect of increased lipid peroxidation was not discernible following a 3-month recuperation period where animals were withdrawn from pesticide exposure post-weaning. Interestingly, toxic effects caused by prenatal exposure to the glyphosate NOAEL were present after the same 3 -month recovery period. No statistically significant changes in the expression of genes linked with genotoxicity were observed. Our findings reinforce the importance of assessing the combined effects of chemical pollutants at doses that are asserted by regulatory agencies to be safe individually.

AB  - Sub-nutrition during pregnancy might affect the offspring's reproductive performance through effects on the development and function of gonads. This study evaluated a maternal energy restriction in ewes from day 48-106 of gestation, on pre- and post-weaning female lambs` performance, onset of female lambs' breeding and ovulation rate during their first breeding season. Adult Polwarth ewes sired by Finnish rams bearing single or twin lambs were assigned to two dietary treatments from day 48 to day 106 of gestation: restricted (R; n = 60) at 60 % of their metabolizable energy (ME) requirements, or non-restricted (NR; n = 54) at 100 % of their ME requirements. After the restriction period, ewes grazed all together ad libitum until weaning. The ewe lambs were evaluated from birth to weaning, as well as during their first breeding season. Although NR ewes weighed 17.7 % more than R ewes (P < 0.05) at the end of the restriction period, the nutritional treatment of the dams had no effect on the weight of the ewe lambs at birth, weaning or final weight (P > 0.05). Fat depth, rib eye area, the percentage of ewe-lambs cycling and their ovulation rate during the first breeding season was not affected by the ewe ' s dietary treatment. Ewes restricted at 60 % of their ME requirements in mid-gestation seemed to have the capacity to compensate any detrimental effects on growth and development as well as the reproductive potential of female lambs if adequate refeeding conditions are provided in late gestation, throughout lactation and post-weaning.

AB  - Biochar undergoes significant transformations in soil as a result of chemical, physical, and biological processes. These alterations can impact its initial properties, influencing both its agronomic effectiveness and its capacity for carbon sequestration. Long-term observations of biochar-aging effects in soil are limited but highly relevant, as they provide a more realistic picture of the agronomic and societal benefits of biochar than short-term studies with relatively "fresh" biochar. This study aimed to describe the aging effects of biochar and their impact on a range of soil properties at a long-term biochar experiment in Bayreuth, Germany. For this purpose, soil and biochar samples were taken 13 years after application (two variants: 1. co-composted and 2. pristine biochar) and compared with a fresh variant in which the same unaged biochar was freshly mixed with the control soil. The soil quality parameters, pH and electrical conductivity, decreased significantly (p < 0.05) during biochar aging. Specifically, the pH dropped from 7.4 in freshly biochar-amended soil to 6.8 in the pristine aged biochar variant and 6.9 in the co-composted aged biochar variant. Electrical conductivity decreased from 217.0 <mu>S cm(-1) in the freshly amended soil to 81.1 mu S cm(-1) in the pristine aged variant and 87.6 mu S cm(-1) in the co-composted aged variant. Nitrogen retention was enhanced in the soil amended with co-composted aged biochar compared to the pristine aged biochar soil. Total nitrogen (TN) was higher at 1.94 g kg(-1) versus 1.57 g kg(-1) (p < 0.05), and ammonium-N (NH4+-N) was slightly elevated at 35.7 mg kg(-1) versus 33.0 mg kg(-1), although the difference was not statistically significant. The nitrate-N (NO3--N) content was significantly lower in all biochar-amended soil variants compared to the control soil. Total carbon (TC) levels decreased during biochar aging in all soil variants. However, the reduction was significantly lower in the co-composted aged biochar soil (25.0 g kg(-1)) compared to the pristine aged biochar soil (20.5 g kg(-1), p < 0.05). This study identified multiple aging effects on biochar following 13 years of exposure in loamy soil. Importantly, the results showed that compared to the amendment of pristine biochar, co-composting did not diminish the TC of the treated soil, and more N could be retained, 13 years after amendment. In fact, co-composting prior to soil application is recommended to fully realize the potential agronomic benefits.

AB  - Fluoride (F) can be absorbed from the environment and hyperaccumulate in leaves of Camellia sinensis without exhibiting any toxic symptoms. Fluoride exporter in C. sinensis (CsFEX) could transport F to extracellular environment to alleviate F accumulation and F toxicity, but its functional mechanism remains unclear. Here, combining with pH condition of C. sinensis growth, the characteristics of CsFEX and mechanism of F detoxification were further explored. The results showed that F accumulation was influenced by various pH, and pH 4.5 and 6.5 had a greater impact on the F accumulation of C. sinensis. Through Non-invasive Micro -test Technology (NMT) detection, it was found that F uptake/accumulation of C. sinensis and Arabidopsis thaliana might be affected by pH through changing the transmembrane electrochemical proton gradient of roots. Furthermore, diverse expression patterns of CsFEX were induced by F treatment under different pH, which was basically upregulated in response to high F accumulation, indicating that CsFEX was likely to participate in the process of F accumulation in C. sinensis and this process might be regulated by pH. Additionally, CsFEX functioned in the mitigation of F sensitivity and accumulation strengthened by lower pH in Escherichia coli and A. thaliana. Moreover, the changes of H+ flux and potential gradient caused by F were relieved as well in transgenic lines, also suggesting that CsFEX might play an important role in the process of F accumulation. Above all, F uptake/ accumulation were alleviated in E. coli and A. thaliana by CsFEX through exporting F-, especially at lower pH, implying that CsFEX might regulate F accumulation in C. sinensis.

AB  - Plant saponin extracts are currently of increasing importance for the environment and climate. Saponin extracts are used for the regeneration of soils contaminated by environmental pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Furthermore, as feed additives they may have the potential to reduce the release of the greenhouse gas methane in ruminants, or to reduce ammonia emissions in pigs and broilers. Quillaja extracts play a major role in emission reduction. Some commercially available Quillaja extracts have been adulterated by blending with an inexpensive Madhuca saponins extract. Since a quantitation has not been performed so far, the present work aims at the development of a quantitative method for the determination of the main ingredient Misaponin A of Madhuca. For this purpose, a semi-preparative HPLC method for the isolation of Mi-saponin A from mahua seed cake, which is the press residue of the seed kernels of Madhuca longifolia, was developed. Using 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and high resolution mass spectrometry, the identity was unambiguously confirmed and the purity was excellent. It was used as standard for quantitation of Mi-saponin A in various currently purchased commercially available Quillaja saponin extracts. The concentration of Mi-saponin A was between 1.68 and 2.65 % (w/w), which reveals that the blending of Quillaja saponin extracts with Madhuca is still relevant. Moreover, the developed method for the quantitation of Mi-saponin A is also suitable for lower concentration. Thus, Misaponin A was found at a concentration of 0.10 % (w/w) in Gypsophila saponin extracts, confirming that there was a contamination with this Madhuca saponin.

AB  - Introduction: Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) from hypertensive disease of pregnancy complicates up to 10% of all pregnancies. Significant hippocampal-dependent cognitive and memory impairments as well as neuropsychiatric disorders have been linked to IUGR. Because disturbance of the hippocampal critical period (CPd) of synaptic plasticity leads to impairments similar to those described in IUGR human offspring, we hypothesized that IUGR would perturb the CPd of synaptic plasticity in the mouse hippocampus in our model. Methods: IUGR was produced by a micro-osmotic pump infusion of the potent vasoconstrictor U-46619, a thromboxane A(2)-agonist, at embryonic day 12.5 in C57BL/6J mouse dams to precipitate hypertensive disease of pregnancy and IUGR. Sham-operated mice acted as controls. At P10, P18, and P40, we assessed astrogliosis using GFAP-IHC. In dorsal CA1 and CA3 subfields, we assessed the immunoreactivities (IR) (IF-IHC) to (i) parvalbumin (PV) and glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) 65/67, involved in CPd onset; (ii) PSA-NCAM that antagonizes CPd onset; (iii) NPTX2, necessary for excitatory synapse formation and engagement of CPd; and (iv) MBP and WFA, staining perineural nets (PNNs), marking CPd closure. ImageJ/Fiji and IMARIS were used for image processing and SPSS v24 for statistical analysis. Results: Although PV+ interneuron numbers and IR intensity were unchanged, development of GAD65/67(+) synaptic boutons was accelerated at P18 IUGR mice and inversely correlated with decreased expression of PSA-NCAM in the CA of P18 IUGR mice at P18. NPTX2(+) puncta and total volume were persistently decreased in the CA3 pyramidal and radiatum layers of IUGR mice from P18 to P40. At P40, axonal myelination (MBP+) in CA3 of IUGR mice was decreased and correlated with NPTX2 deficits. Lastly, the volume and integrity of the PNNs in the dorsal CA was disrupted in IUGR mice at P40. Discussion/Conclusion: IUGR disrupts the molecular and structural initiation, consolidation, and closure of the CPd of synaptic plasticity in the mouse hippocampus in our model, which may explain the learning and memory deficits observed in juvenile IUGR mice and the cognitive disorders seen in human IUGR offspring. The mechanistic links warrant further investigation, to identify therapeutic targets to prevent neurodevelopmental deficits in patients affected by IUGR.

AB  - Cestoda is a class of parasitic worms in the flatworm phylum (Platyhelminthes). Most of the species-and the best-known-are those in the subclass Eucestoda; they are ribbon-like worms as adults, known as tapeworms. The results reported that about 9.94% of selected sheep were infected with tape worms in native breed. Concerning the seasonal incidence of tape worms among sheep, the results revealed that the highest percentage was recorded during winter season (11.3%), while the lowest percentage was recorded during the spring (7.72%). The species of tape worms recorded were Moniezea expansa, Moniezea benedene, Avitellina centripunctata, Thysaniezia giardia and Stilesia hepatic. Molecular characterization of Al Taif Moniezia species coxl gene records four different species Me Taif1, Me Taif2, Me Taif3 and Me Taif4, that have identity ranged from 90 to 99% to species in Senegal and Ethiopia (Me13, Me14 and Me22). In vitro treatment of Monizia spp. with different concentrations (10, 20, 30 and 50 mu g/ml) of Spirulina platensis extract (Blue-green Algae) affects the morphological architecture of tape worms by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results revealed that Spirulina platensis extract treatment, especially for higher doses 30 and 50 mu g/ml, caused the sucker opening to narrow as a result of scolex swelling more than usual, deformation of the proglottids occurred with circular areas of declare swelling along their margins and microtriches covering the whole tegument appears in several directions. In conclusion, as per of our knowledge it is the first time to record new species of Moniezia species in Al Taif governorate and the anthelmintic potential of Spirulina platensis.

AB  - When some plants are defoliated, they may suffer by reaching a smaller final size than if they had not been damaged. Other plants may compensate for damage, ending up the same size as if they had not been damaged. Still, others may overcompensate, ending up larger after defoliation than if they had been spared from damage. We investigated the response of Senna species (Fabaceae) to defoliation, comparing two native and several ornamental congeners, all of which grow locally in southern Florida. Many Senna spp. bear foliar nectaries as nutritional resources for beneficial insects that may, in exchange, protect them from herbivores. We grew five species from seed and subjected them to three levels of defoliation for a period of several months to measure effects of leaf area removal on plant height, number of leaves, and number of extrafloral nectaries. Only three of five species displayed shorter plant heights with greater levels of damage. Two species produced fewer new leaves with moderate to severe defoliation. In only one species, the number of extrafloral nectaries decreased with defoliation, suggesting that while extrafloral nectar production may be an inducible defense in some species, producing more nectaries in response to damage does not occur in these Senna species.

AB  - Heavy metal contamination in agricultural soils presents serious environmental and health risks. This study assessed the bioaccumulation and spatial distribution of nickel, cadmium, zinc, lead, and copper within a sheep-based food chain in the Baia Mare region, Romania, which includes soil, green grass, sheep serum, and dairy products. Using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), we analyzed the concentrations of these metals and calculated bioconcentration factors (BCFs) to evaluate their transfer through trophic levels. Spatial analysis revealed that copper (up to 2528.20 mg/kg) and zinc (up to 1821.40 mg/kg) exceeded permissible limits, particularly near former mining sites. Elevated lead (807.59 mg/kg) and cadmium (2.94 mg/kg) were observed in industrial areas, while nickel and cobalt showed lower concentrations, but with localized peaks. Zinc was the most abundant metal in grass, while cadmium transferred efficiently to milk and cheese, raising potential health concerns. The results underscore the complex interplay between soil properties, contamination sources, and biological processes in heavy metal accumulation. These findings highlight the importance of continuous monitoring, risk assessment, and mitigation strategies to protect public health from potential exposure through contaminated dairy products.

AB  - Reactive oxygen species (ROS) exert an adverse effect on sperm quality during the freezing process. Gamma-oryzanol is an effective antioxidant and has the ability to inhibit lipoperoxidation in various cells. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the effect of gamma-oryzanol supplementation in extender on post-thawed motility and proteomic profiles of swamp buffalo spermatozoa. Each ejaculate of an individual bull was divided into four equal aliquots. Gamma-oryzanol was supplemented at 0 (control), 0.1, 0.25, and 0.5 mM in tris-citrate egg yolk extender. The parameters of sperm motility were evaluated using computer assisted semen analyzer (CASA). The results showed that the progressive motility was significantly higher in 0.5 mM of gamma-oryzanol supple-mentation group when compared with the control group (p < 0.05), but no significant differences were observed among the treatments. In addition, a proteomic approach was applied to analyze the differentially expressed proteins in post-thawed sperm with or without gamma-oryzanol supplementation in extender. We confirmed that 2-phospho-d-glycerate hydro-lyase (ENO1), glutathione s-transferase mu 1 (GSTM1), phospholipid hydroper-oxide glutathione peroxidase (GPX4), outer dense fiber protein 2 (ODF2), tektin-4 (TEKT4), tubulin beta-4B chain (TUBB4B), and ATP synthase subunit beta (ATP5B) were up-regulated in 0.5 mM of gamma-oryzanol supplementation group, which might be associated with the improved post-thawed motility observed in this treatment group. These results demonstrate the beneficial effect of gamma-oryzanol on post-thawed survival of swamp buffalo spermatozoa and help advance the understanding about molecular metabolism of sperm in this species.

AB  - Many pathogens of humans and livestock also infect wildlife that can act as a reservoir and challenge disease control or elimination. Efficient and effective prioritization of research and management actions requires an understanding of the potential for new tools to improve elimination probability with feasible deployment strategies that can be implemented at scale. Wildlife vaccination is gaining interest as a tool for managing several wildlife diseases. To evaluate the effect of vaccinating white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), in combination with harvest, in reducing and eliminating bovine tuberculosis from deer populations in Michigan, we developed a mechanistic age-structured disease transmission model for bovine tuberculosis with integrated disease management. We evaluated the impact of pulse vaccination across a range of vaccine properties. Pulse vaccination was effective for reducing disease prevalence rapidly with even low (30%) to moderate (60%) vaccine coverage of the susceptible and exposed deer population and was further improved when combined with increased harvest. The impact of increased harvest depended on the relative strength of transmission modes, i.e., direct vs indirect transmission. Vaccine coverage and efficacy were the most important vaccine properties for reducing and eliminating disease from the local population. By fitting the model to the core endemic area of bovine tuberculosis in Michigan, USA, we identified feasible integrated management strategies involving vaccination and increased harvest that reduced disease prevalence in free-ranging deer. Few scenarios led to disease elimination due to the chronic nature of bovine tuberculosis. A long-term commitment to regular vaccination campaigns, and further research on increasing vaccines efficacy and uptake rate in free-ranging deer are important for disease management.
   Many wildlife species act as reservoirs of bovine tuberculosis from which they can transmit to cattle and humans. In Michigan, bovine tuberculosis is endemic in white-tailed deer causing occasional spillovers to cattle. Here, with the help of a disease transmission model, we explored the use of wildlife vaccination in white-tailed deer to manage bovine tuberculosis in Michigan. We show that pulse vaccination effectively reduces disease prevalence, especially when combined with increased deer harvest. Key vaccine parameters for disease elimination are vaccine coverage and efficacy. While complete elimination is challenging, sustained vaccination and research to improve vaccine effectiveness are crucial for long-term disease management. Hence, this research informs integrated strategies to reduce bovine tuberculosis in deer populations.

AB  - Saltmarsh Sparrows (Ammospiza caudacuta), a tidal-marsh specialist, face severe population declines due to habitat loss, sea-level rise, and predation. While previous research suggests that predation pressure increases at the southern extent of the species' breeding range, data on local predator communities remain limited. To address this, we deployed game cameras at 16 Saltmarsh Sparrow nests across four salt marshes on Virginia's eastern shore, the southern-most extent of their breeding range. Our study provides camera-documented evidence of red fox (Vulpes vulpes) predation on Saltmarsh Sparrow nests. We detected a suspected predation event by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and four other potential nest predators. Additionally, we detected a Willet (Tringa semipalmata) aggressively displacing a nesting female, suggesting interspecific interactions may contribute to nest failure.

AB  - Uterine inflammation is a common pathology in animals, leading to disturbances in reproductive processes and reduced production profitability. Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP) effects at the uterine level during inflammation are not known. In the current study, we analyzed the relative PACAP type 1 receptor (PAC1R) mRNA transcript and protein abundances in the myometrium (MYO), as well s PACAP and PAC1R involvement in the contractile function of inflamed pig uterus. To that end, E. coli suspension (E. coli group) or saline (SAL group) was injected into the uterine horns or laparotomy was performed (CON group). Eight days after the bacteria injections, severe acute endometritis and a reduced relative abundance of PAC1R protein in the MYO were observed. Compared to the period before PACAP in vitro administration, PACAP (10(-7) M) in the CON and SAL groups decreased in amplitude in the MYO and endometrium (ENDO)/MYO, whereas in the E. coli group, increased amplitude in the MYO and reduced amplitude in the ENDO/MYO were observed. In the E. coli group, PACAP enhanced the amplitude in the MYO (10(-7) M) and decreased the amplitude in the ENDO/MYO (10(-8) M) compared with other groups. PACAP (10(-7) M) increased the frequency of both kinds of strips in the CON and SAL groups compared with the pretreatment period. PACAP (both doses) did not significantly change the frequency in the E. coli group, whereas in response to PACAP (10(-7) M), the frequency was reduced compared to other groups. In the MYO, PAC1R antagonist decreased the amplitude reduction (CON and SAL groups) and reversed a rise in PACAP (10(-7) M)-evoked amplitude (E. coli group). PAC1R blocking reversed (MYO) and abolished (ENDO/MYO) the stimulatory effect of PACAP (10(-7) M) on the frequency (CON and SAL groups). PAC1R antagonist and PACAP (10(-7) M) evoked the appearance of frequency depression in both kinds of strips (E. coli group). In summary, in pigs, severe acute endometritis reduces the relative abundance of PAC1R protein in the MYO, and PAC1R mediates the influence of PACAP on inflamed uterus contractility.

AB  - Camelina (Camelina sativa) is an emerging industrial oilseed crop because of its potential for double cropping, fallow year production, growth on marginal lands, and multiple uses of seed oils and meals. To realize the potential for sustainable production of camelina, a better understanding of how camelina seed oil production and composition respond to low input environments is desired. Phosphorus (P) is one of the least available essential macronutrients to plants with finite worldwide supply. This study investigated seed oil production and lipid composition of camelina in field settings and under greenhouse conditions in response to P deficiency. Lipidomic profiling reveals that P deficiency in field settings triggered extensive leaf lipid remodeling that decreased the ratio of phospholipids to non-P-containing galactolipids from 30% to 5% under P sufficient to deficient conditions. P deficiency increased seed oil content per seed weight by approximately 25% and 20% in field and greenhouse settings, respectively. In addition, P deficiency altered seed fatty acid composition, with increases in monounsaturated 18:1 and 20:1 and decreases in polyunsaturated 18:3. Total seed production was decreased by 10- to 15-fold under P deficiency and the decrease resulted from reduced seed numbers without affecting seed weight. The results from field and greenhouse conditions indicate that P deficiency increases seed oil content, alters fatty acid composition, and decreases greatly seed production, suggesting that achieving a high yield and quality of camelina seed oil is positively linked to P status of soil.

AB  - This article presents the results of research that focused on the nutrition and related health issues of medieval and early modern dogs found in the territory of present-day Lithuania. In this study, we present bone collagen carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) isotope ratios for seventy-five dogs recovered from seven sites which were dated back to the between the 12th and 18th C AD. In addition, by studying the remains of almost 200 dogs, we were able to estimate changes in the sizes and morphotypes of canines across over 600 years. On the basis of stable isotope and historical data, as well as the osteometric analysis, we discuss the dietary patterns of different sizes and types of dogs from the sites related to different social strata and time periods. The results of our study demonstrate that the size, type, diet, and health of canines from different time periods and sociocultural environments varied. Overall, carbon isotopic signals indicate that dogs' diets were based on C-3 plant environment foods (cereals and animals), while freshwater fish was more important for some individuals in coastal Klaip & edot;da/Memelburg Castle. The stable isotope analysis supported the historical records, indicating that cereals were highly important in the diet of elite dogs. Meanwhile, urban dogs had a different nutrition. In the Middle Ages, the consumption of plant-based foods was likely higher compared to the early modern period. Our study also revealed that the diets of dogs did not correlate with individual size. Compared to pigs, dogs had a higher intake of animal foods in their diet. In general, the nutrition of the studied canines was similar to that of the rural human population of the same period.

AB  - The hippocampus is critical for the precise formation of contextual memories. Overlapping inputs coming from the entorhinal cortex are processed by the trisynaptic pathway to form distinct memories. Disruption in any step of the circuit flow can lead to a lack of memory precision, and to memory interference. We have identified the transcriptional repressor Wilm's Tumor 1 (WT1) as an important regulator of synaptic plasticity involved in memory discrimination in the hippocampus. In male mice, using viral and transgenic approaches, we showed that WT1 deletion in granule cells of the dentate gyrus (DG) disrupts memory discrimination. With electrophysiological methods, we then identified changes in granule cells' excitability and DG synaptic transmission indicating that WT1 knockdown in DG granule cells disrupts the inhibitory feedforward input from mossy fibers to CA3 by decreasing mIPSCs and shifting the normal excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance in the DG -> CA3 circuit in favor of excitation. Finally, using a chemogenetic approach, we established a causal link between granule cell hyperexcitability and memory discrimination impairments. Our results suggest that WT1 enables a circuit-level computation that drives pattern discrimination behavior.

AB  - Plant-microorganism combined remediation of heavy metal pollution has been reported, but little attention has been paid to the effect of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi on phytoremediation of dioecious plants under heavy metal pollution. In this study, the growth, physiological responses and phytoremediation traits of Hippophae rhamnoides were determined to evaluate whether sex-specific ecophysiological responses and phytoremediation capacities of females and males are affected by additional AM fungi (Glomus mosseae) under heavy metal treatments. The results showed that excess Pb and Zn stresses inhibited photosynthetic capacities of both sexes. However, inoculated AM fungi treatment increased the activity of photosynthesis, content of photosynthetic pigment, activity of superoxide dismutase, the content of proline and root Pb content and enrichment coefficient of males while decreased root Pb content of females under Pb stress. On the other hand, inoculated AM fungi treatment increased the photosynthetic activities and Pro accumulation of females, and activity of superoxide dismutase and transport coefficient of males under Zn stress. These results demonstrate that H. rhamnoides inoculated AM fungi showed significant sex-specific responses on the growth, physiological traits and phytoremediation potential to Pb and Zn stress. AM fungi significantly improved the tolerance of males to Pb stress and both sexes to Zn stress, which indicates H. rhamnoides and AM fungi can be used as a plant-microbial combined remediation method for Pb and Zn contaminated soil. More attention should be paid on sexual-specific responses and phytoremediation of dioecious plants to heavy metals in the future.

AB  - Broiler houses are an important source of particulate matter (PM) in the Netherlands. High concentrations of PM can threaten the environment and pose health risks to humans and animals. To address these problems, the Dutch government aims to reduce PM10 emissions originating from broiler houses by 50% between 2020 and 2030. This paper explored broiler farmers' investment preferences for different PM10 abatement techniques and how they relate to socio-economic characteristics and perceived obstacles for business development. The results of our discrete choice experiment indicate that farmers were reluctant to invest in PM10 abatement techniques. When they did invest, they had a general preference for techniques with a medium to high (31-52%) rather than a very high PM10 reduction efficiency (80%). Social factors and perceived obstacles for business development explained heterogeneity in farmers' preferences for PM10 abatement techniques and their willingness to invest. When investing in abatement techniques, farmers attached a higher relative importance to an exemption from future PM10 legislation than to a subsidy. The findings imply that more policy-related certainty as well as financial compensation can incentivize farmers to invest in PM10 abatement.

AB  - Both warming and grazing already affect the reproductive phenology of alpine plants. However, their effects have mostly been studied in isolation, and their interaction is still unclear. In this study, an asymmetric warming (average + 1.2 & DEG;C during daytime and + 1.7 & DEG;C during nighttime and + 1.5 & DEG;C during summer and + 2.0 & DEG;C during winter) with moderate grazing experiment was conducted for four years to determine their individual and interactive effects on the onsets and durations of reproductive phenophases for fifteen alpine plant species on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Individual warming and grazing simultaneously advanced the average start dates and ending dates of bud-ding, flowering and fruiting by 5.3-6.2 days, and further resulted in smaller effects on their durations for most plant species. The interactions between warming and grazing on them varied with plant species and year, which advanced by average 12.1 days for all plant species. The effects of grazing on the temperature sensitivity of the start dates of re-productive phenophases (average by -8.5 days & DEG;C-1) were greater than that of warming alone (average by

AB  - The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of different dietary levels of spent mushroom substrate (SMS) at the expense of wheat straw (WS) on milk characteristics in dairy sheep. Thirty ewes at their final stage of lactation (145 +/- 5 days after parturition) were randomly assigned into three groups; control (C), provided with a diet consisting of concentrates, alfalfa hay and WS, and SMS1 and SMS2, where WS was replaced by SMS at 50 or 100%, respectively. The experiment lasted for 28 days, and milk yield, composition, somatic cell count (SCC) and oxidative stability were monitored weekly, while milk fatty acid and immune cell profile were also determined on day 28. No significant differences were found in produced milk quantity, fat, protein, lactose, total solids non-fat, SCC and fatty acid profile between the experimental groups. However, milk oxidative stability was significantly improved as an effect of SMS (p < 0.001). At the same time, milk polymorphonuclear leukocyte percentage was decreased in SMS2 group (p < 0.05). As indicated, SMS seems to be a promising agro-industrial by-product for ewes' diet that could improve milk oxidative stability, without negatively affecting milk yield, composition and ewe health status, contributing in the context of sustainability, circular economy and protection of natural resources.

TI  - Neglecting polydispersity degrades propensity measurements in supercooled liquids
T2  - EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL E
LA  - English
AB  - We conduct molecular dynamics simulations of a bidisperse Kob-Andersen (KA) glass former, modified to add in additional polydispersity. The original KA system is known to exhibit dynamical heterogeneity. Prior work defined propensity, the mean motion of a particle averaged over simulations reconstructing the initial positions of all particles but with randomized velocities. The existence of propensity shows that structure and dynamics are connected. In this paper, we study systems which mimic problems that would be encountered in measuring propensity in a colloidal glass former, where particles are polydisperse (they have slight size variations). We mimic polydispersity by altering the bidisperse KA system into a quartet consisting of particles both slightly larger and slightly smaller than the parent particles in the original bidisperse system. We then introduce errors into the reconstruction of the initial positions that mimic mistakes one might make in a colloidal experiment. The mistakes degrade the propensity measurement, in some cases nearly completely; one no longer has an iso-configurational ensemble in any useful sense. Our results show that a polydisperse sample is suitable for propensity measurements provided one avoids reconstruction mistakes.

AB  - Background Buffaloes are crucial to agriculture, yet mitochondrial biology in these animals is less studied compared to humans and laboratory animals. This research examines tissue-specific variations in mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) gene expression across buffalo kidneys, hearts, brains, and ovaries. Understanding these variations sheds light on mitochondrial energy metabolism and its impact on buffalo health and productivity, revealing insights into enzyme regulation and potential improvements in livestock management. Materials and methods RNA-seq data from buffalo kidney, heart, brain, and ovary tissues were reanalyzed to explore mitochondrial SDH gene expression. The expression of SDH subunits (SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD) and assembly factors (SDHAF1, SDHAF2, SDHAF3, SDHAF4) was assessed using a log2 fold-change threshold of + 1 for up-regulated and - 1 for down-regulated transcripts, with significance set at p < 0.05. Hierarchical clustering and differential expression analyses were performed to identify tissue-specific expression patterns and regulatory mechanisms, while Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway analyses were conducted to uncover functional attributes and pathway enrichments across different tissues. Results Reanalysis of RNA-seq data from different tissues of healthy female buffaloes revealed distinct expression patterns for SDH subunits and assembly factors. While SDHA, SDHB, and SDHC showed variable expression across tissues, SDHAF2, SDHAF3, and SDHAF4 exhibited tissue-specific profiles. Significant up-regulation of SDHA, SDHB, and several assembly factors was observed in specific tissue comparisons, with fewer down-regulated transcripts. Gene ontology and KEGG pathway analyses linked the up-regulated transcripts to mitochondrial ATP synthesis and the respiratory electron transport chain. Notably, tissue-specific variations in mitochondrial function were particularly evident in the ovary. Conclusion This study identifies distinct SDH gene expression patterns in buffalo tissues, highlighting significant down-regulation of SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, and assembly factors in the ovary. These findings underscore the critical role of mitochondria in tissue-specific energy production and metabolic regulation, suggest potential metabolic adaptations, and emphasize the importance of mitochondrial complex II. The insights gained offer valuable implications for improving feed efficiency and guiding future research and therapies for energy metabolism disorders.

AB  - The pig-tailed macaque, Macaca nemestrina, which is distributed in Peninsular Malaysia, Thailand, Borneo, and Sumatra, has been the subject of unstable and changing taxonomic entity in the M. nemestrina group. This species is involved with a human-macaque conflict in Malaysia and at the same time played an important role in the ethnozoological culture of Malaysian. Even so, comprehensive phylogenetic, population genetics and biogeographical analysis of M. nemestrina in Malaysia are non-existent after decades of intensive research on the genus itself. Thus, we conducted the first comprehensive genetic study of M. nemestrina in Malaysia, based on three mitochondrial loci-Cytochrome b (567 bp), D-loop (398 bp), and COI (577 bp)-from 27 individuals representing Malaysia, plus an additional 26 sequences of Southeast Asian macaques from Genbank. Comparative biogeographical analysis in this study supports the positions of M. nemestrina in M. nemestrina groups as opposed to the silenus or Sulawesi groups. Results from this study also indicate that Bornean populations are the first extant lineages to separate from the other examined lineages of M. nemestrina, M. leonina, M. pagensis, and M. siberu in Southeast Asia. Molecular clock analysis suggested that M. nemestrina arrived in the Malay Peninsula about 0.32 million years ago (MYA). Our results indicate that the population of pig-tailed macaque from Perak (west Peninsular Malaysia) differs genetically based on all phylogenetic and population genetic analyses. Morphologically, Perak's pig-tailed macaque shows brighter coloration than M. n. nemestrina. Thus, we proposed a new subspecies for Perak's pig-tailed macaque as Macaca nemestrina perakensis distributed in the state of Perak, Peninsular Malaysia. This research helps resolve the taxonomic position and population genetics of pig-tailed macaque in Malaysia, which contribute directly to conservation and management of the species in Malaysia.

AB  - Simple Summary Farm animals are exposed to various painful procedures during their productive lives, making it necessary to implement anesthetic and analgesic protocols. However, there are few studies evaluating the effectiveness of these drugs in domestic species. We evaluated the effects of meloxicam and flunixin meglumine in pain sensitivity of goat kids subjected to surgical castration with local anesthesia. The von Frey monofilament test was used to evaluate pain sensitivity in three body regions: four points of the scrotum (dorsal and ventral; left and right lateral); medial region of the pelvic limb, gracilis muscle; and hypogastric region of the abdomen. Reactions were recorded before castration, immediately after castration, and once-daily for three consecutive days after castration. Meloxicam-treated goats experience increased pain sensitivity in the scrotal region and gracilis, particularly at 1 day after castration. However, flunixin meglumine resulted in lower pain reactions, indicating more effective pain relief. Farm animals are exposed to various painful procedures during their productive lives, making it necessary to implement anesthetic and analgesic protocols. However, there are few studies evaluating the effectiveness of these drugs. Our objective was to compare the analgesic effects of two nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): meloxicam (MEL) and flunixin meglumine (FLU), in goat kids subjected to surgical castration under local anesthesia. Anglo-Nubian goat kids (60 days old) were allocated into two groups: MEL (n = 9), and FLU (n = 8), each administered 5 min before starting castration. All had been previously subjected to local anesthesia with lidocaine, injected bilaterally into the testes, plus subcutaneous in the scrotal raphe. Pain sensitivity was evaluated using the von Frey monofilaments test. Reactions were recorded before castration (M0), immediately after castration (M1), and once-daily for three consecutive days post-castration (M2, M3, and M4, respectively). Pain assessments were conducted in three body regions: at four points of the scrotum (dorsal and ventral; left and right lateral; R1); medial region of the pelvic limb, gracilis muscle (R2); and hypogastric region of the abdomen (R3). MEL goats had considerably greater pain reaction in R1 and R2 over time, mainly in M2; therefore, FLU was a more effective analgesic than MEL, resulting in less pain reaction.

AB  - The application to agriculture of wheat-straw spent mushroom substrate amendments (compost/vermicompost) used to grow Pleurotus ostreatus has been analyzed. The study was conducted in a vineyard where the effect on (1) the physicochemical properties of the soil and the leaf and (2) the analytical characteristics and the aromatic composition of the wine were analyzed. The application of the amendments resulted in an increase in organic matter and macronutrients (NO3-, P2O5 and K2O) in the soil. With regard to the leaves, the NO3- and K2O contents of those vines fertilized with vermicompost were higher, and the metallic content was the same regardless of the treatment applied. The analysis of the colorimetric parameters showed that there was a higher content of compounds with red and violet colorations in the case of wine obtained after treatment with vermicompost. In addition, for this type of wine, a higher concentration of volatile compounds was obtained. Thus, after grouping the aroma compounds into aroma series, the greatest differences among vermicompost wines and the rest were obtained in the fruit, floral, herbaceous, and green fruit series. The principal component analysis showed that the vermicompost treatment clearly differentiated the wine from the rest of the wines, in addition to its effects on the aromatic series, the values in the total polyphenol index, and the compounds responsible for brown tones.

AB  - Simple Summary Researchers and breeders are consistently exploring better strategies to improve milk, meat, and wool production in different sheep breeds. Conventionally, sheep are grazed on unbalanced pastures that vary in their composition, which results in lower growth performance and heavy parasitic infections. The ongoing climatic changes also have a drastic impact on grazing areas, leading to severe pasture scarcity across the world. Typically, barn-fed sheep rely on hay with a small amount of grain feeding. Right now, sheep production is pacing toward indoor rearing, which demands a highly precise feeding regimen. Therefore, determining the precise protein levels in the nutrition of indoor sheep production is more critical. The current experiment was planned to evaluate the changes in the rumen metabolite profile of lactating ewes fed different dietary protein levels. Feeding sheep at higher protein levels significantly altered the metabolite profile. These metabolic findings provide insights into potentiated biomarker changes in the metabolism influenced by dietary protein levels.Abstract Diet-associated characteristics such as dietary protein levels can modulate the gut's primary or secondary metabolites, leading to effects on the productive performance and overall health of animals. Whereas fecal metabolite changes are closely associated with gut metabolome, this study aimed to see changes in the rumen metabolite profile of lactating ewes fed different dietary protein levels. For this, eighteen lactating ewes (approximately 2 years old, averaging 38.52 +/- 1.57 kg in their initial body weight) were divided into three groups (n = 6 ewes/group) by following the complete randomized design, and each group was assigned to one of three low-protein (D_I), medium-protein (D_m), and high-protein (D_h) diets containing 8.58%, 10.34%, and 13.93% crude protein contents on a dry basis, respectively. The fecal samples were subjected to untargeted metabolomics using ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC). The metabolomes of the sheep fed to the high-protein-diet group were distinguished as per principal-component analysis from the medium- and low-protein diets. Fecal metabolite concentrations as well as their patterns were changed by feeding different dietary protein levels. The discriminating metabolites between groups of nursing sheep fed different protein levels were identified using partial least-squares discriminant analysis. The pathway enrichment revealed that dietary protein levels mainly influenced the metabolism-associated pathways (n = 63 and 39 in positive as well as negative ionic modes, respectively) followed by protein (n = 15 and 8 in positive as well as negative ionic modes, respectively) and amino-acid (n = 14 and 7 in positive as well as negative ionic modes, respectively) synthesis. Multivariate and univariate analyses showed comparative changes in the fecal concentrations of metabolites in both positive and negative ionic modes. Major changes were observed in protein metabolism, organic-acid biosynthesis, and fatty-acid oxidation. Pairwise analysis and PCA reveal a higher degree of aggregation within the D-h group than all other pairs. In both the PCA and PLS-DA plots, the comparative separation among the D_h/D_m, D_h/D_I, and D_m/D_I groups was superior in positive as well as negative ionic modes, which indicated that sheep fed higher protein levels had alterations in the levels of the metabolites.
   These metabolic findings provide insights into potentiated biomarker changes in the metabolism influenced by dietary protein levels. The target identification may further increase our knowledge of sheep gut metabolome, particularly regarding how dietary protein levels influence the molecular mechanisms of nutritional metabolism, growth performance, and milk synthesis of sheep.

AB  - The expected increase in global food demand, as a consequence of a rising and wealthier world population, and an awareness of the limits and drawbacks of modern agriculture, has resulted in a growing attention to the potential of the seas and oceans to produce more food. The capture production of presently exploited marine fish stocks and other species has more or less reached its maximum and can only be slightly improved by better management. This leaves four alternative options open to increase marine food production: (1) manipulating the entire food web structure via removal of high trophic level species to allow an increasing exploitation of low trophic level species, (2) harvesting so far unexploited stocks, such as various fish species from the mesopelagic zone of the ocean or the larger zooplankton species from polar regions, (3) low-trophic mariculture of seaweeds and herbivorous animals, and (4) restoration of impoverished coastal ecosystems or artificially increasing productivity by ecological engineering. In this paper, we discuss these four options and pay attention to missing scientific knowledge needed to assess their sustainability. To assess sustainability, it is a prerequisite to establish robust definitions and assessments of the biological carrying capacity of the systems, but it is also necessary to evaluate broader socio-economic and governance sustainability.

AB  - Although composting techniques are continuously optimised and adjusted, the removal of bacterial pathogen based on the quality of composting products needs further to ensure safe of agricultural use. In this study, we combined aerobic composting and anaerobic process to determine the optimal combination (turning frequency of once a day, the proportion of swine manure to corn straw (3:1), and mixed 6-day anaerobic process) that benefits the reduction of bacterial pathogens, among which the maximum removal efficiency of up to 92.96% was observed for Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1 reached, thereby improving the quality of the compost products. The variation partition analysis and redundancy analysis indicated that physicochemical factors such as temperature, TOC, and pH significantly affected the removal of bacterial pathogens. Therefore, the additive effects of physicochemical factors on bacterial pathogen removal requires further process optimisation. These findings offer powerful technological support for improving agricultural waste recycling and enhancing the safety of fertiliser application.

AB  - Alkali-pretreated Napier grass (NG) was applied as a substrate to increase biogas yields in a mesophilic anaerobic co-digestion system with pig manure (PM). The goal was to identify optimal conditions for maximizing methane yield and improving the efficient use of these materials for sustainable energy. A laboratory-scale setup was used, applying Box-Behnken design and response surface methodology. Key variables included PM/NG ratio (1:2, 1.25:1, 2:1), organic loading rate (OLR) (0.5, 1, 1.5 g VS/L), and total solids content (TS) (1%, 3%, 5% was evaluated, with cumulative methane yield serving as the response variable. The optimal methane production from co-digesting PM and NG was found under conditions with a PM/NG ratio of 1.18, OLR of 0.62 g VS/L, and TS of 4.8%. Under these conditions, methane yield was predicted to be 331.59 mL/gVS, which closely approximated the experimentally observed value of 324.89 mL/gVS. This correspondence confirmed the validity of the optimization results. The kinetic study showed that the Modified Gompertz model accurately captured methane production dynamics, with a high R2. Additionally, significant quadratic effects for the three parameters and notable linear impacts of OLR and TS on biogas production were observed during the co-digestion process.

AB  - Milk extracellular vesicles (mEVs) seem to be one of the main maternal messages delivery systems. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are micro/nano-sized membrane-bound structures enclosing signaling molecules and thus acting as signal mediators between distant cells and/or tissues, exerting biological effects such as immune modulation and pro-regenerative activity. Milk is also a unique, scalable, and reliable source of EVs. Our aim was to characterize the RNA content of cow, donkey, and goat mEVs through transcriptomic analysis of mRNA and small RNA libraries. Over 10,000 transcripts and 2000 small RNAs were expressed in mEVs of each species. Among the most represented transcripts, 110 mRNAs were common between the species with cow acting as the most divergent. The most represented small RNA class was miRNA in all the species, with 10 shared miRNAs having high impact on the immune regulatory function. Functional analysis for the most abundant mRNAs shows epigenetic functions such as histone modification, telomere maintenance, and chromatin remodeling for cow; lipid catabolism, oxidative stress, and vitamin metabolism for donkey; and terms related to chemokine receptor interaction, leukocytes migration, and transcriptional regulation in response to stress for goat. For miRNA targets, shared terms emerged as the main functions for all the species: immunity modulation, protein synthesis, cellular cycle regulation, transmembrane exchanges, and ion channels. Moreover, donkey and goat showed additional terms related to epigenetic modification and DNA maintenance. Our results showed a potential mEVs immune regulatory purpose through their RNA cargo, although in vivo validation studies are necessary.

AB  - To develop effective public health management strategies, it is necessary to account for the viewpoints of all stakeholders. Thus, anthropological approaches can potentially inform strategies for preventing and managing zoonotic diseases. Here, we use Q fever as a starting point for exploring how small ruminant farmers perceive the reality of microbes by disentangling the farmers' often subtle relationships with their livestock, disease, and the world in general. We found that livestock farmers feel like they exist in the borderlands between two worlds: the non-naturalistic World A, characterised by long timespans and complex relationships with non-humans, and the naturalistic World B, characterised by short timespans and the control of non-humans. The occurrence of diseases leads to tension and shifts between the worlds, depending on how much farmers entrust World B with health risk management and relations with non-humans. Significant or complete delegation of these responsibilities may result in a sense of unease and dispossession, particularly when World B fails to provide productive solutions. Whether farmers view Q fever as mysterious and threatening is also highly dependent on the degree of health risk delegation. Overall, the agent that causes Q fever is perceived in one of two ways: as a fearsome pathogen or a normal denizen in the farm's ecosystem. These results have implications beyond Q fever and clearly illustrate the concept of the "microbial turn", which emphasizes the plurality and ambivalence of the relationships between humans and microbes.

AB  - This study aimed to observe the ultrastructure on the surface of the inner ear of a normal tree shrew using scanning electron microscope (SEM). The specimens of cochlea, macula utriculi, macula sacculi, and crista ampullaris of the normal adult tree shrew were collected and observed by SEM. We used immunofluorescence for cochlear protein Atoh1 staining. We observed that cochlea of the tree shrew is centered on the cochlear axis, circling about 3.5 times from bottom to top of the cochlea. The organ of Corti is located between medial and lateral grooves, including inner and outer hair cells as well as supporting cells. Maculae staticae include macula of saccule and macula of utricle, and the surface of macula is covered with a large number of otoliths. We found a gelatinous layer below the otoliths, followed by the layer of the honeycomb structure. The hair cell cilia of macula and crista ampullaris include one kinocilium and more stereocilia. There is no obvious cross structure but numerous hair cell cilia on semicircular canal crista ampullaris. Immunofluorescence staining showed that protein Atoh1 is mainly distributed in the nucleus of the cochlea's inner and outer hair cells. The observation of the inner ear structure under SEM elucidate the fine surface morphological structure of the entire cochlea, the vestibular maculae staticae, and crista ampullaris, providing new insight into the structure and function of the inner ear of tree shrew. Highlights This article is the first to describe the inner ear ultrastructure of a small primate tree shrew by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Under an SEM, the phalangeal processes of Deiter cells in tree shrews were observed to be connected to the tip of a neighboring hair cell, which was different from that of Deiters' cells in guinea pigs, and this crossed one hair cell, and connected to the tip of the third hair cell. It was observed that the crista ampullaris of tree shrews were horseshoe-shaped, and similar to that of humans and monkeys, this had no obvious "cross-shaped hump" structure. Tree shrew's ABR threshold value curve conforms to the mammalian U-shaped curve, wave III is the main wave of ARB, its sensory frequency may be higher 8 kHz, and the characteristics of the stereocilia of tree shrew we have observed may be related to the perception of higher frequency hearing.

AB  - Simple Summary Habitat loss and fragmentation from extensive road development have escalated wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVCs) as a major cause of wildlife mortality. This study covers 9 years of WVC data across South Korea, examining species involved, seasonal and regional variations, and road factors affecting WVCs, to analyze impacts and propose mitigation strategies. Over 4561 km of roads were monitored, yielding insights into the connection between WVCs, road characteristics, and species-specific patterns. The study identified 13,606 WVCs involving 143 terrestrial vertebrate species, with detailed patterns and models for the top seven mammal species. Spatial differences in WVCs appeared more related to wildlife habitats, but some road features correlated variably with WVC frequency, highlighting complex prevention challenges. Effective mitigation requires comprehensive strategies tailored to species traits, seasonality, and road types.Abstract Severe habitat loss and fragmentation due to extensive road development have escalated wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVCs) as one of the major causes of wildlife mortality. This study, spanning 9 years from 2009 to 2017, presents comprehensive WVC data in South Korea, including species composition, seasonal and regional patterns, and road factors influencing WVCs, aiming to analyze their impact and propose effective mitigation strategies. We collected WVC data with road variables for 9 years from 4561 km of nationwide monitoring road sections and analyzed the data to understand the relationship between WVCs and road characteristics, as well as species-specific patterns. A nationwide survey identified 13,606 WVCs involving 143 terrestrial vertebrate species, and patterns and models of the top seven mammal species (raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides), Siberian chipmunk (Eutamias sibiricus), Siberian weasel (Mustela sibirica), water deer (Hydropotes inermis), red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris), Korean hare (Lepus coreanus), and leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis)) were presented. Patterns revealed declines in WVCs overall, except for water deer. Although spatial differences in WVCs seemed linked more to wildlife habitats, certain road features correlated both positively or negatively with WVC frequency, highlighting complexities in the effectiveness of preventative measures. For effective mitigation and prevention of WVCs, comprehensive strategies considering species traits, seasonality, and road types should be implemented

AB  - This study investigates the effects of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP) on porcine sperm capacitation and its interactions with the cAMP-PKA pathway. The semen of adult Landrace boars was divided into four groups: non-capacitated, capacitated, 10 mu M/mL MG132, and 10 mu M/mL DMSO groups. We characterized the parameters related to sperm dynamics using a computer -assisted sperm analysis system. The level of sperm protein tyrosine phosphorylation was detec-ted using Western blotting, and the change of zinc ion signal was detected via flow cytometry. The relationship between A-kinase-anchor protein 3 (AKAP3), ubiquitin (Ub), and protein kinase A (PKA) was assessed by co-precipitation assays; to evaluate the interactions between the UPP and cAMP-PKA pathway, threonine, serine, and tyrosine phosphorylation were detected using West-ern blotting to evaluate the interaction between the UPP and cAMP-PKA pathway; Hoechst staining was used to detect the sperm-egg binding state and evaluate the effects of UPP inhibition. During capacitation, the levels of protein tyrosine, serine, and threonine phosphorylation and ubiquitination of porcine sperm increased, and sperm-egg binding was inhibited (P < 0.05). AKAP3 was degraded by UPP, and after inhibiting the 26 S proteasome, ubiquitinated AKAP3 accumulated in large quantities. Our findings indicate that, after the 26 S proteasome was inhibited, PKA was uncoupled from AKAP3 and degraded by UPP; the level of tyrosine phos-phorylation induced by PKA-AKAP3 was reduced, the level of serine threonine phosphorylation increased, and the ubiquitination pathway interacted with the phosphorylation pathway and was involved in sperm capacitation.

AB  - Seminal plasma contains a large number of extracellular vesicles (EVs). However, the roles of these EVs and their interactions with sperm are not clear. To identify the important molecules affecting sperm motility in EVs, we analyzed RNA from seminal plasma EVs of boars with different sperm motility using whole-transcriptome sequencing and proteomic analysis. In total, 7 miRNAs, 67 lncRNAs, 126 mRNAs and 76 proteins were differentially expressed between the two groups. We observed that EV-miR-222 can obviously improve sperm motility. In addition, the results suggested that miR-222 was transferred into sperm by the EVs and that miR-222 affected sperm apoptosis by inhibiting the expression of EGFR, BCL2L11, BAX, CYCs, CASP9 and CASP3. The results of electron microscopy also showed that overexpression of miR-222 in EVs could reduce sperm apoptosis. The study of the whole transcriptomes and proteomes of EVs in boar semen revealed some miRNAs may play an important role in these EVs interactions with Duroc sperm, and the findings suggest that the release of miR-222 by semen EVs is an important mechanism by which sperm viability is maintained and sperm apoptosis is reduced. Our studies provide a new insight of miR-222 in EVs regulation for sperm motility and sperm apoptosis.

AB  - Main conclusion A WRKY transcription factor identified through forward genetics is associated with sorghum resistance to the sugarcane aphid and through heterologous expression reduces aphid populations in multiple plant species. Crop plant resistance to insect pests is based on genetically encoded traits which often display variability across diverse germplasm. In a comparatively recent event, a predominant sugarcane aphid (SCA: Melanaphis sacchari) biotype has become a significant agronomic pest of grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor). To uncover candidate genes underlying SCA resistance, we used a forward genetics approach combining the genetic diversity present in the Sorghum Association Panel (SAP) and the Bioenergy Association Panel (BAP) for a genome-wide association study, employing an established SCA damage rating. One major association was found on Chromosome 9 within the WRKY transcription factor 86 (SbWRKY86). Transcripts encoding SbWRKY86 were previously identified as upregulated in SCA-resistant germplasm and the syntenic ortholog in maize accumulates following Rhopalosiphum maidis infestation. Analyses of SbWRKY86 transcripts displayed patterns of increased SCA-elicited accumulation in additional SCA-resistant sorghum lines. Heterologous expression of SbWRKY86 in both tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) and Arabidopsis resulted in reduced population growth of green peach aphid (Myzus persicae). Comparative RNA-Seq analyses of Arabidopsis lines expressing 35S:SbWRKY86-YFP identified changes in expression for a small network of genes associated with carbon-nitrogen metabolism and callose deposition, both contributing factors to defense against aphids. As a test of altered plant responses, 35S:SbWRKY86-YFP Arabidopsis lines were activated using the flagellin epitope elicitor, flg22, and displayed significant increases in callose deposition. Our findings indicate that both heterologous and increased native expression of the transcription factor SbWRKY86 contributes to reduced aphid levels in diverse plant models.

AB  - This study investigates the potential of utilizing livestock waste and vineyard residues for sustainable energy production in Portugal. Through the physical and chemical characterization of swine waste, grape seeds and skins, cork powder, sawdust, and biochar, 53 distinct samples, including 11 individual biomasses and their derived mixtures, were analyzed to identify optimal combinations for biofuel pellet production. The best-performing mixture, composed of 50% swine waste, 25% grape seeds and skins, and 25% cork powder, achieved a Lower Heating Value (LHV) of 18.34 MJ/kg and low ash content, qualifying it as a class B pellet. This mixture offers significant energy potential while minimizing environmental impacts. The research also presents three energy valorization scenarios, with the most balanced scenario meeting up to 6% of Portugal's electricity demand and providing energy savings equivalent to 485,463 tons of oil equivalent (toe) annually. A case study on a "Case Study Farm" in the Douro region, managing 2000 pigs and producing 500 tons of wine grapes annually, demonstrated that implementing the optimal biomass mixture could generate 3854 MWh of heat and 1156 MWh of electricity per year. This could result in annual revenues of EUR 189,258 from pellet sales, covering the initial investment of EUR 283,938 within 6.36 years, with a total surplus of EUR 689,666 over 20 years. These findings highlight the economic viability and environmental benefits of converting agricultural waste into renewable energy, contributing to Portugal's carbon neutrality and reducing energy dependence.

AB  - Schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar disorder (BD) and are severe psychiatric conditions that contribute to disability and increased healthcare costs globally. Although first-, second-, and third-generation antipsychotics are available for treating BD and SCZ, most have various side effects unrelated to their unique functions. Many anti- psychotics affect K+ channels (Kv, KCa, Kir, K2P, and other channels), which change the functions of various organs. This review summarizes the biological actions of antipsychotics, including off-target side effects involving K+ channels.

AB  - Introduction: Uterine distension with pressurised carbon dioxide (CO2) (amniotic insufflation) is used clinically to improve visibility during keyhole fetal surgery. However, there are concerns that amniotic insufflation with unconditioned (cold, dry) CO2 damages the fetal membranes which leads to post-operative preterm prelabour rupture of membranes (iatrogenic PPROM). We assessed whether heating and humidifying the insufflated CO2 could reduce fetal membrane damage in sheep.
   Methods: Thirteen pregnant ewes at 103-106 days gestation underwent amniotic insufflation with cold, dry (22 degrees C, 0-5% humidity, n = 6) or heated, humidified (40 degrees C, 95-100% humidity, n = 7) CO2 at 15 mmHg for 180 min. Twelve non-insufflated amniotic sacs acted as controls. Fetal membrane sections were collected after insufflation and analysed for molecular and histological markers of cell damage (caspase 3 and high mobility group box 1 [HMGBI]), inflammation (interleukin 1-alpha [IL1-alpha], IL8 and vascular cell adhesion molecule [VCAM]) and collagen weakening (matrix metalloprotease 9 [MMP9]).
   Results: Exposure to cold, dry CO2 increased mRNA levels of caspase 3, HMGB1, ILI-alpha, IL8, VCAM and MMP9 and increased amniotic epithelial caspase 3 and HMGB1 cell counts relative to controls. Exposure to heated, humidified CO2 also increased IL8 levels relative to controls however, HMGB1, IL1-alpha and VCAM mRNA levels and amniotic epithelial HMGB1 cell counts were significantly lower than the cold, dry group.
   Discussion: Amniotic insufflation with cold, dry CO(2 )damaged the amniotic epithelium and induced fetal membrane inflammation. Heated, humidified insufflation partially mitigated this damage and inflammation in sheep and may prove an important step in reducing the risk of iatrogenic PPROM following keyhole fetal surgery.

AB  - Successful reproductive management of buffaloes depends primarily upon timely estrus identification. However, 50% of the estrus events are undetected in buffaloes with the available estrus identification methods, leading to huge financial loss to buffalo farmers. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop an alternative and accurate estrus identification method, particularly on the basis of biomarkers in non-invasive fluids. Thus, the present study aimed to identify RNA based estrus biomarkers in cell free saliva in Bubalus bubalis, so that they can be used for future field applicable RT-LAMP colour reactions. RNA-Seq analysis of cell free salivary RNA showed 49 differentially abundant mRNAs between the estrus and diestrus stages. Among five mature miRNAs predicted from the RNA-Seq data, four were found differentially altered at the estrus stage than the diestrus stage. Validation study by direct salivary transcript analysis (DSTA) on 6 selected mRNAs (PPARGC1a, TIMP1, PEBP4, CSPG5, PRHR and ATOH7) and 5 miRNAs (bta-miR-92b, bta-miR-302d, bta-miR-141, bta-miR-27a and bta-let7a-5p) showed significantly higher levels of TIMP1 (3.46 fold; P < 0.5) and bta-mir-141 (1.33 fold; P < 0.5) in cell-free saliva at the estrus stage compared to the diestrus stage. Hence, TIMP1 and miR-141 appear to be the possible transcript biomarkers for estrus in the cell free saliva of the buffalo. However, further validation studies are required in a large population of buffaloes to determine their estrus biomarker potential before considering them for RT-LAMP colour reaction.

AB  - Given the traditional use of wood, historical structures are susceptible to termite damage which can irreversibly affect their historical significance. Methods like drilling into the foundation for termiticide injection are impractical and potentially harmful to the structural integrity of these structures. Moreover, the location of these structures in ecologically sensitive areas prohibits the use of soil termiticides due to potential contamination of groundwater, rivers, or oceans. Termite Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategies include baiting programs that use minimal quantities of benign insecticides to reduce environmental impact. This approach is consistent with the risk management component of termite IPM. Bait systems are proven to be effective in eliminating termite colonies, contributing to the benefit component of IPM by preserving the value of historical sites. This article discusses successful baiting interventions at notable locations such as the Statue of Liberty National Monument, New York, USA, the Christiansted National Historic Site in St. Croix, US Virgin Islands, and the Historic Tzu-Su Temple in Taiwan.

This study explores a high-efficiency, low-energy treatment method for livestock and poultry breeding wastewater, focusing on the use of Constructed Wetland-Microbial Fuel Cell technology (CW-MFC). The study showed that the removal rates of COD, NH4+-N, and PO43--P through the multistage tandem system reached 77.32%, 95.97%, and 92.72%, respectively. The study revealed that substrate layers significantly influence microbial community composition, with Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1, unclassified_ Rhizobiales, and Micropruina being primarily enriched in all layers. It can be concluded that microbial metabolism is the primary mechanism of pollution elimination based on the KEGG signaling analysis of PICRUSt2 metabolic pathway 1. The COD removal was dependent on microbial autotrophic carbon fixation reactions; the NH4+-N removal was attributed to the up-regulation of nitrification-denitrification genes; and the PO43--P removal was dependent on the microbial production of transferase enzymes substituting for phosphoryl groups that converted them to hypophosphite products. This study aims to enhance CW-MFC wastewater treatment for livestock and poultry, improve pollutant removal efficiency, and establish a foundation for future research and practical application.

AB  - Glycoside hydrolase family 5 (GH5) harbors diverse substrate specificities and modes of action, exhibiting notable molecular adaptations to cope with the stereochemical complexity imposed by glycosides and carbohydrates such as cellulose, xyloglucan, mixed-linkage beta-glucan, laminarin, (hetero)xylan, (hetero)mannan, galactan, chitosan, N-glycan, rutin and hesperidin. GH5 has been divided into subfamilies, many with higher functional specificity, several of which have not been characterized to date and some that have yet to be discovered with the exploration of sequence/taxonomic diversity. In this work, the current GH5 subfamily inventory is expanded with the discovery of the GH5_57 subfamily by describing an endo-beta-mannanase (CapGH5_57) from an uncultured Bacteroidales bacterium recovered from the capybara gut microbiota. Biochemical characterization showed that CapGH5_57 is active on glucomannan, releasing oligosaccharides with a degree of polymerization from 2 to 6, indicating it to be an endo-beta-mannanase. The crystal structure, which was solved using single-wavelength anomalous diffraction, revealed a massively redesigned catalytic interface compared with GH5 mannanases. The typical aromatic platforms and the characteristic alpha-helix-containing beta 6-alpha 6 loop in the positive-subsite region of GH5_7 mannanases are absent in CapGH5_57, generating a large and open catalytic interface that might favor the binding of branched substrates. Supporting this, CapGH5_57 contains a tryptophan residue adjacent and perpendicular to the cleavage site, indicative of an anchoring site for a substrate with a substitution at the -1 glycosyl moiety. Taken together, these results suggest that despite presenting endo activity on glucomannan, CapGH5_57 may have a new type of substituted heteromannan as its natural substrate. This work demonstrates the still great potential for discoveries regarding the mechanistic and functional diversity of this large and polyspecific GH family by unveiling a novel catalytic interface sculpted to recognize complex heteromannans, which led to the establishment of the GH5_57 subfamily.

AB  - Tamoxifen has been shown to reduce glutamate release from presynaptic glutamatergic nerves and reverse tolerance to morphine-induced respiratory depression. Changes in glutamatergic neurotransmission in the central nervous system contribute to morphine tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal. This study, therefore, evaluated effects of tamoxifen on development of analgesic tolerance and dependence, and brain glutamate and glutamine levels in chronic morphine administration. Mice implanted with placebo or morphine pellets were injected with tamoxifen (0.6-2 mg/kg) or vehicle twice daily for 3 days. Nociceptive response was evaluated in the hot plate and tail immersion tests, 4, 48 and 72 h post-implant, and following a challenge dose of morphine (10 mg/kg). Withdrawal signs were determined after naloxone (1 mg/kg) administration. Morphine increased nociceptive threshold which declined over time. At 72 h, acute morphine elicited tolerance to the analgesic effect in the hot plate test in vehicle or tamoxifen administered animals. In the tail immersion test, however, tolerance to morphine analgesia was observed in tamoxifen, but not vehicle, co-administration. Tamoxifen did not reduce withdrawal signs. In contrast to previous reports, glutamate and glutamine levels in the hippocampus and frontal cortex did not change in the morphine-vehicle group. Confirming previous findings, tamoxifen (2 mg/kg) decreased glutamate and glutamine concentrations in the hippocampus in animals with placebo pellets. Both doses of tamoxifen significantly changed glutamate and/or glutamine concentrations in both regions in morphine pellet implanted animals. These results suggest that tamoxifen has no effect on dependence but may facilitate tolerance development to the antinociception, possibly mediated at the spinal level, in chronic morphine administration.

AB  - Simple Summary Gyrostigma rhinocerontis (Hope), the rhinoceros bot fly, is a rare obligate intestinal parasite of white and black rhinoceroses that can cause severe myiasis and secondary infection, leading to enormous economic and scientific loss. As the main sensory organs of flies, the antennae provide insects with critical information about the environment, playing significant roles in their key activities. The antennal characteristics of G. rhinocerontis remain largely unexplored, probably due to the extreme rarity of adult specimens in collections. In this study, the antennae of G. rhinocerontis were thoroughly examined using light and scanning electron microscopy. The morphology, including detailed ultrastructure, of antennal sensilla are presented. As the largest species of Oestridae Leach, not surprisingly, G. rhinocerontis has significantly larger antennae with more sensilla and sensory pits than any other Oestridae species, which could be an adaptation to locate their rare and endangered hosts. Gyrostigma rhinocerontis (Diptera: Oestridae) is a rare obligate intestinal parasite of both white and black rhinoceroses, which can induce severe myiasis, cause secondary infection, and lead to enormous economic and scientific loss. Antennae are the main sensory organs of G. rhinocerontis, which may have evolved a series of specialized adaptive structures to facilitate the exploitation of their hosts. Here, we thoroughly examine the antennae of G. rhinocerontis via light and scanning electron microscopy. Only microtrichia and chaetic sensilla were observed on the scape and pedicel, and the latter is enlarged, half-enveloping the postpedicel. Four types of sensilla (trichoid sensilla, basiconic sensilla, coeloconic sensilla, and clavate sensilla) and sensory pits are detected on the postpedicel. A set of coeloconic sensilla and a chaetic sensillum are located on the arista. Distribution, type, size, and ultrastructure of antennal sensilla are presented. The antennae of G. rhinocerontis are the largest among Oestridae species, with the most sensilla and the most sensory pits. These antennal characteristics could be correlated to their adaptation for more sensitive and accurate olfactory organs, used to locate their rare and endangered hosts. Accordingly, this morphological evidence supports that the host is an important driving factor in the diversity of antennal morphology in the bot flies.

AB  - Agricultural soils have been identified as potential reservoirs for plastic pollution, with adverse effects on soil properties. Primary sources of plastic input in agricultural landscapes are associated with the application of sewage sludge or compost. Understanding the sources and anticipated plastic content is crucial in mitigating plastic pollution in agricultural fields. This study presents one of the first investigations into the plastic content and other impurities, e.g. glass, of seven organic fertilizers (biowaste compost, digested pig slurry, sewage sludge compost, dry chicken manure, green waste compost, sewage sludge, and a mixed digestate comprising pig slurry, chicken manure, and 74 % renewable raw materials). Potentially visible foreign substances were assessed on the surface of each fertilizer pile. No impurities could be detected in digested pig slurry, chicken manure, and mixed digestate. For the remaining fertilizers, visible potential foreign substances were collected, cleaned, visually described, weighed, photographed, size measured, and chemically characterized using ATR-FTIR. The quantification revealed that plastic particles are the most abundant and are contained in all other fertilizers, in contrast to glass and metal. An increasing trend in plastic particle number per m(2): green waste < biowaste < sewage sludge compost < sewage sludge, which is about 4 times greater in sewage sludge than in green waste compost, could be observed. However, sewage sludge compost has the largest plastic mass and surface area per square meter. This illustrates that sewage sludge compost application can be a significant entry pathway for visual plastics into agricultural soils.

KW  - SPIKE PROTEIN
AB  - The Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become an international public health emergency, which poses the most serious threat to the human health around the world. Accumulating evidences have shown that the new coronavirus could not only infect human beings, but also can infect other species which might result in the cross-speciesinfections. In this research, 1056 ACE2 protein sequences are collected from the NCBI database, and 173 species with >60% sequence identity compared with that of human beings are selected for further analysis. We find 14 polar residues forming the binding interface of ACE2/2019-nCoV-Spike complex play an important role in maintaining protein-protein stability. Among them, 8 polar residues at the same positions with that of human ACE2 are highly conserved, which ensure its basic binding affinity with the novel coronavirus. 5 of other 6 unconserved polar residues (positions at human ACE2: Q24, D30, K31, H34 and E35) are proved to have an effect on the binding patterns among species. We select 21 species keeping close contacts with human beings, construct their ACE2 three-dimensional structures by Homology Modeling method and calculate the binding free energies of their ACE2/2019-nCoV-Spike complexes. We find the ACE2 from all the 21 species possess the capabilities to bind with the novel coronavirus. Compared with the human beings, 8 species (cow, deer, cynomys, chimpanzee, monkey, sheep, dolphin and whale) present almost the same binding abilities, and 3 species (bat, pig and dog) show significant improvements in binding affinities. We hope this research could provide significant help for the future epidemic detection, drug and vaccine development and even the global eco-system protections.

AB  - The CRISPR/Cas9 system has become a powerful tool for molecular design breeding in livestock such as sheep. However, the efficiency of the Cas9 system combined with zygote microinjection remains suboptimal. In this study, mature sheep oocytes were used for microinjection to assess the impact of various factors on Cas9 editing efficiency. We found that the in vitro maturation efficiency of oocytes is related to environmental factors such as air temperature, pressure, and humidity. Our results indicate that high-efficiency gene editing can be achieved when targeting the SOCS2, DYA, and TBXT, using a microinjection mixture with a concentration of 10 ng/mu L Cas9 and sgRNA. By optimizing the injection capillary, we significantly reduced the oocyte invalidation rate post-microinjection to 3.1-5.3%. Furthermore, we observed that using either Cas9 protein or mRNA in the microinjection process resulted in different genotypes in the edited oocytes. Importantly, parthenogenetic activation did not appear to affect the editing efficiency. Using this high-efficiency system, we successfully generated SOCS2 or DYA gene-edited sheep, with all lambs confirmed to be genetically modified. This study presents a highly efficient method for producing gene-edited sheep, potentially enabling more precise and effective strategies for livestock breeding.

AB  - 1. Animals maintain physiological and behavioural systems that allow them to detect and consume specific macro- and micronutrients to maximize their fitness. One common physiological system is the nutrient-state-dependent or demand-driven appetite. These systems are well described for macronutrient regulation, but not for micronutrients.
   2. Sterols are essential micronutrients that all animals need to survive. They are the backbone of many hormones, important in cell signalling and an integral component of cell membranes.
   3. Lady beetles are globally distributed predators of insect herbivores. Adult seven-spotted lady beetles maintain a state-dependent sterol appetite and consume plant tissues to obtain sterols, which improves their fitness. Additionally, seven-spotted lady beetles can detect sterols pre-ingestion.
   4. We used lady beetle species distributed across the three clades of the Coccinellini to determine (a) whether other beetle species maintain a state-dependent sterol appetite, (b) if sterol structure affects beetles' state-dependent sterol appetite and (c) whether lady beetles consume foliage in a sterol-state dependent manner. Additionally, we determined (a) what sensory organ beetles use to detect sterols, (b) their limit of detection and (c) when during development their appetite manifests.
   5. All six beetle species we tested maintained a state-dependent appetite for sterols. Sterol structure affected beetles' propensity to feed on sterol-treated disks, indicating that the number and position of double bonds in sterol molecules affects beetles' ability to detect or desire to feed on them. Only beetles in Glade III fed on plant foliage in response to sterol limitation. Few beetles in any Glade that were supplemented with sterols consumed plant tissue.
   6. Beetles' appetite for sterols first appeared during the second larval stadium, and the rate of sterol consumption increased with age. Ablations of sensory organs revealed that beetles use their labial palps to detect sterols, and that they detect them at concentrations as low as 1ppm.
   7. These data demonstrate that lady beetles across the Coccinellini maintain a state-dependent appetite for an essential class of micronutrients. They also provide very strong evidence that lady beetles can taste sterols, raising the possibility that they maintain novel as-yet undescribed gustatory receptors for an essential class of lipids.

AB  - The development of therapies targeted to improve the health of women has utilized direct vaginal delivery as a more effective and less toxic method of protection from HIV and other pathogens. Vaginal applicants and delivery devices that provide sustained effects have been met with increasing acceptability, but the efficacy and toxicity outcomes have not been successfully predicted by preclinical in vitro studies and animal modeling. We have explored the utilization of sheep as a model for testing the safety of vaginal applicants and devices based on spatial and structural similarities to the human vagina. As recently noted by the FDA, an additional safety measure is an impact on the vaginal microbiome (VMB) that is known to contribute to vaginal health and influence pathogen susceptibility and drug metabolism. To advance the utility of the sheep vaginal model, we completed a thorough molecular characterization of the ovine VMB utilizing both next-generation sequencing (NGS) and PCR methods. The process also created a custom PCR array to quantify ovine VMB community profiles in an affordable, higher throughput fashion. The results from vaginal swabs (>475 samples) collected from non-pregnant crossbred Dorset and Merino ewes treated with selected vaginal applicants or collected as sham samples established 16 VMB community types (VMB CTs). To associate VMB CTs with eubiosis or dysbiosis, we also completed custom ELISAs for six cytokines identifying IL1B, IL8, TNFa, and CXCL10 as useful markers to support the characterization of ovine vaginal inflammation. The results indicated that Pasteurella, Actinobacillus, Pseudomonas, Bacteroides, Leptotrichia, and E. coli were common markers of eubiosis (low inflammatory marker expression), and that Haemophilus, Ureaplasma, and Corynebacterium were associated with dysbiosis (high cytokine levels). Utilizing the optimized workflow, we also confirmed the utility of three commonly used vaginal applicants for impact on the VMB and inflammatory state, producing a dataset that supports the recommendation for the use of sheep for testing of vaginal applicants and devices as part of preclinical pipelines.

AB  - Chronic heat stress (CHS) induces metabolic changes in skeletal muscle from growth to maintenance that jeopardizes growth performance, carcass traits, and meat quality of pigs. We investigated the protective effect of dietary organic selenium (hydroxy-4-methylselenobutanoic acid, OH-SeMet) on CHS-induced skeletal muscle damages of growing pigs, and the corresponding responses of selenoproteins. A total of 40 ((Landrace xYorkshire) x Duroc) pigs with an average live weight of 49.64 +/- 2.48 kg were used in this 4-week trial. Pigs were randomly allotted to 5 groups: The control group was raised on a basal diet in a thermoneutral environment (22 +/- 2 degrees C); and four CHS groups were raised on a basal diet and supplemented with Se 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 mg/kg as OH-SeMet, respectively, in hyperthermal condition (33 +/- 2 degrees C). CHS resulted in significant decrease of growth performance, carcass traits, and meat quality, which were associated with reduced (p < 0.05) serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) and increased (p < 0.05) serum creatine (CK), sarcous heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), glucokinase (GCK), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents. Meanwhile, four metabolism-related genes and seven selenoprotein encoding genes were abnormally expressed in skeletal muscle. Dietary OH-SeMet addition partially alleviated the negative impact of CHS on carcass traits and improved meat quality. These improvements were accompanied by the increase in Se deposition, the anti-oxidative capacity of serum and muscle, and protein abundance of GPX1, GPX3, GPX4, and SELENOP. Supplementation with 0.6 mg Se/kg (OH-SeMet) restored the sarcous PEPCK, and 0.4 and 0.6 mg Se/kg (OH-SeMet) restored all abnormally expressed metabolism-related and selenoprotein encoding genes. In summary, dietary supplementation with OH-SeMet beyond Se requirement mitigated CHS-induced depression of carcass traits and meat quality of pigs associated with optimal skeletal metabolism, enhanced antioxidant capacity, and regulation of selenoproteins in skeletal muscle of pigs.

AB  - The late Miocene is a period of increasing aridity and habitat openness in the south-eastern Mediterranean region. The impact of these changes has not been fully explored regarding rhinocerotids' ecology, although rhinoceroses were a major and diverse component of the Miocene mammalian faunas. Here, we investigate the palaeoecology of rhinocerotid specimens coming from 12 localities throughout the Balkan-Iranian zoogeographic province, and covering a large part of the late Miocene (MN9 to MN13). Microwear textures confirmed the hypothesised niche partitioning between the two main rhinocerotid species - Ceratotherium [Ce.] neumayri (mixed-feeder including grasses) and Dihoplus pikermiensis (browser) - but highlighted dietary overlap between Ce. neumayri and the co-occurring chilothere species at Maragheh, Samos and Pentalophos-1. Although microwear did not reveal clear spatiotemporal differences, we found obvious discrepancies regarding hypoplasia prevalence: Vallesian rhinocerotid teeth displayed more defects (Xirochori and Pentalophos-1: 16.26% of teeth affected) than Turolian specimens (all other localities: 9.72%). Similarly, rhinocerotid teeth from eastern localities (Samos and Maragheh; supposedly more arid), had a higher hypoplasia prevalence (13.52%) than their western counterparts (6.90%). Insights from rhinocerotids' ecology thus challenged space and time homogeneity within Balkan-Iranian province, and the associated savanna habitat, at least regarding the sample studied here.

AB  - Bottom-up (plant) and top-down (natural enemy) trophic factors can interact to have significant influence on the diet breadth of herbivores. For herbivorous insects that are victim to parasitoid attacks, diet composition can modulate insect immune responses against the parasitoid. However, immune responses are costly and insect herbivores experience a trade-off between investment in immune defences and other physiological processes. We used a split-brood laboratory experiment to explore how the diet of the fall webworm (Hyphantria cunea), a species that eats over 400 plant species, affects larval growth and fitness and cellular immune response to attacks from a parasitic wasp. We reared larvae on four different plant diets (apple, alder, chokecherry, cottonwood) and then exposed them to an immune challenge from a parasitoid attack. We found that diet influenced larval development as well as parameters indicative of immune response. Larvae reared on the plant that led to the poorest development also had the fewest granulocytes and the highest odds of containing a parasitoid larva. However, larval growth was not a predictor of immune response. Overall, we show that the bottom-up effect of diet variability has significant impacts on insect immune response such that larval fitness varies considerably when fed different dietary plant species. Broad diet ranges may offer herbivorous insects the opportunity to exploit a different set of resources depending on the severity of top-down pressures. Here, we show that this variability in plant quality also has significant impacts on larval immune response.

AB  - Simple Summary Meishan pig is a local pig breed in China, which has higher immunity than commercial pig breeds for some diseases. The spleen has hematopoietic and immune response functions, making it a good organ model for studying immunity. We depicted the expression profiles of lncRNA-mRNA in the spleen of Meishan pigs at different developmental time points (7 d, 21 d, 35 d, 120 d and 180 d). In addition, we found that AKT3, CBL and PTK2B may be involved in immune regulation in Meishan pigs through a competing endogenous RNA network. This result provides valuable genomic resources for studying immune regulation in animals and finds potential molecular markers for pig disease resistance breeding. Meishan is a well-established local Chinese breed known for its high fecundity, strong immune response and high meat quality. However, the molecular mechanism of immune regulation during the development of Meishan pigs still remains unclear. Here, we performed the transcriptional sequencing of spleen tissues from Meishan pigs at different development stages. In total, 10,268 lncRNAs were identified, including 1254 novel lncRNAs and 9014 known lncRNAs. Time series analysis revealed that genes of the up-regulated module were enriched in pathways associated with transport, immunity, and histone acetylation modifications, while genes of the down-regulated module were enriched in DNA metabolic process and cell cycle. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) showed the functional linkage between mRNAs and lncRNAs, indicating that lncRNAs are important regulatory elements of mRNAs. Notably, a lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network that contained 3 mRNAs (AKT3, CBL and PTK2B), 17 lncRNAs and 67 miRNAs were screened out, which probably plays a critical role in immune regulation of Meishan pigs. Our findings not only revealed the transcriptome profile of spleen development, but also provide novel insights into the mechanism of lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA axis in the immune response in Meishan pigs.

AB  - (1) Background: This work aims to investigate the metabolomic changes in PIGinH11 pigs and investigate differential compounds as potential therapeutic targets for metabolic diseases. (2) Methods: PIGinH11 pigs were established with a CRISPR/Cas9 system. PNPLA3(I148M), hIAPP, and GIPR(dn) were knocked in the H11 locus of the pig genome. The differential metabolites between and within groups were compared at baseline and two months after high-fat-high-sucrose diet induction. (3) Results: 72.02% of the 815 detected metabolites were affected by the transgenic effect. Significantly increased metabolites included isoleucine, tyrosine, methionine, oxoglutaric acid, acylcarnitine, glucose, sphinganines, ceramides, and phosphatidylserines, while fatty acids and conjugates, phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines, and sphingomyelins were decreased. Lower expression of GPAT3 and higher expression of PNPLA3(I148M) decreased the synthesis of diacylglycerol and phosphatidylcholines. Accumulated ceramides that block Akt signaling and decrease hyocholic acid and lysophosphatidylcholines might be the main reason for increased blood glucose in PIGinH11 pigs, which was consistent with metabolomic changes in patients. (4) Conclusions: Through serum metabolomics and lipidomics studies, significant changes in obesity and diabetes-related biomarkers were detected in PIGinH11 pigs. Excessive fatty acids beta-oxidation interfered with glucose and amino acids catabolism and reduced phosphatidylcholines. Decreased hyocholic acid, lysophosphatidylcholine, and increased ceramides exacerbated insulin resistance and elevated blood glucose. Phosphatidylserines were also increased, which might promote chronic inflammation by activating macrophages.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of two different methods of controlling ovine reproduction (ram effect and a combination of eco-friendly substances) in three Greek indigenous sheep breeds, namely Florina, Karagouniko, and Chios. 180 ewes, aged 2-3 years old, were used, equally divided between the three Greek sheep breeds. Each breed was divided in two equal experimental groups: In group ECO (combination of eco-friendly substances), a dose of Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) was administered at day 0, followed by an intramuscular injection of prostaglandin seven days later and another dose of GnRH at day 9. In group ME, sexually active males were introduced to the females that have been isolated for 3 months. The experiment was conducted in three consecutive years: 2020, 2021, and 2022. Average estrus expression and fecundity in all three examined breeds was comparable, with the exemption of Florina ewes treated with the ecofriendly substances in the first year, a result that could be attributed to the strong seasonal pattern in estrus expression of the Florina breed. The average length to estrus expression in days was significantly lower in the eco-friendly method than the procedure using male effect and the prolificacy was higher for the Chios sheep than the Florina and the Karagouniko breeds. Overall, both methods for the induction and synchronization of estrus (male effect and PGF2a administration) could be used in sheep reproduction with promising results. Nevertheless, the male effect seems to be more efficient in indigenous breeds with long anestrus periods.

AB  - Simple Summary Post-weaning diarrhoea in pigs can be a challenge and medicinal zinc oxide can decrease the need for antibiotic treatment. Low protein diets decrease diarrhoea post-weaning and soy protein concentrate improves protein digestion when compared to a soybean meal based diet. The aim of this study was to test the effect of low protein diets with different protein sources as an alternative to medicinal zinc oxide. The study demonstrated that low protein diets can decrease diarrhoea-related antibiotic treatments but also reduces growth performance. Additionally, the study presented a difference in gut nutrient metabolism when feeding very low protein levels. Weaning comprises a challenging period for pigs, but dietary tools can be implemented to avoid excess antibiotics usage. Therefore, we tested the effect of a 17.6% crude protein (CP) diet on growth and diarrhoea and investigated the effect of a 15.5% CP diet post-weaning on transcriptomic responses, growth, and diarrhoea-related antibiotic treatments. At weaning, pigs were divided into five dietary treatment groups in a three-phase diet from weaning to 30 kg bodyweight. The diets included a positive control group (PC) with medicinal zinc oxide, a negative control group (NC), a 17.6% CP diet based on soy protein concentrate (SP), a 17.6% CP diet based on soybean meal (SB), and a 15.5% CP diet with additional amino acids (XLA). Growth performance and the occurrence of diarrhoea were similar between the SP and SB groups. The XLA pigs had a reduced weight gain and fewer antibiotics treatments caused by diarrhoea, as well as a reduced level of blood proteins. Intestinal tissue samples from the XLA pigs displayed decreased expression of genes involved in nutrient metabolism and immune responses relative to the PC group. In conclusion, a very low CP diet reduces antibiotics treatments, but also adapts gut nutrient metabolism and reduces growth performance.

AB  - Simple Summary With the global spread of COVID-19, surveillance of companion animals living in close proximity to humans has been conducted due to the zoonotic nature of the causative agent, SARS-CoV-2. However, further research is still needed when it comes to livestock animals, particularly cattle and goats that are raised in grazing management systems as part of a group. In this study, nasal swabs and blood samples were collected from randomly selected Korean native cattle and Korean native black goats across nine different provinces in Korea. Of the 1798 animals tested, we found 1 cattle and 1 goat with detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA, 54 Korean native cattle (4.60%) and 16 Korean native black goats (2.56%) with antibodies, and 51 Korean native cattle (4.34%) and 14 goats (2.24%) with virus-neutralizing antibodies. Infections have been found in various animals after initiating in wildlife and spreading widely among humans, and our results indicate the presence of antigens and antibodies in Korean native cattle and Korean native black goats. This suggests a potential reverse zoonosis, where humans may be infected through a widespread epidemic. Therefore, continuous monitoring is crucial, and additional testing should be conducted on a broader range of animals.Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic is caused by the zoonotic SARS-CoV-2 virus. A wide range of animals that interact with humans have been investigated to identify potential infections. As the extent of infection became more apparent, extensive animal monitoring became necessary to assess their susceptibility. This study analyzed nasal swabs and blood samples collected from randomly selected Korean native cattle and Korean native black goats. The tests conducted included real-time qPCR to detect SARS-CoV-2 antigens, an ELISA to detect antibodies, and a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) to determine the presence of neutralizing antibodies. Among the 1798 animals tested (consisting of 1174 Korean native cattle and 624 Korean native black goats), SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was detected in one Korean native cattle and one Korean native black goat. ELISA testing revealed positive results for antibodies in 54 Korean native cattle (4.60%) and 16 Korean native black goats (2.56%), while PRNTs yielded positive results in 51 Korean native cattle (4.34%) and 14 Korean native black goats (2.24%). The presence of SARS-CoV-2 antigens and/or antibodies was identified in animals on farms where farmworkers were already infected. It is challenging to completely rule out the possibility of reverse zoonotic transmission from humans to livestock in Korea, although the transmission is not to the same extent as it is in highly susceptible animal species like minks, cats, and dogs. This is due to the limited geographical area and the dense, intensive farming practices implemented in these regions. In conclusion, continuous viral circulation between humans and animals is inevitable, necessitating ongoing animal monitoring to ensure public health and safety.

AB  - Modernizing dairy cattle farming techniques promotes a gradual shift from traditional pasture-based systems to confinement with higher investments in animal comfort and welfare, such as the compost barn system (CBS). In this method, animals generate composted waste in the barn itself, on the bedding where they are housed, which is of high fertilizing potential, and whose subsequent application to soils can affect the functionality of edaphic organisms. The study aimed to evaluate the toxicity on edaphic organisms ( Folsomia candida and Eisenia andrei) ) of increasing doses of CB bedding applied to two soils with different textural characteristics. Ecotoxicological tests were standardized following the recommendations of ISO 11268-1 and 11268-2 for earthworms, and ISO 11267 for springtails. The experimental design was completely randomized with five replications, with the treatments being CB bedding doses (0, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 t of waste ha(-1)). Data were subjected to normality (Shapiro-Wilk) and variance homogeneity (Levene) tests, followed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post-hoc comparisons using the Dunnett test (p<0.05). Still, no significant difference was found between treatments. The tested doses of CB bedding as organic fertilizer showed no acute or chronic toxicity in the two organisms studied (E. E. andrei and F. candida) ) in both soils Oxisol and Entisol Quartzipsamments. The proportional increase in dose promoted the growth of earthworm body mass and stimulated reproduction, as found in springtails. Thus, it is concluded that doses of up to 30 t ha(-1) of CB bedding do not have acute and chronic toxicity effects on earthworms and springtails in Oxisol and Entisol Quartzipsamments. The greater sensitivity of chronic assays with these organisms shows a positive impact of the applied doses, promoting increased reproduction of these organisms.

AB  - Spermatogenesis is an advanced biological process, relying on intricate interactions between somatic and germ cells in testes. Investigating various cell types is challenging because of cellular heterogeneity. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) offers a method to analyze cellular heterogeneity. In this research, we performed 10x Genomics scRNA-seq to conduct an unbiased single-cell transcriptomic analysis in Hezuo pig (HZP) testis at one month of age during prepuberty. We collected 14,276 cells and identified 8 cell types (including 2 germ cells types and 6 somatic cell types). Pseudo-timing analysis demonstrated that Leydig cells (LCs) and myoid cells (MCs) originated from a shared progenitor cell lineage. Moreover, the functional enrichment analyses showed that the genes of differential expression were enriched in spermatogonia (SPG) and were enriched in the cell cycle, reproduction, and spermatogenesis. Expressed genes in spermatocytes (SPCs) were enriched in the cAMP, cell cycle, male gamete generation, reproductive system development, and sexual reproduction, while growth hormone synthesis, gamete generation, reproductive process, and spermine synthase activity were enriched in Sertoli cells (SCs). Additionally, chemokine, B cell receptor, activation of immune response, and enzyme binding were enriched in macrophages. Our study investigated transcriptional alterations across different cell types during spermatogenesis, yielding new understandings of spermatogenic processes and cell development. This research delivers an exploration of spermatogenesis and testicular cell biology in HZP, establishing the groundwork for upcoming breeding initiatives.

AB  - Camellia oleifera Abel. (C. oleifera) is an edible oil tree species that provide an important guarantee for targeted poverty alleviation strategy in China. Severe difficulties in irrigation leading to drought stress have become a major obstacle to the development of the C. oleifera planting industry. Breeding of drought-tolerant cultivars is the main idea for solving the problem of water shortage stress in C. oleifera cultivation. The photosynthetic physiology traits of C. oleifera cultivars 'Xianglin No.1' and 'Hengdong No.2' were affected by drought stress to different degrees, which demonstrated that the two cultivars suffered different degrees of damage. In the present study, we applied mRNA-seq and miRNA-seq to analyze the difference in molecular responses between drought stress and control, drought-tolerant and -sensitive cultivars, at mRNA and miRNA levels. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in photosynthesis-related, porphyrin, and chlorophyll metabolism, circadian rhythm system, and plant hormone signal transduction pathways were identified that might be candidates for drought stress tolerance genes. Subsequently, the miRNA-mRNA regulatory networks connected the differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) to their predicted target genes were established. miR398 and miR408-3p in C. oleifera showed that associated with the response to drought stress by negatively regulating genes encoding Downy Mildew Resistance 6 (DMR6) and Enhanced Disease Resistance 2 (EDR2), respectively, which might further improve drought tolerance via crosstalk between different stress-responsive pathways. The quantitation results of miRNA and mRNA were validated by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). In summary, the integrated mRNA-seq and miRNA-seq analysis deepen our understanding of the regulatory network response to drought stress and variety-specific responses improving drought tolerance in C. oleifera.

AB  - Current declines in male reproductive health may, in part, be driven by anthropogenic environmental chemical (EC) exposure. Using a biosolids treated pasture (BTP) sheep model, this study examined the effects of gestational exposure to a translationally relevant EC mixture. Testes of 8-week-old ram lambs from mothers exposed to BTP during pregnancy contained fewer germ cells and had a greater proportion of Sertoli-cell-only seminiferous tubules. This concurs with previous published data from fetuses and neonatal lambs from mothers exposed to BTP. Comparison between the testicular transcriptome of biosolids lambs and human testicular dysgenesis syndrome (TDS) patients indicated common changes in genes involved in apoptotic and mTOR signalling. Gene expression data and immunohistochemistry indicated increased HIF1 alpha activation and nuclear localisation in Leydig cells of BTP exposed animals. As HIF1 alpha is reported to disrupt testosterone synthesis, these results provide a potential mechanism for the pathogenesis of this testicular phenotype, and TDS in humans.

AB  - This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the dynamics of a three-level vertical food chain model, specifically focusing on the interactions between vegetation, herbivores, and predators in a Snowshoe hare-Canadian lynx system. By simplifying the model through dimensional analysis, we determine conditions for equilibrium existence and identify various types of bifurcations, including Saddle-Node and Hopf bifurcations. Additionally, the study explores codimension-two bifurcations such as Bogdanov-Takens (BT) and zero-Hopf bifurcations. Coefficient formulas of normal forms are derived through the use of center manifold reduction and normal form theory. The study also presents an approximation of homoclinic orbits near a BT bifurcation of the system by computing explicit asymptotics based on regular perturbation methods. Utilizing the MATLAB package MATCONT, a family of limit cycles and their associated bifurcations are computed, including limit point cycles, period-doubling bifurcations, cusp points of cycles, fold-flip bifurcations, and various resonance bifurcations (R1, R2, R3, and R4). The biological implications of the findings are discussed in detail, highlighting how the identified bifurcations and dynamics can impact the population dynamics of vegetation, herbivores, and predators in real-world ecosystems. Numerical experiments validate the theoretical results and provide further support for the conclusions.

   Fear extinction is the driving mechanism to reduce the fear response, and it is the basis of exposure-based cognitive-behavioral therapy. Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) seems to be involved in regulating cognitive function, and its relationship with fear extinction memory has not been reported. BChE knockout mice and wild-type mice with administration of (R)-bambuterol, a BChE inhibitor, were used in this study. In addition to immunohistochemistry and metabolite analysis using mass spectrometry imaging, the influence of age on the conditioned fear test, Morris water maze experiment, and open field test were carefully evaluated. Our results showed that BChE inhibition accelerates the fear extinction memory in mice and delays the cognitive decline in the early stages of aging.
   Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) is detected in plaques preferentially in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and may be associated with stress disorders. However, the physiological function of BChE in the central nervous system remains to be further investigated. BChE knockout (KO) mice and wild-type (WT) mice with orally or intranasal administration of (R)-bambuterol were used to explore the effect of BChE on behavior changes. (R)-bambuterol is a specific and reversible inhibitor of BChE. The behavior changes were evaluated and compared among 3-10 month old mice. Our finding showed that BChE KO and (R)-bambuterol administration enhanced episodic memory, including fear conditioning memory and fear extinction memory in fear conditioning and fear extinction test. BChE KO and (R)-bambuterol administered mice rescued age-related spatial memory and general activity in the water maze test and open field test. The brain metabolomics were imaged using a desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging (DESI-MSI). The image of DESI-MS demonstrated that glutamine content increased in the brain of BChE KO mice. In conclusion, this study found that inhibition of BChE ameliorated episodic and spatial memories. This study also suggested that (R)-bambuterol as a BChE inhibitor has the potential application in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and early cognitive decline.

AB  - It has been suggested that contextual fear conditioning can be supported by either an elemental system, where individual features of the environment are associated with shock, or a configural system, where environmental features are bound together and associated with shock. Although the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) is known to be involved in contextual fear conditioning, it is not clear whether it contributes to the elemental or configural system. To isolate the role of the RSC in contextual fear conditioning, the current experiments examined the influence of RSC lesions on the context preexposure facilitation effect, a procedure known to produce conditioning to a configural representation of context. In Experiment 1, rats that were preexposed to the conditioning context froze more compared to rats that were not, replicating the context preexposure facilitation effect. Although pretraining lesions of the RSC had no impact on the context preexposure facilitation effect (Experiment 2a), posttraining lesions attenuated the effect (Experiment 2b), suggesting that the RSC normally contributes to a configural context representation. Retrohippocampal contributions to contextual fear conditioning are discussed.

AB  - Ionic skin with ionic mechanotransduction similar to human skin can perceive stimuli by ionic conduction, holding great potential in novel human-machine interactions. However, the high-density integration of ionic skins still faces significant challenges due to the difficulty in fabricating high-density patterned ionogel arrays with simple manufacturing processes. Herein, the study reports a high-density ionic skin (HI-Skin) based on ionogel array patterned by direct microlithography. The photosensitive ionogel (PIG) is synthesized by rapid ultraviolet-induced in situ photopolymerization process. The direct microlithography of PIG is developed, which allows to directly pattern ionogel precursors by selective exposure to ultraviolet light and development. Simple and low-cost preparation of PIG array with the minimum line width of 200 mu m is realized. Furthermore, HI-Skin is constructed by integrating patterned PIG arrays with row and column electrodes, and the density is up to 49/cm2. The HI-Skin demonstrates high sensitivity of 126.8 kPa-1 and low crosstalk of -8.93 dB. By integrating the HI-Skin and a microcontroller, a multichannel signal acquisition system is built to achieve detection of multiple motion trajectories. This work opens an avenue for the simple construction of high-density ionic skin.

AB  - In interactions between plants and herbivorous insects, the traits enabling phytophagous insects to overcome chemical defenses of their host plants have evolved multiple times. A prominent example of such adaptive key innovations in herbivorous insects is nitrile specifier proteins (NSPs) that enabled Pierinae butterflies to colonize Brassicales host plants that have a glucosinolate-myrosinase defense system. Although the evolutionary aspects of NSP-encoding genes have been studied in some Pierinae taxa (especially among Pieris butterflies), the ancestral evolutionary state of NSPs is unclear due to the limited genomic information available for species within Pierinae. Here, we generate a high-quality genome assembly and annotation of Leptosia nina, a member of a small tribe, Leptosiaini. L. nina uses as its main host Capparaceae plants, one of the ancestral hosts within Pierinae. By using similar to 90-fold coverage of Oxford Nanopore long reads and Illumina short reads for subsequent polishing and error correction, we constructed a final genome assembly that consisted of 286 contigs with a total of 225.8 Mb and an N50 of 10.7 Mb. Genome annotation with transcriptome hints predicted 16,574 genes and covered 98.3% of BUSCO genes. A typical NSP gene is composed of three tandem domains found in Pierinae butterflies; unexpectedly, we found a new NSP-like gene in Pierinae composed of only two tandem domains. This newly found NSP-like gene in L. nina provides important insights into the evolutionary dynamics of domain and gene duplication events relating to host-plant adaptation in Pierinae butterflies.

AB  - An increase in nitrogen (N) use efficiency (NUE) in agriculture is a requirement for sustainable development. The reduction in nitrogen inputs might benefit from the residual N of former organic fertilization procedures. A 10 year experiment was established in a rainfed Mediterranean system (barley-wheat rotation). The objective of this experiment was to quantify the N residual effects of a single pig slurry (PS) application at sowing (20, 40, and 80 m3 ha-1) and up to three years later. The mineral N equivalence method was used to compare the grain yield (GY) and the whole-plant N uptake (WPNU) between the slurry fertilized plots (slurries applied in previous years) and annual mineral N fertilized ones (30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 kg N ha-1). From the total N applied with PS, a fraction of, ca., 21% accounted for the residual equivalent mineral N for a total period of three years after the PS application. For the 20 m3 ha-1 rate, the relative residual N based on the GY and WPNU equaled to 89-90% of the applied organic N, respectively. This rate also allowed for an increase in NUE values to above 33%. In semiarid areas, the introduction of residual N when scheduling fertilization is important to reduce N inputs and to increase NUE.

AB  - IntroductionRegulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the basal forebrain ameliorates sleep deprivation-induced fear memory impairments in rodents. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) targeting ATXN2 was a potential therapy for spinocerebellar ataxia, whose pathogenic mechanism associates with reduced BDNF expression. We tested the hypothesis that ASO7 targeting ATXN2 could affect BDNF levels in mouse basal forebrain and ameliorate sleep deprivation-induced fear memory impairments. MethodsAdult male C57BL/6 mice were used to evaluate the effects of ASO7 targeting ATXN2 microinjected into the bilateral basal forebrain (1 mu g, 0.5 mu L, each side) on spatial memory, fear memory and sleep deprivation-induced fear memory impairments. Spatial memory and fear memory were detected by the Morris water maze and step-down inhibitory avoidance test, respectively. Immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR, and Western blot were used to evaluate the changes of levels of BDNF, ATXN2, and postsynaptic density 95 (PSD95) protein as well as ATXN2 mRNA. The morphological changes in neurons in the hippocampal CA1 region were detected by HE staining and Nissl staining. ResultsASO7 targeting ATXN2 microinjected into the basal forebrain could suppress ATXN2 mRNA and protein expression for more than 1 month and enhance spatial memory but not fear memory in mice. BDNF mRNA and protein expression in basal forebrain and hippocampus was increased by ASO7. Moreover, PSD95 expression and synapse formation were increased in the hippocampus. Furthermore, ASO7 microinjected into the basal forebrain increased BDNF and PSD95 protein expression in the basal forebrain of sleep-deprived mice and counteracted sleep deprivation-induced fear memory impairments. ConclusionASOs targeting ATXN2 may provide effective interventions for sleep deprivation-induced cognitive impairments.

AB  - Scratching and stroking are tactile interactions used to improve the animal-human relationship and reduce stress in pigs. Both interactions resemble behaviours from the behavioural repertoire of pigs and have been applied in previous studies. To investigate the relative efficacy of these tactile interactions in eliciting positive emotions, we examined pigs' preferences for one of these interactions. Twelve recently inseminated gilts habituated to human contact were trained to discriminate between two handlers standing in two different locations in their home pen. One handler was providing stroking, the other one scratching. After 5 weeks of training, the pigs were tested for their preference. According to the preference index calculated based on the time the pigs spent being stroked and scratched, they did not significantly prefer one type of contact (p = 0.182, preference index median = 0.09, with -1 indicating an absolute preference for stroking and 1 an absolute preference for scratching). There was no significant difference between how often the pigs chose to approach the scratching or the stroking handler (p = 0.115, median scratching = 3.0, median stroking = 1.5), and neither did they approach one of them significantly earlier than the other (day 1: p = 0.126, median of difference between latency to approach scratching handler and latency to approach stroking handler = -55 s; day 2: p = 0.148, median of difference between latencies = -27 s). We did not find evidence for a general preference of one type of contact over the other. To improve the animal-human relationship, it might thus be most efficient to offer both types of tactile contact and adjust the contact depending on the pig's behaviour indicative of enjoyment.

AB  - Silicon (Si) enhances plant resistance against herbivores and improves crop yield. This study investigated the effect of foliar application of silicic acid (SA), an important available form of Si, on the population growth of aphids (Lipaphis erysimi), gas exchange parameters and yield of rapeseed. The first experiment with treatments of foliar spray of 0.4% SA and a control, revealed a significant reduction in L. erysimi population growth in the 0.4% SA treatment (235.60 aphids/ plant) compared to the control (311.16 aphids/ plant). Additionally, the 0.4% SA treatment significantly enhanced rapeseed yield, with 68.28 siliqua per plant, 15.16 seeds per siliqua and 3.73 g yield per plant, compared to the control with 56.08 siliqua per plant, 13.08 seeds per siliqua and 3.26 g yield per plant. The second experiment with treatments of 0.4% SA alone, aphid alone, 0.4% SA + aphid and a control, showed no significant changes in gas exchange parameters for 0.4% SA and the control. However, 0.4% SA + aphid and aphid alone treatments significantly reduced the gas exchange parameters. Notably, 0.4% SA + aphid exhibited a lesser reduction in photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance compared to aphid alone treatment, indicating the role of SA in enhancing gas exchange parameters during L. erysimi infestation in rapeseed. These findings suggest the beneficial application of SA in rapeseed to reduce aphid infestation, increase gas exchange parameters and improve yield.

AB  - Simple Summary Understanding the genetics of traits related to curing is crucial to both revealing the biological insights and effectively designing pig selective breeding programs. Ham weight loss after a prolonged dry-curing process was found to be polygenic, with multiple genomic regions across nearly all Sus scrofa chromosomes affecting the trait, each contributing a small amount of genetic variance. These regions were located in intergenic regions, regulatory regions (enhancer, promoter or open chromatin regions) and intronic regions of specific genes. Genes linked to curing-related traits (ham weight loss, drip loss, proteolysis), as well as genes specifically associated with animal growth and fat metabolism, were identified. The large number of genes associated with fat metabolism suggest that increasing the deposition of adipose tissue in pigs may be essential for ham curing aptitude.Abstract Dissecting the genetics of production traits in livestock is of outmost importance, both to understand biological mechanisms underlying those traits and to facilitate the design of selection programs incorporating that information. For the pig industry, traits related to curing are key for protected designation of origin productions. In particular, appropriate ham weight loss after dry-curing ensures high quality of the final product and avoids economic losses. In this study, we analyzed data (N = 410) of ham weight loss after approximately 20 months of dry-curing. The animals used for ham production were purebred pigs belonging to a commercial line. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 29,844 SNP markers revealed the polygenic nature of the trait: 221 loci explaining a small percentage of the variance (0.3-1.65%) were identified on almost all Sus scrofa chromosomes. Post-GWAS analyses revealed 32 windows located within regulatory regions and 94 windows located in intronic regions of specific genes. In total, 30 candidate genes encoding receptors and enzymes associated with ham weight loss (MTHFD1L, DUSP8), proteolysis (SPARCL1, MYH8), drip loss (TNNI2), growth (CDCA3, LSP1, CSMD1, AP2A2, TSPAN4), and fat metabolism (AGPAT4, IGF2R, PTDSS2, HRAS, TALDO1, BRSK2, TNNI2, SYT8, GTF2I, GTF2IRD1, LPCAT3, ATN1, GNB3, CMIP, SORCS2, CCSER1, SPP1) were detected.

AB  - Concerns about energy security and environmental risks have sparked interest in edible and non-edible seed oils as potential renewable feedstocks for biodiesel production. A study was conducted to investigate the population structure and regeneration status of woody seed oil species in the districts of Chobe and Ngamiland. The population structure and regeneration condition of woody seed oil species were studied in 20 x 20 m (400 m(2)) quadrats spaced 50 m apart along a parallel line transect. Data on the identity of all woody species, the number of all live individuals, and the diameter at breast height (DBH) of individuals with DBH > 2 cm of each woody species were collected in each quadrat. The diversity (H-y) and evenness (J(y)) of woody seed oil species were 1.53, 1.42 and 0.71, and 0.85, 0.73 and 0.51 in Parakarungu, Seronga and Shorobe, respectively. Ximenia caffra was the dominant woody seed oil plant in Shorobe and Seronga, and exhibited an inverted J-shaped curve with continuous diameter classes distribution. Trichilia emetica was only found in Parakarungu, where it was the second dominant species and demonstrated excellent recruitment and regeneration. In Shorobe and Seronga, Croton megalobotrys was the second most dominant species. It had low recruitment, which was most likely due to herbivory and predation on seeds and seedlings. The least prevalent species (Sclerocarya birrea, Schinziophyton rautanenii and Guibourtia coleosperma) had no representation in the intermediate diameter-classes, which might be attributed to the selective removal in these diameter-classes. The examination of the population structure of woody seed oil species indicated variations in patterns of diameter-class distribution, indicating differences in the population dynamics of the species across the study areas. The least dominant species experienced hindered recruitment and regeneration due to herbivory and anthropogenic influences.

AB  - With the ongoing rapid growth of the human population, the industrial development of mass insect rearing for feed and food is gaining momentum. This approach has proved to be a more efficient and effective alternative to traditional livestock to produce animal protein. In this context, the Tenebrio molitor production sector emerges as highly promising in the edible insect market, being among the most commonly bred species in the large-scale insect rearing industry. A recent modification of the European regulatory framework in this matter has authorized insect-produced feed for pigs and poultry, which will boost the creation of new insect industries, resulting in huge quantities of frass, the insect excrement, that could be valorized. This by-product holds substantial amounts of nutrients and advantageous microorganisms that have enormous potential for organic farming. It typically exhibits high organic content and an abundance of essential nutrients like nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K), alongside a narrow carbon (C) to nitrogen (N) ratio. In addition to providing plants with essential macronutrients, frass has been discovered to boost soil microbial biomass and introduce biomolecules and microbes that foster plant growth. The study of utilizing frass in sustainable agriculture is a relatively new and actively researched field in recent years. By conducting a comprehensive review of peer reviewed works, this article highlights the advantages associated with the effects of its use as organic fertilizer. Among these, the effect of frass as (1) a plant growth promoter and productivity enhancer and as (2) phytofortifyer against biotic and abiotic stresses, has been underlined in recent studies. With regard to its promoting effect, it has been observed that the effects of frass depend very much on its dose and the type of crop, with remarkably favorable results in many of the tests carried out. Hence, frass derived from the mass rearing of yellow mealworm for feed and food, could serve as an important and potent source of organic fertilizer in intensive horticultural crops or in highvalue woody crops, contributing to a more sustainable agriculture, which can decrease the use of conventional synthetic agrochemicals.

AB  - Deep-seated relict permafrost was identified in borehole Udryn PIG-1 (north-eastern Poland) at depths from +450 to 357 m. In potential its extant provides an opportunity to expand the known effective realm of grain weathering. Specifically, uncertainty exists as to whether or not glacial-period frost weathering could even occur at such considerable depths, which is well outside an active-layer range (i.e., beyond the currently acknowledged domain of grain weathering). Sand deposits collected at a 410.70-396.75 m depth were subjected to grain-size analysis, then 0.5-0.8 mm quartz-grain surfaces were analysed under stereoscopic and scanning electron microscopy. The obtained results indicate that these relict-permafrost grains were both mechanically and chemically weathered. Mechanical weathering of quartz grains is identified as P- & F-type weathering. The former is associated with an increase in stress generated both by overlying ice-sheet masses and permafrost degradation. Here mechanical weathering was facilitated by the presence of well-sorted sediment, rounded or well-rounded grains, and high porosity. Its effects are microtextures such as breakage blocks and conchoidal fractures. Ftype weathering is/was generated by freezing water in various sorts of cavities and cracks. Weathering is directly associated with the presence of permafrost at this depth. Additionally, chemical weathering is recorded on quartz-grain surfaces in the form of a ragged discontinuous coating. It has been proven here that weathering of quartz grains is not just a near-surface phenomenon, but also occurs deep below Earth's surface.

AB  - Chromosomal variation among closely related taxa is common in both plants and animals, and can reduce rates of introgression as well as promote reproductive isolation and speciation. In mammals, studies relating intro-gression to chromosomal variation have tended to focus on a few model systems and typically characterized levels of introgression using small numbers of loci. Here we took a genome-wide approach to examine how introgression rates vary among four closely related horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus pearsoni group) that possess different diploid chromosome numbers (2n = 42, 44, 46, and 60) resulting from Robertsonian (Rb) changes (fissions/fusions). Using a sequence capture we obtained orthologous loci for thousands of nuclear loci, as well as mitogenomes, and performed phylogenetic and population genetic analyses. We found that the taxon with 2n = 60 was the first to diverge in this group, and that the relationships among the three other taxa (2n = 42, 44 and 46) showed discordance across our different analyses. Our results revealed signatures of multiple ancient introgression events between the four taxa, with evidence of mitonuclar discordance in phylogenetic trees and reticulation events in their evolutionary history. Despite this, we found no evidence of recent and/or ongoing introgression between taxa. Overall, our results indicate that the effects of Rb changes on the reduction of introgression are complicated and that these may contribute to reproductive isolation and speciation in concert with other factors (e.g. phenotypic and genic divergence).

AB  - Current knowledge of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in semi-permeable membrane-covered thermophilic compost (smHTC) is limited. Therefore, this study provided a comprehensive characterization of composition and transformation of DOM in smHTC using multiple spectroscopic methods and ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry. The results showed that the values of SUVA(280), SUVA(254), A(240-400) (0.042, 0.048, 34.193) in smHTC were higher than those of conventional thermophilic composting (cTC) (0.030, 0.037, 18.348), and the increment of P(V,n )in smHTC were 2.4 times higher than that of cTC. These results suggested that smHTC accelerated the humification process by promoting the degradation of labile DOM and the production of humus-like substances. Mass spectrometry further confirmed that the DOM of smHTC possessed higher degree of aromatization and humification, based on the lower H/C (1.14), higher aromaticity index (0.34) and double bond equivalence (10.36). Additionally, smHTC increased the proportion of carboxyl-rich, unsaturated and aromatic compounds, and simultaneously improved the degradation of aliphatic/proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, along with even some refractory substances such as CHO subcategory (24.1%), especially lignin-like structures (14.8%). This investigation provided molecular insights into the composition and transformations of DOM in smHTC, and extended the current molecular mechanisms of humification in composting.

AB  - Protected areas are increasingly prone to violent extremism spillover, with dramatic consequences for both local people and wildlife populations. Due to the influence of violent extremist groups, science and policy generally fade away. We outline the case of the W-Arly-Pendjari complex of protected areas in West Africa (Burkina Faso, Benin, and Niger), 62% of which is currently under the control of violent extremist groups. The last large population of West African elephants may soon disappear if no action is taken. We discuss the roles of conservation science and policy in protected areas under violent extremism spillover, namely (i) maintaining and reinforcing international support, (ii) authentically engaging local communities in conservation and management strategies, and (iii) planning long-term conservation and security strategies.

AB  - Various primate species, including golden snub-nosed monkeys, Rhinopithecus roxellana, form highly complex multilevel social systems. Breeding bands of snub-nosed monkeys maintain stability even though multiple one-male units (OMUs) within a band do not appear to engage in affiliative behaviours among units. As such, female dispersal within breeding bands may be a key factor related to social stability in these complex social systems. However, how individual and group behaviours influence both the formation of this complex social system and the maintenance of social stability within it remain to be fully elucidated. In the current study, based on 16 years of accumulated data, we investigated female dispersal in a wild population of golden snub-nosed monkeys in the Qinling Mountains of China. Using social network analysis and dynamic social modelling, we found that male take-over had no influence on the dominance rank of an OMU, whereas the number of breeding females within an OMU had a sig-nificant positive effect on rank. Both the number of breeding females and the number of females entering an OMU had significant positive effects on eigenvector centrality of an OMU. Female dispersal between OMUs decreased the clustering coefficient and reduced the risk of subgroup formation. In addition, fe-male kinship matrices between units were not significantly correlated with association behaviour pat-terns. Thus, this study sheds light on the internal mechanisms that drive social stability in a complex primate social system.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB  - Long-term fertilization has shown a high relevance as regards soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration, but the degree of stability of the sequestered SOC has not been widely studied up to now. Using physical fractionation combined with laboratory incubation and NMR spectroscopy, we evaluated the differences in SOC stability caused by long-term fertilization. Four SOC fractions were isolated and examined for contents and chemical composition and cumulative amount of CO2-C respired from the fractions under six fertilization treatments: control (CK); balanced inorganic fertilization (NPK); NPK combined with pig manure (MNPK); NPK combined 1.5 times of pig manure (1.5MNPK); and NPK combined with high amount of manure (M2NPK). The highest contents of SOC were recorded for the coarse particulate organic carbon (cPOC) fraction, ranging from 17.25 to 30.47 g kg-1 under CK and M2NPK. The highest cumulative amount of CO2-C was released from the cPOC fraction under manure treatments (M2NPK and 1.5NPKM), which was 56 and 43% higher than that from CK, whereas the lowest amount of CO2-C was released from the mineral associated-C (MOC) fraction under the same treatments, being 65 and 49% higher than that released from CK, suggesting low SOC stability in cPOC and high SOC stability in MOC fractions. However, manure treatments (M2NPK and 1.5NPKM) greatly lowered the specific amount of C-mineralized (C-mineralized per unit total SOC) in fractions and whole soil, suggesting the ability of manure to accumulate more SOC by reducing SOC losses. Moreover, carbonyl-C was found to be the form of SOC experiencing major degree of sequestration under current fertilization practices. The SOC stability indices; aromaticity index (AI), hydrophobicity index (HI) and alkyl-C/O-alkyl-C were found to be higher in manure treated plots further suggesting higher stability of SOC under manure addition. Thus, long-term manure combined with mineral fertilizers would enhance SOC stability through minimizing SOC losses and promoting accumulation of stable C forms in a Chinese Mollisol.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of the optimization of dietary energy supply on the growth performance, nutrient digestibility, energy metabolism, nutrient oxidation, slaughter performance, and meat quality of growing and fattening pigs under a low-temperature environment. In this study, forty-eight 60-day-old growing barrows (Duroc x Landrace x Large White) with an initial body weight of 31.24 +/- 3.56 kg were completely randomized into two treatment groups, with four replicates in each treatment group and six pigs in each replicate. The two groups were fed diets with equal protein levels and different energy levels (a conventional diet and an energy-optimized diet); the dietary energy level was increased by 8% by adding 6% fat, and the two groups were kept at the same ambient temperature (10 +/- 1 degrees C) all day. After 5 d of prefeeding, the final weight reached approximately 110.00 kg prior to slaughter (99 days of age), and four pigs with a body weight of about 80.00 kg were selected in the two groups for digestion, metabolism, and respiratory calorimetry. The results showed that the average daily feed intake of the TES group (energy-optimized diet group, high fat and energy) was lower than that of the CON group (conventional diet group, normal fat and energy) (p < 0.05). Compared with the CON group, the feed-to-gain ratio was lower in the TES group during the fattening period (60-110 kg) (p < 0.05). Compared to the CON group, fat and energy digestibility in the TES group were higher (p < 0.05), fecal nitrogen and urine nitrogen were lower (p < 0.05), the nitrogen deposition rate increased (p < 0.05), and fat oxidation and the sedimentation energy rate also increased (p < 0.05). The serum triglyceride concentration in the TES group was higher than that in the CON group (p < 0.05). Compared to the CON group, the carcass weight, body fat content, backfat thickness, and eye muscle area in the TES group increased (p < 0.05); the L* value of flesh color also increased (p < 0.05); and the shear force was lower (p < 0.05). The dietary energy should be optimized under a low-temperature environment, and the feed conversion efficiency of fattening pigs could be improved by improving dietary energy levels by adding fat, increasing the fat oxidation proportion, promoting nitrogen deposition and sedimentation energy, and improving slaughter performance and meat quality.

AB  - Background: There is increasing evidence of associations between residential proximity to livestock farms and respiratory morbidity, but less is known about potential effects on respiratory mortality among residents.
   Objectives: We aimed to assess potential associations between respiratory mortality and residential proximity to (intensive) livestock farming.
   Methods: In DUELS, a national census-based cohort, we selected all inhabitants from rural and semi-urban areas of the Netherlands, aged >= 30 years and living at the same address for five years up to baseline (2004). We followed these similar to 4 million individuals for respiratory mortality (respiratory system diseases, chronic lower respiratory diseases, pneumonia) from 2005 to 2012. We computed the average number of cattle, pigs, chicken, and mink present in 500 m, 1000 m, 1500 m and 2000 m of each individual's residence in the period 1999-2003. Analyses were conducted using Cox proportional hazards regression, adjusting for potential confounders at individual and neighbourhood level.
   Results: We found evidence that living up to 2000 m of pig farms was associated with respiratory mortality, namely from chronic lower respiratory diseases, with Hazard Ratios ranging from 1.06 (1.02, 1.10) in people living close to low numbers (>= median) of pigs in 2000 m. We also found indications of higher pneumonia mortality in people living near mink farms.
   Conclusion: Our results are in line with previous findings of adverse respiratory effects in people living near livestock farms. Little is known about the physical, chemical, and biological exposures leading to respiratory morbidity and mortality warranting further explorations of air contaminants in the vicinity of livestock farms.

AB  - An animal mammary bioreactor is regarded as an excellent biological system which is applied to produce large-scale recombinant proteins in milk. However, there are no effective methods to produce a large amount of some pharmaceutical proteins, such as human follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), by large animal mammary gland bioreactors due to the fact that accumulation of excessive bioactive FSH might cause serious diseases in animals. Here, we report a novel strategy of preparing recombinant human FSH (rhFSH) from goat mammary glands, which could avoid the accumulation of bioactive FSH in goats. First, the single inactive FSH alpha and FSH beta subunits expressed in goat mammary epithelial cells and goat mammary glands were performed to reassemble in vitro and were found to self-assemble into a complete heterodimer rhFSH at 4 degrees C and pH 7.4. Further, a cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) induction assay showed that the cAMP levels in cell lysate of HEK 293/FSHR cells were increased by about 8-fold in reassembled rhFSH groups than that in the control group (P < 0.01). Pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that the reassembled rhFSH from goat mammary glands was comparable to that of the commercially available Gonal-F (P > 0.05). In addition, the increasing dose of reassembled rhFSH significantly promoted ovulation of mouse and ovary weight gain of Sprague Dawley rat compared with the control groups and maximum values were up to 3-fold (P < 0.01) and 2.8-fold (P < 0.01), respectively. The reassembled rhFSH showed a similar effect to Gonal-F in inducing expression of FSH target genes in vivo and activating the PI3K pathway in granulosa cells. Our study developed a novel method to produce rhFSH and provided the basis for preparing FSH by the goat mammary gland bioreactor with less health problems on the producing animals.

AB  - Theory predicts relaxed host specificity and high host vagility should contribute to reduced genetic structure in parasites while strict host specificity and low host vagility should increase genetic structure. Though these predictions are intuitive, they have never been explicitly tested in a population genomic framework. Trypanorhynch tapeworms, which parasitize sharks and rays (elasmobranchs) as definitive hosts, are the only order of elasmobranch tapeworms that exhibit considerable variability in their definitive host specificity. This allows for unique combinations of host use and geographic range, making trypanorhynchs ideal candidates for studying how these traits influence population-level structure and genetic diversity. Multiplexed shotgun genotyping (MSG) data sets were generated to characterize component population structure and infrapopulation diversity for a representative of each trypanorhynch suborder: the ray-hosted Rhinoptericola megacantha (Trypanobatoida) and the shark-hosted Callitetrarhynchus gracilis (Trypanoselachoida). Adults of R. megacantha are more host-specific and less broadly distributed than adults of C. gracilis, allowing correlation between these factors and genetic structure. Replicate tapeworm specimens were sequenced from the same host individual, from multiple conspecific hosts within and across geographic regions, and from multiple definitive host species. For R. megacantha, population structure coincided with geography rather than host species. For C. gracilis, limited population structure was found, suggesting a potential link between degree of host specificity and structure. Conspecific trypanorhynchs from the same host individual were found to be as, or more, genetically divergent from one another as from conspecifics from different host individuals. For both species, high levels of homozygosity and positive FIS values were documented.

AB  - The objective of this study is to investigate the molecular regulatory mechanisms of non-coding RNA (ncRNA) during the developmental process of multi-litter sheep ovaries and identify key regulatory genes that enhance the reproductive capacity of sheep. This study selected Small-Tail Han sheep (multi-litter sheep) and Ujumuqin sheep (single-litter sheep) as comparative models, constructed the expression profiles of ncRNAs and mRNAs in ovarian tissues, identified differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs, circRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs, and performed target gene prediction along with functional and signaling pathway enrichment analyses. Reproduction-related pathways were further screened to construct competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) regulatory networks (lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA and circRNA-miRNA-mRNA). Finally, the dual-luciferase reporter gene assay system was employed to perform the functional validation of the relevant targeted regulatory effects. A comprehensive screening identified 411 DE lncRNAs, 322 DE circRNAs, 26 DE miRNAs, and 29 DEGs from the ovarian tissues of Ujumqin and Small-Tail Han sheep. The results of the Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses demonstrated that the DE target genes were significantly enriched in pathways associated with cell dedifferentiation, the positive regulation of embryonic development, glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis, Hippo signaling, and other signaling pathways. To identify genes associated with reproductive processes, we performed differential expression screening followed by pathway enrichment analysis, which revealed significant enrichment in reproductive regulatory pathways. Based on these findings, we constructed a ceRNA regulatory network incorporating 22 DEGs, 17 DE lncRNAs, three DE circRNAs, and one DE miRNA. Our analysis revealed that oar-let-7a is involved in signaling pathways such as oocyte meiosis and Hippo, suggesting it may serve as a key miRNA regulating the trait of multiple offspring. The dual-luciferase reporter assay was employed to confirm that oar-let-7a directly targets and regulates the expression of CPEB1. Additionally, it was demonstrated that circRNA803 and lncRNA MSTRG.19726 function as molecular sponges to competitively bind and regulate oar-let-7a. These findings suggest that oar-let-7a mediates the expression of CPEB1 via circRNA803 and lncRNA MSTRG.19726 sponge adsorption, thereby regulating the process of follicular dominance in sheep. The qRT-PCR method was employed to validate the expression patterns of nine randomly selected DEGs, and the results corroborated the reliability of the RNA-seq sequencing data. This study investigated the coordinated regulatory mechanism of DE ncRNAs and their corresponding target genes, identifying a ceRNA network, circRNA803/lncRNA MSTRG.19726-oar-let-7a-CPEB1, which plays a critical role in regulating the process of follicular dominance in sheep. These findings provide fundamental data for uncovering the reproductive potential of sheep and facilitate a comprehensive understanding of their reproductive characteristics, which hold significant guiding implications for enhancing reproductive efficiency.

AB  - Nitrogen is a critical nutrient for rice production which is mostly supplemented through chemical fertilizers. However, their indiscriminate use has not only increased the cost of production but also adversely affected the environment. Legumes form a symbiosis with rhizobia to fix atmospheric nitrogen in the form of ammonia. Legumes also form symbiotic associations with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) for phosphorus uptake from soil. Formation of symbiotic associations in legumes with rhizobia and AMF utilize a shared genetic network known as a common symbiotic signalling pathway (CSSP). Similar to legumes, rice forms a symbiotic association only with AMF and possesses a similar CSSP that promotes the formation of arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis (AMS). However, there is no Nod factor (NF) perceiving genes reported in rice which are essential for rhizobial symbiosis found in legumes. Hence, to perceive the NF from rhizobium, we developed transgenic rice lines J5hL by transferring legume-specific receptor-like kinase (RLK) genes (MtLYK3 and MtNFP) along with MtDMI2, LjLNP, and MtSYMREM1 necessary for RLKs. We also developed RheCM transgenic rice line by transferring the Cameleon calcium (Ca2+) sensor gene and crossed the two transgenic lines to develop J5hLCm. The NF induced root hair deformation in J5hL and Ca2+ fluxes at root hair tips and spiking around nuclei in root hairs of J5hLCm plants. These results showed that the rice plants expressing MtLYK3 and MtNFP gained the ability to perceive NF and transmit nod signals appropriately to trigger Ca2+ fluxes and spiking akin to that in legume roots.

AB  - Joannesia princeps presents two acropetiolar glands, with topography and morphology similar to extrafloral nectaries (EFNs). In the present study we described the anatomy and the ultrastructure of acropetiolar glands, and analyzed the histochemistry and chemical composition of secretion in order to (i) verify if these glands are nectaries and (ii) understand the complexity of secretion and the cell compartment involved with the production and exudation. The samples were processed according to the standard methodology for anatomical and ultrastructural studies. The gland has uniseriate epidermis composed by palisade secretory cells. The secretion produced by the secretory epidermis is accumulated in a subcuticular space, which causes distention of the cuticle until it be broken, allowing the exudation. Xylem and phloem vascularize the gland, with the phloem reaching the nectariferous parenchyma, even close to the secretory epidermis. The histochemical tests revealed polysaccharides, mucilage and protein in the secretion, whereas the exudate chemical analysis showed that glucose, fructose and sucrose are components of the nectar, being fructose the sugar predominant. The secretion is complex and different organelles are involved in this synthesis and secretion process. Secretory parenchyma cells presented a large peripheral nucleus, vacuole with granular material, conspicuous endoplasmic reticulum, numerous mitochondria, plastids, and plasmodesmata. During the secretion process, a granular material is accumulated into the vacuole, which merges with the plasma membrane of the secretory epidermis, releasing this material into the periplasmatic spaces. After crossing the cell wall of the epidermal cell, the secretion is accumulated in a subcuticular space, until ready to be released by the cuticle disruption. Based on this study, we can affirm that the glands of it are extrafloral nectaries.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Egg yolk is inevitably associated with risks of microbial contamination and anti-cryoprotectant agents that necessitate the investigation of some synthetic alternatives. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the potential of carboxylated poly-L-lysine (CPLL) as a replacement for egg yolk during the cryosurvivability of Nili-Ravi buffalo sperm. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Semen collected from four Nili-Ravi buffalo bulls (two ejaculates / bull / day; total 40 ejaculates for five replicates) was cryopreserved in different experimental extenders viz: Control (CPLL 0%, egg yolk 20%); E1 (CPLL 5%, egg yolk 15%); E2 (CPLL 10%, egg yolk 10%); E3 (CPLL 15%, egg yolk 5%) and E4 (CPLL 20%, egg yolk 0%). Post-thaw quality was assessed in terms of sperm motility, plasma membrane integrity (PMI), viability, live:dead ratio, lipid peroxidation of sperm and total antioxidant capacity of seminal plasma. RESULTS: Sperm motility was improved (P<0.05) in extenders replacing 5%, 10% and 15% egg yolk with CPLL. Sperm PMI, viability and live:dead ratio also improved (P<0.05) in extenders replacing 10%, 15% and whole (20%) egg yolk with CPLL. In contrast, sperm DNA integrity was not different (P>0.05) when CPLL replaced egg yolk at any level. The lipid peroxidation level decreased with a concomitant increase in total antioxidant activity of seminal plasma when CPLL replaced egg yolk at 5%, 10%, 15% and 20%. CONCLUSION: Replacement of 15% egg yolk in the extender with CPLL improves all sperm quality parameters: motility, PMI, viability, live:dead ratio, lipid peroxidation of sperm and total antioxidant activity of seminal plasma.

AB  - Manure biogas residue has attracted increasing attention in waste recycling but faces substantial challenges because of its low carbon content, high ash content, and high heavy metal content. A novel sequential carbonization approach was proposed for recycling biogas residue; this approach consisted of pre-pyrolysis, activation with Ca(OH)(2), and then activation with KOH. Pig manure-derived biogas residue was upcycled into engineered biochar (EB) with a high yield (26 %) and showed excellent performance in removing a typical plasticizer, diethyl phthalate (DEP). The proportion of carbon content greatly increased from 18 % (biogas residue) to 67 % (EB); however, the ash content decreased from 50 % (biogas residue) to 24 % (EB). The concentration of heavy metals decreased, and Zn had the largest decrease from 713 mg kg(-1) to 61 mg kg(-1) (p < 0.001). The sorption of DEP onto EB was rapid and reached equilibrium within 20 h. The developed specific surface area of EB was 1247 m(2)/g and provided abundant sorption sites for DEP; additionally, the sorption quantity reached 309 mg/g. The sorption capacity was dominated by surface adsorption. The oxygen-containing functional groups, graphene structure, porous structure, and hydrophobicity of EB contributed to the pore filling, hydrogen bonding, pi-pi stacking, and partitioning processes. Furthermore, the EB showed excellent practical application potential and great cycling stability. A sequential carbonization strategy was proposed to upcycle manure biogas residue into the EB for DEP removal; moreover, this strategy can aid in the attainment of environmental sustainability, including sustainable waste management and environmental pollution mitigation.

AB  - In agricultural activities, there is an increasing need for organic fertilizers to use nature-friendly materials used to fertilize the soil. Farmers have been using granular organic fertilizers made from composted or dried manure of cattle, poultry, pigs, ash, bone meal, and other materials for some time, but the quantities of these organic fertilizers are not large. Biochar is also being intensively studied as a material to improve soil quality and plant growth and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from soil. The suitability of cattle manure compost, poultry manure, biochar, and their combinations for granular fertilizers was analyzed in this work. The preparation of biochar for granulation may have differences compared to other organic materials due to the moisture content, fractional composition, bulk density, and other parameters of the granulated material, so this work examines the physical-mechanical and chemical properties of cattle and poultry manure and biochar raw material and the final granulated product. Research has found that the fractional composition of raw materials under investigation manure and biochar was up to 2 mm. The moisture content of the studied raw material varied from 8.97% in the case of poultry manure to 25.11% in the case of cattle manure compost. The lowest moisture content was obtained due to additional drying. The addition of biochar reduces the granule density in investigated cases. Poultry manure granules were the most mechanically stable, with a semi-static stability of 382.6 +/- 78.08 N. After the addition of biochar, weaker binding properties were determined in the experimental granules. Analysis of the composition of elements shows that these granules can be used for fertilization or soil improvement. High concentrations of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) were detected in the granules. The obtained results showed that it is appropriate to enrich the manure granules with biochar.

AB  - Introduction In the field of agriculture, automated harvesting of Camellia oleifera fruit has become an important research area. However, accurately detecting Camellia oleifera fruit in a natural environment is a challenging task. The task of accurately detecting Camellia oleifera fruit in natural environments is complex due to factors such as shadows, which can impede the performance of traditional detection techniques, highlighting the need for more robust methods. Methods To overcome these challenges, we propose an efficient deep learning method called YOLO-CFruit, which is specifically designed to accurately detect Camellia oleifera fruits in challenging natural environments. First, we collected images of Camellia oleifera fruits and created a dataset, and then used a data enhancement method to further enhance the diversity of the dataset. Our YOLO-CFruit model combines a CBAM module for identifying regions of interest in landscapes with Camellia oleifera fruit and a CSP module with Transformer for capturing global information. In addition, we improve YOLOCFruit by replacing the CIoU Loss with the EIoU Loss in the original YOLOv5. Results By testing the training network, we find that the method performs well, achieving an average precision of 98.2%, a recall of 94.5%, an accuracy of 98%, an F1 score of 96.2, and a frame rate of 19.02 ms. The experimental results show that our method improves the average precision by 1.2% and achieves the highest accuracy and higher F1 score among all state-of-the-art networks compared to the conventional YOLOv5s network. Discussion The robust performance of YOLO-CFruit under different real-world conditions, including different light and shading scenarios, signifies its high reliability and lays a solid foundation for the development of automated picking devices.

AB  - The study evaluated dietary flushing on reproductive efficiency in 60 Santa Ines ewes, divided into three groups: (1) no supplementation, (2) 0.50% and (3) 1.00% supplementation of body weight. The supplement contained corn, soybean meal, oats, lime, bicalcium phosphate, mineral mixture, urea and yeast, administered three weeks before and during mating, which lasted for 46 days. Weight, body condition and weight gain were measured at the beginning and end of the feeding period. Milk production, lamb weight and biometric measurements were recorded until weaning. Supplementation did not significantly affect the ewes' weight, body condition indices or milk production. The percentages of twin births were: 19%, 52.9% and 44.4% (P=0.08), respectively for the ewes in the control group and for those that received supplements (0.50% and 1.00%). Lamb weight and biometric measurements were not significantly affected by maternal treatment or the sex of the lamb. Lambs born from single births were heavier than those from twin births (P<0.05), but the combined weights of twins at weaning were higher. Ewes with twins tended (P<0.09) to be more efficient than those with single birth lambs, weaning 41 kg of lambs per 100 kg of ewe weight, compared to 36 kg for single birth ewes. Flushing did not affect ewe weight or milk production, but it did increase the rate of twin births, improving reproductive efficiency.

KW  - Behaviors analysis
AB  - In the precision-driven field of intelligent livestock breeding, the accurate monitoring and tracking of individual pig behaviors are crucial for assessing health and preventing disease. However, the complex environment of pig farms and the dynamic nature of pig behaviors can lead to issues such as false positives, false negatives, and identity switches, which pose significant challenges for the monitoring of individual pig behaviors. To overcome these challenges, this study proposes a multi-object tracking (MOT) of pigs' behavior based on YOLOv5 fusion Byte (YOLOv5-Byte). This method first uses YOLOv5 to detect individual pig behaviors (lie, stand, eat, other) and uses the Byte method to track the behaviors of individual pigs. According to the behavior tracking results, we statistically analyze the different behaviors' time of each pig for one minute. Moreover, we introduce an innovative metric by combining pig behavior information and ID value to make a more specific and precise behavior analysis of each pig. The experimental results on public and private datasets show that the best tracking results are achieved based on the YOLOv5-Byte method among the three detectors YOLOv5, YOLOv8 and YOLOX combing with the Byte tracker. On public datasets, the three MOT methods exhibit only minor differences in tracking performance between situations with and without behavior classification, with a slight decrease in metrics. On the private dataset, the YOLOv5-Byte method demonstrates superior performance in higher-order tracking accuracy (HOTA), multiple-object tracking accuracy (MOTA), and identity switches (IDs), with values of 76.5%, 94.4%, and 56. Compared to YOLOX-Byte and YOLOv8-Byte, it outperforms them with 4.2 and 9.2 percentage points higher in HOTA, 1.6 and 9.7 percentage points higher in MOTA, and 28 and 14 fewer IDs. Under varying lighting conditions, the experimental results show that YOLOv5-Byte has best tracking results, achieving the behaviors tracking accuracy of over 80%. The results demonstrate YOLOv5-Byte can accurately track pig behavior and conduct statistical behaviors analysis in intricate farm environments, which has the potential to provide a technical support for assessing the health of pigs.

AB  - Sialylated human milk oligosaccharides (HMO), such as 3' -sialyllactose (3'-SL) and 6'-sialyllactose (6'-SL), are abundant throughout lactation and at much higher concentrations than are present in bovine milk or infant formulas. Previous studies have suggested that sialylated HMO may have neurocognitive benefits in early life. Recent research has focused on infant formula supplementation with key nutrients and bioactives to narrow the developmental gap between formula-fed and breastfed infants. Herein, we investigated the impact of supplemental 3'-SL or 6'-SL on cognitive and brain development at two time-points [postnatal days (PND) 33 and 61]. Two-day-old piglets (N = 75) were randomly assigned to commercial milk replacer ad libitum without or with 3'-SL or 6'-SL (added in a powdered form at a rate of 0.2673% on an as-is weight basis). Cognitive development was assessed via novel object recognition and results were not significant at both time-points (p > 0.05). Magnetic resonance imaging was used to assess structural brain development. Results varied between scan type, diet, and time-point. A main effect of diet was observed for absolute volume of white matter and 9 other regions of interest (ROI), as well as for relative volume of the pons on PND 30 (p < 0.05). Similar effects were observed on PND 58. Diffusion tensor imaging indicated minimal differences on PND 30 (p > 0.05). However, several dietary differences across the diffusion outcomes were observed on PND 58 (p < 0.05) indicating dietary impacts on brain microstructure. Minimal dietary differences were observed from myelin water fraction imaging at either time-point. Overall, sialyllactose supplementation had no effects on learning and memory as assessed by novel object recognition, but may influence temporally-dependent aspects of brain development.

AB  - Chinese wingnut (Pterocarya stenoptera) is a medicinally and economically important tree species within the family Juglandaceae. However, the lack of high-quality reference genome has hindered its in-depth research. In this study, we successfully assembled its chromosome-level genome and performed multiomics analyses to address its evolutionary history and synthesis of medicinal components. A thorough examination of genomes has uncovered a significant expansion in the Lateral Organ Boundaries Domain gene family among the winged group in Juglandaceae. This notable increase may be attributed to their frequent exposure to flood-prone environments. After further differentiation between Chinese wingnut and Cyclocarya paliurus, significant positive selection occurred on the genes of NADH dehydrogenase related to mitochondrial aerobic respiration in Chinese wingnut, enhancing its ability to cope with waterlogging stress. Comparative genomic analysis revealed Chinese wingnut evolved more unique genes related to arginine synthesis, potentially endowing it with a higher capacity to purify nutrient-rich water bodies. Expansion of terpene synthase families enables the production of increased quantities of terpenoid volatiles, potentially serving as an evolved defense mechanism against herbivorous insects. Through combined transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis, we identified the candidate genes involved in the synthesis of terpenoid volatiles. Our study offers essential genetic resources for Chinese wingnut, unveiling its evolutionary history and identifying key genes linked to the production of terpenoid volatiles.

AB  - Pregnancy and motherhood can have long-term effects on cognition and brain aging in both humans and rodents. Estrogens are related to cognitive function and neuroplasticity. Estrogens can improve cognition in postmenopausal women, but the evidence is mixed, partly due to differences in age of initiation, type of menopause, dose, formulation and route of administration. Additionally, past pregnancy influences brain aging and cognition as a younger age of first pregnancy in humans is associated with poorer aging outcomes. However, few animal studies have examined specific features of pregnancy history or the possible mechanisms underlying these changes. We examined whether maternal age at first pregnancy and estradiol differentially affected hippocampal neuroplasticity, inflammation, spatial reference cognition, and immediate early gene activation in response to spatial memory retrieval in middle-age. Thirteen-month-old rats (who were nulliparous (never mothered) or previously primiparous (had a litter) at three or seven months) received daily injections of estradiol (or vehicle) for sixteen days and were tested on the Morris Water Maze. An older age of first pregnancy was associated with impaired spatial memory but improved performance on reversal training, and increased number of new neurons in the ventral hippocampus. Estradiol decreased activation of new neurons in the dorsal hippocampus, regardless of parity history. Estradiol also decreased the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines based on age of first pregnancy. This work suggests that estradiol affects neuroplasticity and neuroinflammation in middle age, and that age of first pregnancy can have long lasting effects on hippocampus structure and function.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate cyclopropane fatty acids (CPFAs) as quality biomarkers of forage feedings in cheese fat obtained from ewes milk, based on two different dietary treatments (hay and silage). The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis detected CPFAs in most cheese samples, both from hay and silage-based diets. CPFA levels in cheese fat from hay feeding were positively correlated to the total trans-monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), whereas they were negatively correlated to cis-MUFAs, odd- and branched-chain fatty acids (i.e., C13:0 anteiso, C16:0 iso, and C17:1), and C22:5n-3, which are mainly associated with a low starch intake and grass pasture. Overall, the presence of CPFAs in ovine cheese fat suggests the use of silage, but it can also be an indicator of poor-quality hay forages. This approach confirmed the reliability of CPFAs as biomarkers of forage quality, especially in relation to the use of conserved forages and good livestock practices.

AB  - Simple Summary To achieve optimal growth performance and improved fertility in animals living on high plateaus, it is important to understand how high-altitude stress reduces fertility in females. This study analyzed the transcriptome dynamics of Tibetan sheep ovaries under high-altitude stress. High-altitude stress suppressed the expression of follicular development marker genes and impaired the luteinizing hormone/follicle-stimulating hormone signaling pathway. High-altitude stress also increased abnormally spliced isoforms of transcription factors and RNA processing factors. Therefore, high-altitude stress may reduce the fertility of Tibetan sheep by disrupting the normal expression/hormone signaling of follicular development genes. Further work is needed to decipher whether this phenomenon is a unique feature of Tibetan sheep or a general mechanism in animals under high-altitude stress. High-altitude stress threatens the survival rate of Tibetan sheep and reduces their fertility. However, the molecular basis of this phenomenon remains elusive. Here, we used RNA-seq to elucidate the transcriptome dynamics of high-altitude stress in Tibetan sheep ovaries. In total, 104 genes were characterized as high-altitude stress-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs). In addition, 36 DEGs contributed to ovarian follicle development, and 28 of them were downregulated under high-altitude stress. In particular, high-altitude stress significantly suppressed the expression of two ovarian lymphatic system marker genes: LYVE1 and ADAMTS-1. Network analysis revealed that luteinizing hormone (LH)/follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) signaling-related genes, such as EGR1, FKBP5, DUSP1, and FOS, were central regulators in the DEG network, and these genes were also suppressed under high-altitude stress. As a post-transcriptional regulation mechanism, alternative splicing (AS) is ubiquitous in Tibetan sheep. High-altitude stress induced 917 differentially alternative splicing (DAS) events. High-altitude stress modulated DAS in an AS-type-specific manner: suppressing skipped exon events but increasing retained intron events. C2H2-type zinc finger transcription factors and RNA processing factors were mainly enriched in DAS. These findings revealed high-altitude stress repressed ovarian development by suppressing the gene expression of LH/FSH hormone signaling genes and inducing intron retention of C2H2-type zinc finger transcription factors.

AB  - Due to their documented epidemiological relevance as hosts for influenza A viruses (IAV), humans, poultry and pigs in backyard production systems (BPS) within wetlands could be key to the emergence of novel IAV variants able to transmit between humans or animals. To better understand the circulation of IAV at the human-animal interface of BPS within wetlands, we studied IAV in backyard duck flocks and pig herds in the Pacific Coast of Guatemala. From April 2013 to October 2014, we estimated the monthly IAV per cent seropositive and viral positive flocks and herds in two resource-limited communities. We detected antibodies in sera against the IAV nucleoprotein through ELISA. We also detected IAV viral RNA in respiratory (ducks and pigs) and cloacal (ducks) swabs through rRT-PCR directed at the matrix gene. We attempted viral isolation in eggs or MDCK cells followed by sequencing from swabs positive for IAV. During our study period, IAV seropositivity in duck flocks was 38%, and viral positivity was 23% (n = 86 BPS sampled). IAV seropositivity in pig herds was 42%, and viral positivity was 20% (n = 90 BPS sampled). Both flocks and herds had detectable antibodies against IAV mostly year-round, and IAV was detected in several months. We isolated an H3N2 virus from one pig sampled at the end of 2013. Standard nucleotide BLAST searches indicate that the isolated virus was similar to seasonal viruses circulating in humans, suggesting human-to-pig transmission. Our data show concurrent circulation of IAV in multiple species of poultry and pigs that were commingled in rudimentary conditions in proximity to humans, but no significant risk factors could be identified.

AB  - Semen preservation quality affects the artificial insemination success rate, and seminal exosomes are rich in various proteins that are transferable to sperm and conducive to sperm-function preservation during storage. However, the specific effects of these proteins remain unclear. In this study, the specific effects of these proteins on semen preservation quality and fertilization capacity were investigated through a proteomic analysis of seminal exosomes from boars with high conception rates (HCRs) and low conception rates (LCRs). The results revealed significant differences in the expression of 161 proteins between the two groups, with the GPX5 level being significantly higher in the HCR group (p < 0.05). The role of GPX5 was further investigated by constructing engineered exosomes enriched with GPX5 (Exo-GPX5), which could successfully transfer GPX5 to sperm. Compared to the control group, Exo-GPX5 could significantly improve sperm motility on storage days 4 and 5 and enhance the acrosome integrity on day 5 (p < 0.05). Additionally, Exo-GPX5 increased the total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) of sperm, reduced the malondialdehyde (MDA) level, and decreased the expression of antioxidant proteins SOD1 and CAT (p < 0.05). In simulated fertilization experiments, Exo-GPX5-treated sperm exhibited higher capacitation ability and a significant increase in the acrosome reaction rate (p < 0.05). Overall, Exo-GPX5 can improve boar semen quality under 17 degrees C storage conditions and enhance sperm fertilization capacity.

AB  - The flocculation of (co -)digested cattle and pig manure has rarely been investigated, leading to a rather intuitive use of flocculants in manure treatment processes, resulting in overdosing and increasing costs. Here, we investigate the effect of molecular weight, charge density and branching of reference and commercially available flocculants by establishing the optimal flocculant dosage and the corresponding maximum organic matter removal. Higher molecular weight flocculants show increased turbidity removal as result of their long chains corresponding to a higher amount adsorption sites. Results presented show that polymers with an increased cationic charge density give moderate and unstable flocculation due to the low amounts of non -charged parts essential for the hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding. Further, the results show that a linear high molecular weight flocculant with a nonionic or a low anionic charge density is the most effective as it reached the highest organic matter removal at a low dosage.

AB  - Simple Summary ACADL long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, not only a key enzyme in the initiation step of fatty acid oxidation, but also plays an important role in adipocyte differentiation. In our study, we found that ACADL promotes intramuscular adipocyte differentiation in goats via the TNF signaling pathway. This study provides a theoretical basis for the study of adipocytes differentiation in goat intramuscular adipocytes. Intramuscular fat (IMF) deposits help improve meat quality such as marbling, juicy, flavor and tenderness. Long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (ACADL) is a key enzyme for catalyzing fatty acid oxidation, and studies have shown ACADL is involved in the deposition and differentiation of intramuscular adipocytes. However, the effect of ACADL on intramuscular adipocytes differentiation in goats needs further study. In this study, to explore the mechanism of ACADL on the development of goat intramuscular adipocytes, we constructed an over-expression plasmids and a SI-RNA of ACADL to explore the function of ACADL on the development of goat IMF. It was found that overexpression of ACADL promoted the differentiation of goat intramuscular adipocytes, and promoted the expression of fat cell differentiation marker genes lipoprotein lipase (LPL), peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma), APETALA-2-like transcription factor gene (AP2), CCAT enhancer binding protein (CEBP alpha), preadipocyte Factor 1 (Pref-1) and CCAT enhancer binding protein (CEBP beta), and the opposite trend occurred after interference. In addition, we screened of this related tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway by RNA-Seq. So, we validate the signaling pathway with inhibitor of TNF signaling pathway. In summary, these results indicate that ACADL promotes intramuscular adipocytes differentiation through activation TNF signaling pathway. This study provides an important basis for the mechanism of IMF development.

AB  - BackgroundThe hyolaryngeal apparatus generates biosonar pulses in the laryngeally echolocating bats. The cartilage and muscles comprising the hyolarynx of laryngeally echolocating bats are morphologically modified compared to those of non-bat mammals, as represented by the hypertrophied intrinsic laryngeal muscle. Despite its crucial contribution to laryngeal echolocation, how the development of the hyolarynx in bats differs from that of other mammals is poorly documented. The genus Rhinolophus is one of the most sophisticated laryngeal echolocators, with the highest pulse frequency in bats. The present study provides the first detailed description of the three-dimensional anatomy and development of the skeleton, cartilage, muscle, and innervation patterns of the hyolaryngeal apparatus in two species of rhinolophid bats using micro-computed tomography images and serial tissue sections and compares them with those of laboratory mice. Furthermore, we measured the peak frequency of the echolocation pulse in active juvenile and adult individuals to correspond to echolocation pulses with hyolaryngeal morphology at each postnatal stage.ResultsWe found that the sagittal crests of the cricoid cartilage separated the dorsal cricoarytenoid muscle in horseshoe bats, indicating that this unique morphology may be required to reinforce the repeated closure movement of the glottis during biosonar pulse emission. We also found that the cricothyroid muscle is ventrally hypertrophied throughout ontogeny, and that the cranial laryngeal nerve has a novel branch supplying the hypertrophied region of this muscle. Our bioacoustic analyses revealed that the peak frequency shows negative allometry against skull growth, and that the volumetric growth of all laryngeal cartilages is correlated with the pulse peak frequency.ConclusionsThe unique patterns of muscle and innervation revealed in this study appear to have been obtained concomitantly with the acquisition of tracheal chambers in rhinolophids and hipposiderids, improving sound intensity during laryngeal echolocation. In addition, significant protrusion of the sagittal crest of the cricoid cartilage and the separated dorsal cricoarytenoid muscle may contribute to the sophisticated biosonar in this laryngeally echolocating lineage. Furthermore, our bioacoustic data suggested that the mineralization of these cartilages underpins the ontogeny of echolocation pulse generation. The results of the present study provide crucial insights into how the anatomy and development of the hyolaryngeal apparatus shape the acoustic diversity in bats.

AB  - Lipid metabolic disturbances are associated with several diseases, such as type 2 diabetes or malignancy. In the last two decades, high-performance mass spectrometry-based lipidomics has emerged as a valuable tool in various fields of biology. However, the evaluation of macroscopic tissue homogenates leaves often undiscovered the differences arising from micron-scale heterogeneity. Therefore, in this work, we developed a novel laser microdissection-coupled shotgun lipidomic platform, which combines quantitative and broad-range lipidome analysis with reasonable spatial resolution. The multistep approach involves the preparation of successive cryosections from tissue samples, cross-referencing of native and stained images, laser microdissection of regions of interest, in situ lipid extraction, and quantitative shotgun lipidomics. We used mouse liver and kidney as well as a 2D cell culture model to validate the novel workflow in terms of extraction efficiency, reproducibility, and linearity of quantification. We established that the limit of dissectible sample area corresponds to about ten cells while maintaining good lipidome coverage. We demonstrate the performance of the method in recognizing tissue heterogeneity on the example of a mouse hippocampus. By providing topological mapping of lipid metabolism, the novel platform might help to uncover region-specific lipidomic alterations in complex samples, including tumors.

AB  - The effects of human activities are becoming clearer every year, with multiple reports of struggling and eroded ecosystems resulting in new threats of plant and animal extinctions throughout the world. It has been speculated that roadside tea-growing soils impact on metal dynamics from soil to tea plants and subsequently to tea infusion which may be threatened by increasingly unpredictable and dangerous surroundings. Furthermore, heavy metals released from vehicles on the national highway (NH) could be a source of metal contamination in roadside tea soils and tea plants. This study was articulated to realize the effect of NH on a buildup of selected metals (Cu, Cd, Fe, Mn, Ni, and Zn) in made tea along with repeated tea infusion. In general, metal concentration was found significantly higher in made tea prepared from the young shoots collected from the vicinity of NH. The results also showed that distance from the NH and infusion process significantly influenced to content of the analysed metal in tea infusions. The mean average daily intake (ADI) and hazard quotient (HQ) values of analysed tea samples were found in the orderMn degrees Fe degrees Zn degrees Cu degrees Ni degrees Cd and Mn degrees Cu degrees Zn degrees Fe degrees Ni degrees Cd, respectively. The HQ values of all analysed metals were found << 1, indicating that ingestion of tea infusion with analysed heavy metals should not cause a danger to human health. However, this study further demonstrates the consumption of tea infusion prepared from made tea around the vicinity of NH may contribute to a significantly higher quantity of metal intake in the human body. From the hierarchical cluster analysis, it has been observed that there are three homogenous groups of analysed heavy metals.

AB  - Hypoxia benefits the proliferation and maintenance of animal spermatogonial cells; however, the underlying mechanism remains incompletely understood. This study aims to investigate the role and mechanism of the hypoxia-glycolysis-histone lactylation axis in the proliferation of buffalo spermatogonial cells (bSCs). bSCs were cultured under different oxygen concentrations to observe changes in cell proliferation. RNA-seq was used to analyze gene expression and signaling pathways. Changes in lactylation were monitored, and CUT&Tag-seq was utilized to determine the regulatory effects of lactylation on gene expression. The glycolytic pathway was regulated to validate the results of the bioinformatic analysis. Oxygen concentrations between 2.5% and 10% support the proliferation of bSCs, with 5% having the most pronounced effect. An amount of 5% oxygen significantly increased the proliferation and pluripotency of bSCs while also promoting glycolysis and lactylation. Inhibition of glycolysis eliminated the proliferative effects of hypoxia. By analyzing genes associated with the key lactylation site H3K18la using CUT&Tag technology, we found that it is closely linked to genes involved in the regulation of proliferation. After inhibition of HK-2 expression, cell proliferation, H3K18la expression, and the expression of these target genes were all suppressed. Hypoxia promotes the proliferation of bSCs via activation of glycolysis, leading to an increase in H3K18la and altered expression of its target genes.

AB  - In polyandrous species, males face reproductive competition both before and after mating. Sexual selection thus shapes the evolution of both pre- and postcopulatory traits, creating competing demands on resource allocation to different reproductive episodes. Traits subject to strong selection exhibit accelerated rates of phenotypic divergence, and examining evolutionary rates may inform us about the relative importance and potential fitness consequences of investing in traits under either pre- or postcopulatory sexual selection. Here, we used a comparative approach to assess evolutionary rates of key competitive traits in two artiodactyl families, bovids (family Bovidae) and cervids (family Cervidae), where male-male competition can occur before and after mating. We quantified and compared evolutionary rates of male weaponry (horns and antlers), body size/mass, testes mass, and sperm morphometrics. We found that weapons evolve faster than sperm dimensions. In contrast, testes and body mass evolve at similar rates. These results suggest strong, but differential, selection on both pre- and postcopulatory traits in bovids and cervids. Furthermore, we documented distinct evolutionary rates among different sperm components, with sperm head and midpiece evolving faster than the flagellum. Finally, we demonstrate that, despite considerable differences in weapon development between bovids and cervids, the overall evolutionary patterns between these families were broadly consistent.

AB  - Soybean crop is regulated by abiotic and biotic stresses with great potential in reducing grain yield and quality. The selection of resistant cultivars is a promising approach for mitigating these damages. We evaluated the chemical profile of Glycine max leaves from different cultivars in order to explore their defense mechanisms against Spodoptera cosmioides caterpillars. We optimized solid-liquid extraction techniques using ultrasound bath and static headspace extraction. Additionally, we developed an approach based on liquid and gas chromatography for analyzing the chemical profile of G. max cultivars. The principal component analysis allowed the classification of transgenic cultivars, which are classified as susceptible to S. cosmioides, from those obtained by genetic improvement and resistant to the insect. Differences were observed in the abundance of phenolic glycosides, lipids, aldehydes, and alcohols. More specifically, S. cosmioides resistant cultivars presented molecules related to the jasmonic and salicylic acid pathways. Such data can contribute to a molecular understanding of phenotypic diversity in soybean cultivars, from plant quality to resistance mechanisms and adaptation, to environmental stress and herbivory.

AB  - Anaerobic digestion of goat dung and pawpaw seed and the fitness of some kinetic models in predicting the rate and cumulative production of biogas were investigated in this study, to compare biogas potential of plant and animal based wastes as well as evaluate the effect of co-digestion on biogas production. The results revealed that the goat dung produced higher volume of biogas (4943 mL) than the pawpaw seed (4329 mL). The mixture of both produced the highest volume (5871 mL) of biogas in comparison with the mono-substrates. Polynomial regression model gave the best correlation with R-2 value ranging from 0.9650-0.9810 for the three experiments when compared with linear regression model for the ascending limb with R-2 values ranging from 0.9210-0.9500. For descending limb, polynomial regression also gave a better fit with R-2 value in the range of 0.9690-0.9770 than the linear regression (IT: 0.9560-0.9700).

AB  - Composting is useful for treatment of residues from agribusiness, but the potential toxicity of the final compost should be evaluated before its agricultural destination. The objective of this study was to evaluate the physi-cochemical characteristics and the toxicity of agribusiness residues using onion seeds as bioindicators. All tested treatments were composed by sludge from a swine slaughterhouse and sawdust. Besides the control, which included no additional materials, the other treatments included aviary bedding, rice husk and residue from to-bacco industries as structuring materials. After 120 days of composting, for all treatments, the temperature inside the composting piles approached the environmental temperature, the physicochemical parameters indicated that the composts were stabilized and, except for the treatment including tobacco residues, that could be used for agriculture without impairing plant germination. Although the treatments including tobacco residues and rice husk showed evidence of cytotoxicity and genotoxicity at the beginning of the composting period, that was not observed for the treatment including aviary bedding. Such potential toxicity was not observed at the end of composting for any of the tested treatments.

AB  - Simple Summary Long-distance transport in the global swine industry is more the rule than the exception. We tested the impact on the rates of temperature change and air enthalpy on the stress response and muscle pH in pigs subjected to long-distance travel from Spain to Portugal performed in the summer and winter. We found that winter journeys are more adverse for the animals because during the journey, abrupt variations in rates of temperature change and air enthalpy caused a marked physiological stress response and effects on the meat pH after 45 min. These results indicate the need to develop new environmental control strategies that mitigate abrupt temperature changes during travel to attenuate the biological cost of such long-distance transport on the animals. Current legislation in the European Union places limits on live pig transport according to outside temperature, but less is known about the effects of sudden changes in the thermal microenvironment in trailers, particularly during long-distance transport. In this study, we measured the temperature and relative humidity inside livestock vehicles carrying 1920 Spanish finisher pigs (live weight 100 kg and 240 animals per journey) during eight long-distance (>15 h) commercial journeys to slaughter from northern Spain to Portugal in the summer and winter. Here, we report the rate of change in the air temperature (degrees C x min(-1)) and air enthalpies in the transport vehicle (kg water kg dry air-1). At sticking, blood samples were taken for to measure cortisol, glucose, and creatine kinase (CK) as stress response indicators, and the meat pH after 45 min and the pH after 24 h were also determined. The rate of change in the air temperature and enthalpy was higher inside the livestock vehicle during the winter months and was positively related with higher cortisol and glucose levels and lower pH after 45 min (p < 0.05). It is proposed that the rate of temperature change and air enthalpy represent useful integrated indices of thermal stress for pigs during transport.

TI  - GOAT: efficient and robust identification of gene set enrichment
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - Gene set enrichment analysis is foundational to the interpretation of high throughput biology. Identifying enriched Gene Ontology (GO) terms or disease-associated gene sets within a list of gene effect sizes that represent experimental outcomes is an everyday task in life science that crucially depends on robust and sensitive statistical tools. We here present GOAT, a parameter-free algorithm for gene set enrichment analysis of preranked gene lists. The algorithm can precompute null distributions from standardized gene scores, enabling enrichment testing of the GO database in one second. Validations using synthetic data show that estimated gene set p-values are well calibrated under the null hypothesis and invariant to gene list length and gene set size. Application to various real-world proteomics and gene expression studies demonstrates that GOAT identifies more significant GO terms as compared to current methods. GOAT is freely available as an R package and user-friendly online tool for gene set enrichment analyses that includes interactive data visualizations: https://ftwkoopmans.github.io/goat.

AB  - This study aimed to determine the diversity of species of predators attacking scale insects (Hemiptera: Coccidae) in Serbia. Over a four-year period, at 25 locations and on 25 host plants infested with 16 species of Coccidae, a total of 18,050 predators were collected and reared. Among them, were 16 species belonging to 7 families and 5 insect orders (Coleoptera, Dermaptera, Diptera, Hemiptera, and Neuroptera). Six species, Harmonia axyridis , Hippodamia variegata , Propylea quatuordecimpunctata , For fi cula auricularia , Deraeocoris ruber and Oxycarenus lavaterae , were recorded for the first time feeding on coccid pests in Serbia and O. lavaterae was fi rst recorded being zoophagous. The most common species was Exochomus quadripustulatus , which was recorded feeding on all 16 species of soft scale insects, while the dominant species was Anthribus nebulosus, with a total of 17,385 individuals collected and reared on fi ve species of soft scale. Considering the potential of the predators as biocontrol agents for suppressing scale insects, the data obtained indicate the need to understand predator diversity, which is one of the prerequisites for using these predators for controlling coccid pests.

AB  - Introduction: The study of non-laboratory species has been part of a broader effort to establish the basic organization of the mammalian neocortex, as these species may provide unique insights relevant to cortical organization, function, and evolution. Methods: In the present study, the organization of three somatosensory cortical areas of the medium-sized (5-11 kg body mass) Amazonian rodent, the paca (Cuniculus paca), was determined using a combination of electrophysiological microelectrode mapping and histochemical techniques (cytochrome oxidase and NADPH diaphorase) in tangential sections. Results: Electrophysiological mapping revealed a somatotopically organized primary somatosensory cortical area (S1) located in the rostral parietal cortex with a characteristic foot-medial/head-lateral contralateral body surface representation similar to that found in other species. S1 was bordered laterally by two regions housing neurons responsive to tactile stimuli, presumably the secondary somatosensory (S2) and parietal ventral (PV) cortical areas that evinced a mirror-reversal representation (relative to S1) of the contralateral body surface. The limits of the putative primary visual (V1) and primary auditory (A1) cortical areas, as well as the complete representation of the contralateral body surface in S1, were determined indirectly by the histochemical stains. Like the barrel field described in small rodents, we identified a modular arrangement located in the face representation of S1. Conclusions: The relative location, somatotopic organization, and pattern of neuropil histochemical reactivity in the three paca somatosensory cortical areas investigated are similar to those described in other mammalian species, providing additional evidence of a common plan of organization for the somatosensory cortex in the rostral parietal cortex of mammals.

AB  - Background Comparative genomics, genetic spread analysis, and context-aware ranking are crucial in understanding microbial dynamics' impact on public health. gSpreadComp streamlines the path from in silico analysis to hypothesis generation. By integrating comparative genomics, genome annotation, normalization, plasmid-mediated gene transfer, and microbial resistance-virulence risk-ranking into a unified workflow, gSpreadComp facilitates hypothesis generation from complex microbial datasets.Findings The gSpreadComp workflow works through 6 modular steps: taxonomy assignment, genome quality estimation, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) gene annotation, plasmid/chromosome classification, virulence factor annotation, and downstream analysis. Our workflow calculates gene spread using normalized weighted average prevalence and ranks potential resistance-virulence risk by integrating microbial resistance, virulence, and plasmid transmissibility data and producing an HTML report. As a use case, we analyzed 3,566 metagenome-assembled genomes recovered from human gut microbiomes across diets. Our findings indicated consistent AMR across diets, with diet-specific resistance patterns, such as increased bacitracin in vegans and tetracycline in omnivores. Notably, ketogenic diets showed a slightly higher resistance-virulence rank, while vegan and vegetarian diets encompassed more plasmid-mediated gene transfer.Conclusions The gSpreadComp workflow aims to facilitate hypothesis generation for targeted experimental validations by the identification of concerning resistant hotspots in complex microbial datasets. Our study raises attention to a more thorough study of the critical role of diet in microbial community dynamics and the spread of AMR. This research underscores the importance of integrating genomic data into public health strategies to combat AMR. The gSpreadComp workflow is available at https://github.com/mdsufz/gSpreadComp/.

AB  - We analyzed, through a Pavlovian conditioning procedure in rats, the temporal pattern of behavior in appetitive and aversive conditions within subjects, and the difference in inferred temporal working memory functioning with the Gap paradigm. For both conditions, we paired a 60-s conditioned stimulus (CS: tone1 or tone2) with an unconditioned stimulus (US: shock or chocolate pellet) delivered 20s after CS onset. The analyses of mean response rate and individual-trial data were performed during Probe trials, consisting of CS alone, and trials in which gaps of different position or duration were inserted, to assess the effect of the temporal manipulation on behavior. The results showed: (1) An anticipatory peak time in the aversive condition but better accuracy in the appetitive condition, (2) constancy in the Weber fraction suggesting that the difference in peak time was under clock control, (3) a graded effect of gap parameters only in the aversive condition and (4) different gap effects between conditions when a gap was inserted early in the CS. These results highlight behavioral differences between aversive and appetitive conditions and suggest that the temporal working memory mechanism was not engaged in the same manner in each condition.

AB  - The present study was aimed at gaining insight into the signalling relationship between glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and its receptor (GLP-1R) in the regulation of glucose metabolism. Further, to assess the role of Gprotein-coupled receptor 40 (GPR40) and insulin receptor (INSR) in the pancreas of sheep that were supplemented with calcium salts of long-chain fatty acids (CSFAs). An experiment was carried out over a period of 60 days with eighteen sheep, and they were fed with a standard basal diet. The sheep were divided into three groups: CSFA0 (without CSFAs), while CSFA3 and CSFA5 were supplemented with 3 % and 5 % of CSFAs, respectively. Plasma concentrations of GLP-1, insulin, glucagon, and glucose were assessed every two weeks. At the end of the experiment, sheep were slaughtered, and samples of gastrointestinal tract (GIT) epithelial tissues and pancreas were collected to assess the relative expression of mRNA of GPR40, GLP-1R, and INSR. Postprandial GLP-1 and insulin were increased by 3.7-4.1 and 1.45-1.5 times, respectively, in the CSFAs-supplemented groups compared to CSFA0. Post-feeding, glucagon and glucose levels decreased in CSFA3 and CSFA5 compared to CSFA0. The results indicated that the supplementation of LCFAs increased the expression of GLP-1R in the GIT and pancreas, as well as the mRNA of GPR40 and INSR in the pancreas. Chemosensing of LCFAs by GPR40 in the pancreas triggers signalling transduction, and enhanced GLP-1 and GLP-1R resulted in moderately increased insulin secretion and reduced glucagon levels. These combined effects, along with the glucose-lowering effect of GLP-1, effectively lowered glucose levels in normoglycemic sheep.

AB  - This current study aimed for the first time to evaluate the effect of a single intravenous administration of human chorionic gonadotropin hormone (hCG) on the testicular artery haemodynamics measurements (resistance [RI], and pulsatility indices [PI]), plasma steroids (estradiol-17 beta and testosterone) and nitric oxide (NO) levels in buffalo bulls. Twelve Egyptian buffalo bulls weighted 450 +/- 20 kg were randomly divided into the hCG group (n = 6) and injected a single dose with Ovogest (EPIFASI; 5,000 IU, iv), whereas the others (n = 6) were injected with normal saline and served as controls. Doppler evaluation and blood sampling were performed just before the administration (hour 0) and at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 24 and 28 hr after administration. Bulls in the control group did not show any alterations in hormonal levels and blood flow parameters (p > .05). In the hCG group, RI was declined (p < .05) in 6 hr post-administration (0.31 +/- 0.01 versus 0.45 +/- 0.01), while PI was declined (p < .05) later in 10 hr (0.74 +/- 0.01 versus 1.23 +/- 0.02). Additionally, testicular blood flow was increased (p < .05) 8 hr (42.02 +/- 1.02 ml/min/100 g versus 31.34 +/- 0.88 ml/min/100 g) after administration. Testosterone and NO levels were (p < .05) increased at 4 and 6 hr post-administration (3.55 +/- 0.03 ng/ml versus 2.84 +/- 0.01 ng/ml, and 55.32 +/- 4.25 mu mol/L versus 32.21 +/- 1.55 mu mol/L), whereas oestradiol levels were elevated (p < .05) in 6 hr (31.25 +/- 0.08 pg/ml) only post-administration then declined. In conclusion, the single intravenous administration of hCG triggered many alterations in the supratesticular artery vascularization and hormonal profile that could affect positively on steroidogenesis and testicular function in buffalo bull.

AB  - In addition to the drying kinetics of digestate, a comprehensive knowledge is necessary on nitrogen loss and ammonia emissions in order to appropriately develop and design a dryer. Otherwise, these phenomena would result in environmental concerns and reduce the nutrient value of digestate. Expectedly, drying parameters considerably affect drying time. In this study, drying experiments were conducted at a laboratory scale fixed-bed dryer. The drying experiments were performed on dewatered digestate that mainly consisted of grass and maize silage (initial moisture content 76.4% w.b., 0.026 kg N kg(-1) DM). The drying air temperatures were adjusted to 60, 70 and 80 degrees C, the airflow rate varied between 150 and 250 m(3) h(-1), respectively. As the results have shown, the total nitrogen was reduced by 29 to 42% during drying. Almost all ammonium nitrogen was lost (92%). No relationship between nitrogen loss and drying air temperature or airflow rate could be proved. These results will be used as a basis for further investigation of continuous digestate drying at a semi-technical scale. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Metagenomic Hi-C (metaHi-C) has shown remarkable potential for retrieving high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes from complex microbial communities. Nevertheless, existing metaHi-C-based contig binning methods solely rely on Hi-C interactions between contigs, disregarding crucial biological information such as the presence of single-copy marker genes. To overcome this limitation, we introduce ImputeCC, an integrative contig binning tool optimized for metaHi-C datasets. ImputeCC integrates both Hi-C interactions and the discriminative power of single-copy marker genes to group marker-gene-containing contigs into preliminary bins. It also introduces a novel constrained random walk with restart algorithm to enhance Hi-C connectivity among contigs. Comprehensive assessments using both mock and real metaHi-C datasets from diverse environments demonstrate that ImputeCC consistently outperforms other Hi-C-based contig binning tools. A genus-level analysis of the sheep gut microbiota reconstructed by ImputeCC underlines its capability to recover key species from dominant genera and identify previously unknown genera.

AB  - Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the leading causes of disability, affecting over 500 million adults worldwide. Previous studies have found that various inflammatory factors can contribute to the pathogenesis of OA, including complement factors in the synovial fluid of OA patients. However, the pathogenesis of this disease is still not known, and the only therapy of severe OA is total joint replacements. Total joint replacements are invasive, expensive, and affect quality of life. Here we show that when human articular chondrocytes are stimulated with pro-inflammatory mediator interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) there is an increase in inflammatory factors including complement component 3 (C3). We also found the transcription factor, signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), is responsible for increased C3 expression after IL-1 beta stimulation in human articular chondrocytes. A specific STAT1 inhibitor, fludarabine, attenuates the hyper-expression of C3 and delays/prevents spontaneous OA in Dunkin-Hartley guinea pigs. Since fludarabine is already clinically used for chemotherapy, this study has great translational potential as a unique disease-modifying osteoarthritis drug (DMOAD) in treating primary OA.
   Osteoarthritis (OA) affects over 500 million adults worldwide. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 can increase complement C3 expression after IL-1 beta stimulation, and STAT1 inhibition can prevent OA pathogenesis in guinea pigs.

AB  - The objective was to determine crude protein (CP) and amino acids (AA) digestibility of fish meal, defatted black soldier fly (BSF; Hermetia illucens) larva meal, and adult BSF fed to pigs. Eight castrated male pigs with a body weight of 72.6 kg (standard deviation = 10.4) surgically fitted with T-cannulas in the distal ileum were individually housed in pens that were equipped with a feeder and a nipple drinker. The pigs were allotted to a replicated 4x5 incomplete Latin square design with 4 diets and 5 periods to obtain 9 replicates. Three experimental diets were prepared to contain fish meal (686 g/kg CP and 75 g/kg ether extract), defatted BSF larva meal (595 g/kg CP and 76 g/kg ether extract), and adult BSF (590 g/kg CP and 268 g/kg ether extract) as the sole source of AA. Additionally, a nitrogen-free diet based on corn starch and sucrose was formulated to determine the basal endogenous losses of CP and AA. All diets contained 5 g/kg chromium oxide as an indigestible marker. Each period consisted of 4 days of adaptation and 2 days of ileal digesta collection. The coefficient of standardised ileal digestibility (CSID) of CP in defatted BSF larva meal was lower (0.738 vs 0.883; P<0.05) than that in fish meal but was higher (P<0.05) than that in adult BSF (0.561). The CSID of all indispensable AA except for methionine and phenylalanine in defatted BSF larva meal was lower (P<0.05) than that in fish meal. The CSID of all AA except for proline in defatted BSF larva meal was higher (P<0.05) than that in adult BSF. Overall, AA in defatted BSF larva meal were less digestible than those in fish meal when fed to growing pigs but were more digestible than those in adult BSF.

AB  - This study aims to determine whether differences exist between the presence of microplastics and mesoplastics in fishes of coral reef and mangrove ecosystems, in Isla Grande, Colombian Caribbean. The collection of three species of coral reef (Centropomus undecimalis, Caranx hippos, and Lutjanus synagris) and three species of mangrove from coral reef (Centropomus undecimalis, Eugerres plumieri, and Archosargus rhomboidalis) were found to have ingested microplastics and mesoplastics, with a significantly higher in the mangrove species than in the coral reef species (1.9 vs. 1.6 items/individual). Furthermore, the average abundance and weight of microplastics and mesoplastics were significantly higher in females than in males (p < 0.05) and the abundance of microplastics and mesoplastics in the intestines was significantly higher than in the stomach (p < 0.05). PE, polyester, PVC, and PET were the most abundant polymers among common plastics found in species of the two habitats. Our findings highlight the importance of more rigorous plastic waste management strategies in areas nearby the coast and mangrove habitats.

AB  - Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz is an important oil crop with many excellent agronomic traits. This model oil plant has been exploited to accumulate value-added bioproducts using genetic manipulation that depends on antibiotic- or herbicide-based selection marker genes (SMG), one of the major concerns for genetically modified foods. Here we reported metabolic engineering of C. sativa to synthesize red ketocarotenoids that could serve as a reporter to visualize transgenic events without using a traditional SMG. Overexpression of a non-native beta-carotene ketolase gene coupled with three other carotenogenous genes (phytoene synthase, beta-carotene hydroxylase, and Orange) in C. sativa resulted in production of red seeds that were visibly distinguishable from the normal yellow ones. Constitutive expression of the transgenes led to delayed plant development and seed germination. In contrast, seed-specific transformants demonstrated normal growth and seed germination despite the accumulation of up to 70-fold the level of carotenoids in the seeds compared to the controls, including significant amounts of astaxanthin and keto-lutein. As a result, the transgenic seed oils exhibited much higher antioxidant activity. No significant changes were found in the profiles of fatty acids between transgenic and control seeds. This study provided an interesting tool for metabolic engineering of seed crops without using a disputed SMG.

AB  - The segregation in one trophic niche of n-dimensional niches can allow many species to coexist in the same habitat. In this study, we conducted surveys in Ben En National Park, Thanh Hoa Province, Vietnam to examine stomach contents of two syntopic tree frog species, Hyla simplex and Polypedates megacephalus, using the stomach-flushing method. A total of 21 individuals of H. simplex and 32 individuals of P. megacephalus were sampled revealing 352 food items (H. simplex: 131 invertebrates belonging to 20 prey types of seven orders; P. megacephalus: 215 invertebrates belonging to 22 prey types of 11 orders). Generally, both species consumed slightly diverse and equal prey types. However, ants (Formicidae) and termites (Rhinotermitidae) were identified as the most dominant and important prey for the two tree frog species. With only 38.95% overlap, it is evident that there is tropic segregation between the two syntopic species.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of replacing soybean meal with cottonseed cake in the diet offered to Santa Ines sheep on their performance, carcass yield and economic viability. Thirty-two uncastrated male sheep (27.48 +/- 4.96 kg and 12 months old) were distributed in a completely randomized design, with 4 treatments (replacement of 0, 14, 28 and 42% of soybean meal with cottonseed cake in dry matter basis) and 8 replications. The inclusion levels of cottonseed cake in their diet provided a reduction in performance, thoracic perimeter, body capacity (measured in vivo), slaughter body weight, hot and cold carcass weights, external length, rump perimeter, thoracic perimeter, carcass compactness index, and leg compactness index (p < 0.05). The weights of the left half carcass, shoulder, neck, loin, and leg were reduced with increasing levels of cottonseed cake in their diet (p < 0.05). The quadratic effect was observed for the rib weight and the yield (p < 0.05). Diets with cottonseed cake had lower total feed costs/animal, revenue, gross margin, and leveling price, and had a higher benefit/cost. Under experimental conditions, despite reducing the feed costs and presenting an improvement in the cost ratio benefit, the use of levels up to 42% of cottonseed cake in sheep diets is not recommended, as it negatively affects the animal performance, carcass weights, and commercial cuts.

AB  - Simple Summary: Sheep breeding has important economic value in China's animal husbandry industry, and growth traits represent an important factor affecting the economic benefits of the industry. This study is based on a functional 168 bp SINE element insertion upstream of the HOXB13 gene discovered in GWAS. By using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data, we analyzed the frequency of the HOXB13 gene in 33 different sheep breeds worldwide, and we genotyped 6 specific sheep breeds by using PCR and agarose gel electrophoresis. We also associated the polymorphism of the HOXB13 gene with the growth traits of Luxi black-headed sheep and found that the 168 bp insertion showed a certain correlation with the growth traits in sheep. This may provide effective assistance for improving the economic benefits of the sheep industry. In recent years, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have uncovered that the HOXB13 gene is a key regulatory factor for the tail length trait of sheep. Further research has found that there is a functional 168 bp SINE element insertion upstream of the HOXB13 gene, which leads to the occurrence of long tails in sheep. However, the frequency of mutations in the 168 bp SINE element of the HOXB13 gene among different sheep breeds around the world and its relationship with growth traits are still unclear. This study used whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data, including 588 samples from 33 different sheep breeds around the world, to evaluate the frequency of HOXB13 gene mutations in different sheep breeds globally. At the same time, this study also selected 3392 sheep samples from six breeds. The genetic variation in the 168 bp InDel locus in the HOXB13 gene was determined through genotyping, and its association with the growth traits of Luxi black-headed sheep was analyzed. The research results indicate that the polymorphism of the 168 bp InDel locus is significantly correlated with the hip width of adult ewes in the Luxi black-headed sheep breed (p < 0.05) and that the hip width of adult ewes with the DD genotype is significantly larger than that of adult ewes with the ID genotype (p < 0.05). This study indicates that there is consistency between the research results on the sheep tail length trait and growth traits, which may contribute to the promotion of sheep breed improvement.

AB  - Submerged macrophytes play crucial roles in maintaining the stability of clear-water states in shallow lakes. Recent stable isotope studies have shown that crustacean zooplankton can utilize submerged macrophyte carbon, but macrophytes alone cannot support the growth and reproduction of such grazers, being deficient in highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA). We hypothesized that flagellates feeding on macrophytes can synthesize HUFA and thereby support crustacean zooplankton. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a feeding experiment in which Daphnia magna were provided with a diet of submerged macrophyte Hydrilla verticillata detritus which had been degraded by lake microbes. The chlorophyte Scenedesmus bijuga and undegraded macrophyte detritus were used as controls for comparison of Daphnia's performance. Using biochemical analysis, we examined how the degradation process affected the food quality of the macrophyte. Flagellates were subsequently isolated from the degraded macrophyte and cultured heterotrophically to detect their HUFA synthesis. The 5-day degraded H. verticillata showed significantly higher HUFA concentrations than undegraded macrophyte detritus. They supported better Daphnia performance than undegraded macrophyte, being comparable with S. bijuga. Two isolated flagellates (SL-1 and SL-2), identified as Ochromonas sp. and Poterioochromonas sp., were found to contain HUFA when cultured heterotrophically without dietary sources of fatty acids, suggesting their HUFA synthesis ability. Our results demonstrate that submerged macrophytes may thus indirectly support crustacean zooplankton via flagellate mediation. As crustacean zooplanktons are of key importance for water quality in the grazer control of phytoplankton, this microbial facilitation may contribute to the maintenance of macrophyte clear-water conditions in shallow lakes.

AB  - This study investigates the effects of different washing methods and intake concentrations on the removal efficiency of odor gases and particulate matter. Odor concentration (OU value) was used as the evaluation criterion, with three concentration gradients established: high (1000-1100 OU), medium (500-600 OU), and low (200-300 OU). The experiment employed water washing, acidic washing (pH = 4), and alkaline washing (pH = 10) to analyze the removal rates across nine treatments. Results indicated that the removal rate of ammonia significantly increased with higher intake concentrations (p < 0.01), while intake concentration had no significant effect on the removal rates of hydrogen sulfide and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Acidic washing achieved the highest ammonia removal rate (72.68%) (p < 0.01), whereas alkaline washing showed the highest hydrogen sulfide removal rate (64.87%) (p < 0.01). For VOCs, the removal rates for water washing, acidic washing, and alkaline washing were 50.35%, 59.70%, and 61.56%, respectively, which were significantly lower than those for acidic and alkaline washing (p < 0.01). Alkaline washing demonstrated a significantly higher removal rate for methyl mercaptan compared to water washing and acidic washing (p < 0.01), and also for dimethyl sulfide compared to acidic washing (p < 0.05). Trimethylamine and carbon disulfide removal rates by acidic and alkaline washing were significantly higher than those by water washing (p < 0.01). There was no significant difference in styrene removal rates among different washing methods (p > 0.05), although acidic washing showed the best performance. Neither washing method nor intake concentration significantly affected particulate matter removal. It is recommended to combine acidic and alkaline washing for optimal deodorization.

AB  - We analyzed the multi-year relationship between particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) concentrations and possible precursors including NO2, SO2, and NH3 based on local observations over the Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA) from 2015 to 2017. Surface NH3 concentrations were obtained from Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) retrievals, while other pollutants were observed at 142 ground sites. We found that NH3 had the highest correlation with PM2.5 (R = 0.51) compared to other precursors such as NO2 and SO2 (R of 0.16 and 0.14, respectively). The correlations indicate that NH3 emissions are likely a limiting factor in controlling PM2.5 over the SMA in a high-NOx environment. This implies that the current Korean policy urgently requires tools for controlling local NH3 emissions from the livestock industry (for example, from hog manure). These findings provide the first satellite-based trace gas evidence that implementing an NH3 control strategy could play a key role in improving air quality in the SMA.

AB  - This study assessed concrete durability in pig farm environments, focusing on resistance to organic acid corrosion and physical abrasion. It used supplementary cementitious materials like silica fume (SF), coal fly ash (CFA), and bagasse fly ash (BFA) to improve concrete resilience. The research involved casting and testing concrete samples for compressive strength, acid corrosion resistance, abrasion resistance, and their combined effects. A custom apparatus simulated corrosion and abrasion cycles typical in pig farm flooring. Results showed that a combination of SF, CFA, and BFA significantly enhanced compressive strength, especially with extended curing. Additionally, these materials improved concrete's resistance to acid corrosion, physical abrasion, and their combined effects. The replacement of 30 wt% of cement with CFA and BFA in concrete significantly reduced mass loss due to acid corrosion to less than 10%, whereas the control mix exhibited a mass loss exceeding 24%. Additionally, concrete with 30 wt% CFA or BFA replacement exhibited a minimal combined mass loss, decreasing to less than 2.5% due to acid corrosion and physical abrasion, as opposed to the 16% observed in the control mixture.

AB  - Simple Summary: Screening and interpretation of differentially expressed genes and associated biological pathways was conducted among experimental groups with divergent phenotypes providing valuable information about the metabolic events occurring and identification of candidate genes with major regulation roles. This comparative transcriptomic analysis includes the first RNA-seq analysis of the Longissimus lumborum muscle tissue from two Portuguese autochthonous pig breeds with different genetic backgrounds, Alentejano and Bisaro. Moreover, a complementary candidate gene approach was employed to analyse, by real time qPCR, the expression profile of relevant genes involved in lipid metabolism, and therefore with potential impacts on meat composition. This study contributes to explaining the biological basis of phenotypical differences occurring between breeds, particularly the ones related to meat quality traits that affect consumer interest.
   Gene expression is one of the main factors to influence meat quality by modulating fatty acid metabolism, composition, and deposition rates in muscle tissue. This study aimed to explore the transcriptomics of the Longissimus lumborum muscle in two local pig breeds with distinct genetic background using next-generation sequencing technology and Real-Time qPCR. RNA-seq yielded 49 differentially expressed genes between breeds, 34 overexpressed in the Alentejano (AL) and 15 in the Bisaro (BI) breed. Specific slow type myosin heavy chain components were associated with AL (MYH7) and BI (MYH3) pigs, while an overexpression of MAP3K14 in AL may be associated with their lower loin proportion, induced insulin resistance, and increased inflammatory response via NFkB activation. Overexpression of RUFY1 in AL pigs may explain the higher intramuscular (IMF) content via higher GLUT4 recruitment and consequently higher glucose uptake that can be stored as fat. Several candidate genes for lipid metabolism, excluded in the RNA-seq analysis due to low counts, such as ACLY, ADIPOQ, ELOVL6, LEP and ME1 were identified by qPCR as main gene factors defining the processes that influence meat composition and quality. These results agree with the fatter profile of the AL pig breed and adiponectin resistance can be postulated as responsible for the overexpression of MAP3K14 ' s coding product NIK, failing to restore insulin sensitivity.

AB  - Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a chronic, recurring, and potentially life-threatening illness, which affects over 300 million people worldwide. MDD affects not only the emotional and social domains but also cognition. However, the currently available treatments targeting cognitive deficits in MDD are limited. Minocycline, an antibiotic with anti-inflammatory properties recently identified as a potential antidepressant, has been shown to attenuate learning and memory deficits in animal models of cognitive impairment. Here, we explored whether minocycline recovers the deficits in cognition in a mouse model of depression. C57BL6/J adult male mice were exposed to two weeks of chronic unpredictable mild stress to induce a depressive-like phenotype. Immediately afterward, mice received either vehicle or minocycline for three weeks in standard housing conditions. We measured anhedonia as a depressive-like response, and place learning to assess cognitive abilities. We also recorded long-term potentiation (LTP) as an index of hippocampal functional plasticity and ran immunohistochemical assays to assess microglial proportion and morphology. After one week of treatment, cognitive performance in the place learning test was significantly improved by minocycline, as treated mice displayed a higher number of correct responses when learning novel spatial configurations. Accordingly, minocycline-treated mice displayed higher LTP compared to controls. However, after three weeks of treatment, no difference between treated and control animals was found for behavior, neural plasticity, and microglial properties, suggesting that minocycline has a fast but short effect on cognition, without lasting effects on microglia. These findings together support the usefulness of minocycline as a potential treatment for cognitive impairment associated with MDD.

AB  - Simple Summary A pre-weaned Zaraibi goat kid's body weight gain and survival are complex traits affected by the maternal ability of the doe and the kid's capability for rapid growth and survival, in addition to the management tactics and environmental variables during the postnatal period. In this study, we investigate the effect of some potential maternal, postnatal, and management-related factors, including sex, litter size, birth weight, daily milk yield, parity, kidding year, and kidding season. The effects of these factors on both the daily body weight (ADG) gain and survivability of Zaraibi (Nubian) kids during the suckling period are studied. The body weight gain for kids was influenced significantly by all the aforementioned factors, except for the kidding season. The framework of the survival analysis revealed that the male kids experienced a greater risk of death compared with the female kids. The single-born kids were at a lower risk of death compared with two or more kids born in a litter. Survival rates increased steadily along with the increase in the mother's daily milk yield and the dam's parity number. There was a decrease in the probability of mortality with each passing year. In practice, monitoring traits that indicate an imbalance in milk and that could lower the body weight of the kid could promote the identification of kids with a higher risk of death and the inability to achieve the required body weight gain. During the early period of an animal's life, rapid growth and higher survival rates can provide more profits to producers by minimizing the rearing and replacement costs. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of some maternal, postnatal, and management-related factors (sex, the litter size [LS], the kid's birth weight [KBW], the daily milk yield [DMY], and the parity order), as well as the kidding year and season on both the average daily weight gain (ADG) and survivability of suckling Zaraibi goat kids during the postnatal period. A total of 3005 kidding events were available from the herd of Zaraibi goats raised at El-Serw Experimental Station from 2008 to 2014, which belongs to the Animal Production Research Institute. Data revealed that the overall ADG was 131.14 +/- 2.34, 94.22 +/- 2.21, and 85.63 +/- 2.33 g/day, whereas the survival rates were 94.68%, 91.81%, and 90.62% during the periods from birth to 1, 2, and 3 months, respectively. During all periods considered, the aforementioned maternal, postnatal, and management-related factors significantly affected the ADG. In males, the ADG increased compared with females. Singletons had a higher ADG compared with kids born to a litter of two or more. A higher KBW and DMY were associated with an increase in the ADG. Additionally, increasing the parity order was associated with an increased ADG. The kidding season did not have a significant effect on the ADG, whereas the kidding year showed a significant effect on the ADG. During the pre-weaning period, the hazard of death increased by 23.1% (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.231; 95% CI = 0.972-2.057) in males compared with females in terms of survival rates. A higher LS was associated with an increase in the incidence of mortality, increasing by 51.6% (HR = 1.516; 95% CI = 1.363-1.719) with each unit increase in the LS. Additionally, the KBW was an extremely important determinant of survivability, as the risk of death decreased by 62.8% (HR = 0.372; 95% CI = 0.229-0.504) with the increase in the KBW.
   Likewise, survival rates increased steadily along with an increase in both the DMY and parity number. The risk of death decreased by 52.7% (HR = 0.473; 95% CI = 0.376-0.808) and 38.2% (HR = 0.618; 95% CI = 0.512-1.724) with the increase in the DMY and parity number, respectively. The kidding season did not significantly affect the kid's survivability, but with each passing year, there was a decrease of 2.8% (HR = 0.972; 95% CI = 0.952-0.991) in the probability of mortality. In conclusion, better growth and survival rates can be achieved by controlling the maternal, postnatal, and management-related factors, as well as upgrading management plans.

AB  - This study employed high-throughput sequencing to explore bacterial diversity and hematological variations across different age groups of giraffes, as well as the impact of diarrhea on their intestinal microbiota. Additionally, the correlation between intestinal flora and hematological indices was examined for the first time. Firmicutes, Bacteroides, and Proteobacteria were the predominant bacterial groups in the giraffe's intestinal flora. The alpha-diversity analysis indicated significant variations in microbial diversity among giraffes of varying ages (p < 0.05). Furthermore, giraffes suffering from diarrhea exhibited significant alterations in the abundance of Proteobacteria and Actinobacteriota at the phylum level (p < 0.05). At the genus level, Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group, Monoglobus, and Prevotellaceae_UCG-004 had significant differences compared to healthy counterparts (p < 0.05). Hematological parameters such as lymphocyte count (Lym), red blood cell count (RBC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), platelet count (PLT), and plateletcrit (PCT) varied significantly across different age groups (p < 0.05). A substantial correlation was observed between the intestinal microbiome composition and hematological parameters (p < 0.05). In conclusion, this study highlights significant differences in both the intestinal microbiome composition and hematological indices among giraffes of different ages. Diarrhea was found to significantly alter the abundance and composition of the intestinal microbial community. These insights provide a valuable theoretical foundation for the microbiological and hematological aspects of giraffe health management and breeding practices.

AB  - Deficiency of neurotrophic factors and oxidative DNA damage are common causes of many neurodegenerative diseases. Recently, the importance of kynurenic acid (KYNA), an active metabolite of tryptophan, has increased as a neuroprotective molecule in the brain. Therefore, the present study tested the hypothesis that centrally acting KYNA would positively affect: (1) brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-tyrosine receptor kinase B (TrkB) signaling and (2) selected base excision repair (BER) pathway enzymes activities in the hippocampal CA1 field in sheep. Both lower (20 mu g in total) and higher (100 mu g in total) doses of KYNA infused into the third brain ventricle differentially increased the abundance of BDNF and TrkB mRNA in the CA1 field; additionally, the higher dose increased BDNF tissue concentration. The lower dose of KYNA increased mRNA expression for 8-oxoguanine glycosylase (OGG1), N-methylpurine DNA glycosylase (MPG), and thymine DNA glycosylase and stimulated the repair of 1,N6-ethenodeoxyadenosine and 3,N4-ethenodeoxy-cytosine as determined by the excision efficiency of lesioned nucleobases. The higher dose increased the abundance of OGG1 and MPG transcripts, however, its stimulatory effect on repair activity was less pronounced in all cases compared to the lower dose. The increased level of AP-endonuclease mRNA expression was dose-dependent. In conclusion, the potential neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects of KYNA in brain cells may involve stimulation of the BDNF-TrkB and BER pathways.

AB  - While corn is considered to be a healthy food option, common agricultural practices, such as the application of soil amendments, might be introducing contaminants of concern (COC) into corn plants. The use of dredged material, which contain contaminants such as heavy metals, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), as a soil amendment is increasing. Contaminants from these amendments can accumulate in corn kernels harvested from plants grown on these sediments and potentially biomagnify in organisms that consume them. The extent to which secondary exposure to such contaminants in corn affect the mammalian central nervous system has been virtually unexplored. In this preliminary study, we examine the effects of exposure to corn grown in dredge amended soil or a commercially available feed corn on behavior and hippocampal volume in male and female rats. Perinatal exposure to dredge-amended corn altered behavior in the open-field and object recognition tasks in adulthood. Additionally, dredge-amended corn led to a reduction in hippocampal volume in male but not female adult rats. These results suggest the need for future studies examining how dredge-amended crops and/or commercially available feed corn may be exposing animals to COC that can alter neurodevelopment in a sex-specific manner. This future work will provide insight into the potential long-term consequences of soil amendment practices on the brain and behavior.

AB  - This paper aims to provide a novel approach for improving urban land cover classification accuracy, which combines the Elephant Herding Optimization (EHO) algorithm as a meta-heuristic optimization method with the Random Forest (RF) classifier. The proposed approach involves both classifier hyperparameter tuning and feature selection for a data set of a selected urban area. The EHO and the RF algorithms were both utilized in a hybrid system (EHO-RF) to find an optimal classification model with a tuned set of hyperparameters and features (predictor variables). EHO-RF model tuning was followed by backward feature elimination using RF, which further reduced data dimensionality. This work also combines two well-known optimization and feature selection algorithms to enhance accuracy assessment of the proposed approach. Grid search optimization was combined with Variable Selection Using Random Forests (VSURF) algorithm to build an optimization system (Grid-VSURF) that is similar to the workflow of EHO-RF. Objective functions for both Grid-VSURF and EHO-RF were designed to perform 10-fold cross-validation to reduce over-fitting. An area in Deerfield Beach city, Florida, USA, was selected as the study area representing an urban land cover. The testing dataset used in this study represents a performance benchmarking dataset, which has been utilized in many studies. EHO-RF results showed a significant improvement with an overall map accuracy of 83.83%, compared with Grid-VSURF results with an overall map accuracy of 74.75%. The number of input features was significantly reduced by both approaches with 82.30% reduction using EHO-RF with backward elimination and 89.70% reduction using Grid-VSURF.

AB  - The Anthropocene epoch is characterized by unprecedented rates of global biological invasions, resulting in the formation of novel ecological assemblages composed of multiple species with different origins. In this study, we focused on the recent expansion of host usage by the red goldenrod aphid, Uroleucon nigrotuberculatum, introduced to Japan from North America. Uroleucon nigrotuberculatum is well known to exclusively feed on Solidago spp in their native range, North America. Based on our observation, we hypothesize that in their introduced region (ie Japan), the aphid U. nigrotuberculatum, recently exhibited a broad host range, capable of exploiting a wide range of exotic plant species beyond the Solidago genus. We collected red aphid colonies from multiple exotic plant species in Hokkaido Island and also collected U. nigrotuberuculatum from multiple populations of S. altissima in Hokkaido and the main island of Japan. Then, we performed a phylogenetic analysis to determine genetic relationships among collected samples. Morphological characteristics were also examined. The phylogenetic analysis revealed no genetic variation among aphids collected from different exotic plants. All specimens clustered with U. nigrotuberculatum were found on S. altissima. Morphological examination confirmed key diagnostic features of U. nigrotuberculatum. We also performed field inoculation experiments. The red aphids collected from S. altissima could survive and reproduce on various exotic plant species, S. gigantea, Taraxacum officinale, and Senecio vulgaris. These results indicate a lack of host-associated genetic differentiation and support the utilization of these novel exotic plants by U. nigrotuberuculatum, potentially facilitating its further spread and ecological impact.

AB  - Spray-dried haemoglobin meal, a by-product and derivative of the swine processing industry, is formed when haemoglobin is separated hygienically from pig's blood. A 120-days feeding trial using snub nose pompano Trachinotus blochii (1.01 +/- 0.02 g) tested spray-dried haemoglobin meal (SHM) as an ingredient in six iso-nitrogenous (crude protein of 50%) and iso-lipidic (crude fat of 8%) diets, namely, a diet with 0% SHM (control) and five diets replacing fishmeal with SHM at 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20%. Weight gain percentage (WG%) significantly decreased (p < 0.05) when fish were fed diets with 12, 16 and 20% SHM inclusion levels. Feed conversion ratio and survival significantly decreased (p < 0.05) when fish were fed diets with 16 and 20% SHM inclusion levels. However, visceral somatic index, hepatosomatic index, condition factor and proximate composition were not affected (p > 0.05) by SHM inclusion levels. As an ingredient for pompano feed, SHM has digestibilities for protein, lipid and dry matter at 89, 78 and 45% respectively. No apparent pathological changes were observed in the intestines. However, physiological changes in the liver have been seen in fish fed diets containing 12, 16 and 20% of SHM. Based on the quadratic regression model at the maximum response of weight gain percentage, the optimum inclusion level of SHM was estimated to be 3.08% (5.87% SHM protein in the diet).

AB  - The grid environment is a dynamic, heterogeneous, and changeable computing system that distributes various services amongst different clients. To attain the benefits of collaborative resource sharing in Grid computing, a novel and proficient grid resource management system (RMS) is essential. Therefore, detection of an appropriate resource for the presented task is a difficult task. Several scientists have presented algorithms for mapping tasks to the resource. Few of them focus on fault tolerance, user fulfillment, and load balancing. With this motivation, this study designs an intelligent grid scheduling scheme using deer hunting optimization algorithm (DHOA), called IGSS-DHOA which schedules in such a way that the makespan gets minimized in the grid platform. The IGSS-DHOA technique is mainly based on the hunting nature of humans toward deer. It also derives an objective function with candidate solution (schedule) as input and the outcome is the makespan value denoting the quality of the candidate solution. The simulation results highlighted the supremacy of the IGSS-DHOA technique over the recent state of art techniques with the minimal average processing cost of 31717.9.

AB  - Clostridium perfringens (C. perfringens) causes intestinal injury through overgrowth and the secretion of multiple toxins, leading to diarrhea and necrotic enteritis in animals, including pigs, chickens, and sheep. This study aimed to investigate the protective effects of Lactobacillus plantarum (L. plantarum) Lac16 on C. perfringens infection-associated injury in intestinal porcine epithelial cell line (IPEC-J2). The results showed that L. plantarum Lac16 significantly inhibited the growth of C. perfringens, which was accompanied by a decrease in pH levels. In addition, L. plantarum Lac16 significantly elevated the mRNA expression levels of host defense peptides (HDPs) in IPEC-J2 cells, decreased the adhesion of C. perfringens to IPEC-J2 cells, and attenuated C. perfringens-induced cellular cytotoxicity and intestinal barrier damage. Furthermore, L. plantarum Lac16 significantly suppressed C. perfringens-induced gene expressions of proinflammatory cytokines and pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) in IPEC-J2 cells. Moreover, L. plantarum Lac16 preincubation effectively inhibited the phosphorylation of p65 caused by C. perfringens infection. Collectively, probiotic L. plantarum Lac16 exerts protective effects against C. perfringens infection-associated injury in IPEC-J2 cells.

AB  - Simple Summary Pork is currently the cheapest protein source in the world. In the traditional rearing of backyard pigs in regions of Ecuador, cassava and taro crops are frequently used as replacement alternatives to corn in pig feed formulations. In this study, the quality and characteristics of the carcass and the behavior of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of 30 fattening pigs reared under the backyard production system were analyzed. The animals were fed with a conventional or alternative diet based on the addition of cassava and taro in doses of 32% and 42%. The results showed a higher effect of the geographical location than the feed administered to the animals. The morphological traits were those with lower changes between groups than the gastrointestinal tract measurements. The proportions of alternatives used in the formulations must be optimized, since this directly increases the amount of protein in the meat and the weight of the GIT, decreasing the degree of fattening of the carcass. In the production of backyard pigs in Ecuador based on the use of by-products and agricultural waste, it is necessary to promote the standardization of the type of pig that is raised, taking into account geographical location and promoting the use of local genetic resources.Abstract Ecuadorian small producers use crossbred animals with a low level of genetic improvement, which are fed with alternative feeds to decrease production costs. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of geographical location and three diets according to the amount of cassava and taro incorporated into the feed (T1 conventional feed; T2 and T3 with 32% and 42% of cassava and taro, respectively) in pigs reared under the backyard system. The results did not show many differences between the treatments for morphological traits; however, between geographical locations, significant differences were evidenced. The fat content from the first rib was higher in the T1 group. The intramuscular fat percentage was higher in the T1 group, contrary to the protein levels, which were higher in the T3 group in Esmeraldas and the T2 group in Ro Chico. In the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and its attached organs, differences were found in the empty stomach weight, full and empty small intestine weight, liver weight, and total GIT weight, with the T2 and T3 groups having the largest and heaviest. Cassava and taro did not affect the morphometric behavior and quality of the carcass but increased the amount of protein in the meat and the weight of the GIT. Geographical location was also observed to have a significant effect.

AB  - Anthracnose, caused by Colletotrichum spp., is a threat to strawberry production globally. Unlike their chemical counterparts, microbial biofungicides offer a method of postharvest fungal disease control that is safe, sustainable and less affected by pathogen resistance. The present study evaluated the antifungal effects of three bacteria, Bacillus velezensis strains SH1 and SH2 and Pseudomonas azotoformans strain SH3, obtained from sheep manure compost tea. The bacteria or their cell-free filtrates were tested against Colletotrichum acutatum and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides in bioassays and against strawberry anthracnose. In addition, precipitated or extracted extracellular fractions were tested to determine the effects on membrane permeability of Colletotrichum spp. spores. Confrontation assay results showed all bacteria inhibited mycelial growth, with B. velezensis SH1 and P. azotoformans SH3 being the most effective. All cell-free filtrates inhibited mycelial growth with B. velezensis SH1 and SH2 resulting in the highest inhibition. The bacteria suppressed anthracnose lesions on strawberry fruit although effective treatments varied by causal mould. B. velezensis SH1 and SH2 significantly permeabilized spore membranes, indicating antibiosis as a possible mode of action. Investigation into antimicrobial compound production found various homologues of the lipopeptides fengycin, iturin and surfactin were produced by B. velezensis SH1 and SH2. Results suggest that lipopeptides produced by B. velezensis strains permeabilize Colletotrichum cell membranes, and that fengycins were the most inhibitory of the lipopeptides against Colletotrichum spp.

AB  - Background Cannabinoids and their derivatives attract strong interest due to the tremendous potential of their psychoactive effects for treating psychiatric disorders and symptoms. However, their clinical application is restricted by various side-effects such as impaired coordination, anxiety, and learning and memory disability. Adverse impact on dorsal striatum-dependent learning is an important side-effect of cannabinoids. As one of the most important forms of learning mediated by the dorsal striatum, reinforcement learning is characterized by an initial association learning phase, followed by habit learning. While the effects of cannabinoids on habit learning have been well-studied, little is known about how cannabinoids influence the initial phase of reinforcement learning. Results We found that acute activation of cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1R) by the synthetic cannabinoid HU210 induced dose-dependent impairment of association learning, which could be alleviated by intra-dorsomedial striatum (DMS) injection of CB1R antagonist. Moreover, acute exposure to HU210 elicited enhanced synaptic transmission in striatonigral "direct" pathway medium spiny neurons (MSNs) but not indirect pathway neurons in DMS. Intriguingly, enhancement of synaptic transmission that is also observed after learning was abolished by HU210, indicating cannabinoid system might disrupt reinforcement learning by confounding synaptic plasticity normally required for learning. Remarkably, the impaired response-reinforcer learning was also induced by selectively enhancing the D1-MSN (MSN that selectively expresses the dopamine receptor type 1) activity by virally expressing excitatory hM3Dq DREADD (designer receptor exclusively activated by a designer drug), which could be rescued by specifically silencing the D1-MSN activity via hM4Di DREADD. Conclusion Our findings demonstrate dose-dependent deleterious effects of cannabinoids on association learning by disrupting plasticity change required for learning associated with the striatal direct pathway, which furthers our understanding of the side-effects of cannabinoids and the underlying mechanisms.

AB  - UV-C irradiation is known to enhance plant resistance against insect pests. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of low doses of UV-C on Macrosiphum rosae infesting greenhouse rose (Rosa x hybrida) plants. The application of 2.5-kJ/m(2) UV-C irradiation on rose leaves before infestation induced anti-herbivore resistance and negatively affected the aphid fecundity. No eggs and first instar nymphs were recorded on irradiated leaves, whereas an average of 4.3 and 2.7 eggs and 6.7 and 14 first instars were recorded on vars. "Etoile Brilante" and "Arlen Francis" untreated leaves, respectively. UV-C irradiation reduced the aphid population from naturally infested rose plants by up to 58%. In a greenhouse pot trial (GPT) in 2019, UV-C irradiation minimised the initial aphid population six hours after treatment. UV-C elicited host resistance and, also, helped in aphid repulsion without killing the adult individuals. UV-C did not affect the physiological responses of rose plants. The net CO2 assimilation of the UV-C irradiated plants ranged between 10.55 and 15.21 mu mol/m(2). sec for "Arlen Francis" and between 10.51 and 13.75 mu mol/m(2). sec for "Etoile Brilante" plants. These values, with only a few exceptions, were similar to those recorded to the untreated plants.

AB  - Elicitor-induced defences are a new addition in plants' armour to counter insect herbivory. It is unknown whether exogenously-applied jasmonic acid and salicylic acid (JA & SA) induced defence in pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan) can reduce Maruca vitrata (Fab.) herbivory. We exogenously treated one resistant (AL 1747) and one susceptible (MN 1) pigeon pea genotype with JA (100 mu M) and SA (5 mM) at 50% flowering stage (five treatments each). Then, we quantified pigeon pea secondary plant metabolites and M. vitrata nutritional indices. Approximate digestibility, efficiency of conversion of ingested and digested food into body matter, and relative growth rate of M. vitrata larvae were significantly reduced on plants pre-treated with JA and then infested with M. vitrata (PJA + MV); however, consumption index was increased. SA applications also altered the nutritional indices of M. vitrata, but the effects were not as pronounced as JA applications. PJA + MV treatment rapidly increased the level of tannins, total phenols and total protease inhibitors in flowers of both genotypes one day after treatment (DAT); this induction was more noticeable in the resistant genotype. However, only constitutive levels of the aforesaid compounds were detected at 7 DAT. Thus, JA and SA can significantly enhance pigeonpea defences against M. vitrata, providing farmers with an environmentally friendly alternative to synthetic pesticides. Researchers can further explore the use of natural or synthetic elicitors in integrated pest management, potentially combining them with biological control.

AB  - Composting with efficient microbes is considered a sustainable strategy for effective conversion of agricultural discards into a productive biofertilizer. The present study was designed to isolate fungal strain efficient in releasing hydrolytic enzymes for accelerated decomposition and value addition of press mud (PM). In order to tolerate higher temperatures and pH variations during composting, the analysis specifies the different enzymatic behavior at varied temperature and pH range and the strain was also tested for aflatoxins production to produce biofertilizer safe for crop application. The physicochemical characteristics of PM such as total organic carbon (TOC), C/N ratio, electrical conductivity (EC), cation exchange capacity (CEC), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), total phosphorus (TP), and total potassium (TK) during composting were also studied as compared to control. The results indicated that among seven fungal isolates, Aspergillus niger (A. niger) PM-4 was selected as the best enzyme producers by producing carboxymethyl cellulase (CMCase) alpha Amylase, pectinase, and xylanase at a broader temperature and pH spectrum. Composting of PM with A. niger PM-4 leads to significant reduction in TOC (21.2%), C/N ratio (21.3%), increase in EC (25%), CEC (98%), TKN (10.5%), TP (9.2%), and TK (41%) compared to control with one month maturity duration. The A. niger PM-4 also inhibiting mycotoxin growth (aflatoxins) and its inoculation into PM generated mature biofertilizer with germination index (GI) 96.5% after a month representing a cheaper, effective and sustainable approach for waste utilization.

AB  - Magnesium (Mg) ions play a crucial role in the growth and development of tea plants (Camellia sinensis). In this study, the ion kinetic method was used to analyze the effect of ions from various elements on the Mg ion uptake rate in two tea plant varieties (Rougui and Shuixian). Additionally, Mg ion content and the expression intensity of CsMGT5 gene in the tea plant's root system were measured to further understand how different elemental ions affect Mg ion uptake and accumulation. The results revealed that while the trends in the effects of different elements on Mg ion uptake were similar in both Rougui and Shuixian roots, the magnitude of these effects was lower in Rougui and higher in Shuixian. In the presence of only Mg ions in the solution, the tea plant's root system exhibited the highest intensity of CsMGT5 gene expression, the fastest uptake rate of Mg ion, and the highest Mg content. Conversely, the presence of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium ions alone reduced CsMGT5 gene expression, Mg ion uptake rate, and Mg content in the tea plant's root system. However, differences in the impact of these three elements on Mg ion uptake and accumulation were not statistically significant. In addition, with the increase in the types of added ions, the Mg ion uptake rate by tea plants gradually declined, indicating a decreasing demand, with Mg accumulation showing a downward trend. Statistical analysis of correlations showed that CsMGT5 gene expression in the tea plant's root system positively regulated the maximum uptake rate of Mg ion (Imax value, 0.94 **). The Imax value negatively regulated Mg ion content in solution (Cmin value, -0.94 **), and the Cmin value negatively regulated Mg ion content in the tea plant's root system (-0.95 **). In conclusion, the presence of different elemental ions significantly influenced the uptake and accumulation of Mg ions in tea plants, with the magnitude of this effect intensifying as the number of elemental types increased. A positive correlation was observed between the capacity for Mg ion uptake and accumulation capacity in the tea plant's root system and the expression intensity of the CsMGT5 gene within the root system. This study offers valuable insights and serves as an important reference for leveraging Mg to regulate tea plant growth in practical agricultural applications.

AB  - Rhinotermitidae (Isoptera) is an economically important termite family globally. The family is not monophyletic, and the relationships among some of its taxa remain confusing. The taxonomic status of some subfamilies is likely questionable because of various morphological characters of the soldiers and imagoes. Twenty species in 10 genera, representing all six subfamilies of Rhinotermitidae were studied herein. Morphological phylogenetic trees based on 65 characters and molecular phylogenetic trees based on mitochondrial COII and 16SrRNA genes were reconstructed. The sequence composition and genetic distance were analyzed. Based on these results, Rhinotermitidae is polyphyletic. In the morphological trees, the family was divided into five clades. Heterotermitinae and Coptotermitinae were grouped into the most apical one of them and constituted the sister group to Termitidae in the Bayesian inference (BI) tree. In the combined molecular tree, Rhinotermitidae was divided into three clades. The position of the Glade composing Heterotermitinae and Coptotermitinae was the same as in the morphological BI tree. The nucleotide sequence analyses also showed that the genetic distances between Heterotermitinae or Coptotermitinae with Termitidae might be closer than those between Heterotermitinae or Coptotermitinae with other subfamilies in Rhinotermitidae. It is postulated that the relationship of Heterotermitinae and Coptotermitinae with other subfamilies of Rhinotermitidae is not as close as that indicated in the current taxonomic system. They might be the real representative of the intermediate lineage from lower to higher termites. These findings further suggest that Heterotermitinae and Coptotermitinae should be separated from Rhinotermitidae and be upgraded as a whole to family rank.

AB  - During the productive polar day, zooplankton and sea-ice amphipods fulfill a critical role in energy transfer from primary producers to higher trophic-level species in Arctic marine ecosystems. Recent polar night studies on zooplankton and sea-ice amphipods suggest higher levels of biological activity than previously assumed. However, it is unknown if these invertebrates maintain polar night activity on stored lipids, opportunistic feeding, or a combination of both. To assess how zooplankton (copepods, amphipods, and krill) and sea-ice amphipods support themselves on seasonally varying resources, we studied their lipid classes, fatty acid compositions, and compound-specific stable isotopes of trophic biomarker fatty acids during polar day (June/July) and polar night (January). Lipid storage and fatty acid results confirm previously described dietary sources in all species during polar day. We found evidence of polar night feeding in all species, including shifts from herbivory to omnivory. Sympagic-, pelagic-, and Calanus spp.-derived carbon sources supported zooplankton and sea-ice amphipods in both seasons. We provide a first indication of polar night feeding of sea-ice amphipods in the pelagic realm.

AB  - The Gamma model is a novel approach to characterise the complex degradation dynamics taking place during anaerobic digestion. This three parameters model results from combining the first-order kinetic model and the Gamma distribution function. In contrast to conventional models, where the kinetic constant is considered invariant, the Gamma model allows analysing the variability of the kinetic constant using a probability density function. The kinetic constant of mono-digestion and co-digestion batch tests of different wastes were modelled using the Gamma model and two common first-order models: one-step one-fraction model and one-step twofraction model. The Gamma distribution function approximates three distinct probability density functions, i.e. exponential, log-normal, and delta Dirac. Specifically, (i) cattle paunch and pig manure approximated a lognormal distribution; (ii) cattle manure and microalgae approximated an exponential distribution, and (iii) primary sludge and cellulose approximated a delta Dirac distribution. The Gamma model was able to characterise two distinct waste activated sludge, one approximated to a log-normal distribution and the other to an exponential distribution. The same cellulose was tested with two different inocula; in both tests, the Gamma distribution function approximated a delta Dirac function but with a different kinetic value. The potential and consistency of Gamma model were also evident when analysing pig manure and microalgae co-digestion batch tests since (i) the mean k of the co-digestion tests were within the values of the mono-digestion tests, and (ii) the profile of the density function transitioned from log-normal to exponential distribution as the percentage of microalgae in the mixture increased.

AB  - Recognizing form and function of animal defenses is paramount to understanding the ecological and evolutionary forces behind predator and prey dynamics. Color patterns are strongly related to defensive strategies in animals. Some rely on camouflage to avoid detection, while others are brightly colored and conspicuously signal their noxiousness to potential predators. Still others combine cryptic dorsal coloration with colorful patches that are concealed in resting position but are facultatively unveiled by special behavior or simply during activity. Such hidden conspicuous color patches may be an intermediate stage in the evolution from camouflage to aposematism. Many species, especially treefrogs of the family Hylidae, are generally considered to be cryptic, yet show colorful patches on their flanks or thighs and have defensive skin secretions that may have unpalatable properties. We investigated whether the conspicuous black and yellow spotted pattern on the thighs of Eastern Gray Treefrogs (Hyla versicolor) serve as an aposematic signal. We conducted a palatability study to test whether Gray Treefrog skin secretions are unpalatable, and a clay model field study to test whether the conspicuous black and yellow thigh pattern is an aposematic warning coloration that reduces predation. Frog secretions were discriminated against during palatability assays, and clay models painted with a spotted black and yellow pattern suffered lower predation rates. Our findings support the hypothesis that hidden color patches act as aposematic signals in Gray Treefrogs and suggest that more species benefit from aposematic coloration than currently appreciated.

AB  - Simple Summary Welfare farming of pigs is a kind of farming method that pays attention to the welfare of animals, which is of great significance to the health and production performance of pigs. The estimation of pig weight based on computer vision can avoid direct contact with pigs, reduce the loss caused by contact or pressure, and ultimately improve the overall breeding efficiency and economic benefits. In this paper, we proposed a new pig weight estimation method based on Mask R-CNN and machine learning methods. Our new method extracted features from a new perspective to solve the problem of illumination and body bending.The experimental results show that our method can accurately predict the weight of pigs.Abstract Using computer vision technology to estimate pig live weight is an important method to realize pig welfare. But there are two key issues that affect pigs' weight estimation: one is the uneven illumination, which leads to unclear contour extraction of pigs, and the other is the bending of the pig body, which leads to incorrect pig body information. For the first one, Mask R-CNN was used to extract the contour of the pig, and the obtained mask image was converted into a binary image from which we were able to obtain a more accurate contour image. For the second one, the body length, hip width and the distance from the camera to the pig back were corrected by XGBoost and actual measured information. Then we analyzed the rationality of the extracted features. Three feature combination strategies were used to predict pig weight. In total, 1505 back images of 39 pigs obtained using Azure kinect DK were used in the numerical experiments. The highest prediction accuracy is XGBoost, with an MAE of 0.389, RMSE of 0.576, MAPE of 0.318% and R2 of 0.995. We also recommend using the Mask R-CNN + RFR method because it has fairly high precision in each strategy. The experimental results show that our proposed method has excellent performance in live weight estimation of pigs.

AB  - Simple Summary This study develops a deep learning framework called PorcineAI-enhancer to predict enhancer sequences in pigs. Enhancers play a key role in regulating gene expression. However, identifying enhancers experimentally remains challenging. This study constructs a reliable pig enhancer dataset by integrating multiple data sources. The PorcineAI-enhancer model employs convolutional neural networks to extract features from DNA sequences and classify them into enhancers or non-enhancers. Evaluation on an independent test set shows the model has excellent performance. It also demonstrates strong predictive capability on tissue-specific enhancers from human and pig. This tool facilitates research on gene regulation mechanisms in pigs. It provides valuable resources to understand complex traits related to agriculture and biomedicine.Abstract Understanding the mechanisms of gene expression regulation is crucial in animal breeding. Cis-regulatory DNA sequences, such as enhancers, play a key role in regulating gene expression. Identifying enhancers is challenging, despite the use of experimental techniques and computational methods. Enhancer prediction in the pig genome is particularly significant due to the costliness of high-throughput experimental techniques. The study constructed a high-quality database of pig enhancers by integrating information from multiple sources. A deep learning prediction framework called PorcineAI-enhancer was developed for the prediction of pig enhancers. This framework employs convolutional neural networks for feature extraction and classification. PorcineAI-enhancer showed excellent performance in predicting pig enhancers, validated on an independent test dataset. The model demonstrated reliable prediction capability for unknown enhancer sequences and performed remarkably well on tissue-specific enhancer sequences.The study developed a deep learning prediction framework, PorcineAI-enhancer, for predicting pig enhancers. The model demonstrated significant predictive performance and potential for tissue-specific enhancers. This research provides valuable resources for future studies on gene expression regulation in pigs.

AB  - While the echolocation behavior and specialized adaptive auditory system of the greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) are well documented, comprehensive insights into its wild ecology, especially its detailed nocturnal movements for foraging behavior, remain scarce. Therefore, our objective was to obtain information on the spatiotemporal features of the movements of the Japanese greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus nippon), a close relative of R. ferrumequinum, during foraging. Hence, we investigated the nightly flight paths of R. nippon using high-resolution GPS data loggers. Initially, hidden Markov modeling analysis classified bat flight paths into two behavioral patterns: commuting and area-restricted behavior, the latter primarily corresponding to foraging activities. Focusing on foraging behavior along their trajectory, we observed that R. nippon repeatedly foraged with brief stops lasting only a few minutes and an average distance of approximately 300 m between any two foraging sites. Notably, one individual covered a considerable distance (23.6 km) from its roost, possibly because of irregular social behavior during the mating season. Furthermore, for commuting, bats occasionally used forest roads, which were located along the middle of relatively steep slopes. In cases of echolocations with limited detection distances, echoes from the ground and adjacent tree lines offered crucial navigation cues, underscoring the significance of forest roads as nightly movement routes for echolocating bats. Overall, our findings highlight the importance and urgency of ongoing research on bat movement ecology in Japan.

AB  - Background: Neurodegenerative disorders are associated with chronic neuroinflammation, which contributes to their pathogenesis and progression. Resveratrol (RSV) is a polyphenolic compound with strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. In the present study, we investigated whether RSV could protect against cognitive impairment and inflammatory response in a mouse model of chronic neuroinflammation induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Method: Mice received oral RSV (30 mg/kg) or vehicle for two weeks, and injected with LPS (0.75 mg/kg) or saline daily for the last seven days. After two weeks, mice were subjected to behavioral assessments using the Morris water maze and Y-maze. Moreover, mRNA expression of several inflammatory markers, neuronal loss, and glial density were evaluated in the hippocampus of treated mice. Results: Our findings showed that RSV treatment effectively improved spatial and working memory impairments induced by LPS. In addition, RSV significantly reduced hippocampal glial densities and neuronal loss in LPSinjected mice. Moreover, RSV treatment suppressed LPS-induced upregulation of NF-kappa B, IL-6, IL-1 beta, and GFAP in the hippocampus of treated mice. Conclusion: Taken together, our results highlight the detrimental effect of systemic inflammation on the hippocampus and the potential of natural products with anti-inflammatory effects to counteract this impact.

AB  - Twenty-two pluriparous single-foetus-bearing Angora goats, housed 3 weeks pre-partum in mid-December, and in transition from pregnancy to lactation were used to test the efficacy of post-partum supplementation (Group S: 11 goats) or not (Group C: 11 goats) with 300 g/head/day of whole field bean seeds (WFBS) to a diet based on mixed hay ad libitum and natural pasture. The goats were maintained with the suckling of their kids for 90 days. Significant decreases in liveweight (LW) and body condition score (BCS), were documented post-parturition in both groups and were then maintained throughout. These suggest a mobilisation in body tissue that was not mitigated by WFBS supplementation. However, the faster growth of the suckled kids and greater elongation of mohair fibre recorded (Group S > Group C), suggested improvement in partition towards production indices of lactation and hair fibre deposition, respectively. Greater concentrations of total thyroid hormones, T3 and T4 in supplemented does were recorded. Overall mean (pre-prandial) plasma insulin concentrations, not different between treatments, decreased (p < 0.5) from pre-partum concentration, and showed a pattern in time, similar to that of LW and BCS. Insulin appeared not to contribute to the suggested lactational and hair growth effects and possibly contributed to transition by a homeorhetic-type reduction in concentration post-partum. Mean plasma insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) concentrations trended lower due to supplementation from 3 weeks after kidding. It is concluded that WFBS supplementation was efficacious in improving production indices of the transition Angora goats. The feeding of different quantities of WFBS should be investigated.

AB  - Plants play an important role in maintaining the ecological balance of the biosphere, but often suffer from pathogenic fungi during growth. During our continuing mycological surveys of plant pathogens from terrestrial plants in Jiangxi and Yunnan provinces, China, 24 strains of Pestalotiopsis isolated from diseased and healthy tissues of plant leaves represented eight new species, viz. P. alpinicola, P. camelliicola, P. cyclosora, P. eriobotryae, P. gardeniae, P. hederae, P. machiliana and P. mangifericola. Multi-locus (ITS, tef1-alpha and tub2) phylogenetic analyses were performed using maximum-likelihood and Bayesian inference to reveal their taxonomic placement within Pestalotiopsis. Both molecular phylogenetic analyses and morphological comparisons supported them as eight independent taxa within Pestalotiopsis. Illustrations and descriptions of these eight taxa were provided, in conjunction with comparisons with closely related taxa in the genus. This work highlights the large potential for new fungal species associated with diseased plant leaves.

AB  - Background Host plant-microbe associations mediate interspecific interactions amongst herbivorous insects. However, this theory has rarely been ecologically verified in tephritid fruit flies. Research on this subject can not only help predict tephritid species invasion and occurrence patterns, but also develop potential novel lures for the control of the tephritid fruit fly pests. Recently, we observed mixed infestation of Bactrocera minax and Bactrocera dorsalis larvae in citrus orchards, which prompted us to explore the underlying mechanism. Results Following oviposition by B. minax, the yeast Pichia kluyveri translocated to and proliferated inside the citrus fruit. The level of d-limonene released from citrus fruits containing P. kluyveri was 27 times higher than that released from healthy fruits. Mature B. dorsalis females were attracted to d-limonene and oviposited into fruits previously infested by B. minax. Furthermore, the interspecific interaction between B. dorsalis and B. minax within the same fruit significantly decreased the number of surviving larvae and pupal weight in B. dorsalis, but its effect on B. minax was weaker. Conclusion In the studied interspecific interaction, B. minax occupies the dominant position, implying ecological significance for this species in terms of consolidating its own niche and inhibiting the invasion of exotic species. To our best knowledge, this is the first report from both ecological and physiological perspectives on a symbiotic yeast mediating the interaction between B. minax and B. dorsalis through altering fruit volatiles.

AB  - Camellia japonica L. (Theaceae) has been used for medicinal and cosmetic purposes in East Asian countries. Most functional components were obtained from the upper parts of the tree, such as leaves, flowers, or seeds. Here, we report a functional effect of the 80% methanolic extract of C. japonica root (CJRE) on antioxidative stress in HeLa cells. The nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) is a key transcription factor that triggers the induction of oxidative stress-relating genes and drug detoxification. As result, CJRE showed a strong anti-radical scavenging effect in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, the induction of antioxidant response elements (ARE)-luciferase activity was maximized at CJRE 200 mu g/mL. Furthermore, CJRE induced the mRNA levels of HO-1 and NQO1 by the nuclear NRF2 accumulation. As a possible mechanism of Nrf2 activation, the phosphorylation of p38 and ERK1/2 signaling might fortify the NRF2 induction as well as its stability. However, the phosphorylation of AKT is rather decreased. Taken together, CJRE may potentiate the antioxidant effects by increasing the NRF2 signaling through MAP kinase signaling and the properties of its radical scavenging activity. Thus, CJRE could apply for other medicinal and cosmetic purposes.

AB  - Camelina (Camelina sativa) is a robust crop to cultivate and a potential source of protein, oil and n-3 fatty acids for aquaculture. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of camelina seed in feed on rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) performance and nutritional composition of the muscle. A mixture of faba bean, wheat gluten meal and rapeseed oil was gradually replaced by camelina seed (0%, 10% and 20% camelina in the diet). Fifty 0+ old fish were placed in each of the 12 recirculation aquaculture tanks to enable three treatments with four replicates. Camelina seed inclusion did not affect the growth performance, crude protein or fat content of fish body. The moisture content was the lowest (p = 0.021) with 20% camelina. The vitamin D-3 contents in fish muscle were low, indicating that camelina may slightly impair the absorption of vitamin D-3 (p = 0.055). Camelina diets decreased (p < 0.001) the proportion of monounsaturated fatty acids and increased (p < 0.001) polyunsaturated fatty acids and n-3 fatty acids, particularly alpha-linolenic acid, in fish muscle. Camelina seed proved to be a potential plant-based ingredient for rainbow trout feed.

AB  - Terahertz (THz) radiation has a wide range of applications including use in medicine. However, effects of high-power THz radiation have not been clearly elucidated. We used a 2.52 THz self-made optically pumped gas THz laser, the low- and high-energy group, to irradiate the backs of Hartley guinea pigs. RNA-sequencing was done to explore global transcriptional responses in the irradiated skin. Gene Ontology analysis revealed that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the unexposed and low-energy exposed groups were associated with skin development, skin barrier establishment, and multicellular organismal water homeostasis or water loss regulation via the skin. On the other hand, comparison between the unexposed and high-energy exposed groups showed that the DEGs mediated monocarboxylic acid metabolism, blood vessel morphogenesis, establishment of skin barrier, blood vessel development, or angiogenesis. Our analyses demonstrate the potential effects of high-power THz source on the skin and sets the basis for further studies on the safety and application of the high-power THz in dermatology.

AB  - A modified Nzi trap was tested at a residence and at a farm in eastern Ontario, Canada to better capture high-flying tabanids (Diptera) such as Chrysops Meigen. A new upper trap entrance was created to provide a higher and larger opening by reducing the front blue top shelf to half its height. To minimise escape of low-flying tabanids, a vertical inner baffle was added to direct low-flying tabanids up into the cone. Half of the tests of 18 new designs caught 1.5-2.7 times more deer flies than the Nzi trap did, with the other trap designs being as effective as the Nzi trap. The optimal design that maintained equal catches of other biting flies relative to the Nzi trap was one with a phthalogen inner horizontal shelf and a netting inner vertical baffle. This design is defined in the present as the "bi-level Nzi trap." Chrysops entered the trap mostly through the top (88%; 17 spp.), along with Hybomitra Enderlein (94%; 12 spp.). Tabanus Linnaeus (9 spp.) entered through both entrances. The most abundant Tabanus, T. quinquevittatus Wiedemann, entered mostly through the bottom (70%), whereas Stomoxys calcitrans Linnaeus entered mostly through the top (92%).
   Un piege Nzi modifie a ete mis a l'essai dans une residence et dans une ferme de l'est de l'Ontario, Canada pour mieux attraper les tabanides (Diptera) volant a haute altitude comme les Chrysops Meigen. Une nouvelle entree superieure au piege a ete creee pour fournir une ouverture plus haute et plus grande en reduisant simplement l'etagere superieure bleue avant a la moitie de sa hauteur. Pour minimiser la fuite des tabanides volant a basse altitude, un deflecteur interieur vertical a ete ajoute pour diriger les tabanides volant a basse altitude dans le cone. La moitie des tests de 18 nouveaux modeles ont capture 1,5 a 2,7 fois plus de mouches a chevreuil que le piege Nzi; les autres modeles de piege etaient aussi efficaces que le piege Nzi. Le modele optimal qui maintenait des captures egales d'autres mouches piqueuses par rapport au piege Nzi etait celui avec une etagere horizontale interieure en phtalogene et une chicane verticale interieure en filet. Ce modele est defini comme << le piege Nzi a deux niveaux >>. Chrysops sont entrees principalement par le haut (88 %, 17 spp.), ainsi que Hybomitra Enderlein (94 %, 12 spp.). Tabanus Linnaeus (9 spp.) est entre par les deux entrees. La Tabanus la plus abondante, T. quinquevittatus Wiedemann, est entree principalement par le fond (70 %), tandis que Stomoxys calcitrans Linnaeus est entre principalement par le haut (92 %).

KW  - ALIGNMENT
KW  - SEARCH
AB  - Before implementing metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) in the routine diagnostic laboratory, several challenges need to be resolved. To address strengths and limitations of mNGS in bacterial detection and quantification in samples with overwhelming host DNA abundance, we used the pig muscle tissue spiked with a home-made bacterial mock community, consisting of four species from different phyla. From the spiked tissue, we extracted DNA using: (i) a procedure based on mechanical/chemical lysis (no bacterial DNA enrichment); (ii) the Ultra-Deep Microbiome Prep (Molzym) kit for bacterial DNA enrichment; and (iii) the same enrichment kit but replacing the original proteinase K treatment for tissue solubilization by a collagenases/thermolysin digestion and cell filtration. Following mNGS, we determined bacterial: 'host' read ratios and taxonomic abundance profiles. We calculated the load of each mock-community member by combining its read counts with read counts and microscopically-determined cell counts of other co-spiked bacteria. In unenriched samples, bacterial quantification and taxonomic profiling were fairly accurate but at the expense of the sensitivity of detection. The removal of 'host' DNA by the modified enrichment protocol substantially improved bacterial detection in comparison to the other two extraction procedures and generated less distorted taxonomic profiles as compared to the original enrichment protocol.

AB  - The hippocampal formation (HF) processes spatial memories for cache locations in food-hoarding birds. Hoarding is a seasonal behavior, and seasonal changes in the HF have been described in some studies, but not in others. One potential reason is that birds may have been sampled during the seasonal hoarding peak in some studies, but not in others. In this study, we investigate the seasonal changes in hoarding and HF in willow tits (Poecile montanus). We compare this to seasonal changes in HF in a closely related non-hoarding bird, the great tit (Parus major). Willow tits near Oulu, Finland, show a seasonal hoarding peak in September and both HF volume and neuron number show a similar peak. HF neuronal density also increases in September, but then remains the same throughout winter. Unexpectedly, the great tit HF also changes seasonally, although in a different pattern: the great tit telencephalon increases in volume from July to August and decreases again in November. Great tit HF volume follows suit, but with a delay. Great tit HF neuron number and density also increase from August to September and stay high throughout winter. We hypothesize that seasonal changes in hoarding birds' HF are driven by food-hoarding experience (e.g., the formation of thousands of memories). The seasonal changes in great tit brains may also be due to experience-dependent plasticity, responding to changes in the social and spatial environment. Large-scale experience-dependent neural plasticity is therefore probably not an adaptation of food-hoarding birds, but a general property of the avian HF and telencephalon.

AB  - Theca cells (TCs) play a unique role in the structure and function of the ovary. They are not only the structural basis of the follicle but also the androgen-secreting cells in female mammals, which can affect the normal development and atresia of the follicle. The results showed that melatonin receptor (MTR) MT1 and MT2 were expressed on sheep TCs. In the present study, the effects of different concentrations of MT at 0, 10-10, 10-8, 10-6 and 10-4 M/L on sheep TCs with regards to the antioxidant levels, prolif-eration, apoptosis and steroid hormone secretion were investigated. The results showed that in sheep TCs, all concentrations of MT significantly decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) concentration and BAX expression; increased Cat, Sod1, and BCL-2 expression. The proliferation viability of TCs was significantly inhibited in all groups except for 10-10 M/L MT, and the expression of cyclin D1 and CDK4 was significantly reduced. MT significantly increased StAR expression and progesterone secretion in TCs, but there was no significant effect on androgen secretion and CYP11A1, CYP17A1 and 3b-HSD expression in all groups. MT-induced progesterone secretion was completely inhibited by Luzindole (a nonspecific MT1 and MT2 inhibitor) and partially inhibited by 4p-PDOT (specific MT2 inhibitor). MT-induced pro-gesterone secretion can be inhibited by LY294002 (PI3K/AKT pathway inhibitor). This study indicated that MT inhibits apoptosis and proliferation of in vitro cultured sheep TCs, which has implications for slowing ovarian atresia and aging. MT activates the PI3K/Akt pathway to mediate the synthesis and secretion of progesterone by TCs. This study provides a basis for further exploration of the role of TCs on follicle development and ovarian steroid hormone secretion.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Piagetian object permanence (OP) refers to the ability to know that an object continues to exist when out of sight: In humans, it develops in six stages. Species of great apes, other mammals, and birds (parrots, corvids, and pigeons) have been shown to possess partial or full OP, which is a prerequisite for more complex physical cognition abilities they may possess. In birds, the greatest variation is in Stage 6 (invisible displacements) and in "A-not-B" errors-incorrectly persevering in searching an empty location rewarded previously. Caching abilities have been invoked as holding explanatory power over results in corvids, for which this error is sometimes completely absent. The rook (Corvus frugilegus), a cognitively advanced, social, caching corvid, has not yet been studied for OP. This study applies tasks of one OP scale commonly adapted for nonhuman animals, Uzgiris and Hunt's Scale 1, as well as later-conceived tasks 16 and S, to a sample of adult, captive rooks. One rook demonstrated full OP (Stage 6b, multiple invisible displacements), whereas other individuals varied, attaining between Stages 5a (single visible displacements) and 6a (single invisible displacements). Like some corvids, a few made transient "A-not-B" errors. Behavioral considerations potentially underlying observed individual variation in results in rooks, including dominance, neophobia, past experiences, and individual idiosyncrasies, are examined. Rooks, like other corvids, possess well-developed OP abilities, and these results support the idea that exertion of executive control is required to avoid "A-not-B" errors, rather than caching abilities or developmental age, as previously suggested.

AB  - alpha-Farnesene accumulated in tea plants following infestations by most insects, and mechanical wounding is the common factor. However, the specific mechanism underlying the wounding-regulated accumulation of alpha-far-nesene in tea plants remains unclear. In this study, we observed that histone deacetylase inhibitor treatment induced the accumulation of alpha-farnesene. The histone deacetylase CsHDA6 interacted directly with CsMYC2, which was an important transcription factor in the jasmonic acid (JA) pathway, and co-regulated the expression of the key alpha-farnesene synthesis gene CsAFS. Wounding caused by insect infestation affected CsHDA6 production at the transcript and protein levels, while also inhibited the binding of CsHDA6 to the CsAFS promoter. The resulting increased acetylation of histones H3/H4 in CsAFS enhanced the expression of CsAFS and the accu-mulation of alpha-farnesene. In conclusion, our study demonstrated the effect of histone acetylation on the pro-duction of tea plant HIPVs and revealed the importance of the CsHDA6-CsMYC2 transcriptional regulatory module.

AB  - Simple Summary The forest musk deer is a wild animal that is endangered due to widespread hunting for its musk, which is used in medicine and perfume. Stem cells can differentiate into a variety of cells, tissues, organs, and even complete individuals, which can be used for cell therapy and germplasm preservation. Mesenchymal stem cells are the most abundant stem cells in animals and have been isolated from many animals, such as cows and dogs. In this study, to evaluate the feasibility of isolating mesenchymal stem cells from forest musk deer, bone marrow was collected from forest musk deer, and the cells were isolated and characterized. They exhibit the same stemness and differentiation capacity as other mammals studied previously. Therefore, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells may be an important tool for forest musk deer cell therapy. The forest musk deer (Moschus berezovskii) is an endangered animal that produces musk that is utilized for medical applications worldwide, and this species primarily lives in China. Animal-derived musk can be employed as an important ingredient in Chinese medicine. To investigate the properties of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) obtained from the bone marrow of forest deer for future application, MSCs were isolated and cultivated in vitro. The properties and differentiation of these cells were assessed at the cellular and gene levels. The results show that 81,533 expressed genes were detected by RNA sequencing, and marker genes of MSCs were expressed in the cells. Karyotype analysis of the cells determined the karyotype to be normal, and marker proteins of MSCs were observed to be expressed in the cell membranes. Cells were differentiated into osteoblasts, adipocytes, and chondroblasts. The expression of genes related to osteoblasts, adipocytes, and chondroblasts was observed to be increased. The results of this study demonstrate that the properties of the cells isolated from bone marrow were in keeping with the characteristics of MSCs, providing a possible basis for future research.

AB  - In recent decades, Saiga antelope (Saiga t. tatarica) mass die-offs have become more common. The mass die-off of 2015 in central Kazakhstan, recorded 140,000 individual deaths across multiple herds. Previously, research has shown atmospheric humidity, the bacterium Pasteurella multocida serotype B, and resultant haemorrhagic septicaemia, were the primary cause. However, other synergistic factors may have impacted this process. Here we use a multivariate compositional data analysis (CoDA) approach to assess what other factors may have been involved. We show a pollutant linkage mechanism where relative humidity and dewpoint temperature combine with environmental pollutants, potentially toxic elements (e.g., Hg, As), complex carbon compounds (e.g., Acetone, Toluene), and inorganic compounds (e.g., CHx, SO2) which affected the Saiga during the calving season (start and peak) and at the onset of the mass die-off. We suggest a mechanism for this process. Upon arrival at their carving grounds, the Saiga experienced a sudden precipitation event, a spike in temperatures, and resultant high humidity occurs. The infectious bacterium P. multocida serotype B then spreads. Further, environmental pollutants contained within steppe soils are released to the air, forming localised smog events, these synergistically combine, and mass die-off occurs.

AB  - Plant secondary metabolites (PSMs) can influence the consumption of particular plants by herbivores. Unsubstituted B-ring flavanones (UBFs), which are compounds found in the leaves of Eucalyptus species from the Eucalyptus subgenus (common name monocalypt), deter feeding by common brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) when added to artificial diets at concentrations that reflect those found naturally in foliage. We hypothesised that common ringtail possums (Pseudocheirus peregrinus) would tolerate higher UBF concentrations, because, unlike brushtail possums, they regularly eat monocalypt foliage. This proved to be the case; ringtail possums were not deterred by two different UBFs, pinocembrin and flavanone, at concentrations up to 4.7% dry matter, which is substantially higher than the concentrations that deter brushtail possums. These results extend and refine our understanding of how variation in tolerance or susceptibility to eucalypt PSMs affects the diets of sympatric marsupial folivores, potentially reducing competition for food.

AB  - Different concentrations of sesamol (0, 20, 40, 80 and 160 mg/g protein) were incorporated for evaluating the effects of sesamol on the structural and gel properties of yak myofibrillar proteins (MPs). The results manifested that the contents of active thiol and free amine diminished and the carbonyl contents elevated when the MPs modified with sesamol. The intrinsic fluorescence intensity progressively decreased and surface hydrophobic value displayed a down-up trend after binding with the increasement of sesamol. Moreover, the presence of sesamol reduced protein solubility and increased particle size of MPs. For the protein gels, inclusion of sesamol effectively improved water-holding capacity and gel strength but decremented gel whiteness and the proportion of free water, and significantly enhanced the hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions and disulfide bonds in the gel matrix. Microstructure analysis revealed that a more compact microstructure was formed for the MP-sesamol gels. This study suggests that sesamol is capable of improving the functional properties of MPs, and the complexes of MP-sesamol have potential applications in the food industry.

AB  - Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) at pig farms are significant environmental reservoirs of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). In particular, contamination by multidrug-resistant Alcaligenes faecalis (MDR-AF) poses an increasingly severe threat to human health. However, no safe and effective method is currently available to hinder its dissemination in the environment. In this study, two hitherto unreported bacteriophages were screened. In addition, qPCR experiments demonstrated that applying these bacteriophage preparations to wastewater significantly eradicates MDR-AF and reduces ARGs by 0.7-2.5 orders of magnitude (P < 0.05), thereby substantially diminishing the risk of antibiotic resistance transmission. Furthermore, various characterizations, bacteriophage genomic analysis, and microbial community analysis indicated that these bacteriophage preparations possess safety, specificity, and high resilience, rendering them an efficient and eco-friendly biological control measure.

AB  - Simple Summary Fasciolid flukes collected from sheep and cattle in Ecuador showed a high diversity in DNA sequences whose analyses indicated introductions from South America, European and North American countries. These results agree with the numerous livestock importations performed by Ecuador. Abnormally big-sized liver flukes were found in Ecuadorian sheep. The morphometric phenotypic CIAS study showed that its size maximum and mean very pronouncedly and significantly surpassed those of the Fasciola hepatica populations from South America and Spain and proved to be intermediate between standard F. hepatica and F. gigantica populations. Such a feature is only known in intermediate fasciolid forms in Old World areas where the two species and their specific lymnaeid snail vectors overlap. This argues about a past hybridization after F. gigantica importation from Pakistan and/or introduction of intermediate hybrids previously generated in USA. The lack of heterozygotic rDNA ITS positions differentiating the two species, and of introgressed fragments and heteroplasmic positions in mtDNA genes, indicate a post-hybridization period sufficiently long as for rDNA concerted evolution to complete homogenization and mtDNA to return to homoplasmy. The vector specificity filter due to Radix absence should act as a driving force in accelerating such lineage evolution. Public health implications are finally emphasized. Fascioliasis is a disease caused by Fasciola hepatica worldwide transmitted by lymnaeid snails mainly of the Galba/Fossaria group and F. gigantica restricted to parts of Africa and Asia and transmitted by Radix lymnaeids. Concern has recently risen regarding the high pathogenicity and human infection capacity of F. gigantica. Abnormally big-sized fasciolids were found infecting sheep in Ecuador, the only South American country where F. gigantica has been reported. Their phenotypic comparison with F. hepatica infecting sheep from Peru, Bolivia and Spain, and F. gigantica from Egypt and Vietnam demonstrated the Ecuadorian fasciolids to have size-linked parameters of F. gigantica. Genotyping of these big-sized fasciolids by rDNA ITS-2 and ITS-1 and mtDNA cox1 and nad1 and their comparison with other countries proved the big-sized fasciolids to belong to F. hepatica. Neither heterozygotic ITS position differentiated the two species, and no introgressed fragments and heteroplasmic positions in mtDNA were found. The haplotype diversity indicates introductions mainly from other South American countries, Europe and North America. Big-sized fasciolids from Ecuador and USA are considered to be consequences of F. gigantica introductions by past livestock importations. The vector specificity filter due to Radix absence should act as driving force in the evolution in such lineages.

AB  - We reconstructed the palaeoenvironmental conditions of Cartagena Bay during the Holocene after a multidisciplinary study to identify natural variations and the anthropic processes of this coastal area. A total of 119 samples were recovered for amino acid racemization dating, 3 for radiocarbon dating (C-14), and four sets of 80 samples for sedimentological and palaeontological determination, mineralogical content, biomarker and trace elements quantification. Two natural scenarios were identified from the variations of n-alkane indices and palaeobiological content. The first period (6650-5750 yr cal BP) was marked by the development of euhaline marine conditions with strong inputs from aquatic macrophytes and high biodiversity. After a hiatus, the area underwent a profound change, becoming a paucispecific brackish marsh environment with increasing inputs from land plants, with possible episodes of emersion with a greater presence from terrestrial gastropods (3600-300 cal yr BP). By combining trace element abundance and stanol distributions, our study also provides a novel approach to identify the predominant influence of anthropogenic factors in the last three millennia in the coastal record of Cartagena Bay. Findings confirmed that Pb mining and metallurgy began during the Bronze Age, with considerable inputs of this heavy metal into the atmosphere during Phoenician, Punic and particularly Roman times compared to the Middle Ages. Pollution by Cu and Zn was also observed during Punic and Roman times, and was first documented in the Middle Ages. In addition, faecal stanols, such as coprostanol, derived mainly from humans, and 24-ethylcoprostanol from herbivores were present, thereby indicating for the first time a continuous presence of human populations and significant pollution input since 3600 yr cal BP, this being greater in the late Bronze Age and Phoenician, Punic and Roman times than during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, when the city was in decline.

AB  - Preclinical studies have clearly indicated that offspring of mothers who suffered sleep deprivation during pregnancy exhibit anxiety, depression-like behaviors, and cognitive deficits. The cognitive impairment induced by maternal sleep deprivation (MSD) is currently poorly treated. Growing evidence indicates that an enriched environment (EE) improves cognition function in models of Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and lipopolysaccharide. However, the effects of EE on hippocampal-dependent learning and memory, as well as synaptic plasticity markers changes induced by MSD, are unclear. In the present study, pregnant CD-1 mice were randomly divided into a control group, MSD group, and MSD+EE group. Two different living environments, including standard environment and EE, were prepared. When male and female offspring were 2 months, the open field test and elevated plus maze were used to assess anxiety-like behavior, and the Morris water maze was used to evaluate hippocampal learning and memory. Western blotting and real-time fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction were used to detect the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and Synaptotagmin-1 in the hippocampus of offspring. The results revealed that MSD-induced offspring showed anxiety-like behaviors and cognitive impairment, while EE alleviated anxiety-like behavior and cognitive impairment in offspring of the MSD+EE group. The cognitive impairment induced by MSD was associated with a decreased brain-derived neurotrophic factor and an increased Synaptotagmin-1, while EE increased and decreased brain-derived neurotrophic factor and Synaptotagmin-1 in the hippocampus of mice from the MSD+EE group, respectively. Taken together, we can conclude that EE has beneficial effects on MSD-induced synaptic plasticity markers changes and can alleviate anxiety-like behaviors and cognitive impairment.

AB  - Postmenopausal osteoporosis, characterized by an imbalance between osteoclast-mediated bone resorption and osteoblast-driven bone formation, presents substantial health implications. In this study, we investigated the role of black goat extract (BGE), derived from a domesticated native Korean goat, estrogen-like activity, and osteoprotective effects in vitro. BGE's mineral and fatty acid compositions were analyzed via the ICP-AES method and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, respectively. In vitro experiments were conducted using MCF-7 breast cancer cells, MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts, and RAW264.7 osteoclasts. BGE exhibits a favorable amount of mineral and fatty acid content. It displayed antimenopausal activity by stimulating MCF-7 cell proliferation and augmenting estrogen-related gene expression (ER alpha, ER beta, and pS2). Moreover, BGE positively impacted osteogenesis and mineralization in MC3T3-E1 cells through Wnt/beta-catenin pathway modulation, leading to heightened expression of Runt-related transcription factor 2, osteoprotegerin, and collagen type 1. Significantly, BGE effectively suppressed osteoclastogenesis by curtailing osteoclast formation and activity in RAW264.7 cells, concurrently downregulating pivotal signaling molecules, including receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6. This study offers a shred of preliminary evidence for the prospective use of BGE as an effective postmenopausal osteoporosis treatment.

AB  - Simple Summary In this study, deep learning combined with udder ultrasonography of buffalo was used for the detection of mastitis for the first time, with the aim of establishing an accurate, rapid, and inexpensive method to detect buffalo mastitis instead of routine laboratory examination. This method provides a basis for mastitis detection in buffaloes mostly raised by small farmers and has the opportunity to be used in a variety of dairy animals in the future.Abstract Mastitis is one of the most predominant diseases with a negative impact on ranch products worldwide. It reduces milk production, damages milk quality, increases treatment costs, and even leads to the premature elimination of animals. In addition, failure to take effective measures in time will lead to widespread disease. The key to reducing the losses caused by mastitis lies in the early detection of the disease. The application of deep learning with powerful feature extraction capability in the medical field is receiving increasing attention. The main purpose of this study was to establish a deep learning network for buffalo quarter-level mastitis detection based on 3054 ultrasound images of udders from 271 buffaloes. Two data sets were generated with thresholds of somatic cell count (SCC) set as 2 x 105 cells/mL and 4 x 105 cells/mL, respectively. The udders with SCCs less than the threshold value were defined as healthy udders, and otherwise as mastitis-stricken udders. A total of 3054 udder ultrasound images were randomly divided into a training set (70%), a validation set (15%), and a test set (15%). We used the EfficientNet_b3 model with powerful learning capabilities in combination with the convolutional block attention module (CBAM) to train the mastitis detection model. To solve the problem of sample category imbalance, the PolyLoss module was used as the loss function. The training set and validation set were used to develop the mastitis detection model, and the test set was used to evaluate the network's performance. The results showed that, when the SCC threshold was 2 x 105 cells/mL, our established network exhibited an accuracy of 70.02%, a specificity of 77.93%, a sensitivity of 63.11%, and an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) of 0.77 on the test set. The classification effect of the model was better when the SCC threshold was 4 x 105 cells/mL than when the SCC threshold was 2 x 105 cells/mL. Therefore, when SCC >= 4 x 105 cells/mL was defined as mastitis, our established deep neural network was determined as the most suitable model for farm on-site mastitis detection, and this network model exhibited an accuracy of 75.93%, a specificity of 80.23%, a sensitivity of 70.35%, and AUC 0.83 on the test set. This study established a 1/4 level mastitis detection model which provides a theoretical basis for mastitis detection in buffaloes mostly raised by small farmers lacking mastitis diagnostic conditions in developing countries.

AB  - Birth weight is a key economic trait in pig breeding, affecting pre-weaning survival, growth performance, and overall production efficiency. However, the genetic factors underlying birth weight remain incompletely understood. This study aimed to identify genetic variants associated with birth weight in pigs through a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using 50K SNP genotyping data from 1125 Landrace pigs. Seven significant SNPs linked to birth weight were identified, along with 13 potential candidate genes. To validate these findings, the study population was expanded to include 998 Yorkshire pigs, totaling 2123 individuals. Validation identified two novel SNPs on chromosomes 1 and 16, as well as the previously unreported gene MARCHF11, which was associated with birth weight. These findings enhance the understanding of the genetic architecture underlying birth weight and provide potential targets for molecular marker-assisted selection (MAS). The results offer valuable insights into breeding strategies aimed at improving piglet survival rates and production efficiency. This study underscores the utility of GWAS in identifying key genetic loci for economically important traits in livestock populations.

AB  - The Scotch broom gall mite, Aceria genistae, is an adventive herbivore of Cytisus scoparius (Scotch broom), an invasive non-native shrub in California, USA. Although feeding by these mites clearly induces localised tissue distortion, the effect of A. genistae on overall host vigour and reproduction has not been assessed. Here we compare biomass allocation across various plant organs between two groups, heavily or lightly galled plants, at three northern California sites. Most structural components, including plant height, stem biomass, and leaf biomass, were similar regardless of galling intensity. However, both canopy volume and seeds per plant were reduced in heavily versus lightly galled plants; seeds were reduced up to 80% among larger plants. Collectively, these data suggest A. genistae galls are produced at the cost of seed production. Aceria genistae is a relatively new arrival in California but is already causing measurable effects to plant performance, which are expected to increase over time as mite populations increase and its range expands. Intentionally redistributing this mite is currently illegal in the USA, and this research is part of a broader investigation to inform the biological control agent permit process.

AB  - The periderm plays a crucial role in trees, acting as a barrier protecting internal tissues against biotic and abiotic stresses, thus having an impact on tree physiology, ecology, and general performance. It consists of the meristematic phellogen, whose activity gives rise to suberized phellem (cork) cells outwardly and the parenchymatous phelloderm inwardly. Despite the periderm importance, intra-annual and seasonal changes in phellogen activity and phellem and phelloderm differentiation are poorly recognized. Therefore, we aimed to compare periderm development and functioning in successive years in horse chestnut, utilizing standard histological methods. We distinguished six stages of periderm development, including phellogen initiation and the differentiation of its derivatives. In the following years, the phellogen was active for a similar period, but produced fewer derivative cells. Importantly, some phellogen cells lost their meristematic characteristics before the end of the season and differentiated into phellem. To maintain periderm integrity, the remaining phelloderm cells underwent divisions, leading to phellogen re-initiation. Alternatively, when all periderm cells differentiated into the phellem, the new (subsidiary) phellogen originated from the underneath collenchyma. We postulate that phellogen re-initiation could be a mechanism ensuring the functional integrity of the periderm and discuss the role of phelloderm or collenchyma cells in this process.

AB  - This study investigates the impact of priming on the resistance of tomato plants to the potato aphid Macrosiphum euphorbiae, focusing on the role of glandular trichomes. Glandular trichomes are specific hairs that provide protection to tomato plants against herbivorous insects. The experimental priming conducted in this study revealed that prior infestation by Spodoptera littoralis caterpillars increased the plant's resistance against M. euphorbiae, pointing at the jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathway in regulating this plant-aphid interaction. Glandular trichomes type IV were effective against aphids regardless of the previous infestation. Using JA-deficient tomato (spr2), we observed that M. euphorbiae multiplication increased, while the number of aphids on salicylic -deficient NahG plants was lower than in the wildtype Moneymaker. These findings emphasize the crucial role of the JA signaling pathway in tomato plant resistance to aphids and the importance of glandular trichomes to enhance plant defences against pests.

AB  - Excessive nitrogen input threatens the ecological health of the Yellow River estuary, with the Main Cities in the Yellow River Delta (MCYRD) facing persistent nitrogen management challenges. Previous studies have lacked a detailed characterization of nitrogen metabolism in estuarine and coastal cities, with limited sector-specific assessments, constraining effective management. Based on urban metabolism theory, this study develops a comprehensive nitrogen metabolism model for MCYRD (2015-2023), refining assessments of nitrogen fluxes from extensive animal husbandry and seawater aquaculture. Results show that nitrogen input to the sea fluctuated around 60 Gg, with aquaculture as the dominant contributor (35.53 %) to surface water and the only productive sector with increasing discharge (+5.28 %), followed by animal husbandry (32.00 %). Among them, seawater aquaculture discharged 234.89 % and 508.11 % more nitrogen than inland aquaculture in Binzhou and Dongying, respectively, posing ecological risks due to the lack of wastewater discharge standards, particularly from shellfish farming. Untreated extensive animal husbandry contributed 81.43 % of animal husbandry runoff, with cattle in Binzhou and sheep in Dongying as the major sources, highlighting the urgency of improved manure management. Meanwhile, by enforcing wastewater treatment in aquaculture, MCYRD could cut nitrogen emissions by 13.00 Gg, while fertilizer reduction and livestock intensification offer long-term mitigation potential. Upgrading wastewater treatment technologies remains essential for sustained nitrogen control. Our findings provide a scientific basis for nitrogen pollution management in MCYRD, supporting targeted strategies for coastal ecosystem protection.

AB  - Gut microbiota is essential for intestinal integrity and brain functions. Herein we aimed to investigate the effects of alteration of gut microbiome using broad-spectrum antibiotics on CD 1 male mice (germ-modified group (GM). Moreover, we co-administrated probiotics with or without antibiotics for four weeks and evaluated if probiotics could reverse these behavioral and intestinal effects. GM, co-administered antibiotics and probiotics, and probiotics-only groups were compared to control mice of the same sex, age, and weight that did not receive either drug (n=12 in all groups). Cultivation of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria was evaluated by fecal culture of all groups. We tested exploratory behavior, anxiety, memory, depression-like behavior, and hippocampal and frontal lobe BDNF protein level alterations in response to antibiotics and its downstream effect on the PI3K/ Akt1/Bcl2 pathway. Intestinal integrity was evaluated using gene expression analysis of ZO-1, claudin, and occludin genes. Additionally, the inflammatory TLR4 and p-p38 MAPK pathways in the intestines were investigated. Twice-daily administration of oral antibiotics for four weeks significantly reduced total bacterial count and upregulated TLR4 and p-p38.GM mice showed a significant reduction in BDNF(P =0.04), impaired spatial memory, and long-term memory as evidenced by decreased T maze correct alternation trails and shortened retention time in the passive avoidance test in GM(P =0.01). Passive avoidance showed significantly increased latency after probiotics intake. Depressive-like behavior was more pronounced in GM mice as assessed by the tail suspension test (P =0.01). GM showed significant upregulation(p<0.001) of the TLR4 and p-p38 MAPK pathway. Co-administration of probiotics with antibiotics showed an increase in BDNF levels, and upregulation of the cell survival PI3K/Akt1/Bcl2 pathway, significantly higher relative abundance in the firmucutes members, a significant decrease in the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio and downregulation of TLR4 and p-p38 MAPK. The tight junction proteins ZO-1, claudin and occludin were downregulated by antibiotic administration for four weeks and restored by probiotics. Collectively, the data suggest that long-term use of antibiotics appears to disrupt the intestinal epithelial barrier and alter neurobehavioral qualities specifically, long-term memory and exploratory drive, possibly through the reduction of BDNF, and probiotics partially reverse these effects. Our study emphasizes the effect of prolonged intake of antibiotics on production of dysbiosis as well as the impact of the antibiotic induced intestinal inflammation on neurobehavioral aspects in mice as the memory and anxiety-like behavior. We also reveal that co-administration of probiotics can reverse these changes

AB  - Currently, there is an urgent need to develop novel protein feeds to replace traditional soybean meal from the point of view of feed source, nutrition and cost. Palm kernel meal (PKM) is a potential alternative to traditional soybean meal. The present study evaluated the effect of PKM supplementation in traditional diets of Tibetan sheep on the flavor and fatty acid profile of different parts of adipose tissue of Tibetan sheep. The results showed that the addition of PKM resulted in the deposition of favorable volatile flavor compounds in Tibetan sheep fat, which effectively improved the fat flavor of Tibetan sheep. This finding provides a basis for the improvement of fat flavor in Tibetan sheep and the rational development of PKM feed. Substituting traditional protein feed with palm kernel meal (PKM) in the diet of Tibetan sheep can be a cost-effective feeding strategy. To determine the impact of PKM on flavor development in different adipose tissues of Tibetan sheep, subjects were fed with 15% and 18% of PKM, while the control group received no PKM. The fatty acids and volatile compounds in the samples were then analyzed by GC-MS and HS-GC-IMS. Adding PKM to the diet significantly increased the C12:0, C14:0, C16:0 and C18:1N9 content in adipose tissues compared with the control, and most of these were associated with flavor formation (p < 0.05). The flavor compounds in the adipose tissues predominantly consisted of alcohols, ketones, acids and aldehydes. In particular, including PKM in the diet increased the proportion of ketones but decreased the proportion of alcohols, acids and aldehydes in subcutaneous and tail fat. Specifically, the proportion of acetone, acetoin monomer, 2,3-butanedione, 2-butanone monomer, 2-methyl-2-propanol, 2-methyl-2-propanol and methyl acetate increased significantly in the subcutaneous and tail fat (p < 0.05), while that of ethanol, 1-propanol monomer, butanol monomer, acetic acid monomer and acetic acid monomer decreased. Intermuscular fat exhibited variable results, mainly because the addition of PKM resulted in higher proportions of alcohols, including ethanol, 1-propanol and butanol monomer, especially at 15% PKM. In summary, the addition of PKM improved the flavor of Tibetan sheep fat and increased the amount of favorable volatile flavor compounds. This study can serve as reference for understanding the effects of dietary PKM on the adipose tissue flavor profile of Tibetan sheep.

AB  - The sand cat is one of the world's least studied small cats. Our camera-trap survey, one of the largest undertaken in a desert system, generated over 1500 images of the species across 100 camera-traps distributed systematically over the 2400 km(2) core area of the Uruq Bani Ma'arid Protected Area of the Empty Quarter, Saudi Arabia. The study revealed a much more significant and widespread sand cat population in the ecosystem than previously understood. Sand cats were detected across one-third of the core area in all major habitats, comprising escarpment plateau, sand dunes and interdunal gravel valleys. The species showed a marginal preference for the interior parallel dune system with interspersed gravel valleys where they also preferred sand dunes over the gravel valley in the hot season. There was no evidence of strong spatial interactions with other predators. The ecosystem's larger predators (Arabian red fox and honey badger, and all records of wild and feral cats) were primarily associated with the escarpment plateau. The smaller Rueppell's fox was the only other carnivore more consistently present in the main dune system. Sand cats were strictly nocturnal and 14% more active in the hot season than the cool season.

AB  - The coprolites of archeological sites offer information about the paleobiology of organisms and paleoenvironment. Camelids were one of the main resources of hunter-gatherers inhabiting Patagonia and, therefore, the studies of the behavior of camelids from the Holocene are essential to increase the knowledge of human group dynamics. The aim of this study was to identify palaeodiet food items from the camelids in the Pueyrredon Lake area (Santa Cruz, Argentina) after the Hudson volcanic eruption (7800 cal. BP), and to contribute to the knowledge of the vegetation in the camelid home range. Camelid coprolites were collected from four archeological layers, which were dated between 5900 and 6260 cal. BP, in the site Cueva Milodon Norte 1 (47 degrees 00'S-72 degrees 15W), in the area of the Pueyrredon Lake. Today, the vegetation of the area consists of a shrubgrass steppe near a deciduous forest of Nothofagus pumilio. According to a palynological analysis of coprolites. the dominant pollen types were Nothofagus. Asteraceae subf. Asteroideae, Cerastium and Poaceae, with concentrations of 24,000 to 111,000 grains/g. Among the putative diet items, pollen types with zoophilous dispersal were Asteraceae subf. Asteroideae, Cerastium and Acaena, while those with anemophilous dispersal were Poaceae and Nothofagus. The taxa currently growing in the Nothofagus forest include Onagraceae, Lathyrus and pteridophytes, such as Blechnum. The presence of these pollen types and spores suggests the use of the steppe and the forest by camelids in search of food. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Immune cell landscape in a human decedent receiving a pig liver xenograft
T2  - NATURE MEDICINE
LA  - English
AB  - Recent advancements in genetically engineered pigs have spurred research into pig-to-human xenotransplantation, particularly involving heart, kidney and liver. Here we characterize immune cell populations cells in both peripheral blood and transplanted liver in a human decedent who received a pig liver xenograft and who was monitored over the course of 10 days. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial RNA sequencing, we found that T cells were progressively activated in the peripheral blood, whereas gamma delta T cells and exhausted T cells infiltrated the pig liver extensively, indicating impaired adaptive immunity. Additionally, we identified two distinct monocyte clusters that may influence the coagulation and immune response after xenotransplantation. First, at an early phase after transplantation, THBS1+ monocytes had the potential to regulate coagulation through interaction with platelets via the THBS1-CD36 signaling pathway. Second, at a later phase, C1QC+ monocytes infiltrated the pig liver, potentially promoting T cell exhaustion through induction of CD274 (PD-L1) expression. In summary, our study highlights how innate immune cells may affect thrombotic and immune pathways after liver xenotransplantation and should spur further research to clarify the roles of THBS1+ and C1QC+ monocytes.

AB  - This study was designed to assess the distribution of organochlorines (OCs) in fish species, their spatio-temporal variations, bioaccumulation potential, and associated human health risks via dietary intake. The levels of twenty-three organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and thirty-five polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were analyzed in six fish species collected from the riverine ecosystem of Punjab Province, Pakistan. The results indicated that the mean levels of & sigma;(23)OCPs were 74.1 ng/g ww and 184 ng/g ww, and for & sigma;(35)PCBs the levels were 38.8 ng/g ww and 74.8 ng/g ww in herbivorous and carnivorous fish species, respectively. The most abundant contaminants in all fish species were DDTs (65%) and HCHs (14%) among OCPs and heavier PCB congeners (62%) among PCBs. As for dioxin-like PCBs, the WHO toxic equivalency values (ng TEQ/g ww) were in the range of 0.21 (Cyprinus Carpio) to 2.38 (Rita Rita), exceeding the maximum allowable limit of 0.004 ng TEQ/g, ww by the European Commission. Spatio-temporal analysis indicated relatively higher OC levels in winter season with elevated concentrations in fish samples from industrial zone. The bioconcentration factor (L/kg) values ranged from 723 to 2773 for PCBs and 315 to 923 for OCPs in all fish species, with higher levels were reported in carnivorous species. The human health risk assessment at both 50th and 95th percentiles revealed the absence of any significant non-carcinogenic risk as calculated HR was less than 1. However, the critical carcinogenic risk was found to be associated for most of the contaminants, signifying the dietary exposure to OCPs and PCBs might pose the public health concern.

AB  - The swallowtail butterfly Battus polydamas L. (Lepidoptera: Papilionidae) is a specialist on Aristolochia (Aristochiaceae). Larvae sequester secondary compounds, such as aristolochic acids (AAs), from their host plants and transfer them to adults through the pupae. In this study, we evaluated the performance of B. polydamas larvae fed from 1st instar through pupation on two host plants with distinct chemical compositions, Aristolochia ringens Vahl. (which has several diterpenes) and Aristolochia gigantea Mart. (which has acyclic monoterpenoids and sesquiterpenoids, but no diterpenoids or AAs). Differential gene expression in gut and fat body tissues in response to two larval host plants was evaluated in 5th-instar larvae. We found significant differences in the survival of larvae feeding on the two host plants; the survival in A. gigantea is significantly higher than survival in A. ringens. In A. gigantea, 46% of the larvae persisted until pupation, whereas none of the larvae feeding on A. ringens survived until the end of larval development. Upregulated and downregulated contigs comprise genes encoding ribosomal proteins, protein farnesyltransferase, phosphomevalonate kinase, dolichyl-phosphate-mannose-protein mannosyltransferase 4, and O-glucosyltransferase (possibly involved in AA metabolization), as well as genes encoding superoxide dismutase, P450s, UGTs, glutathione S-transferase, and many proteases. As expected, larvae of B. polydamas were strongly influenced by host plants containing different compounds, leading to worse larval performance on key fitness components, such as life cycle performance attributes and larval survival. We suggest that there is a threshold of toxicity in the host plant that larvae can tolerate, and above such a threshold, the impact of plant secondary chemicals is no longer beneficial for the larvae but negative, disrupting their detoxification mechanism.

AB  - Room-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries are still hampered by severe shuttle effects and sluggish kinetics. Most of the sulfur hosts require high cost and complex synthesis process. Herein, a facile method is proposed to prepare a phosphorous doped porous carbon (CSBP) with abundant defect sites from camellia shell by oxidation pretreatment combined with H3PO4 activation. The pretreatment can introduce pores and adjust the structure of biochar precursor, which facilitates the further activation of H3PO4 and effectively avoids the occurrence of large agglomeration. Profiting from the synergistic effects of physical confinement and doping effect, the prepared CSBP/S cathode delivers a high reversible capacity of 804 mAh g-1 after 100 cycles at 0.1 C and still maintains an outstanding capacity of 458 mAh g-1 after 500 cycles at 0.5 C (1 C = 1675 mA g-1). This work provides new insights into the rational design of the microstructures of carbon hosts for high-performance room temperature sodium-sulfur batteries.

AB  - Introduction-The few epidemiologic studies published previously about different forms of mountain running (ie, fell running, sky running, and ultratrail running) have not reported on fatal events. This report aims to contribute to the literature on mountain running fatalities, recording and classifying fatal events related to mountain running competitions found in online literature searches over a 12-y period.
   Methods-From 2008 to 2019, searches on mountain sport, mountain races, and newspaper websites were periodically performed, looking for fatal events related to running competitions in the mountains. Data are presented as mean +/- SD or percentage, as appropriate.
   Results-Fifty-one fatal events, involving 45 men (88%) and 6 women (12%), aged 50 +/- 11 and 46 +/- 6 y, respectively, were recorded in the 2008 to 2019 period in Western Europe. These events occurred during races (n=35; 69%), during training (n=13; 25%), and after races (n=3; 6%); 43% were sudden cardiac death, 32% due to falls (blunt trauma), 16% due to hypothermia, 4% due to both blunt trauma and hypothermia, 4% due to lightning strike injuries, and 2% due to animal attack (injuries from deer).
   Conclusions-Understanding all of the causes of fatal events is necessary to institute preventative efforts and to organize rescues. Preventative efforts should be implemented by race organizers and by athletes themselves, and rescue teams can be trained and equipped to address all of these possible events. The relatively high percentage of sudden cardiac deaths stresses the need for preparticipation cardiovascular screenings. Further longitudinal studies are necessary to better understand the real impact of fatal events on the mountain running population.

AB  - Simple Summary Tenderness influences repurchase decisions of sheep meat because it is a significant factor contributing to eating satisfaction and consumer acceptance. This study analyzed the transcriptome of five high- and five low-lamb tenderness samples. The result showed potential candidate hepatic genes and polymorphisms affecting lamb tenderness. These potential candidate genes and genetic markers could be used in lamb tenderness selection programs. Tenderness is a key meat quality trait that determines the public acceptance of lamb consumption, so genetic improvement toward lamb with higher tenderness is pivotal for a sustainable sheep industry. However, unravelling the genomics controlling the tenderness is the first step. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the transcriptome signatures and polymorphisms related to divergent lamb tenderness using RNA deep sequencing. Since the molecules and enzymes that control muscle growth and tenderness are metabolized and synthesized in the liver, hepatic tissues of ten sheep with divergent phenotypes: five high- and five low-lamb tenderness samples were applied for deep sequencing. Sequence analysis identified the number of reads ranged from 21.37 to 25.37 million bases with a mean value of 22.90 million bases. In total, 328 genes are detected as differentially expressed (DEGs) including 110 and 218 genes that were up- and down-regulated, respectively. Pathway analysis showed steroid hormone biosynthesis as the dominant pathway behind the lamb tenderness. Gene expression analysis identified the top high (such as TP53INP1, CYP2E1, HSD17B13, ADH1C, and LPIN1) and low (such as ANGPTL2, IGFBP7, FABP5, OLFML3, and THOC5) expressed candidate genes. Polymorphism and association analysis revealed that mutation in OLFML3, ANGPTL2, and THOC5 genes could be potential candidate markers for tenderness in sheep. The genes and pathways identified in this study cause variation in tenderness, thus could be potential genetic markers to improve meat quality in sheep. However, further validation is needed to confirm the effect of these markers in different sheep populations so that these could be used in a selection program for lamb with high tenderness.

AB  - Bovine Respiratory Disease (BRD) poses a significant threat to cattle welfare worldwide, affecting their respiratory system and causing substantial economic losses. BRD is multifactorial in nature. This research aimed to investigate the serological profile of calves for the five main bovine respiratory pathogens. Serum samples were collected from dairy calves aged 7-12 months that had never been vaccinated against tested pathogens and had recently shown signs of BRD. A total of 4095 calves from 650 dairy herds located in south-western Poland were examined. The Commercial Indirect Respiratory ELISA Kit Multiplexed-Double well-BIO K 284/5 (Bio-X Diagnostics, Rochefort, Belgium) was used to determine the presence of antibodies against BVDV, BoAHV1, BRSV, BPIV3, and M. bovis. The presence of antibodies against at least one of the tested pathogens was found in 306 (47.08%) herds. The overall prevalence of antibodies was as follows: BoAHV1 21.54%, BVDV 32.0%, BRSV 34.15%, BPIV3 34.31%, and M. bovis 31.38%. The strongest correlation was between BRSV antibodies positive sera and BPIV3 antibodies positive sera. Among the five pathogens tested, antibodies to BVDV, BRSV, BPIV3, and M. bovis were most commonly detected simultaneously. The results of this study indicate the need for preventive measures against these pathogens in the studied region.

AB  - Understanding the past and future evolution of the Antarctic Ice Sheet is challenged by the availability and quality of observed paleo-boundary conditions. Numerical icesheet models often rely on these paleo-boundary conditions to guide and evaluate their models' predictions of sea-level rise, with varying levels of confidence due to the sparsity of existing data across the ice sheet. A key data source for largescale reconstruction of past ice-sheet processes are internal reflecting horizons (IRHs) detected by radio-echo sounding (RES). When IRHs are isochronal and dated at ice cores, they can be used to determine paleo-accumulation rates and patterns on large spatial scales. Using a spatially extensive IRH over the Pine Island Glacier (PIG), Thwaites Glacier (THW), and the Institute and Moller ice streams (IMIS, covering a total of 610 000 km(2) or 30% of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS)), and a local layer approximation model, we infer mid-Holocene accumulation rates over the slow-flowing parts of these catchments for the past similar to 4700 years. By comparing our results with modern climate reanalysis models (1979-2019) and observational syntheses (1651-2010), we estimate that accumulation rates over the AmundsenWeddell-Ross Divide were on average 18% higher during the mid-Holocene than modern rates. However, no significant spatial changes in the accumulation pattern were observed. The higher mid-Holocene accumulation-rate estimates match previous paleo-accumulation estimates from ice-core records and targeted RES surveys over the ice divide, and they also coincide with periods of grounding-line readvance during the Holocene over theWeddell and Ross sea sectors. We find that our spatially extensive, mid-Holocene-to-present accumulation estimates are consistent with a sustained late-Holocene period of higher accumulation rates occurring over millennia reconstructed from the WAIS Divide ice core (WD14), thus indicating that this ice core is spatially representative of the wider West Antarctic region. We conclude that future regional and continental ice-sheet modelling studies should base their climatic forcings on time-varying accumulation rates from the WAIS Divide ice core through the Holocene to generate more realistic predictions of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's past contribution to sea-level rise.

AB  - Alpha-helical membrane proteins perform numerous critical functions essential for the survival of living organisms. Traditionally, these proteins are extracted from membranes using detergent solubilization and reconstitution into liposomes or nanodiscs. However, these processes often obscure the effects of nanoconfinement and the native environment on the structure and conformational heterogeneity of the target protein. We demonstrate that pulsed dipolar electron spin resonance spectroscopy, combined with the Gd3+-nitroxide spin pair, enables the selective observation of the vitamin B12 importer BtuCD-F in its native cellular envelope. Despite the high levels of non-specific labeling in the envelope, this orthogonal approach combined with the long phase-memory time for the Gd3+ spin enables the observation of the target protein complex at a few micromolar concentrations with high resolution. In the native envelope, vitamin B12 induces a distinct conformational shift at the BtuCD-BtuF interface, which is not observed in the micelles. This approach offers a general strategy for investigating protein-protein and protein-ligand/drug interactions and conformational changes of the alpha-helical membrane proteins in their native envelope context.

AB  - Plants assemble beneficial rhizosphere microbiomes through a 'cry for help' mechanism upon pathogen or insect herbivore attack. The arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can influence the composition of microbial communities in the plant rhizosphere. However, their impacts on the rhizosphere microbiome in response to co-attacks of pathogens and insect herbivores remain unknown. In this study, a mesocosm of alfalfa, Rhizophagus intraradices, Phoma medicaginis and Acyrthosiphon pisum was used to elucidate how AMF alter the plant rhizosphere microbiome and its responses to multiple biotic stresses. The AMF significantly increased the activity of soil acid phosphatase, urease and beta-glucosidase, causing an enhanced absorption of soil phosphorus by plants. The soil enzymes were also significantly and positively correlated with plant shoot properties, including polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase, salicylic acid (SA) and trypsin inhibitor (TI). Although all the AMF, P. medicaginis and aphids altered the rhizosphere microbiome of alfalfa, the AMF recruited beneficial microorganisms in the alfalfa rhizosphere in response to pathogens and aphid attacks. The multi-interaction also increased the complexity and stability of the rhizosphere microbial network. Additionally, there is a significant correlation between soil enzyme activity, nitrate nitrogen, TI, SA, biomass, disease severity and the rhizosphere microbiome. Therefore, the AMF improves plant defence and soil biochemistry profiles and assists alfalfa in assembling beneficial rhizosphere microbiomes in response to P. medicaginis and aphid attacks. These findings are vital for understanding the interactions between transboundary species in above- and below-ground systems altered by AMF in natural ecosystems.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

AB  - Amblyseius orientalis Ehara (Acari: Phytoseiidae) is one local predatory mite in China that has high potential for controlling Polyphagotarsonemus latus, a globally important pest to many vegetables and crops. To further evaluate the control potential of A. orientalis on different host plants against P. latus, we selected bean, cucumber, and pepper as host plants to feed P. latus, and then to feed A. orientalis. It was found when the prey P. latus fed on cucumber leaves, development of A. orientalis was the slowest, with the lowest egg production and overall poor biological performance. When A. orientalis was fed with prey hosted on cucumber and the other two plants, there were 119 differentially expressed organic compounds. The differentially metabolites were significantly enriched in the pentose phosphate pathway and carbon metabolism pathway. Further transcriptomic analysis ofA. orientalis revealed 36 differentially expressed genes. Among these genes, 20 were annotated in 17 pathways in KEGG, with significant enrichment in hippo signaling pathway-fly and polysaccharide degradation pathways detected. These results indicate that the development and reproduction of A. orientalis are significantly poorer when feeding on P. latus, leading to a marked decline in amino acids, sugars, lipids, and organic compounds in A. orientalis. Additionally, there are 36 genes with consistently different expression patterns in A. orientalis when comparing cucumbers to the other two host plants. This study is an initial attempt to unravel the biological mechanisms of how nutritional substances might affect biology of natural enemies through the food chain.

AB  - Platelet rich plasma (PRP) is extensively used in regenerative medicine. Present work was aimed to investigate the effect of autologous PRP supplementation in semen freezing extender on sperm quality, antioxidant capacity, lipid peroxidation and in vitro fertilizing capacity of frozen-thawed buffalo semen and subsequent embryo developmental competence. Buffalo bulls, n = 8, were used as semen donors. Semen ejaculates were separately divided into four equal parts and extended with autologous PRP 0 (control), 2, 5 and 10% supplemented Tris-based semen extender. Extended semen samples were then cooled to 5 C-o for 2h and processed for cryofreezing in French straws. Post-thawed semen samples (37 C-o for 30 s) were evaluated for progressive motility (PM), structural membrane integrity (SMI), functional membrane integrity (FMI), total abnormalities (TA), and acrosome integrity (AI). Supernatant from the thawed samples was examined colormetrically for superoxide dismutase activity (SOD), total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and lipid peroxidation profile (MDA). Fertilizing capacity of post-thaw spermatozoa cryofrozen in 5% PRP extender was tested upon fertilization the buffalo oocytes in vitro. Higher (P < 0.05) post-thaw sperm quality (PM, SMI, FMI, AI) in 5% PRP semen extender, whereas TA was lower in control, 2% and 10% concentrations. Five percent PRP supplemented semen extender resulted in greater (P < 0.05) TAC and SOD, and lesser MDA levels compared to other groups. Inseminated buffalo oocytes with sperm cryofrozen in 5% PRP revealed higher fertilization, cleavage and blastocyst rate and lower polyspermy as compared to control. In conclusion, buffalo spermatozoa cryofrozen in autologous PRP supplemented semen extender enhanced cryotolerance and fertilizing potential.

AB  - Transplantation is a clinical procedure that treats a variety of diseases yet is unattainable for many patients due to a nationwide organ shortage and the harsh side effects of chronic immune suppression. Xenografted pig organs are an attractive alternative to traditional allografts and would provide an endless supply of transplantable tissue, but transplants risk rejection by the recipient's immune system. An essential component of the rejection immune response is the complement system. Sertoli cells, an immunoregulatory testicular cell, survive complement as xenografts long term without any immune suppressants. We hypothesized that exposure to the xenogeneic complement influences Sertoli cell gene expression of other accommodation factors that contribute to their survival; thus, the purpose of this study was to describe these potential changes in gene expression. RNA sequencing of baseline neonatal pig Sertoli cells (NPSC) as compared to NPSC after exposure to normal human serum (NHS, containing complement) revealed 62 significantly differentially expressed genes (DEG) that affect over 30 pathways involved in immune regulation, cell survival, and transplant accommodation. Twelve genes of interest were selected for further study, and Sertoli cell protein expression of CCL2 and the accommodation factor A20 were confirmed for the first time. Functional pathway analyses were conducted in NPSC and three biological clusters were revealed as being considerably affected by NHS exposure: innate immune signaling, cytokine signaling, and T cell regulation. Better understanding of the interaction of Sertoli cells with complement in a xenograft environment may reveal the mechanisms behind immune-privileged systems to increase graft viability.

AB  - Increased generalization between fear-inducing stimuli (e.g., looking over the edge of a tall building) and perceptually-similar neutral stimuli (e.g., an aerial photograph) is observed in all subtypes of anxiety disorders, leading to avoidance behaviors that feed forward from the feared stimulus to other, seemingly unrelated stimuli. However, recent research suggests a much more nuanced relationship between generalization, discrimination, and behavior. This study seeks to extend current understanding by using a mnemonic discrimination task to explore the relationship between risk for anxiety and differences in mnemonic discrimination abilities. Participants self-reported trait anxiety and behavioral inhibition (a temperamental construct linked to risk for anxiety), and also completed a memory task. After incidental encoding of color photographs of neutral everyday objects, participants performed a surprise recognition task, where they categorized each test image as "old" (identical to a previously viewed image), "similar" (new but perceptually-similar to a studied image, with half the images being highly similar and the other half being less similar to the studied images), or "new" (new and perceptually-dissimilar to studied images). We found that those with high behavioral inhibition are more successful at discriminating between previously seen "old" items from highly similar items. In contrast, those with high trait anxiousness are less successful at the same kind of discrimination. Interestingly, these relationships were not apparent in low similarity items. Our data suggest that behavioral inhibition and trait anxiety may be associated with unique aspects of individual differences in mnemonic discrimination abilities.

AB  - The Booroola fecundity (FecB) mutation in the bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 1B (BMPR1B) gene increases ovulation in sheep. However, its effect on follicular maturation is not fully understood. Therefore, we collected granulosa cells (GCs) at a critical stage of follicle maturation from nine wild-type (WW), nine heterozygous FecB mutant (WB), and nine homozygous FecB mutant (BB) Small Tail Han sheep. The GCs of three ewes were selected at random from each genotype and consolidated into a single group, yielding a total of nine groups (three groups per genotype) for proteomic analysis. The tandem mass tag technique was utilized to ascertain the specific proteins linked to multiple ovulation in the various FecB genotypes. Using a general linear model, we identified 199 proteins significantly affected by the FecB mutation with the LIMMA package (p < 0.05). The differential abundance of proteins was enriched in pathways related to cholesterol metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid biosynthesis, and glutathione metabolism. These pathways are involved in important processes for GC-regulated 'conservation' of oocyte maturation. Further, the sparse partial least-squares discriminant analysis and the Fuzzy-C-mean clustering method were combined to estimate weights and cluster differential abundance proteins according to ovulation to screen important ovulation-related proteins. Among them, ZP2 and ZP3 were found to be enriched in the cellular component catalog term "egg coat", as well as some apolipoproteins, such as APOA1, APOA2, and APOA4, enriched in several Gene Ontology terms related to cholesterol metabolism and lipoprotein transport. A higher abundance of these essential proteins for oocyte maturation was observed in BB and WB genotypes compared with WW ewes. These proteins had a high weight in the model for discriminating sheep with different FecB genotypes. These findings provide new insight that the FecB mutant in GCs improves nutrient metabolism, leading to better oocyte maturation by altering the abundance of important proteins (ZP2, ZP3, and APOA1) in favor of increased ovulation or better oocyte quality.

AB  - The World Health Organization included Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii in its priority fungal pathogen list due to their high mortality rates and frequent treatment failures. These facts have driven research toward the discovery of new compounds for the treatment of cryptococcosis. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of two complexes, [Cu(phendione)3](ClO4)2<middle dot>4H2O (Cu-phendione) and [Ag(phendione)2]ClO4 (Ag-phendione), against drug-resistant clinical isolates of C. gattii and C. neoformans. Both complexes demonstrated anti-Cryptococcus activity, with Cu-phendione exhibiting minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 6.25 mu M for C. gattii and 3.125 mu M for C. neoformans, while Ag-phendione showed an MIC of 1.56 mu M for both Cryptococcus species. Notably, both Cu-phendione and Ag-phendione complexes exhibited enhanced antifungal activity against reference strains of C. neoformans and C. gattii. In silico analysis identified both complexes as highly promising, exhibiting good oral bioavailability, high gastrointestinal absorption, and moderate skin permeability. Moreover, neither complex demonstrated toxicity toward sheep erythrocytes at concentrations up to 62.5 mu M, with a selectivity index (SI) exceeding 10 for Cu-phendione and 40 for Ag-phendione. In vivo testing using the Galleria mellonella model demonstrated that both complexes were non-toxic, with 100% larval survival at concentrations up to 1000 mu M and SI exceeding 160 following a single administration. Interestingly, larvae exposed to Cu-phendione at concentrations of 15.6-31.25 mu M exhibited a significant increase in the density of hemocytes, the immune cells responsible for defense in invertebrates. Furthermore, multiple treatments with 62.5 mu M of complexes caused either no larval mortality, hemocyte alterations, or changes in silk production or coloration, indicating a lack of toxicity. These findings suggest that Cu-phendione and Ag-phendione may serve as promising antifungal alternatives against Cryptococcus, with minimal host toxicity.

AB  - Demand for ruminant products (dairy products, beef, and sheep meat) is increasing rapidly with population and income growth and the acceleration of urbanization. However, ruminant animals exert the highest environmental impacts and consume the most resources in the livestock system. Increasing studies have focused on various measures to reduce ammonia, greenhouse gas emissions, and resource depletion from ruminant production to consumption. This review offers supply- and demand-side management strategies to reduce the environmental impact of ruminant products and emphasizes the mitigation potential of coupling livestock production with cultivation and renewable energy. On a global scale, more attention should be paid to the green-source trade and to strengthening global technology sharing. The success of these strategies depends on the cost effectiveness of technology, public policy, and financial support. Future studies and practice should focus on global database development for sharing mitigation strategies, thus facilitating technology innovations and socioeconomic feasibility.

AB  - In this research, it was aimed to investigate (i) the recultivation efficiency, (ii) to assess the plantation state via a complex estimated indicator, and (iii) to evaluate the environmental quality in disturbed lands in a zone under influence of copper smelting production. The research was carried out on Golden Mountain, located in the influenced zone of the Karabashed Joint Stock Company. In three plantations as reclamation sites established by sowing and planting, silver birch (Betula pendula Roth), aspen (Populus tremula L.), balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera L.), goat willow (Salix caprea L.) as broadleaves, and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Siberian spruce (Picea obovata Ledeb.) as conifers were selected. Moreover, environmental quality was rated based on the condition scores by collecting leaf samples in four different sites of silver birch forests. As a result, the fluctuating activity method of the silver birch leaf blade seems to be effectively used to assess the environmental quality. At a considerable distance of 8.0 and 13.0 km from the pollution source, the environmental quality has an average [condition score: III with .046 integral asymmetry index] and initial level (condition score: II with .041 integral asymmetry index) of deviation from the norm, respectively. In addition, silver birch can be recommended as the main species in forestry on disturbed lands in the South Ural forest steppe region.

AB  - Under heterogeneous resource supply, alien invasive plants with clonal growth can benefit more from clonal integration than their native ones. However, different benefit from clonal integration of non-resource substance (such as stress signal or hormone) between alien invasive plants with clonal growth and their congeneric native ones was poorly understood. A pot experiment was conducted to explore clonal integration of stress signal induced by local exogenous ABA application within clonal networks of alien invasive plant Wedelia trilobata and its congeneric native one W. chinensis subjected to drought stress (20% soil moisture). Chlorophyll fluorescence parameter (Fv/Fm, Phi PSII and qP) and photosynthetic parameter (Pn and Gs) of young ramets in W. trilobata significantly increased 2 or 3 days after exogenous ABA application to old ramets. Fv/Fm of young ramets in W. chinensis significantly increased 3 days after exogenous ABA application. Meanwhile, Pn and Gs significantly increased 17 days after exogenous ABA application. After exogenous ABA application to young ramets of W. trilobata 3 days, Fv/Fm and Pn of its old ramets significantly increased. In addition, significant increase of Phi PSII, Pn and Gs in old ramets of W. chinensis was delayed to 17 days after exogenous ABA application. At the end of experiment, exogenous ABA application significantly promoted biomass accumulation of clonal fragments in alien invasive plant W. trilobata. Similar pattern was not observed in its congeneric native one. It is suggested that clonal integration of stress signal may improve growth performance more in alien invasive plant with clonal growth than its congeneric native one, which further promoting its invasiveness.

AB  - Lysophospholipids (LPL) are monoacyl derivatives of phospholipids in which one of the fatty acids has been removed by enzymatic hydrolysis and can influence lipid digestion. In this study, the effect of feeding lysophospholipids in the diet to pigs from 7-30 kg was investigated with respect to growth performance and the intestinal morphology. A total of 800 pigs were divided into two groups fed either basal diet (CON) or basal diet + 0.05% LPL (LPL), respectively, and the growth performance was measured for 42 days. At the end of the experiment, 32 pigs were euthanized to evaluate the tissue of the small intestine in the pigs. Overall, there was no statistical difference between day 1 and day 42 relating to overall gain or growth performances. However, due to the variations between the two groups starting phases, the results indicate that lysophospholipids had a positive effect on recovering from a poorer starting point. This was further reinforced by intestinal morphology analysis, which also showed no statistical difference, despite the early lag in growth performance of the LPL group. Inclusion of lysophospholipids (LPL) has been proposed to increase growth performance in broilers and pigs, acting as emulsifiers through mixed micelle formation. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of feeding LPL in weanling pig diets on growth performance and intestinal morphology. Eight hundred pigs (weight 6.96 kg +/- SD 1.58 kg) were assigned to one of two dietary treatments, i.e., a basal diet (CON) or a basal diet + 0.05% lysophospholipids (LPL). The experimental period lasted for 42 days, and on days 40 and 41, 32 pigs in total were euthanized for intestinal tissue samples. From days 14 to 21, feed intake and average daily gain increased, as well as FCR, from days 28 to 42, in the LPL group compared with the CON group. In the overall period, no differences in growth performance were present between the groups. However, females displayed increased ADG from days 21 to 28 compared with castrates. The villous height tended (p = 0.051) to be lower in LPL in the proximal jejunum compared with CON. In the proximal jejunum, villus was higher (p > 0.01) in females, and in the distal jejunum, higher crypt cell proliferation (p < 0.01) and a tendency to deeper crypts (p = 0.064) were observed in female pigs as well. In conclusion, lysophospholipids did not increase growth performance in this study; however, the rate of recovery from a poorer starting point was noted, as growth rates recovered and increased faster in the LPL group. In conclusion, unlike the first phase, the LPL group recovered the growth from days 14 to 21 through higher feed intake and weight gain than the CON group. Eventually, the LPL group displayed improved FCR compared with the CON group from days 28 to 42. Further studies are needed to investigate whether this effect continues into the grower-finisher phase.

AB  - Diarrhea of piglets is an important disease affecting the development of pig industry, while F4 enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is an important pathogen causing diarrhea of newborn or weaned piglets, which seriously harms animal husbandry and causes huge economic losses. The pathogenicity of E. coli is closely related to its virulence factors, which are strictly regulated in vivo, and the quorum sensing system is involved in this process. To study the effect of quorum sensing signal molecule acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) on the biological characteristics of Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), gene lasI of Pseudomonas aeruginosa which is responsible for the synthesis of long side-chain AHL (3OC12-HSL), and gene yenI of Yersinia enterocolitica which is responsible for the synthesis of short side-chain AHL (C6-HSL), were selected and transformed into ETEC strain C83902, respectively, and endowed with the ability of endogenous synthesis of 3OC12-HSL and C6-HSL. At the same time, 200 mu mol/L 3OC12-HSL and C6-HSL were added into the culture medium, respectively, and co-cultured with ETEC strain C83902. ETEC strains were stimulated by exogenous and endogenous long-chain and short-chain AHL molecules, respectively, and their biological characteristics, such as growth characteristics, biofilm formation ability, and adhesion ability to piglets intestinal epithelial cells IPEC-J2 were observed under the influence of the AHLs described above. Real-time PCR was used to detect the transcription levels of genes encoding major subunits of pathogenic factors such as fimbriae, flagella, enterotoxin, adhesin and hemolysin under the influence of the AHLs. The results showed that under the influence of quorum sensing AHLs, the biofilm formation ability and adherence ability of ETEC were significantly reduced, and the expression of fliC and other major virulence factors were regulated. AHL signaling molecules can regulate virulence related characteristics of F4ac+ ETEC.

AB  - Tick-borne diseases constitute the predominant vector-borne health threat in North America. Recent observations have noted a significant expansion in the range of the black-legged tick (Ixodes scapularis Say, Acari: Ixodidae), alongside a rise in the incidence of diseases caused by its transmitted pathogens: Borrelia burgdorferi Johnson (Spirochaetales: Spirochaetaceae), Babesia microti Starcovici (Piroplasmida: Babesiidae), and Anaplasma phagocytophilium Zhu (Rickettsiales: Anaplasmataceae), the causative agents of Lyme disease, babesiosis, and anaplasmosis, respectively. Prior research identified environmental features that influence the ecological dynamics of I. scapularis and B. burgdorferi that can be used to predict the distribution and abundance of these organisms, and thus Lyme disease risk. In contrast, there is a paucity of research into the environmental determinants of B. microti and A. phagocytophilium. Here, we use over a decade of surveillance data to model the impact of environmental features on the infection prevalence of these increasingly common human pathogens in ticks across New York State (NYS). Our findings reveal a consistent northward and westward expansion of B. microti in NYS from 2009 to 2019, while the range of A. phagocytophilum varied at fine spatial scales. We constructed biogeographic models using data from over 650 site-year visits and encompassing more than 250 environmental variables to accurately forecast infection prevalence for each pathogen to a future year that was not included in model training. Several environmental features were identified to have divergent effects on the pathogens, revealing potential ecological differences governing their distribution and abundance. These validated biogeographic models have applicability for disease prevention efforts.

AB  - The development of next-generation sodium-cooled fast reactors necessitates comprehensive research on metallic fuels to maximize economic performance while ensuring safe operation. In this study, we investigated the steadystate irradiation behavior of two high burnup U-19Pu-10Zr fuel pins, DP-36 and DP-40, in preparation for planned safety testing. Post-irradiation examination (PIE) was performed to quantify fuel column elongation, regions of low-density at the top of the fuel column, pin deformation, fission product distribution, fractional fission gas release, microstructural evolution, and fuel constituent redistribution. Benchmarking against existing PIE data from U-19Pu-10Zr fuel pins irradiated in EBR-II revealed consistent patterns in fuel column elongation and cladding diametral strain. However, both pins exhibited longer low-density structures, and destructive examination of DP-36 revealed more complex constituent redistribution patterns compared to previously reported data for ternary fuel pins. The steady-state irradiation of both pins was also modeled using BISON. Comparisons of PIE results with modeled predictions showed overall agreement in fractional fission gas release but consistent overestimation of axial and radial swelling due to gaseous and solid swelling models. These findings underscore the critical importance of pre-test characterization on test and sibling pins to accurately capture steady-state fuel behavior ahead of transient testing, thus establishing a baseline for post-test comparison. Additionally, these analyses identified key data gaps that warrant further investigation to improve the understanding and prediction of fuel swelling, thereby enhancing the synergy between modeling and experimental efforts in supporting accident testing.

AB  - Aerobic energy demands have led to the evolution of complex mitochondrial reticula in highly oxidative muscles, but the extent to which metabolic challenges can be met with adaptive changes in physiology of specific mitochondrial fractions remains unresolved. We examined mitochondrial mechanisms supporting adaptive increases in aerobic performance in deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) adapted to the hypoxic environment at high altitude. High-altitude and low-altitude mice were born and raised in captivity, and exposed as adults to normoxia or hypobaric hypoxia (12 kPa O-2 for 6-8 weeks). Subsarcolemmal and intermyofibrillar mitochondria were isolated from the gastrocnemius, and a comprehensive substrate titration protocol was used to examine mitochondrial physiology and O-2 kinetics by high-resolution respirometry and fluorometry. High-altitude mice had greater yield, respiratory capacity for oxidative phosphorylation, and O-2 affinity (lower P-50) of subsarcolemmal mitochondria compared to low-altitude mice across environments, but there were no species difference in these traits in intermyofibrillar mitochondria. High-altitude mice also had greater capacities of complex II relative to complexes I + II and higher succinate dehydrogenase activities in both mitochondrial fractions. Exposure to chronic hypoxia reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) emission in high-altitude mice but not in low-altitude mice. Our findings suggest that functional changes in subsarcolemmal mitochondria contribute to improving aerobic performance in hypoxia in high-altitude deer mice. Therefore, physiological variation in specific mitochondrial fractions can help overcome the metabolic challenges of life at high altitude.

AB  - In a nature reserve in southern Maine, we removed invasive Japanese barberry (Berberis thunbergii de Candolle) along sections of forested recreational trails that ran through dense barberry infestations. Barberry thickets provide questing substrate and a protective microclimate for blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis Say), and trail users could brush up against encroaching barberry and acquire ticks. Trailside barberry removal will reduce or eliminate encroaching tick questing substrate and could reduce trailside questing tick abundance by creating a microclimate more hostile to ticks. The same-day cut-and-spray treatment comprised mechanical cutting of barberry clumps (individual plants with numerous ramets) followed immediately by targeted herbicide application to the resulting root crowns. The treatment created trail shoulders to a lateral width of 1-2 m on both sides of 100-m trail sections, with initial treatment in the fall of 2013 and one retreatment in the summer of 2014. Our aim was to remove 90% of barberry clumps to achieve a 50% or better reduction in questing tick abundance on trail shoulders. However, by the fall of 2015, there were only 41% fewer barberry clumps on treated vs. untreated trail sections and there was no reduction in either adults or nymphs. We concluded that our barberry treatment protocol was not sufficiently aggressive since the resulting ecotone habitat on trail shoulders proved suitable for questing I. scapularis. In principle, cutting back barberry along trails should reduce trail user contact with questing deer ticks, but we were unable to demonstrate a reduction in trailside tick abundance.

AB  - Birth weight is a complex multifactorial trait relevant to health states and disease risks in later life. The placenta is essential for proper fetal growth and facilitates gas, nutrient, and waste exchange between the mother and developing fetus. How changes in placental DNA methylation affect fetal birth weight remains to be fully elucidated. In this study, we used whole-genome bisulfite sequencing and RNA sequencing to reveal a global map of DNA methylation and gene expression changes between the placentas of highest birth weight and lowest birth weight piglets in the same litters. The transcriptome analysis identified 1682 differential expressed genes and revealed key transcriptional properties in distinct placentas. We also identified key transcription factors that may drive the differences in DNA methylome patterns between placentas. The decrease in DNA methylation level in the promoter was associated with the transcriptional activation of genes associated with angiogenesis, extracellular matrix remodeling, and transmembrane transport. Our results revealed the regulatory role of DNA methylation in gene transcription activity leading to the differences in placental morphological structures and birth weights of piglets. These results could provide novel clues to clarify the underlying regulatory mechanisms of placental development and fetal growth.

AB  - Intensive sampling of earthworms in French Guiana has been carried out for several years. The first published results have highlighted a very high regional diversity, a considerable geographical turnover in the composition of communities, as well as a very high proportion of species new to science. However, the work of describing these new species had not been undertaken until now. In this work, we present the results of the sampling carried out in March 2015 during the "Our Planet Reviewed" terrestrial expedition in the Mitaraka Range. We used an integrative taxonomy approach combining the use of DNA barcodes and morpho-anatomical characters, which allowed the identification of 31 species, nine of which were represented in our samples only by juveniles, and four of which corresponded to already known species (Nouraguesia parare Csuzdi & Pavlicek, 2011, Pontoscolex corethrurus (Muller, 1856), Dichogaster andina Cognetti de Martiis, 1904 and Dichogaster bolaui (Michaelsen,1891)). The remaining 18 species were new to science and are described in this work.

AB  - Neddylation is a biological process that covalently links neuronal precursor cell-expressed developmentally downregulated protein 8 (NEDD8) to its substrate. Its main function is to activate the cullin ubiquitin junction complex, thereby promoting substrate protein degradation. The research of neddylation mainly focus on cell senescence, Alzheimer's disease progression, and tumor treatment. However, the neddylation mechanism underlying follicular granulosa cells (GCs) proliferation and steroidogenesis remains unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to reveal the functions of neddylation in sheep follicular GCs. Here, immunohistochemistry results revealed that NEDD8 was expressed in sheep follicular GCs. The neddylation-specific inhibitor MLN4924 and NEDD8 small interfering (si) RNA (si-NEDD8) were used to inhibit neddylation, significantly attenuating sheep follicular GC proliferation. The RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) showed that cytochrome P450 11A1 (CYP11A1) and steroidogenic acute regulator (StAR) were significantly downregulated via the inhibition of neddylation. Additionally, qRT-PCR results showed that CYP11A1, StAR and 3(1-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3(1-HSD) mRNA abundance decreased significantly following the addition of various MLN4924 doses and si-NEDD8, however, CYP19A1 mRNA levels did not significantly differ. Western blotting results showed that inhibition of neddylation also significantly decreased the expression of CYP11A1, 3 beta-HSD, cytochrome P450 19A1 (CYP19A1), StAR, and androgen receptor (AR). The current study revealed that the inhibition of neddylation affects sheep follicular GC function by inhibiting proliferation and the enzymes involved in synthesis in sheep.

AB  - Invasive species managers utilise species records to inform management. These data can also be used in Species Distribution Models (SDM) to predict future spread or potential invasion of new areas. However, issues with nonequilibrium (also called disequilibrium) can cause difficulties in modelling invasive species that have not fully colonised their potential distribution and, in addition, sampling bias can result from a lack of information on survey effort, a particular issue for presence only modelling techniques. Geographical confounds are unavoidable when building iSDMs but there are methods that allow prediction to be optimised. We used maximum entropy (Maxent) to model suitable habitat for invasive Reeve's muntjac deer (Muntiacus reevesi) throughout Great Britain and Ireland comparing several methods that aimed to address invasive Species Distribution Modelling (iSDM) bias including spatial filtering, weighted background points and targeted background points built at varying spatial extents. Model evaluation metrics suggested that the model, which explicitly failed to account for nonequilibrium at the full extent of Great Britain and Ireland using random background points, predicted the species' current invasive range best. This highlighted that negative environmental relationships are likely to represent uncolonised areas rather than habitat selection and thus, low predicted suitability of uncolonised areas was misleading. Of the models that dealt with non-equilibrium conceptually best, by restricting the training extent to their current invasive range or core range, and utilised targeted background points accounting for survey effort (cells with other deer species recorded as present yet with no records for muntjac) as the best model evaluation metric, yielded relatively poor predictive performance. This implied limited habitat selectivity or avoidance within the colonised range which, when spatially extrapolated, suggested virtually all regions in Great Britain and Ireland may be vulnerable to future muntjac invasion.

AB  - Selective pressures have favored conspicuous coloration across a wide variety of taxa. A particularly striking example of conspicuous coloration is the brilliant red chest patch of male geladas (Theropithecus gelada), a species of cercopithecine monkey found in the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia. Previous research found that gelada chest patch redness increases with age (adult vs subadult), social status ("leader" vs non-leader), and mating opportunities (number of adult females), but the mechanism mediating changes in redness has not yet been examined. First, we validated and compared multiple color measurement methods (Adobe Photoshop, micaToolbox designed for use with ImageJ, and a subjective measure using the human eye). Second, we demonstrated that chest patch redness is positively associated with high-intensity physical activity, the application of a heat pack directly to the chest skin, and higher chest skin surface temperatures. Together, these results suggest that increases in chest redness are mediated by increased blood flow to this area with a concomitant increase in surface temperature. Further research is needed to understand both the energetic costs associated with redness and how other males respond to variation in the signal.

AB  - The industrial farming and slaughtering of animals may be considered one of the most pressing ethical problems of our time, yet consumers remain empathically disconnected from food animals and continue to eat meat. Therefore, animal advocacy groups have started using virtual reality (VR) outreach to promote consumers' concern for food animals and persuade them to eat less meat. In this study, we examined whether a short 360 degrees documentary depicting the life cycle of factory farmed pigs (from their lives on the farm to their death in the slaughterhouse) experienced in a VR format versus in a regular video format increases participants' intentions to eat less meat via an increased feeling of presence and empathic concern. Using a single factor experimental design, we randomly allocated participants (n = 84 after data-cleaning) to answer a questionnaire following one of both conditions (VR versus video documentary, each n = 42). Results confirmed our hypothesized serial mediation model; VR (versus video) had a positive influence on presence and additionally on empathic concern, leading to higher intentions of reduced meat consumption among participants. Yet, VR (versus video) also had a direct, negative effect on empathy when controlling for presence, so no total effect of medium format on intentions to reduce meat could be found. This counter-effect of VR on empathic concern could be explained by an increased level of speciesism among participants exposed to the VR (versus video) documentary, a finding that is consistent with prior literature on speciesism, cognitive dissonance and dissociation, and requires further confirmatory investigation. Limitations and implications for theory and practice of the study are considered.

AB  - Background/Objectives: Milk is one of the main sources of nutrition in people's daily diet, but the fat in milk raises health concerns in consumers. Here, we aimed to elucidate the impact of Buffalo milk and Holstein cow milk consumption on blood lipid health through metabolomics analysis. Methods: Golden hamsters were administered Murrah Buffalo milk (BM) or Holstein cow milk (HM), and the body weight and serum lipid indicators were tested and recorded. The hamsters receiving equal amounts of physiological saline were used as the negative control (NC). Serum and fecal samples were collected, and LC-MS was used to identify the metabolites in the samples. Results: The results showed that both the BM and HM groups exhibited a significant reduction in body weight compared to that of the NC group from day 9, and the serum TG, TC, and LDL-C levels were significantly lower than those of the NC group. Further analysis identified 564 and 567 metabolites in the serum and fecal samples shared in the BM and HM groups and significantly different from those in the NC group, which were mainly enriched in the pathways related to lipid metabolism, such as fatty acid biosynthesis, arachidonic acid metabolism, and primary bile acid biosynthesis. Correlation analysis further suggested that milk intake can increase the levels of Muramic Acid, Oleoyl Ethanolamide, Seratrodast, Chenodeoxycholic Acid, Docosahexaenoic Acid Ethyl Ester, and Deoxycholic Acid in the serum and gut microbiota, which may affect TG, TC, HDL-C, and LDL-C in the serum, and thereby benefit the body's lipid health. Conclusions: The results further confirmed that milk intake has a beneficial effect on blood lipid health by altering multiple metabolites in the serum and the gut. This study provides novel evidence that milk consumption is beneficial to health and is a reference for guiding people to a healthy diet.

AB  - The use of recombinant bovine somatotropin (rbST) leads to an increase in variable amounts of milk production in buffalo, but there is a lack of information on the influence of rbST on their metabolism. This study looked at the effects of a single 500 mg dose of rbST on the lipid profile, liver and kidney function, and physical, chemical, and cellular constitution of milk in 14 buffalo over 14 days, from the 100th day of lactation, compared with 14 animals in a control group. From the first day after rbST, there was a rise in beta-hydroxybutyrate (ss-HBO), possibly due to higher dry matter intake or the biotransformation of NEFA into ss-HBO. The treatment did not influence blood glucose, non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs), triglycerides, cholesterol, total protein, albumin, AST, GGT, bilirubin, urea, or creatinine levels. In 71.3% of the buffalo, there was a gradual increase in milk production, with the maximal response occurring in the first week followed by a gradual decrease, whilst in 21.4%, the increase in production occurred between 7 and 10 days. Only 7.1% of the animals did not respond. On the 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 10th days after treatment, an increase was found in daily milk production between the two groups equal to 1.04, 1.52, 1.42, and 1.06 L, respectively. In relative terms, this means an increase in milk production, respectively, of 15.1%, 21.0%, 19.8%, and 15.1%. The constitution of the milk showed no difference in the amounts of fat, lactose, total solids, or somatic cell count; however, on the third day after rbST administration, there was a decrease in protein. Notably, from the fifth day, the protein values showed no statistical difference. It can be concluded that the use of rbST in buffalo from the 100th day of lactation is metabolically safe since the treatment neither caused imbalances in fat metabolism nor overloaded the liver or renal function, and the changes in milk composition were transient and limited to a decrease in milk protein.

AB  - Simple Summary This study demonstrates that treatment with selenium and vitamin-E reduced the damage caused by sodium arsenite in sperm quality in goats. The present investigation is a reference to propose the use of these antioxidants to reduce damage caused by arsenic in the animal organisms in places where groundwater contaminated with arsenic is used as drinking water for animals. This study was to evaluate whether selenium and vitamin-E counteract the toxic effects of arsenic on reproductive aspects and physiological conditions of male goats. Male goats [Criollo, n = 20, 4-5 yr-old, 72 kg live weight (LW)] were distributed in homogeneous groups (n = 5), and received during 12 weeks: (1) Sodium arsenite 2 mg/kg of LW/day (AG, LW = 69 kg); (2) Sodium selenite 6 mg + vitamin-E 420 I.U. every 14 days during the 12 weeks (SG, LW = 68 kg); (3) Both AG and SG treatments (ASG, LW = 77 kg); and (4) 1 mL of physiological solution every 14 days during the 12 weeks (CG, LW = 72 kg). The animals had access to water from a well with a concentration of 35 & mu;g/L of arsenic. The SG had the highest percentage of sperm viability (80.6%) followed by the CG, ASG (74.7; p > 0.05), and AG (64.3; p & LE; 0.05). The ASG and SG had a lower heart rate as compared to the CG and AG (58.8, 58 vs. 65.4, 63.5; respectively, p & LE; 0.05). The CG and SG showed a lower respiratory rate than the AG and ASG (19.2, 18.7 vs. 22.1, 21.0, respectively; p & LE; 0.05). Selenium and vitamin-E were efficient in reducing the damage caused by sodium arsenite in sperm quality and maintaining heart and respiratory rates and increases in odor in male goats.

AB  - As one of the world's top three popular non-alcoholic beverages, tea is economically and culturally valuable. Xinyang Maojian, this elegant green tea, is one of the top ten famous tea in China and has gained prominence for thousands of years. However, the cultivation history of Xinyang Maojian tea population and selection signals of differentiation from the other major variety Camellia sinensis var. assamica (CSA) remain unclear. We newly generated 94 Camellia sinensis (C. sinensis) transcriptomes including 59 samples in the Xinyang area and 35 samples collected from 13 other major tea planting provinces in China. Comparing the very low resolution of phylogeny inferred from 1785 low-copy nuclear genes with 94 C. sinensis samples, we successfully resolved the phylogeny of C. sinensis samples by 99,115 high-quality SNPs from the coding region. The sources of tea planted in the Xinyang area were extensive and complex. Specifically, Shihe District and Gushi County were the two earliest tea planting areas in Xinyang, reflecting a long history of tea planting. Furthermore, we identified numerous selection sweeps during the differentiation of CSA and CSS and these positive selection genes are involved in many aspects such as regulation of secondary metabolites synthesis, amino acid metabolism, photosynthesis, etc. Numerous specific selective sweeps of modern cultivars were annotated with functions in various different aspects, indicating the CSS and CSA populations possibly underwent independent specific domestication processes. Our study indicated that transcriptome-based SNP-calling is an efficient and cost-effective method in untangling intraspecific phylogenetic relationships. This study provides a significant understanding of the cultivation history of the famous Chinese tea Xinyang Maojian and unravels the genetic basis of physiological and ecological differences between the two major tea subspecies.

AB  - Background Multifetal births are the most significant economic characteristic in goats. Therefore, physiologically, exploring the influence of their birth frequency on genital function and milk production is vital. The present study was carried out to monitor the potential effect of the number and type of birth on udder, milk yield, milk composition, ovarian follicles, and certain blood parameters in dam's Baladi goats during the postpartum period. On the birth day, fifty Baladi goat dams were separated into five equal groups based on the number of births: (G1) female kids and (G2) male kids. In addition to gender, there are three categories: (G3) single kids, (G4) twin kids, and (G5) triple kids. All of the offspring looked to be in good health, moving about regularly, and displaying no symptoms of peripartum pregnancy problems. Results The data revealed that the udder width of dams in G4 and G5 was significantly higher (p < 0.033) than G3, while the udder circumference was increased in the G5. Furthermore, no significant differences were observed in the udder measurements between G1 and G2. Gender of birth showed a significant higher in large follicle <= 5 mm (p < 0.005), medium follicle (p < 0.004), and small follicle >= 3 mm (p < 0.004) in the G2 compared to the G1. Also, the follicular population (p < 0.042) of the medium and the diameter follicle (p < 0.038) of the small >= 3 mm were significantly higher in the G5 compared to the G3. The Pearson correlation (r) was determined to increase the milk yield with an increase in udder length, udder width, and udder circumference. Also, there was a positive correlation among the udder length with protein, salt, solids not fat, and total solids. A negative correlation was found among udder width and udder circumference with fat, lactose, solids not fat, and total solids. There was a negative correlation between the ultrasonographic examination of ovarian follicles and milk yield. Conclusions This study may provide valuable information regarding the association of udder parameters and ovarian population with milk yield and its composition as an indicator of milk production in goat dams based on gender and number of births.

AB  - Simple Summary
   The growing demand for protein and the reluctance of consumers to use genetically modified feeds necessitate the use of other protein feeds. Corn dried distillers grains with solubles (cDDGS) is a well-digested protein feed; however, it is rich in unsaturated fatty acids and can negatively affect the meat quality and oxidative stability. The negative influence of dietary unsaturated fatty acids on meat quality can be balanced by feed additives, e.g., a dietary saturated fat source increasing the iodine value of fat. To reduce the detrimental effect of corn DDGS in the present experiment, the beef tallow and coconut oil in a feed mixture were studied, as both of them are more saturated than corn DDGS and rapeseed oil. The aim of the study was to investigate mixtures comprising corn DDGS as a partial replacer for soybean meal as well as different dietary saturated fat sources to determine their effect on the meat quality and fatty acid profile. The relationships between dietary fatty acid profile and meat fatty acid profile and between various meat quality parameters were analyzed.
   The aim of the study was to investigate mixtures comprising corn distillers dried grain with solubles as a partial replacer for soybean meal (SBM) and different dietary fat sources, in order to determine their effect on the meat quality and fatty acid profile. Thirty-two crossbred fatteners were divided into four groups: I-SBM + rapeseed oil, II-cDDGS + rapeseed oil, III-cDDGS + beef tallow, IV-cDDGS + coconut oil. The experiment took place from 60 to 118 kg. At the end of fattening, all pigs were slaughtered and samples of meat (musculus longissimus lumborum) were taken. The fatty acid profile, texture, and quality traits were analyzed. Corn DDGS affected drip loss. Beef tallow and coconut oil improved water holding capacity and drip loss and increased fat content, compared to the control group. The dietary fat type affected the fatty acid composition, iodine value, and consequently some quality traits of meat. However, these relationships varied. Fat content in the meat was inversely correlated with shear force and texture parameters, but positively with tenderness and juiciness. The fatty acid profile significantly influenced cohesiveness, chewiness, resilience and sensory traits, which were the most beneficial in meat with higher fat content and higher fat saturation index.

AB  - The issue of soil acidification in tea plantations has become a critical concern due to its potential impact on tea quality and plant health. Understanding the factors contributing to soil acidification is essential for implementing effective soil management strategies in tea-growing regions. In this study, a field study was conducted to investigate the effects of tea plantations on soil acidification and the associated acid-base buffering capacity (pHBC). We assessed acidification, pHBC, nutrient concentrations, and cation contents in the top 0-20 cm layer of soil across forty tea gardens of varying stand ages (0-5, 5-10, 10-20, and 20-40 years old) in Anji County, Zhejiang Province, China. The results revealed evident soil acidification due to tea plantation activities, with the lowest soil pH observed in tea gardens aged 10-20 and 20-40 years. Higher levels of soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen (TN), Olsen phosphorus (Olsen-P), available iron (Fe), and exchangeable hydrogen (H+) were notably recorded in 10-20 and 20-40 years old tea garden soils, suggesting an increased risk of soil acidification with prolonged tea cultivation. Furthermore, prolonged tea cultivation correlated with increased pHBC, which amplified with tea stand ages. The investigation of the relationship between soil pHBC and various parameters highlighted significant influences from soil pH, SOM, cation exchange capacity, TN, available potassium, Olsen-P, exchangeable acids (including H+ and aluminum), available Fe, and available zinc. Consequently, these findings underscore a substantial risk of soil acidification in tea gardens within the monitored region, with SOM and TN content being key driving factors influencing pHBC.

AB  - Theophylline is a drug commonly used to treat asthma due to its anti-inflammatory and bronchodilatory properties. Testosterone (TES) has been suggested to reduce the severity of asthma symptoms. This condition affects boys more than girls in childhood, and this ratio reverses at puberty. We reported that guinea pig tracheal tissue chronic exposure to TES increases the expression of beta(2)-adrenoreceptors and enhances salbutamol-induced K+ currents (IK+). Herein, we investigated whether the upregulation of K+ channels can enhance the relaxation response to methylxanthines, including theophylline. Chronic incubation of guinea pig tracheas with TES (40 nM, 48 h) enhanced the relaxation induced by caffeine, isobutylmethylxanthine, and theophylline, an effect that was abolished by tetraethylammonium. In tracheal myocytes, chronic incubation with TES increased theophylline-induced IK+; flutamide reversed this effect. The increase in IK+ was blocked by 4-aminopyridine by similar to 82%, whereas iberiotoxin reduced IK+ by similar to 17%. Immunofluorescence studies showed that chronic TES exposure increased the expression of K(V)1.2 and K(V)1.5 in airway smooth muscle (ASM). In conclusion, chronic exposure to TES in guinea pig ASM promotes upregulation of K(V)1.2 and K(V)1.5 and enhances theophylline relaxation response. Therefore, gender should be considered when prescribing methylxanthines, as teenage boys and males are likely to respond better than females.

AB  - The acini-islet-acinar (AIA) axis concept justifies the anatomical placement of the Langerhans islets within the exocrine pancreatic parenchyma and explains the existence of the pancreas as a single organ. Amylase has been suggested to play a key role as an anti-incretin factor. Oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) were performed on 18 piglets in both a healthy (prior to pancreatic duct ligation (PDL) surgery, study Day 10) and an exocrine pancreatic insufficient (EPI) state (30 days after PDL, study Day 48)). Amylase (4000 units/feeding) or Creon (R) (100,000 units/feeding) was administered to pigs with the morning and evening meals, according to study design randomization, for 37 days following the first OGTT. Blood glucose levels, as well as plasma levels of insulin, GLP-1, and GIP, were measured, and the HOMA-IR index was calculated. EPI status did not affect the area under the curve (AUC) of insulin release, fasting insulin levels, or the HOMA-IR index, while amylase supplementation led to a significant (p < 0.05) decrease in the above-mentioned parameters. At the same time, EPI led to a significant (p < 0.05) increase in GLP-1 levels, and neither amylase nor Creon (R) supplementation had any effects on this EPI-related increase. Fasting plasma levels of GIP were not affected by EPI; however, the GIP response in EPI and Amylase-treated EPI animals was significantly lower (p < 0.05) when compared to that of the intact, healthy pigs. Orally administered amylase induces gut anti-incretin action, normalizing glucose homeostasis and reducing HOMA-IR as a long-term outcome, thus lowering the risk of diabetes type II development. Amylase has long-lasting anti-incretin effects, and one could consider the existence of a long-lasting gut memory for amylase, which decreases hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia for up to 16 h after the last exposure of the gut to amylase.

AB  - Orangutan (Pongo spp.) fossils have been found throughout much of Pleistocene Southeast Asia. Today, Pongo is restricted to three living species on the islands of Borneo and Sumatra. They are predominately frugivores, and during fruit masting events their diets can consist entirely of fruit. However, food procurement strategies between masting events differ between islands and thus species. Sumatran orangutans (Pongo abelii) are largely able to fall back on non-masting fruit species, such as figs, such that they can maintain higher quality diets compared to their Bornean counterparts (Pongo pygmaeus), who ingest more lower quality and tougher foods between masting events. However, diets of fossil orangutans remain largely unknown. We investigated the diets of Sumatran orangutans from the Pleistocene deposits of the Padang Highlands, western Sumatra, using dental microwear texture analysis. We tested whether the diets of the fossil species were similar to those of Bornean orangutans, all great apes generally, and macaques that occupy similar habitats to modern orangutans, in order to gain insights into palaeoenvironments present in western Sumatra. We found that fossil orangutans consumed foods less tough than modern Bornean Pongo pygmaeus, and thus presumably more fleshy fruits (absent of significant seed mastication). We found no differences in the amount of hard object feeding between modern and fossil orangutans. Taken together, we suggest that Pleistocene orangutans from western Sumatra had similar diets to Pongo abelii, indicating that masting events were not a significant contributing factor in their intake of fruit. Finally, we suggest anisotropy values in orangutan dental microwear may be an important marker for fruit masting events in the Pleistocene.

AB  - Simple Summary: Ovarian follicular development is associated with ovulation and is further related to litter size in goats. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from miRNAs within follicular fluid undergo dynamic changes, and, together with follicle growth, may be considered as potential regulators of follicular development. However, the function and changes in EVs remain ambiguous. Here, we identified miRNA changes in EVs from small to large goat follicular fluid. Using bioinformatics tools, we demonstrated the existence of differentially expressed miRNAs in EVs from follicles of different sizes that are responsible for an altered biological effect. This study contributes to a better understanding of follicular development in goats.
   Extracellular vesicles (EVs), which exist in the follicular fluid of ruminant ovaries, are considered as cargo carriers for the transfer of biomolecules to recipient cells. However, the functions and changes in EVs in antral follicles remain ambiguous. In the present study, we isolated and characterized EVs from goat follicular fluid by means of differential ultracentrifugation and Western blotting of marker proteins. Bioinformatics tools were used to detect miRNA expression levels in EVs. Different miRNA expression patterns of EVs exist in small to large follicles. Thirteen differentially expressed miRNAs (seven upregulated and six downregulated) were identified and used for analysis. A total of 1948 predicted target genes of 13 miRNAs were mapped to signaling pathways, and three significantly enriched pathways (FoxO, MAPK, and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways) were involved in follicular development, as revealed by KEGG enrichment analysis. Our findings suggest that EVs in follicular fluid play biofunctional roles during follicular development in goats.

AB  - Simple Summary The papaya mealybug, Paracoccus marginatus, is an invasive pest affecting many crop plants. It reproduces and spreads rapidly. They have historically been a pest of potato, Solanum tuberosum, but they have successfully adapted to infesting papaya, Carica papaya. When they feed on papaya, they survive and reproduce more and live longer than when they feed on potato. We do not yet know what biological adaptations they made in order to use this new host plant. We compared the RNA sequences of papaya mealybugs feeding on potato and papaya. A total of 408 genes are expressed differently depending on the host plant. Most of these genes are expressed less when feeding on potato than on papaya. They encode digestive enzymes, detoxifying enzymes, and ribosomes and some have reproductive functions. We further analyzed their known functions using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes. This showed that they include genes regulating digestion, detoxification, and longevity. We suggest that papaya is a more suitable host than potato, and that the decreased expression of particular genes may have important effects on the adaptation of the papaya mealybug to this alternative host plant. Paracoccus marginatus (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae) is an invasive pest with a diverse host range, strong diffusion, and high fecundity. It has been observed that P. marginatus feeding on Carica papaya have a higher survival rate, fecundity, and longer lifespan than P. marginatus feeding on Solanum tuberosum, indicating their successful adaptation to C. papaya; however, the mechanisms underlying host plant adaptation remain unclear. Therefore, RNA-seq was performed to study the transcriptional responses of P. marginatus feeding on C. papaya and S. tuberosum plants. A total of 408 genes with significant differential expression were defined; most of them were downregulated in S. tuberosum, including those of digestive enzymes, detoxifying enzymes, ribosomes, and reproductive-related genes, which may result from the adaptation of the host to nutritional needs and changes in toxic chemical levels. Enrichment analysis of the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes showed that lysosome and longevity regulating pathways related to digestion, detoxification, and longevity were enriched. We suggest that C. papaya is a more suitable host than S. tuberosum, and downregulated target genes may have important effects on the adaptation of P. marginatus to host transfer.

AB  - Problem: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from gram-negative bacteria has reportedly been associated with infectious diseases like metritis, which has a substantial adverse effect on animal reproductive performance and causes serious financial losses for the dairy sector. The current work aimed to establish the impact of LPS on in vitro oocyte maturation and subsequent in vitro developmental competence of oocytes, as well as to investigate the explanatory molecular mechanism underlying this effect. Method of Study: Buffalo cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were challenged with 0, 5, 10 and 20 mu g/mL LPS during IVM followed by IVF and IVC. Cytoplasmic and nuclear maturation, cleavage and blastocyst rate, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP, Delta Psi m) and transcript abundance of genes related to inflammation, antioxidation and apoptosis were evaluated. Results: The maturation and subsequent embryonic development competency were found to be significantly (p <= 0.05) reduced with the addition of 10 and 20 mu g/mL LPS to IVM media. ROS production accompanied by a decreased Delta Psi m was recorded in LPS-treated oocytes in comparison to the control group (p <= 0.05). Our results were further supported by the transcriptional expression of proinflammatory (TLR4, CD14 and RPS27A) and apoptotic gene (Caspase 3) which were found to be significantly increased while antioxidant genes (SOD2 and GPX1) were decreased significantly in matured oocytes and blastocyst after LPS exposure. Conclusions: The deleterious effects of LPS are mediated through ROS generation, which triggers inflammatory processes via the TLR4 pathway and impairs oocyte maturation and subsequent embryonic development.

AB  - Freshwater quality and ecosystem impairment associated with excess phosphorus (P) loadings have led to federally mandated P reduction for certain organic waste streams. Phosphorus reduction from livestock and poultry feeds such as corn ethanol distillers' grains (DGs) presents a centralized strategy for reducing P loss from animal manurein agriculturally intensive states, but little is known about the actual distribution and geospatial P contributions of DGs as animal feed. Here, a county-level flow network for corn ethanol DGs was simulated in the United States to elucidate opportunities for P reduction and the potential for nutrient trading between centralized sources. Overall, the estimated P in DGs that was transferred to US animal feeding operations was nearly twice that present in all human waste prior to treatment. Simulation results suggest that Midwestern states account for an estimated 63% of domestic DG usage, with 72% utilized within the state of production. County-level data were also used to highlight the potential of using nutrient trading markets to incentivize P recovery from DGs at biorefineries within an agriculturally intensive watershed region in Iowa. In summary, corn ethanol biorefineries represent a key leverage point for sustainable P management at the national and local scales.

AB  - Background Ribosomal protein SA (RPSA) of human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) can transfer from the cytosol to the cell surface and act as a receptor for some pathogens, including Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2), a zoonotic pathogen causing meningitis in pigs and humans. We previously reported that SS2 virulence factor enolase (ENO) binds to RPSA on the cell surface of HBMECs and induces apoptosis. However, the mechanism that activates RPSA translocation to the cell surface and induces ENO-mediated HBMEC apoptosis is unclear. Results Here, we show that RPSA localization and condensation on the host cell surface depend on its internally disordered region (IDR). ENO binds to the IDR of RPSA and promotes its interaction with RPSA and vimentin (VIM), which is significantly suppressed after 1,6-Hexanediol (1,6-Hex, a widely used tool to disrupt phase separation) treatment, indicating that ENO incorporation and thus the concentration of RPSA/VIM complexes via co-condensation. Furthermore, increasing intracellular calcium ions (Ca2+) in response to SS2 infection further facilitates the liquid-like condensation of RPSA and aggravates ENO-induced HBMEC cell apoptosis. Conclusions Together, our study provides a previously underappreciated molecular mechanism illuminating that ENO-induced RPSA condensation activates the migration of RPSA to the bacterial cell surface and stimulates SS2-infected HBMEC death and, potentially, disease progression. This study offers a fresh avenue for investigation into the mechanism by which other harmful bacteria infect hosts via cell surfaces' RPSA.

AB  - Subterranean termites of the species Reticulitermes speratus kyushuensis Morimoto (Isoptera: Rhinotermitidae) are notoriously destructive soil-dwelling pests that feed on the cellulosic wood biomass. This leads to tremendous losses of forest trees such as Pinus densiflora Siebold and Zucc. (Pinales: Pinaceae) and precious wooden structures of cultural heritage. This study investigated the efficacy of chitinase and protease produced by Bacillus licheniformis PR2 as cuticle-degrading enzymes for the biocontrol of worker termites. Bacillus licheniformis PR2 produced a strong chitinase and protease activity up to a maximum of 82.3 unit/mL and 35.9 unit/mL, respectively, and caused a lethal effect on termites under laboratory conditions. Treatment of termites with the bacterial broth culture and the crude enzyme fraction of B. licheniformis PR2 resulted in a maximum mortality rate (with a median lethal time (ET50)) of 83.3% (3 h, 36 min) and 88.9% (2 h, 59 min), respectively. The termites treated with B. licheniformis PR2 exhibited loss of setae, disintegration of epicuticle, rupturing of procuticle, and swelling at sockets. The degradation of cuticular chitin and glycoprotein polymers in the termite cuticle by chitinase and protease enzymes produced by B. licheniformis PR2 represents an effective eco-friendly strategy for controlling termite damage in Korean cultural heritage sites and forests.

AB  - Neurotrypsin (NT) is a neuronal trypsin-like serine protease whose mutations cause severe mental retardation in humans. NT is activated in vitro by Hebbian-like conjunction of pre- and postsynaptic activities, which promotes the formation of dendritic filopodia via proteolytic cleavage of the proteoglycan agrin. Here, we investigated the functional importance of this mechanism for synaptic plasticity, learning, and extinction of memory. We report that juvenile neurotrypsin-deficient (NT-/-) mice exhibit impaired long-term potentiation induced by a spaced stimulation protocol designed to probe the generation of new filopodia and their conversion into functional synapses. Behaviorally, juvenile NT-/- mice show impaired contextual fear memory and have a sociability deficit. The latter persists in aged NT-/- mice, which, unlike juvenile mice, show normal recall but impaired extinction of contextual fear memories. Structurally, juvenile mutants exhibit reduced spine density in the CA1 region, fewer thin spines, and no modulation in the density of dendritic spines following fear conditioning and extinction in contrast to wild-type littermates. The head width of thin spines is reduced in both juvenile and aged NT-/- mice. In vivo delivery of adeno-associated virus expressing an NT-generated fragment of agrin, agrin-22, but not a shorter agrin-15, elevates the spine density in NT-/- mice. Moreover, agrin-22 co-aggregates with pre- and postsynaptic markers and increases the density and size of presynaptic boutons and presynaptic puncta, corroborating the view that agrin-22 supports the synaptic growth.

AB  - Simple Summary In many places and under certain conditions, feeding shrubs and trees such as date palm leaves to goats and sheep is a common practice to reduce feed costs. The main problem with such materials is the low nutritive value. Therefore, improving their nutritive value before feeding can overcome the problem of low nutritive value. Ensiling with organic acids can be used as a good strategy to increase the digestion and intake of date palm leaves and other agricultural byproducts. The inclusion of malic or lactic acid during ensiling can improve the quality of silages, resulting in improved performance (daily gain or milk production) when these materials are fed to ruminants, resulting in increased profitability. This is the first study to evaluate date palm leaves ensiled with malic or lactic acids in the diet of lactating ewes under desert conditions. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the ensiling of date palm leaves (DPL) with organic acids (lactic or malic acid) for 45 day as a feed for lactating ewes under desert conditions. Two weeks before expected parturition, 50 multiparous lactating Farafra ewes (mean +/- SD: 2 +/- 0.3 parity, 34 +/- 1.9 kg bodyweight, 25 +/- 2.4 months of age, and 555 +/- 13.0 g/day of previous milk production) were equally divided into five treatments in a completely randomized design for 90 day. The ewes in the control treatment were offered a diet composed of a concentrate feed mixture and DPL at 60:40 on a dry matter (DM) basis ensiled without additive. In the other treatments, DPL (ensiled without organic acids) in the control treatment was replaced with DPL ensiled with lactic or malic acid (at 5 g/kg DM) at 50 or 100% levels. Organic acids linearly and quadratically increased (p < 0.01) DPL and total intakes and digestibilities of DM, organic matter, crude protein, and nonstructural carbohydrates without affecting fiber digestibility. Malic and lactic acid treatment also increased the concentrations of ruminal total volatile fatty acids, acetate, propionate, and ammonia-N. Additionally, malic and lactic acid-treated DPL increased serum glucose concentration and total antioxidant capacity. Without affecting daily actual milk production, treatments increased (p < 0.001) the daily production of energy-corrected milk (ECM), fat-corrected milk (FCM), milk energy output, milk contents of fats, and feed efficiency. Organic acid-treated DPL increased (p < 0.05) the proportions of total polyunsaturated fatty acids and total conjugated linoleic acids and the unsaturated to saturated fatty acid ratio in milk. It is concluded that feeding DPL ensiled with malic or lactic acid at 20 or 40% of total diet DM increased daily ECM and FCM production, nutrient utilization efficiency, and milk quality. No differences were observed between lactic and malic acid treatment of DPL during ensiling; therefore, both of them are recommended to treat DPL for silage preparation.

AB  - Heat stress is a major detriment to crop growth and yield under the current patterns of climate change. Two independent experiments of camelina and canola were conducted to assess the role of thiourea (TU) priming in modulating heat stress tolerance in camelina and canola. The experiment comprised of three factors: (i) seed priming; NP (no priming), HP (hydro-priming), TU500 (thiourea priming at 500 mg L-1), TU1000 (thiourea priming at 1000 mg L-1), and TU1500 (thiourea priming at 1500 mg L-1); (ii) heat stress; control (22/18 degrees C) and heat stress (35/25 degrees C) applied at 20% flowering (62 DAS); and (iii) cultivars; camelina (611 and 618) and canola (Hiola-401 and 45S42). The results indicated that the plants exposed to heat stress exhibited a significant decrease in the growth and yield of camelina and canola due to impaired physiological attributes, while activities/levels of superoxide dismutase, total soluble sugars, glycine betaine, and proline were triggered under heat stress compared with control. Heat stress decreased the photosynthetic rate and water potential by 47% and 23% in camelina and 49% and 24% in canola that led to reduction in seed yield of camelina and canola by 53% and 57%, respectively. Seed priming with thiourea improved the growth and yield attributes of both crops by maintaining the gas-exchange attributes, water relations, and upregulating the activities/levels of antioxidants compared with NP; the maximum improvement was observed with thiourea priming at TU1000. Cultivars 618 and 45S42 showed better antioxidant activity to maintain redox potential in camelina and canola, respectively. In crux, these findings indicated that thiourea seed priming improved the heat stress tolerance in camelina and canola, which might be attributed to higher accumulation of secondary metabolites, better antioxidative defense, and maintenance of plant water status in thiourea-primed seedlings.

AB  - Elevated non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs), particularly stearic acid (SA), have a deleterious effect on oocyte maturation, leading to developmental damage and reproductive issues. High SA levels disrupt metabolic processes, inducing lipotoxicity that impairs oocyte quality and contributes to reproductive failures through early embryonic losses. This research investigates the lipotoxic effects of SA and assesses the protective potential of 6-Gingerol (6-G) and Astaxanthin (AX) on porcine oocytes during in vitro maturation (IVM). Herein, 6100 cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were exposed to various concentrations of SA (25-250 mu M) to elucidate the concentration-dependent effect on oocyte viability, polar body extrusion (PBE) and cumulus cell expansion index (CCEI). However, the efficacy of 6-G (5-15 mu M) and AX (2.5 mu M) in combination with SA at 150 mu M (SA6) concentration was evaluated to mitigate these adverse effects. The results indicated that SA6 substantially reduced oocyte viability, PBE and CCEI, demonstrating its toxic impact on oocyte developmental competence (p < 0.0001). Moreover, treatment with antioxidants such as SA6 + 6-G (10 mu M) and SA6 + AX showed a considerable increase in viability and PBE compared to SA6 alone (p < 0.05). These findings demonstrate the importance of lipid metabolism in oocyte health, where dysregulation impairs reproductive capacity. Both 6-G and AX protected against lipotoxicity induced by SA6 while enhancing lipid homeostasis and the anti-oxidative defences necessary for maintaining cellular integrity. This study finds substantial evidence that optimising the microenvironment with specific antioxidants can improve oocyte quality and provide invaluable knowledge in reproductive technologies and fertility treatments.

AB  - Disturbances in the neurotransmitter systems associated with the development of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) have been well-studied in forebrain structures including the temporal cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus. It is known that in rodents genetically prone to audiogenic seizures, TLE establishment induced by audiogenic kindling is also associated with the involvement of the forebrain, however, initially epileptiform activity arises in the brainstem, in particular, in the inferior colliculi (IC). It is reasonable to suppose that neurochemical alterations in the IC may contribute significantly to the spreading of epileptiform activity at early steps of TLE development. At the same time, the functional state of the key neurotransmitter systems in the IC of audiogenic rodents exposed to audiogenic kindling remains unknown. In the present work, we performed a comprehensive analysis of proteins involved in glutamate- and GABA-ergic transmission in the IC of Krushinsky-Molodkina (KM) rats genetically prone to audiogenic seizures. A modified audiogenic kindling protocol was used to reproduce the early stage of TLE development. According to this protocol, rats were exposed to daily audiogenic stimulations for seven days. Naive KM rats were used as a control. Although the rodent's predisposition to audiogenic seizures is often associated with the impairment of GABAergic transmission, no significant changes were found in the expression of GABA synthesis enzymes and GABAA receptor alpha 1 subunit in the IC of KM rats either 24 hours or a week after their last seizure. However, 24 hours after the last audiogenic stimulation, an increase in glutamatergic transmission in the IC was observed including upregulation of ERK 1/2 kinases, synaptic proteins synapsin 1 and SV2B, VGLUT1 and VGLUT2. One week after the last seizure, only an increase in VGLUT1 content in the IC was observed, suggesting the persistent changes in the neurons of forebrain structures, in particular, of the temporal cortex.

AB  - BACKGROUND Plants in nature can be sequentially attacked by different arthropod herbivores. Feeding by one arthropod species may induce plant-defense responses that might affect the performance of a later-arriving herbivorous species. Understanding these interactions can help in developing pest-management strategies. In tomato, the sweet-potato whitefly Bemisia tabaci and the two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae are key pests that frequently cohabit on the same plant. We studied whether colonization by one species can either facilitate or impede later colonization of tomato plants by conspecific or heterospecific individuals.
   RESULTS B. tabaci females showed a strong preference for and increased oviposition on plants previously colonized by conspecifics. In contrast, plants infested with T. urticae repelled B. tabaci females and reduced their oviposition rate by 86%. Although females of T. urticae showed no preference between conspecific-infested or uninfested plants, we observed a 50% reduction in the number of eggs laid on conspecific-infested plants. Both herbivorous arthropods up-regulated the expression of genes involving the jasmonic acid and abscisic acid pathways, increasing emissions of fatty-acid derivatives, but only B. tabaci increased the expression of genes related to the salicylic acid pathway and the total amount of phenylpropanoids released. Terpenoids were the most abundant compounds in the volatile blends; many terpenoids were emitted at different rates, which might have influenced the arthropods' host selection.
   CONCLUSION Our results indicate that B. tabaci infestation facilitated subsequent infestations by conspecifics and mites, while T. urticae infestation promoted herbivore-induced resistance. Based on both the molecular and behavioral findings, a novel sustainable pest-management strategy is discussed.

Further, work on the association with the resistance of Staphylococcus epidermidis, isolated from cases of sheep mastitis in Greece, to antibiotics is presented. The database includes 1593 isolates from 46 countries, most (76%) of human origin. Of the isolates of animal origin, 72% are from cases of mastitis, among which there were differences between isolates of bovine or ovine origin. Of the isolates from sheep mastitis in Greece, in 58%, resistance to antibiotics was found. There was no association between MLST types and resistance to antibiotics, but antibiotic resistance was more frequent among isolates from flocks being hand- than machine-milked.
   Staphylococcus epidermidis is an important causal agent of ovine mastitis. A literature search indicated a lack of systematic studies of causal agents of the infection by using multi-locus sequence typing (MLST). The objectives were to analyse MLST-based data and evaluate the antimicrobial resistance of S. epidermidis isolates from ovine mastitis in Greece. The database included 1593 isolates from 46 countries: 1215 of human, 195 of environmental and 134 of animal origin, distributed into 949 sequence types (STs) and cumulatively with 450 alleles therein. Among mastitis isolates, bovine isolates were distributed into 36 different STs and ovine ones into 15 STs. The 33 isolates from ovine mastitis in Greece were in 15 different STs, 6 of these (ST677, ST678, ST700, ST 709, ST710, ST711) assigned for the first time; in addition, 5 alleles (65 for arcC, 59 for aroE, 56 and 57 for gtr and 48 for tpiA) were identified for the first time. The spanning tree of these isolates included 15 nodes and 14 edges (i.e., branches). Among these isolates, 19 showed resistance to antimicrobial agents (tetracycline, penicillin, fucidic adic, erythromycin, clindamycin, cefoxitin). Resistance-related genes (tetK, tetT, msrA, tetM, tetS, ermC, mecA) were detected. There was no association between STs and resistance to antimicrobial agents. Isolates with antimicrobial resistance were recovered more often from flocks where hand-milking was practised.

AB  - The present study aimed to evaluate the genetic parameters of first parity reproductive traits. Information on 762 reproductive records on Saanen x Beetal (S x B) goats reared for approximately five decades was collected from ICAR-National Dairy Research Institute, Karnal, Haryana (1973-2020). For genetic analysis, single-trait and multiple-trait animal models were used. Gibbs sampler for animal model (GSAM) approach was used for estimating (co)variance components of reproductive traits. Six different single-trait animal models (with or without maternal and environmental effects) were used and the deviance information criterion (DIC) determined the best model. The least squares mean for age at first service (AFS), age at first kidding (AFK), service period (SP), dry period (DP), gestation length (GL), kidding interval (KI), litter weight (LW), number of kids born (NKB) and number of female kids born (NFKB) in first parity were 526.99 +/- 4.86, 662.96 +/- 5.03, 219.11 +/- 6.25, 109.38 +/- 6.00, 150.48 +/- 0.27, 356.63 +/- 4.80 days, 3.87 +/- 0.05 kg, 1.27 +/- 0.02 and 0.67 +/- 0.03, respectively. Lower heritability estimates for these reproductive traits revealed a sparse scope for genetic improvement. Multivariate analysis using Model 1 was carried out to evaluate the genetic and phenotypic correlation of these nine reproductive traits. The genetic correlation of DP and SP was negatively with LW, NKB and NFKB, which is favourable as reduction in SP and DP can improve these economically important traits through indirect selection. Consistent efforts towards genetic improvement of these goat flock poses a promising future for meat industry owing to high prolificacy and good reproductive potential in this flock.

AB  - The problem of odor pollution caused by the functioning of large livestock facilities does not lose its relevance. Searching solutions to this problem is one of the promising areas of modern science and production. In this regard it is interesting to use chemical reagents and additives for manure effluents in order to reduce the odor load. One of the key problems is the presence of a strong, unpleasant and persistent odor from pig manure and manure effluents formed in large volumes at enterprises. The active production of the gas components underlying this phenomenon is provided by certain types of microorganisms that make up the permanent microbiota of both pig intestines and pig manure. The effectiveness of using drugs to neutralize odors depends on their effect on the change in the microbiological composition of the substrate. The treatment of manure and sewage was carried out with preparations "BIOCTIC" and "BIUS". As an alternative, sulfuric acid and sodium hypochlorite were used, which are the waste products of chlorine production by electrolysis. As a result of the study, it was revealed that the use of "BIUS" led to an increase in Clostridium ssp. (78.22%), Escherichia coli (10.51%) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (6.6%), and the BIOCTIC creates favorable conditions for the reproduction of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (88,07%), Rhodotorula glutinis (5.87%) and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (1.17%) in manure drains. When using H2SO4 in manure drains, Bacteroides sp. (53.42%), S. cerevisiae (12,02%), R. glutinis (12.02%), Proteus ssp. (9.35%), Clostridium ssp. (5.34%) prevail and the introduction of NaOCl leads to an increase in S. cerevisiae (87.91%), Clostridium ssp. (10.05%), R. glutinis (1.01%). Of particular interest is the detection of yeast of the genus Rhodotorula in surface films, which can serve as a marker of environmental pollution by animal waste. The analysis of the dynamics of the microbiota and its correlation with the process of suppressing gas formation during the introduction of various preparations will allow us to establish and use the optimal method for the greening of animal husbandry.

AB  - Mechanistic evaluations of processes that underlie organism-level physiology often require reductionist approaches. Dermal fibroblasts offer one such approach. These cells are easily obtained from minimally invasive skin biopsy, making them appropriate for the study of protected and/or logistically challenging species. Cell culture approaches permit extensive and fine-scale sampling regimes as well as gene manipulation techniques that are not feasible in vivo. Fibroblast isolation and culture protocols are outlined here for primary cells, and the benefits and drawbacks of immortalization are discussed. We show examples of physiological metrics that can be used to characterize primary cells (oxygen consumption, translation, proliferation) and readouts that can be informative in understanding cell-level responses to environmental stress (lactate production, heat shock protein induction). Importantly, fibroblasts may display fidelity to whole animal physiological phenotypes, facilitating their study. Fibroblasts from Antarctic Weddell seals show greater resilience to low temperatures and hypoxia exposure than fibroblasts from humans or rats. Fibroblast oxygen consumption rates are not affected by temperature stress in the heat-tolerant camel, whereas similar temperature exposures depress mitochondrial metabolism in fibroblasts from rhinoceros. Finally, dermal fibroblasts from a hibernator, the meadow jumping mouse, better resist experimental cooling than a fibroblast line from the laboratory mouse, with the hibernator demonstrating a greater maintenance of homeostatic processes such as protein translation. These results exemplify the parallels that can be drawn between fibroblast physiology and expectations in vivo, and provide evidence for the power of fibroblasts as a model system to understand comparative physiology and biomedicine.

AB  - There is a growing interest in using naturally-occurring plant colorants as alternative to the toxic synthetic colors for hair coloration. However, poor color reproducibility and color fastness on the human hair remain a constant problem for natural hair dyeing. This study presents a systematic investigation into the dyeing performances of dye extracts of four hair dye plants (henna, walnut husks, sappanwood and Chinese gallnuts) for hair coloration with the focus on their photostability on the dyed human hair and the underlying mechanisms. First, the optimal dyeing conditions for each of the four plant colorants were obtained on yak hairs by assessing the effects of different dyeing variables (i.e. metallic mordants, mordant concentrations, mordanting methods and pHs) on color strength and CIE coordinates. Then, the plant colorants with ferrous mordant as the most influential metallic mordant to produce dark colors were investigated in terms of dyeability and photostability on human bleached hairs and natural gray hairs. The results demonstrated that the photosensitivity of naturally dyed human hairs is related to the nature of both hair dye colorant and the dyeing substrate. ESR measurement and fluoresce probing of hydroxyl radicals in hair fibers revealed that dyeing human hairs with natural plant colorants can inhibit, to varying extents, the photogeneration of oxidative radicals in human hairs, which may in turn provide the dyed human hairs with certain photo-protecting effects.

AB  - Objective: Total sleep deprivation (TSD) causes several harmful changes in the brain, including memory impairment, increased stress and depression levels, as well as reduced antioxidant activity. Growth hormone (GH) has been shown to boost antioxidant levels while improving memory and depression. The present study was conducted to explain the possible effects of exogenous GH against behavioral and biochemical disorders caused by TSD and the possible mechanisms involved.Main methods: To induce TSD, rats were housed in homemade special cages equipped with stainless steel wire conductors to induce general and inconsistent TSD. They received a mild repetitive electric shock to their paws every 10 min for 21 days. GH (1 ml/kg, sc) was administered to rats during induction of TSD for 21 days. Memory retrieval, anxiety, depression-like behaviors, pain behaviors, antioxidant activity, hippocampal level of BDNF, and simultaneously brain electrical activity were measured at scheduled times after TSD.Key findings: The results showed that GH treatment improved memory (p < 0.001) in the PAT test of rats exposed to TSD. These beneficial effects were associated with lowering the level of anxiety and depression-like behavior (p < 0.001), rising the pain threshold (p < 0.01), increasing the activity of antioxidants (p < 0.01), hippocampal BDNF (p < 0.001), and regular brain electrical activity.Significance: Our findings show that GH plays a key role in modulating memory, anxiety and depression be-haviors, as well as reducing oxidative stress and improve hippocampal single-unit activity in the brain during TSD.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the effects of dietary Eucommia ulmoides leaf extract (ELE) on meat quality, antioxidant capacity, and lipid metabolism in finishing pigs. A total of 240 "Duroc x Landrace x Yorkshire" crossbred pigs with an initial weight of 74.70 +/- 0.77 kg were randomly assigned to two groups: control group and 0.2% ELE group, with each group containing 10 replicates of 12 pigs per pen (half barrows and half gilts). The data showed dietary 0.2% ELE supplementation did not affect growth performance but tended to reduce the backfat thickness of the finishing pigs (p = 0.07). ELE diets increased pH value (p < 0.05) and meat color score (p = 0.01) and decreased 45 min L* value (p < 0.05), 24 h L* value (p = 0.01), pressurization loss (p = 0.01), and 24 h drip loss (p < 0.05) in longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle, accompanied by an increased (p < 0.05) proportion of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and decreased polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (p = 0.06) and n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio (p = 0.05) compared to controls. In addition, ELE supplementation increased inosine monophosphate (IMP) (p = 0.01), sweet amino acids (AAs) (p < 0.05), and total free AA content (p = 0.05) in LD. Meanwhile, increased activity of glutathione peroxidase (p < 0.05) and superoxide dismutase (p < 0.01) in both serum and LD muscle and decreased malondialdehyde content (p < 0.01) in LD muscle were detected with ELE treatment. Moreover, pigs fed ELE had a higher total protein (p < 0.01), albumin (p < 0.05), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p < 0.05) and a lower total cholesterol (p < 0.01) and triacylglycerols (p = 0.06) in serum. Consistently, significant effects of dietary ELE were observed on the relative mRNA expression of lipid metabolism in the backfat and the LD muscle, respectively. ELE attenuated lipogenic processes in backfat, decreasing the relative expression of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and upregulating the relative expression of adipose triacyl glyceride lipase, carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1B, and fatty acid-binding protein 4 (p < 0.05). ELE also decreased the relative expression of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (p < 0.05), fatty acid translocase (p < 0.05), carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1B (p < 0.01), and adipose triacyl glyceride lipase (p < 0.05) in LD muscle (p < 0.05). More specifically, lipogenesis appeared to be inhibited in both LD muscle and backfat, with the difference being that lipolysis was enhanced in backfat and inhibited in LD muscle. In conclusion, dietary ELE supplementation can potentially enhance carcass traits, sensory quality, and nutritional value of pork without negatively affecting intramuscular fat content. The underlying mechanism for these positive effects may be linked to the alterations in lipid metabolism and increased antioxidant capacity induced by ELE.

AB  - Reduction of nitrate (NO3) and ammonia (NH3) emission to the environment has, since the 1980s, been targeted by Danish environmentally friendly regulations. Nitrate pollution of aquifers and surface waters caused by farming was observed at the start of the 1980s, and in the mid-1980s, NH3 emission was known to contribute reactive nitrogen (N) to the environment. Manure is a significant source of plant nutrient loss, because there might be a lack of economic incentives and knowledge for the farmers to obtain a high nutrient utilization of the manure. This article gives a presentation of the initiatives and regulations intended to reduce the emission, the actual reduction in emission achieved, and the effect of the regulation on farmers' economy, which is considered important in the discussion about how we can reduce pollution of the environment and at the same time have an economically sustainable agriculture. In the 1980s, the Ministry of Environment and the farmers' union agreed on launching a "good agricultural practice" program, aimed at reducing N loss by increasing N use efficiency and reducing fertilizer N import. This had no or limited effect on emission, and in the late 1980s, regulations were introduced with mandatory stipulations on manure storage capacity, application of manure during the growing season, and limitation on the number of animals per hectare agricultural land (Harmony Rules). Early introduction of the Harmony Rule in 1985 has since prevented very high local surpluses of N and phosphorus. In 1993/94, legislation was introduced for a system of farm-specific N quotas and minimum requirements for utilization of N in animal manure, controlled by the Ministry of Agriculture and Environment based on fertilizer accounts for each farm. The legislation requirements for utilization of N in manure were based on research at the universities and a large number of trials on commercial farms conducted by the Danish extension service (SEGES). These convinced most farmers of the potential manure N fertilizer efficiency. From 1993/94, the N quotas were based on optimal N levels to the crops, but from 1998/99 to 2016/17, they were reduced to 10-20% below the economically optimal rate. From 2016/17, the reduced N quotas were replaced by an expansion of the catch crop requirement in the legislation. The effect is that NO3- leaching has been reduced by 45% by restricting manure application to the period with crop demand for plant nutrients, by undersupplying with N as related to the economically optimum application rate, and by compulsory cultivation of crops that take up N during most of the year. Regulation has resulted in a 51% reduction in NH3 emission from livestock buildings, manure stores, and manure application. In 2020/21, the required N fertilizer efficiency of manure N (equivalence to N in mineral fertilizers) is 75% of N in cattle slurry and 80% for pig slurry, higher than in any other countries known to us. The N quotas are based on the optimal level, and the requirement for compulsory catch crops is 40-50% for the main part of the country. The farmers can use alternatives to catch crops like a reduced N quota or early establishment of winter cereals. The revision of the "regulation system" was intended to improve the economy of the crop production, but the effect was that complexity and volume of legislation have increased significantly, without much effect on farmers' economy.
   It is recommended that the regulation is kept simple and that it reflects the processes leading to plant uptake and emissions.

AB  - Faba beans (Vicia faba L.) face threats from pests like the black bean aphid (Aphis fabae S.). By understanding the intricate interactions between environmental factors and pest dynamics, we aim to enhance pest management practices in leguminous crop production for improved efficiency and sustainability. A field experiment spanning three growing seasons (2021-2023) explored the link between meteorological parameters and A. fabae abundance in V. faba. Weekly field inspections documented aphid levels alongside concurrent meteorological data. Correlation and multiple linear regression were used to evaluate these relationships. Aphid infestation varied annually, appearing in 2021 and 2023 but not in 2022. Peak density aligned with specific growth stages, indicating temporal variability. In 2023, a significant surge of 1157.4% to 2126.0% compared to 2021 levels highlighted population dynamics in response to environmental factors. Negative correlations with total rainfall were consistent in both years, while positive correlations with maximum temperature and relative humidity were observed. Multiple linear regression attributed 67.1% to 99.9% of aphid abundance variance to the meteorological parameters, emphasizing their role in predicting aphid populations. Our study sheds light on the complex relationship between meteorological parameters and A. fabae dynamics, offering valuable insights into factors impacting aphid abundance in V. faba.

AB  - Understanding the diet of large carnivores in different ecosystems is important for their effective conservation. This study investigated the dietary composition of leopards (Panthera pardus fusca) in Gir forest (n = 135) and its surrounding multi-use land matrix (n = 50) using scat analysis. We employed frequency of occurrence (FO) and biomass consumption models to quantify the leopard diet and evaluated dietary niche breadth using Levin's index. Our results revealed significant differences in dietary patterns between the two ecological settings. Leopards in the Gir forest consumed 82% wild prey, while those in the multi-use land matrix consumed 53%. Domestic prey constituted 18% and 47% of the leopard diet in the Gir forest and the multi-use land matrix, respectively. Leopards in the Gir forest displayed a narrow dietary niche breadth (Levin's index = 0.39), whereas those in the multi-use land matrix exhibited a broader niche breadth (Levin's index = 0.70). These findings underscore the importance of wild ungulates in the diet of leopards, highlighting the importance of implementing effective conservation measures to safeguard these species. Moreover, this study bridges the knowledge gap concerning leopard dietary intake in two distinct ecological settings, providing valuable information for future comparisons and formulating conservation strategies for this species.

AB  - Introduction: Methoxychlor (MXC) is an organochlorine pesticide (OCP) that was formerly used worldwide as an insecticide against pests and mosquitoes. However, MXC is not biodegradable and has lipophilic characteristics; thus, it accumulates in organisms and affects reproductive function. MXC, as an estrogenic compound, promotes oxidative stress, induces oxidative stress damage to ovarian follicles, and causes miscarriages and stillbirths in females. In this research endeavor, our primary objective was to explore the ramifications of MXC regarding the developmental processes occurring during the initial stages of embryogenesis in pigs.Methods: In this study, we counted the blastocyst rate of early embryos cultured in vitro. We also examined the reactive oxygen species level, glutathione level, mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial copy number and ATP level in four-cell stage embryos. Finally, apoptosis and DNA damage in blastocyst cells, as well as pluripotency-related and apoptosis-related genes in blastocyst cells were detected. The above experiments were used to evaluate the changes of MXC damage on early parthenogenetic embryo development.Results and Discussion: The results showed that early embryos exposed to MXC had a significantly lower cleavage rate, blastocyst rate, hatching rate, and total cell count compared with the control group. It was also of note that MXC not only increased the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), but also decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta psi m) and mitochondrial copy number during the development of early embryos. In addition, after MXC treatment, blastocyst apoptosis and DNA damage were increased, decreased cell proliferation, and the expression of pluripotency-related genes SOX2, NANOG, and OCT4 was down-regulated, while the expression of apoptosis-related genes BAX/BCL-2 and Caspase9 was up-regulated. Our results clearly show that MXC can have deleterious effects on the developmental processes of early porcine embryos, establishing the toxicity of MXC to the reproductive system. In addition, the study of this toxic effect may lead to greater concern about pesticide residues in humans and the use of safer pesticides, thus potentially preventing physiological diseases caused by chemical exposure.

AB  - The aim of this pilot study was to assess the time-related changes in viable nasal bacteria concentrations among waste-incineration plant (WIP) workers compared to a group of office building (OB) workers outside the plant. In total, 20 volunteers participated in the study, including 14 WIP and 6 OB workers. WIP workers were divided into two sub-groups: supervisory staff (SVS) and maintenance and repair workers (MRW). Nasal swabs were collected before and after the morning work shift. Airborne bacteria were sampled with a six-stage impactor to assess the bioaerosol size distribution. The analysis showed that a significant, almost three-fold increase in nasal bacterial concentration was found only among WIP workers, and this referred mainly to anaerobic species. The load of anaerobic bacteria at the beginning of work was 12,988 CFU/mL, and after work shift 36,979 CFU/mL (p < 0.01). Significant increases in microbial concentrations was found only in the MRW subgroup, among non-smoking workers only. The results showed increased bacterial concentration in WIP nasal samples for as many as 12 bacterial species, including, e.g., Streptococcus constellatus, Peptostreptococcus spp., E. coli, and P. mirabilis. These preliminary data confirmed that the nasal swab method was helpful for assessment of the workers' real-time exposure to airborne bacteria.

AB  - Raspberry fruits are a valuable source of bioactive compounds. The study used the modification of the substrate (coconut fibre), consisting of the use of various organic and mineral additives, in the soilless cultivation of raspberries. The additives influenced the biosynthesis of bioactive compounds in the raspberry fruits by modifying the sorption properties and the abundance of the substrate. The influence of the additives on the content of polyphenols was determined as well as their profile (UPLC-MS), antioxidant potential (ABTS), vitamin C content, and the activity of selected enzymes that are markers of stress and resistance to abiotic factors. In the study, a significant effect of these additives was observed on the biosynthesis of polyphenols in raspberry fruit. The highest increase in the content of these compounds in relation to the control sample (substrate-100% coconut fibre), namely 37.7%, was recorded in the case of fruit produced on coconut substrate enriched with sheep wool. These fruits were also characterised by a significantly different profile of these compounds. These changes were caused by readily available ammonium nitrogen and free amino acids in the decomposition of proteins contained in the sheep wool. This was confirmed by the recorded content of chlorophyll SPAD in the plant leaves and the activity of selected enzymes, which proves a low level of stress and good condition of the plants.

AB  - Buffalo physiology intricately balances energy, profoundly influencing health, productivity, and reproduction. This study explores nuclear-mitochondrial crosstalk, revealing OXPHOS Complex I gene expression variations in buffalo tissues through high-throughput RNA sequencing. Unveiling tissue-specific disparities, the research elucidates the genomic landscape of crucial energy production genes, with broader implications for veterinary and agricultural progress. Post-slaughter, tissues from post-pubertal female buffaloes underwent meticulous processing and RNA extraction using the TRIzol method. RNA-Seq library preparation and IlluminaHiSeq 2500 sequencing were performed on QC-passed samples. Data underwent stringent filtration, mapping to the Bubalus bubalis genome using HISAT2. DESeq2 facilitated differential expression gene (DEG) analysis focusing on 57 Mitocarta 3-derived genes associated with OXPHOS complex I. Nuclear-encoded mitochondrial protein transcripts of OXPHOS complex 1 exhibited tissue-specific variations, with 51 genes expressing significantly across tissues. DEG analysis emphasized tissue-specific expression patterns, highlighting a balanced OXPHOS complex I subunit expression in the kidney vs. brain. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment showcased mitochondria-centric terms, revealing distinct proton motive force-driven mitochondrial ATP synthesis regulation. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses emphasized Thermogenesis and OXPHOS pathways, enriching our understanding of tissue-specific energy metabolism. Noteworthy up-regulation of NDUFB10 in the heart and kidney aligned with heightened metabolic activity. Brain-specific up-regulation of NDUFAF6 indicated a focus on mitochondrial function, while variations in NDUFA11 and ACAD9 underscored pivotal roles in the heart and kidney. GO and KEGG analyses highlighted tissue-specific mitochondrial ATP synthesis and NADH dehydrogenase processes, providing molecular insights into organ-specific metabolic demands and regulatory mechanisms. Our study unveils conserved and tissue-specific nuances in nuclear-encoded mitochondrial OXPHOS complex I genes, laying a foundation for understanding diverse energy demands and potential health implications.

AB  - Comprehensive analysis of triacylglycerol (TAG) regioisomers is extremely challenging, with many variables that can influence the results. Previously, we reported a novel algorithmic method for resolving regioisomers of complex mixtures of TAGs. In the current study, the TAG Analyzer software and its mass spectrometric fragmentation model were further developed and validated for a much wider range of TAGs. To demonstrate the method, we performed for the first time a comprehensive analysis of TAG regioisomers of bovine milk fat, a very important and one of the most complex TAG mixtures in nature containing FAs ranging from short to long carbon chains. This analysis method forms a solid basis for further investigation of TAG regioisomer profiles in various natural fats and oils, potentially aiding in the development of new and healthier foods and nutraceuticals with targeted lipid structures.

AB  - To fully unlock the potential of pigs as both agricultural species for animal-based protein food and biomedical models for human biology and disease, a comprehensive understanding of molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying various complex phenotypes in pigs and how the findings can be translated to other species, especially humans, are urgently needed. Here, within the Farm animal Genotype-Tissue Expression (FarmGTEx) project, we build the PigBiobank (http:////pigbiobank.farmgtex.org) to systematically investigate the relationships among genomic variants, regulatory elements, genes, molecular networks, tissues and complex traits in pigs. This first version of the PigBiobank curates 71 885 pigs with both genotypes and phenotypes from over 100 pig breeds worldwide, covering 264 distinct complex traits. The PigBiobank has the following functions: (i) imputed sequence-based genotype-phenotype associations via a standardized and uniform pipeline, (ii) molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying trait-associations via integrating multi-omics data, (iii) cross-species gene mapping of complex traits via transcriptome-wide association studies, and (iv) high-quality results display and visualization. The PigBiobank will be updated timely with the development of the FarmGTEx-PigGTEx project, serving as an open-access and easy-to-use resource for genetically and biologically dissecting complex traits in pigs and translating the findings to other species.

   This study aims to investigate the effects of guanidine acetic acid (GAA) on carcass traits, plasma biochemical parameters, tissue antioxidant capacity, and tissue-bound amino acid contents in finishing pigs. Seventy-two 140-day-old (body weight 86.59 +/- 1.16 kg) crossbred pigs (Duroc x Landrace x Large White) were randomly assigned into four treatments with six replicate pens and three pigs per pen, which were fed the basal diets supplemented with 0, 0.05%, 0.10%, or 0.15% GAA, respectively. The plasma glucose concentration decreased, and creatine kinase activity and levels of GAA and creatine increased with the dietary GAA concentration. GAA linearly improved creatine content in the longissimus thoracis muscle (LM) and heart. The activities of superoxide dismutase, total antioxidant capacity, and glutathione peroxidase increased linearly in tissue or/and plasma, while the contents of malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl decreased linearly. GAA improved the contents of multiple-bound amino acids (such as proline or isoleucine) in the myocardium and LM. In conclusion, GAA enhanced the plasma biochemical parameters, oxidative status, and bound amino acid profiles of the heart and LM in finishing pigs.

AB  - Simple Summary: A limited amount of work has been done on gamebirds in Lao PDR, primarily comprising wildlife bio-inventories, which include several species of gamebirds. Using camera-trap data, we describe the general biology and ecology of several species of gamebirds and assess species status in Namha National Protected Area in Luang Namtha Province, Laos. Three species of Hill Partridges were detected in low numbers. Three species of pheasants were active during daylight hours. There are slightly more females than males in local populations of Silver and Gray Peacock Pheasants. Occupancy for Silver Pheasant and Gray Peacock Pheasant is higher in rougher terrain, while it is lower near trekking trails for Red Junglefowl. In situations where our findings are not new, we compare and contrast our results with other studies. This is the first time that detailed research focusing on gamebirds has been done on-the-ground in Lao PDR. This information is vital for management guidelines, and to set forth conservation recommendations.
   Using camera-trap data, we describe the ecology and occupancy of several species of gamebirds while assessing associations at Namha National Protected Area (Lao People's Democratic Republic). We detected three species of Arborophila Partridges, albeit in low numbers. Red Junglefowl Gallus gallus show typical diurnal activity, and we provide a record of a male-female pair commensally associated with a boar Sus scrofa. Silver Pheasants Lophura nycthemera have sex ratios slightly favoring females, and are mostly solitary; we provide novel findings of male age structure and rectrix molt. Gray Peacock Pheasants Polyplectron bicalcaratum sex ratios also favor females; males are recorded displaying as early as late February, while daily activity is somewhat bimodal, and we provide novel findings of male age structure. Analysis of the association between occupancy and 14 environmental covariates indicated that Silver Pheasant and Gray Peacock-Pheasant were associated with rougher terrain, and Red Junglefowl had higher occupancy far from well-groomed trails used for tourism. We discuss our results by comparing and contrasting our findings with other studies, and consider implications for conservation in the region.

AB  - Glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3 beta) has a vital role in the regulation of many cellular processes. However, the role of GSK3 beta in muscle cell differentiation in sheep remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the function of GSK3 beta in skeletal muscle satellite cells (SMSCs) of sheep. An overexpression of GSK3 beta significantly inhibited myotube formation as well as the mRNA levels of myogenic genes (MyoD, MyoG, MyHC1, and MyHC2a) in sheep SMSCs. SB216763 treatment had a time-course effect on the phosphorylation levels of sheep GSK3 beta. In addition, reducing the activity of GSK3 beta lead to the promotion of sheep SMSCs differentiation as well as the mRNA levels of myogenic genes (MyoD, MyoG, MyHC1, and MyHC2a). This study illustrated the function of GSK3 beta to inhibit myogenesis in sheep SMSCs, which provided evidence for studying the mechanisms involved in the regulation of sheep SMSCs differentiation by GSK3 beta.

AB  - Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is a highly toxic fungal toxin that causes severe damage to animal intestines. Porcine betadefensin-2 (pBD-2) is a well-studied antimicrobial peptide in pigs that can protect animal intestines and improve productivity. This study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms of pBD-2 in alleviating AFB1-induced oxidative stress and intestinal mucosal damage using porcine intestinal epithelial cells (IPEC-J2 cells) and Kunming (KM) mice. The maximum destructive concentration of AFB1 for IPEC-J2 cells and the optimal therapeutic concentration of pBD-2 were determined by CCK-8 and RT-qPCR. We then investigated the oxidative stress and intestinal damage induced by AFB1 and the alleviating effect of pBD-2 by detecting changes of reactive oxygen species (ROS), inflammatory cytokines, tight junction proteins (TJPs) and mucin. Finally, the molecular mechanism of pBD-2 mitigates AFB1-induced oxidative stress and intestinal mucosal damage were explored by adding ROS and Erk1/2 pathway inhibitors to comparative analysis. In vivo, the therapeutic effect of pBD-2 on AFB1-induced intestinal damage was analyzed from aspects such as average daily gain (ADG), pathological damage, inflammation, and mucosal barrier in KM mice. The study found that low doses of pBD-2 promoted cell proliferation and prevented AFB1-induced cell death, and pBD-2 significantly restored the feed conversion rate and ADG of KM mice reduced by long-term exposed AFB1. Increasing the intracellular ROS and the expression and phosphorylation of Erk1/2, AFB1 promoted inflammation by altering inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6 , IL-8, , disrupted the mucosal barrier by interfering with Claudin-3, Occludin, and MUC2, while pBD-2 significantly reduced ROS and decreased the expression and phosphorylation of Erk1/2 to restored their expression to alleviate AFB1-induced oxidative stress and intestinal mucosal damage in IPEC-J2 cells and the small intestine of mice.

AB  - Pyrrolnitrin, a natural antifungal compound from Burkholderia sp. O33 was compared with the phenylpyrrole fungicides fludioxonil and fenpiclonil through metabolomic analysis of Botrytis cinerea. Phenylpyrrole fungicides are traditionally known to disrupt the high-osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway. However, recent studies suggest additional mechanisms for fludioxonil, including reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and mitochondrial dysfunction. ROS generation and membrane permeability assays showed that pyrrolnitrin induced the highest ROS accumulations, while phenylpyrrole fungicides induced both ROS production and increased membrane permeability. Metabolomic analysis revealed that pyrrolnitrin and phenylpyrrole fungicides inhibit key metabolic pathways, including the TCA cycle, amino acid metabolism, and nucleic acid metabolism, with consistent metabolite changes across these pathways. This study identifies mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic disruption as shared mechanisms of pyrrolnitrin and phenylpyrrole fungicides.

AB  - This study investigated the impact of an increased arginine (ARG) level in a boar diet on semen production, sperm quality, and seminal plasma proteome. Adult Nebraska Index Line boars were assigned to two groups, one receiving a control diet with 0.77% arginine (n = 4) and the other a high-arginine diet with 1.77% arginine (n = 5). Semen was collected twice a week over the whole experiment, including one week before, six weeks during, and six weeks after the supplementation. Parameters such as semen volume and concentration were assessed immediately after collection, alongside sperm motility and morphology. Centrifugation of raw semen samples yielded seminal plasma for a gel-based proteome analysis. The seminal plasma proteins were extracted, quantified, and separated via 2D gel electrophoresis, allowing protein identification through mass spectrometry. Data analysis involved two-way ANOVA for comparisons (p < 0.05). Results showed that arginine supplementation improved semen volume and total sperm counts, with averages of 21 +/- 3 doses in the control group versus 24 +/- 2 in the ARG group (p = 0.05). Although sperm motility and morphology remained unaffected (p > 0.05), dietary arginine upregulated ten proteins and downregulated two. In summary, increased dietary arginine did not significantly alter key parameters of semen output or sperm quality but significantly impacted seminal plasma proteome, warranting further research on sperm viability.

AB  - Atmospheric air cold plasma treatments (cold plasma; CP) have emerged as a promising technology in various fields, including medicine, agriculture, and environmental sciences. While CP treatment has been optimized in many fields, we lack empirical data on the efficiency and effectiveness of CP treatments in deterring insect herbivory, a recent development in CP application. Needless to say, by fine-tuning parameters such as plasma discharge method, exposure time, source gas, and input voltage, researchers can enhance the desired effects while minimizing any potential side effects. Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS) generated during CP treatments can potentially play a crucial role in enhancing plant defense mechanisms and inhibiting herbivore growth, as they have been associated with plant signaling pathways against insect herbivores. To understand the differential effectiveness of various CP treatments on plant and insect herbivore traits, soybean seeds (Glycine max) and sorghum-sudangrass seeds (Sorghum x drummondii) (sorghum) were treated under three different voltages and time exposures using two different plasma generation reactors: pin-to-plate and plasma jet. We then evaluated the effects of CP seed treatment on herbivory using two different lepidopteran pests: fall armyworm (FAW) (Spodoptera frugiperda) on sorghum-sudangrass and soybean looper (SBL) (Chrysodeixis includens) on soybean. The results showed that CP had significant positive effects on plant growth and development, alongside negative effects on herbivore growth and development. More prominently, the results revealed that the effect of CP varies significantly based on the reactor and has differential effects on soybean and sorghum. Collectively, these findings show the need for continuous optimization of CP treatments to fully harness their potential while ensuring their safe and effective application across different domains.

AB  - The study describes mammalian fauna from Barsuchiy Dol cave in the Southern Urals, Russia. The accumulation of faunal remains in the cave deposits occurred due to natural processes. The remains from layers 1-4 were disturbed by fossorial activities of badgers. The faunal assemblage from these layers contain mixed remains of Pleistocene and Holocene age. The faunal assemblage from the layer 5 was excavated from in situ deposits. The of taxonomic composition and representation of skeletal element indicate that bone remains were accumulated in the layer 5 as digging activities of a badger (Meles meles), and natural death of larger (Ursus kanivets) and smaller (Ursus rossicus) cave bears during hibernation. The mammalian fauna from Barsuchiy Dol included typical species of the mammoth complex, as well as the mole (Talpa europaea), desman (Desmana moschata), red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris), Malayan porcupine (Hystrix brachyura), forest dormouse (Dryomys nitedula), European mink (Mustela lutreola), European badger (M. meles), lynx (Lynx lynx), and Merck's rhinoceros (Stephanorhinus kirchbergensis). The remains of steppe (Ochotona, Spermophilus, Lagurus, Allocricetulus, Cricetulus and Eolagurus) and "tundra-steppe" (Lasiopodomys gregalis) species comprise about 50% of the small mammal fauna. The remains of relatively thermophilic (Dryomys, Hystrix), mesophilic (Cricetus) and "forest" (Sciurus, Apodemus, Clethrionomys, Microtus agrestis) species account for about 40% of the assemblage. The taxonomic composition and ecological structure of the fauna evidence interglacial conditions. The chronological position of the fauna was determined based on the analysis of the enamel differentiation quotient (SDQ) and the size of the m1 of the water vole (Arvicola spp.). The SDQ values in voles from layer 5 are close to the values observed in voles from Eastern European and Ural localities dated to the end of OIS6 and OIS5-2. The length of the tooth in voles from Barsuchiy Dol cave is similar to that in the voles from the OIS5-2 sites. Based on the data on evolutionary morphology of Arvicola and taxonomic composition of fossil assemblage, the fauna from layer 5 was dated to the OIS 5e (Mikulino, Tabulda, Streletsk, Kazantsevo, and Eemian) interglacial.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) on the expression of TGF-beta 1, cyclinD1, and CDK4 in fibroblasts of miniature pig bile duct scar model cultured in vitro. The bile duct scar fibroblasts were replicated by incision and anastomosis in miniature pigs and bile duct scar fibroblasts were obtained. After cell identification, the bile duct scar fibroblasts were given different concentrations of 5-FU (0, 0.001, 0.01, and 0.1 mmol/L). After 48 h of intervention, CCK-8 method was used to detect the cell proliferation level of each group; Western blot was used to detect the expression of TGF-beta 1, cyclinD1, and CDK4 protein in each group of cells; and real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to detect the expression levels of TGF-beta 1, cyclinD1, and CDK4 mRNA in each group of cells. The results showed that after 5-FU intervention, the proliferation of bile duct scar fibroblasts was inhibited, and the expressions of TGF-beta 1, cyclinD1, CDK4 mRNA and protein in the cells were down-regulated (P<0.05), showing concentration-dependence. In conclusion, 5-FU may have a role in inhibiting bile duct scars. One of the mechanisms may be related to its ability to inhibit the expression of TGF-beta 1, cyclinD1, and CDK4 in bile duct scar fibroblasts.

AB  - Circular RNAs (circRNAs), which exert critical functions in the regulation of transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene expression, are found in mammalian cells but their functions in mammalian preimplantation embryo development remain poorly understood. Here, we showed that circKDM5B mediated miRNA-128 (miR-128) to regulate porcine early embryo development. We screened circRNAs potentially expressed in porcine embryos through an integrated analysis of sequencing data from mouse and human embryos, as well as porcine oocytes. An authentic circRNA originating from histone demethylase KDM5B (referred to as circKDM5B) was abundantly expressed in porcine embryos. Functional studies revealed that circKDM5B knockdown not only significantly reduced blastocyst formation but also decreased the number of total cells and trophectoderm (TE) cells. Moreover, the knockdown of circKDM5B resulted in the disturbance of tight junction assembly and impaired paracellular sealing within the TE epithelium. Mechanistically, miR-128 inhibitor injection could rescue the early development of circKDM5B knockdown embryos. Taken together, the findings revealed that circKDM5B functions as a miR-128 sponge, thereby facilitating early embryonic development in pigs through the modulation of gene expression linked to tight junction assembly.

AB  - Luzhong mutton sheep, a new breed of sheep used for meat production, are characterized by a fast growth rate, high adaptability, and roughage tolerance. The aim of this study was to estimate the genetic parameters and analyze the genetic trends of early growth traits in Luzhong mutton sheep using different animal models, and Model 4 was identified as the best model. In this study, the greater heritability of weaning weight and higher genetic correlation with key production traits indicated that weaning weight could be used as a selection criterion for late weight traits. In addition, the results of this study indicated that maternal effects had a great influence on early growth traits in Luzhong mutton sheep.
   In this study, six different animal models were fitted, and the constrained maximum likelihood method was used to assess the genetic parameters and genetic trends of early growth traits in Luzhong mutton sheep. The experimental data of this study included the newborn weight (BWT, N = 2464), weaning weight (WWT, N = 2923), weight at 6 months of age (6WT, N = 2428), average daily weight gain from birth to weaning (ADG1, N = 2424), and average daily weight gain from weaning to 6 months of age (ADG2, N = 1836) in Luzhong mutton sheep (2015 similar to 2019). The best model for the genetic parameters of the five traits in Luzhong mutton sheep was identified as Model 4 using the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and likelihood ratio test (LRT) methods, in which the estimated values of direct heritability for the BWT, WWT, 6WT, ADG1, and ADG2 were 0.156 +/- 0.057, 0.547 +/- 0.031, 0.653 +/- 0.031, 0.531 +/- 0.035, and 0.052 +/- 0.046, respectively, and the values for maternal heritability were 0.201 +/- 0.100, 0.280 +/- 0.047, 0.197 +/- 0.053, 0.275 +/- 0.052, and 0.081 +/- 0.092, respectively. The genetic correlation between the ADG2 and WWT was negative, and the genetic and phenotypic correlations among the remaining traits were positive. In this study, maternal effects had a more significant influence on early growth traits in Luzhong mutton sheep. In conclusion, to effectively improve the accuracy of genetic parameter estimation, maternal effects must be fully considered to ensure more accurate and better breeding planning.

AB  - The quality of goat milk can be affected by mesophilic aerobic and facultatively anaerobic microorganisms (MAFAnM), intestinal bacteria, psychrotrophic, some pathogenic microorganisms, fungi, etc. Traditional microbiological methods, which are used to determine the safety of milk, do not provide an opportunity to obtain an instant result, require the preparation of nutrient media and glassware, which takes up work time and is energy-consuming. We have carried out studies of goat milk by classical (using conventional and selective nutrient media) and alternative modern (using test plates, which are widely used to control microbiological contamination in the food industry) methods. As a result of the conducted research, it was established that the bacterial contamination of goat milk was within the permissible limits. There were no significant differences in the results of using the test plates. According to the classical method, the average indicators of the number of mesophilic aerobic and facultatively anaerobic microorganisms were 4.97 f 0.14 lg CFU/mL, according to the alternative method - 4.86 f 0.13 lg CFU/mL. Escherichia coli was isolated in four samples (with an average concentration of microorganisms of 1.86 f 0.62 lg CFU/mL), in the same samples Enterobacter spp. in the amount of 1.77 f 0.61 lg CFU/mL. In three samples, the presence ofProteusspp. Proteus spp. with average concentration values of 2.19 f 0.15 lg CFU/mL. Using an alternative method, contamination of milk with Escherichia coli (1.53 f 0.33 lg CFU/mL) was detected in five samples, coliform bacteria were isolated in four samples (1.49 f 0.50 lg CFU/mL). Staphylococcus aureus was not detected by any of the methods, but other representatives of the genus Staphylococcus were detected in all samples by both classical and alternative methods (2.48 f 0.05 and 3.01 f 0.07 lg CFU/mL). Using the classic method, it was established that two samples were positive for Enterococcus spp. (2.46 f 0.08 lg CFU/mL), Bacillus spp. were isolated in six samples (1.70 f 0.09 lg CFU/mL), in three - Clostridium spp. (1.66 f 0.06 lg CFU/mL), in all six samples psychrotrophic bacteria (2.09 f 0.26 lg CFU/mL) and yeast (2.41 f 0.24 lg CFU/mL), four of the samples contained single colonies of mold fungi of the genus Aspergillus . Pathogens Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella spp. not found. It will be promising to study the dependence of the milk microbiome on environmental factors, as well as the influence of the milk microbiota on the course of technological processes, quality and safety indicators during the production of goat cheese or other dairy products.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Sheep-induced pluripotent stem cells (siPSCs) have low reprogramming efficiency, thereby hampering their use in biotechnology and agriculture. Several studies have shown that some microRNAs play an important role in promoting somatic reprogramming in mouse and human. In this study, we investigated the effect of miR-200c-141 on somatic reprogramming in sheep and explored the mechanism of promoting the reprogramming. Methods and Results: The lentivirus system driven by tetracycline (TET)-on carrying Oct4, Sox2, c-Myc, Klf4, Nanog, Lin28, hTERT, and SV40LT (OSKMNLST) could reprogram sheep kidney cells into pluripotent cells. Overexpression of miR-200c-141 in combination with OSKMNLST could significantly improve the efficiency of sheep iPSC generation (p<0.01). Sheep iPSCs derived from miR-200c-141 showed embryonic stem cell (ESC)-like pluripotent properties, were positive for alkaline phosphatase and some pluripotent markers by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunofluorescence, and were able to differentiate into three germ layers in vitro. Oar-miR-200c was transfected into HEK293FT cells and was able to target the zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) 3'UTR using dual luciferase reporting analysis. Overexpression of oar-miR-200c in SKCs significantly reduced the expression of ZEB1, but increased the expression of E-cadherin by qRT-PCR and western blotting analysis. Conclusions: These results suggest that miR-200c-141 can promote the reprogramming of sheep somatic cells to iPSCs, and oar-miR-200c targeted ZEB1 3'UTR, significantly decreased expression of ZEB1, and increased expression of E-cadherin. Oar-miR-200c may improve the MET process by affecting the TGF-beta signaling pathway, thus improving the efficiency of somatic cell reprogramming in sheep.

Elamipretide (ELAM) improves mitochondrial function. We hypothesized that MetS blunts kidney autophagy, which ELAM would restore. Domestic pigs were fed a control or MetS-inducing diet for 16 weeks. During the 4 last weeks, MetS pigs received subcutaneous injections of ELAM (0.1 mg/kg/day, MetS + ELAM) or vehicle (MetS), and kidneys were then harvested to measure protein expression of autophagy mediators and apoptosis. Systemic and renal venous levels of inflammatory cytokines were measured to calculate renal release. The function of isolated mitochondria was assessed by oxidative stress, energy production, and pro-apoptotic activity. MetS slightly downregulated renal expression of autophagy mediators including p62, ATG5-12, mTOR, and AMPK vs. control. Increased mitochondrial H2O2 production accompanied decreased ATP production, elevated apoptosis, and renal fibrosis. In MetS + ELAM, mito-protection restored autophagic protein expression, improved mitochondrial energetics, and blunted renal cytokine release and fibrosis. In vitro, mitoprotection restored mitochondrial membrane potential and reduced oxidative stress in injured proximal tubular epithelial cells. Our study suggests that swine MetS mildly affects renal autophagy, possibly secondary to mitochondrial damage, and may contribute to kidney structural damage in MetS.

AB  - Simple Summary Pig production leads to high levels of ammonia emissions, which in turn causes environmental pollution. This paper, therefore, looks at the possibilities for reducing ammonia emissions. Reducing ammonia precursors in diets and acidifying the urine and manure pH by acidifying diets make it possible to reduce the ammonia emissions from pig production facilities. The present study tested the impact of decreased crude protein or acidifying diets on urine and manure composition and ammonia emissions from growing and finishing pig houses. We found that decreasing dietary crude protein levels reduced the ammonia emissions from the floor as well as from the pig houses, whereas acidifying diets failed to reduce ammonia emissions from the floor and the pig houses. Reducing dietary crude protein is, therefore, a positive solution to reduce ammonia emissions from pig houses. This study aimed to investigate the impact of decreased crude protein (CP) levels (by 2% units) or acidifying diets (by adding 10 g benzoic acid/kg diet in combination with replacing a part of CaCO3 by about 10 g Ca-formate/kg diet) on urine, feces and manure composition and ammonia emissions from growing and finishing pig houses. Yorkshire x F1(Landrace x Yorkshire) pigs (n = 576) with an initial body weight of 24.9 +/- 3.4 kg were randomly allocated to four treatments of (i) a control diet with normal protein content and no acidifying components added; (ii) a diet with 2% units CP reduction; (iii) a diet with an acidifying effect on the manure; (iv) or a diet consisting of a combination of diet (ii) and (iii). Pigs were housed in four mechanically ventilated and temperature-controlled rooms. Results showed that decreasing the dietary CP levels by 2% units reduced the ammonia emission from the floor by 46% (p = 0.06) and from the pig house by 31% (p = 0.08). Decreased CP diets reduced the total N in feces and in manure and NH4-N in the manure, as well as the ammonia concentration at 1 cm and 10 cm above the manure surface (p < 0.05). However, acidifying diets failed to reduce ammonia emissions from the floor and the pig house (p > 0.05). Reducing dietary crude protein is, therefore, a solution to reducing ammonia emissions from pig houses.

AB  - Background Musk, secreted by the musk gland of adult male musk-secreting mammals, holds significant pharmaceutical and cosmetic potential. However, understanding the molecular mechanisms of musk secretion remains limited, largely due to the lack of comprehensive multiomics analyses and available platforms for relevant species, such as muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus Linnaeus) and Chinese forest musk deer (Moschus berezovskii Flerov).Results We generated chromosome-level genome assemblies for the 2 species of muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus Linnaeus) and musk deer (Moschus berezovskii Flerov), along with 168 transcriptomes from various muskrat tissues. Comparative analysis with 11 other vertebrate genomes revealed genes and amino acid sites with signs of adaptive convergent evolution, primarily linked to lipid metabolism, cell cycle regulation, protein binding, and immunity. Single-cell RNA sequencing in muskrat musk glands identified increased acinar/glandular epithelial cells during secretion, highlighting the role of lipometabolism in gland development and evolution. Additionally, we developed MuskDB (http://muskdb.cn/home/), a freely accessible multiomics database platform for musk-secreting mammals.Conclusions The study concludes that the evolution of musk secretion in muskrats and musk deer is likely driven by lipid metabolism and cell specialization. This underscores the complexity of the musk gland and calls for further investigation into musk secretion-specific genetic variants.

AB  - 3-methylcholanthrene (3-MC) is a highly toxic environmental pollutant that impairs animal health. 3-MC exposure can cause abnormal spermatogenesis and ovarian dysfunction. However, the effects of 3-MC exposure on oocyte maturation and embryo development remain unclear. This study revealed the toxic effects of 3-MC exposure on oocyte maturation and embryo development. 3-MC with different concentrations of 0, 25, 50, and 100 mu M was applied for in vitro maturation of porcine oocytes. The results showed that 100 mu M 3-MC significantly inhibited cumulus expansion and the first polar body extrusion. The rates of cleavage and blastocyst of embryos derived from 3-MC-exposed oocytes were significantly lower than those in the control group. Additionally, the rates of spindle abnormalities and chromosomal misalignments were higher than those in the control group. Furthermore, 3-MC exposure not only decreased the levels of mitochondria, cortical granules (CGs), and acetylated alpha-Tubulin, but also increased the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), DNA damage, and apoptosis. The expression of cumulus expansion and apoptosis-related genes was abnormal in 3-MC-exposed oocytes. In conclusion, 3-MC exposure disrupted the nuclear and cytoplasmic maturation of porcine oocytes through oxidative stress.

AB  - It is commonly acknowledged that memory is substantially improved when learning is distributed over time, an effect called the "spacing effect". So far it has not been studied how spaced learning affects the neuronal ensembles presumably underlying memory. In the present study, we investigate whether trial spacing increases the stability or size of neuronal ensembles. Mice were trained in the "everyday memory"task, an appetitive, naturalistic, delayed matching-to-place task. Spacing trials by 60 min produced more robust memories than training with shorter or longer intervals. c-Fos labeling and chemogenetic inactivation established the involvement of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) in successful memory storage. In vivo calcium imaging of excitatory dmPFC neurons revealed that longer trial spacing increased the similarity of the population activity pattern on subsequent encoding trials and upon retrieval. Conversely, trial spacing did not affect the size of the total neuronal ensemble or the size of subpopulations dedicated to specific task-related behaviors and events. Thus, spaced learning promotes reactivation of prefrontal neuronal ensembles processing episodic-like memories.

AB  - The geographic ranges of forensically informative taxa on decomposing remains vary across regions. To determine which calliphorid flies would be expected to occur in Minnesota and the upper Midwest, individual freshly killed pig carcasses (Sus scrofa L.) were placed in the field in St. Paul, MN, at monthly intervals from May to October 2017 and May to September 2018. Aerial nets, forceps, and pitfall traps were used to collect and preserve associated adult and immature insects. Sixty-four forensically informative insect taxa were recorded, representing three insect orders and 14 families. Ten informative calliphorid species were recorded on carcasses, adding four new Minnesota records. Comparison of species lists from 26 human forensic cases indicated agreement between the two lists, except for Lucille coeruleiviridis Macquart, Calliphora vomitoria (L.), and Cynomya cadaverina Robineau-Desvoidy, which occurred on pig carcasses but not human remains, and Calliphora livida Hall, which occurred on human remains, but not carcasses.The composite fauna list from cadavers agreed largely with the 2-yr list from pig carcasses.

AB  - Atg15 (autophagy-related 15) is a vacuolar phospholipase essential for the degradation of cytoplasm-to -vac-uole targeting (Cvt) bodies and autophagic bodies, hereinafter referred to as intravacuolar/intralysosomal autophagic compartments (IACs), but it remains unknown if Atg15 directly disrupts IAC membranes. Here, we show that the recombinant Chaetomium thermophilum Atg15 lipase domain (CtAtg15(73-475)) possesses phospholipase activity. The activity of CtAtg15(73-475) was markedly elevated by limited digestion. We in-serted the human rhinovirus 3C protease recognition sequence and found that cleavage between S159 and V160 was important to activate CtAtg15(73-475). Our molecular dynamics simulation suggested that the cleavage facilitated conformational change around the active center of CtAtg15, resulting in an exposed state. We confirmed that CtAtg15 could disintegrate S. cerevisiae IAC in vivo. Further, both mitochondria and IAC of S. cerevisiae were disintegrated by CtAtg15. This study suggests Atg15 plays a role in disrupting any organelle membranes delivered to vacuoles by autophagy.

AB  - Background: Pig islets have the potential to address the limited supply of human islets available for transplantation. However, the knowledge of the biology of pig islets is currently limited. Thus, this study evaluated the molecules involved in cell-to-cell adhesion and insulin secretion pathways during the in vitro development of neonatal pig islets to understand the tissue we hope to use as a possible solution to the shortage of human islets for transplantation. Methods: Through RT-qPCR, immunoassays, and assessments of islet function, we explored the expression of E-cadherin and its correlation with the molecules involved in the insulin secretion pathway including GTPase, RAC1, and the membrane fusion protein SNAP25 during neonatal pig islet development. Results: Despite no significant difference observed in gross morphology and viability, as well as variable expression of RAC1, insulin, and SNAP25 in islets from 1-, 3-, and 7-day-old neonatal pigs, there was an apparent trend towards improved function in islets obtained from 3- and 7-day-old pigs compared with 1-day-old pigs. In the presence of 30 mM KCl, the amount of insulin secreted by islets from 3- and 7-day-old pigs but not from 1-day-old pigs was increased. Disruption of E-cadherin interactions with monoclonal antibodies resulted in decreased insulin secretion capacity of islets from 3-day old pigs. Conclusions: Our results show that blocking E-cadherin interactions with monoclonal antibodies resulted in disrupted peri-islet capsule and impaired islet insulin secretion under high glucose conditions. Thus, E-cadherin is important in the in vitro postnatal development and function of pig islets.

AB  - Mismatches between highly-standardized laboratory predatory assays and more realistic environmental conditions may lead to different outcomes. Understanding rodents' natural responses to predator scents is important. Thus, field studies on the same and related species are essential to corroborate laboratory findings to better understand the contexts and motivational drives that affect laboratory responses to predator scents. However, there are too few field assays to enable researchers to study factors that influence these responses in genetically variable populations of wild rodents. Therefore, we placed laboratory-style chambers and remote-sensing devices near multiple colonies of two species of wild mice (Apodemus agrarius and Apodemus flavicollis) to test dual-motivational drives (appetitive and aversive) in a 'familiar', yet natural environment. A highly-palatable food reward was offered daily alongside scents from coyotes, lions, rabbits, and both wet and dry controls. In all but two instances (n = 264), animals entered chambers and remained inside for several minutes. Animals initiated flight twice, but they never froze. Rather, they visited chambers more often and stayed inside longer when predatory scents were deployed. The total time spent inside was highest for lion urine (380% longer than the dry control), followed by coyote scent (75% longer), dry control and lastly, herbivore scents (no difference). Once inside the chamber, animals spent more time physically interacting with predatory scents than the herbivore scent or controls. Our findings support the common assumption that rodents fail to respond as overtly to predatory scents in the field compared to what has been observed in the laboratory, possibly due to their varying motivational levels to obtain food. More time spent interacting with scents in the field was likely a function of 'predator inspection' (risk assessment) once subjects were in a presumed safe enclosure. We conclude this sort of chamber assay can be useful in understanding the contexts and motivational drives inherent to field studies, and may help interpret laboratory results. Our results also suggest more attention should be given to subtle behaviors such as scent inspection in order to better understand how, and when, environmental stimuli evoke fear in rodents.

AB  - In this report, different handling conditions at slaughterhouse were studied to assess changes in salivary biomarkers. For this purpose, finishing pigs were divided into two groups, one in which handling was improved to minimize stress (Group A, n = 24, transported and stabled at the slaughterhouse at low density without mixing with unfamiliar animals throughout the whole process) and another one in which animals had a more stressful handling process (Group B, n = 24, transported and stabled at high density with unfamiliar animals). Saliva samples were taken the day before transport to the slaughterhouse at 8:00 a.m. (B0) and 12:00 a.m. (B4), and the day of slaughter just after unloading animals at the slaughterhouse at approximately 8:00 a.m. (S0) and after 4 h of lairage at approximately 12:00 a.m. (S4). Group B showed significantly higher cortisol, total esterase activity, oxytocin, adenosine deaminase and haptoglobin levels than the Group A at both S0 and S4 sampling times, and higher levels of calprotectin and creatine kinase at S4 sampling time. This report indicates that differences in the way in which the pigs are handled at the slaughterhouse can lead to changes in salivary biomarkers and opens the possibility of the use of biomarker at slaughter to monitor handling conditions.

AB  - Although sheep are commonly transported long distances, and sheep welfare during transport is a topic of research and policy discussion, the subject of their fatigue during transport has been under-researched. The current qualitative study, focused on the EU and UK, aimed to critically analyse stakeholder views on issues relating to sheep fatigue, including behavioural indications of fatigue, the interplay between fatigue and other factors, and the practicalities of identifying fatigue in commercial transport conditions. Insight into stakeholder perceptions of these issues could contribute to the body of knowledge regarding sheep fatigue during transport, potentially playing a part in future efforts to improve fatigue understanding and detection. Eighteen experts from different stakeholder groups were interviewed. Reflexive thematic analysis of interview data yielded four themes and three sub-themes. The first theme, "Let's anthropomorphise it a little bit", underscores the pervasiveness of anthropomorphism and suggests using it in a conscious and deliberate way to drive stakeholder engagement and policy change. The second theme, "We think that they're like we are and they're not", cautions against wholesale transfer of human experiences to animals. The third theme, 'See the whole animal', advocates using Qualitative Behaviour Analysis (QBA), proven reliable in other contexts, to deepen and enrich our current understanding of fatigue. The fourth theme, 'Fatigue "never comes up"', highlights the fact that fatigue is rarely if ever discussed in the context of sheep transport. These themes suggest several avenues for future research, including developing QBA-based assessments for fatigue to improve welfare during transport.

AB  - Barbarea, winter-cress, is a genus of 29 species in Brassicaceae, the mustard family, which has emerged as a model for evolution of plant defence and specialised metabolites. Notably, some Barbarea species have evolved the ability to produce triterpenoid saponins as the only ones in Brassicaceae, some of which make plants resistant to important herbivores. Resistance has, however, been lost in a distinct group of plants within B. vulgaris ssp. arcuata, which is genetically strongly diverged from other B. vulgaris plants. This divergence is not reflected present in taxonomy. Thus, a phylogeny is needed to understand evolution and defence in Barbarea. Here, we analysed the nuclear ITS and the plastid matK, ndhF, rps16, and psbA-trnH DNA regions from seven out of 29 Barbarea species, 57 accessions of B. vulgaris, 10 accessions of other Barbarea species, and eight outgroup species, in addition to sequences available from GenBank. All Barbarea species formed a highly supported monophyletic group, separated from sister genera. Several clades seem to have radiated within the genus with no simple branching pattern, and discordant nuclear and plastid DNA phylogenies indicate reticulate evolution and chloroplast capture. One of the complex patterns may have resulted from chloroplast capture of a non-Nordic Barbarea species not included in the study. Two pairs of species were almost identical, B. australis and B. grayi, and B. orthoceras and B. stricta. Despite hybridization, chloroplast capture, and incongruence among the plastid and nuclear DNA data, the high level of intraspecific diversity, coupled with lineage specificity, lead us to recognize three groups of Barbarea vulgaris: G-type (glabrous) and P-type (pubescent) individuals of the current B. vulgaris ssp. arcuata as two distinct groups and the current B. vulgaris ssp. vulgaris as the third. Despite the high molecular diversity below species level, the evolutionary history of the saponin-based resistance remains unsettled due to unresolved basal branching.

AB  - Tomato, a globally significant crop, faces continuous threats from pests and pathogens, necessitating alternative approaches to reduce chemical inputs. Beneficial soil microbes, such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR), offer promising solutions by enhancing plant growth and pest tolerance. However, domestication may have weakened tomatoes' interactions with these microbes, potentially compromising their innate immunity, a hypothesis that remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we examined the effects of AMF and PGPR inoculation on growth, herbivory resistance, and metabolic responses in the domesticated Solanum lycopersicum 'Moneymaker' and three wild tomato relatives. Our findings reveal that microbial inoculation significantly influences both domesticated and wild tomatoes, with PGPR generally enhancing and AMF reducing plant growth across species. Using targeted and untargeted metabolomics, we found that soil microbes substantially alter plant chemistry above- and belowground in a species-specific manner. Notably, herbivore responses were more affected by AMF presence than by tomato species. These results highlight that while domestication has profoundly shaped tomato traits, microbial interactions can modulate these phenotypes. Thus, selecting microbial strains best suited to modern cultivars is crucial for optimizing plant growth and resilience against pests.

AB  - There have been various environmental issues in the treatment and resource utilisation of solid waste of livestock and poultry industry in Gansu Province. Thus, in this study, manure of cattle, pig, and chicken from farms near the Lanzhou University of Technology in Lanzhou City, Gansu Province were selected as raw materials for composting using 10 % corn stalk as a leavening agent for aerobic static composting. This study focused on bacterial, fungal, and actinomycetes community succession during livestock manure composting and the underlying microbial degradation mechanism. The results demonstrated that during livestock manure composting, the number of the above-mentioned types of microbes was all positively correlated with the temperature of the compost piles. In the initial stage of composting, the number of microbes increased as the temperature increased, and reached the peaks at the highest temperature, after which, their numbers decreased with the decrease in temperature. At the end of composting, in the cattle, pig, and chicken manure compost piles, the number of bacteria were respectively (3.1 +/- 1.0) center dot 10(9) CFU center dot g(-1) d.w., (4.4 +/- 1.0) center dot 10(9) CFU center dot g(-1) d.w. and (6.7 +/- 1.8) center dot 10(9) CFU center dot g(-1) d.w., respectively, those of fungi were (8.6 +/- 1.2) center dot 10(4) CFU center dot g(-1) d.w., (7.2 +/- 1.6) center dot 10(4) CFU center dot g-(1) d.w. and (8.0 +/- 2.8) center dot 10(4) CFU center dot g(-1) d.w., respectively, while those of actinomycetes were (8.8 +/- 2.2) center dot 10(6) CFU center dot g(-1) d.w., (9.5 +/- 2.1) center dot 10(6) CFU center dot g(-1) d.w. and (6.32 +/- 0.98) center dot 10(6) CFU center dot g(-1) d.w., respectively.

AB  - Abies nebrodensis (Lojac.) Mattei is an endemic species of the north-west of Sicily located in an 84 ha area in the Madonie Regional park. The current population is limited to 30 relic adult trees and a fluctuating number of juveniles of natural regeneration. The species is defined as "Critically Endangered" in the Italian list of threatened plants and is classified as CR-D in the 2000 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. This article reports the key action undertaken by the LIFE4FIR project aimed at preserving A. nebrodensis, and the results obtained so far in three years of activity. OpenArrays SNPs genotyping revealed a high rate of inbreeding in the natural population and that the adult trees are genetically related. Controlled cross-pollination was consequently performed to increase the genetic variability of the progeny. Outbred offspring are currently being grown in the nursery. Reforestation has been planned by using 4000 selected outbred seedlings in 10 areas within Madonie Park to create re-diffusion cores. Support and protection of the relic population have been implemented through regular phytosanitary surveys, as well as new fencing and video surveillance systems against grazing and wild herbivores. A seedbank and cryobank for the long-term germplasm conservation have been established.

AB  - KIFC1 is a motor protein of the Kinesin family and it is involved in spindle apparatus assembly, chromosome arrangement, and microfilament-mediated biological processes in mitosis. However, the specific function of KIFC1 in pig oocytes remains unclear. Here, in order to explore the function of KIFC1 in porcine oocytes, the AZ82 inhibitor was used to inhibit the activity of KIFC1. Our results showed when KIFC1 was inhibited, the polar body extrusion rate was obviously decreased, indicating that KIFC1 plays a crucial role in porcine oocytes. We next measured the spindle structure and chromosome arrangement via immunofluorescent staining and found both the rates of abnormal spindle and chromosome disorder increased significantly. By further analyzing the causes of the abnormal spindle, we found the acetylation of tubulin was disrupted. In addition, we also found the spindle position was impaired after KIFC1 inhibition, declaring the spindle migration was affected. Further analysis found cortex actin decreased and cytoplasmic actin increased after KIFC1 inhibition. In summary, we found that KIFC1 played a critical role in porcine oocytes maturation by controlling spindle apparatus via mediating the acetylation of microtubule and regulating the spindle migration via affecting actin dynamics.

TI  - A sheep pangenome reveals the spectrum of structural variations and their effects on tail phenotypes
T2  - GENOME RESEARCH

KW  - GENE
AB  - Structural variations (SVs) are a major contributor to genetic diversity and phenotypic variations, but their prevalence and functions in domestic animals are largely unexplored. Here we generated high-quality genome assemblies for 15 individuals from genetically diverse sheep breeds using Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) high-fidelity sequencing, discovering 130.3 Mb nonreference sequences, from which 588 genes were annotated. A total of 149,158 biallelic insertions/deletions, 6531 divergent alleles, and 14,707 multiallelic variations with precise breakpoints were discovered. The SV spectrum is characterized by an excess of derived insertions compared to deletions (94,422 vs. 33,571), suggesting recent active LINE expansions in sheep. Nearly half of the SVs display low to moderate linkage disequilibrium with surrounding single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and most SVs cannot be tagged by SNP probes from the widely used ovine 50K SNP chip. We identified 865 population-stratified SVs including 122 SVs possibly derived in the domestication process among 690 individuals from sheep breeds worldwide. A novel 168-bp insertion in the 5 ' untranslated region (5 ' UTR) of HOXB13 is found at high frequency in long-tailed sheep. Further genome-wide association study and gene expression analyses suggest that this mutation is causative for the long-tail trait. In summary, we have developed a panel of high-quality de novo assemblies and present a catalog of structural variations in sheep. Our data capture abundant candidate functional variations that were previously unexplored and provide a fundamental resource for understanding trait biology in sheep.

AB  - Kiwifruit (KF) fiber, a mixture of soluble and insoluble fibers, elicits mucosal changes in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). This study aimed to define the nature of these changes in mucosal features throughout the GIT of the growing pig in response to semi-synthetic iso-fiber diets containing cellulose (CEL, low GIT luminal functionality) as the sole fiber source (4.5%), or diets where half of the CEL was replaced by either PSY fiber (PSY husk, high GIT luminal functionality) or KF fiber (consumed as intact fruit). Entire male growing pigs (n = 24, 21 kg bodyweight) received the three diets (n = 8) for 42 d. GIT tissues, digesta, and feces were sampled. The partial replacement of CEL increased (P <= 0.05) the ileal (KF 22% and PSY 33%) and colonic (PSY 86%) mucus layer thickness, whereas it decreased the rectal crypt depth (KF -26%), and small intestinal (duodenum to ileum) villus length (PSY -17%). The number of duodenal goblet cells was 77% higher (P <= 0.05) for KF than CEL. Pigs fed the KF-containing diet had greater (P <= 0.05) apparent ileal organic matter digestibility and apparent total tract organic matter digestibility compared with CEL, but the lowest amount of fermented organic matter in the large intestine. In conclusion, partial substitution of CEL with PSY or KF at a constant, practically-relevant dietary fiber intake, affected several measures of GIT functionality with effects being specific to the added fiber.

AB  - Zearalenone (ZEA) and deoxynivalenol (DON) are two common mycotoxins produced by the genus Fusarium and have potential immunotoxic effects that may lead to a weak immune response against bacterial infections. Listeria monocytogenes (L. monocytogenes), a food-borne pathogenic microorganism ubiquitous in the environment, actively multiplies in the liver, where hepatocytes are capable of resistance through mediated innate immune responses. At present, it is not clear if ZEA and DON affect hepatocyte immune responses to L. monocytogenes infection or the mechanisms involved. Therefore, in this study, in vivo and in vitro models were used to investigate the effects of ZEA and DON on the innate immune responses of hepatocytes and related molecules after L. monocytogenes infection. In vivo studies revealed that ZEA and DON inhibited the toll-like receptors 2 (TLR2)/nuclear factor kappa-B (NF kappa B) pathway in the liver tissue of L. monocytogenes-infected mice, downregulating the expression levels of Nitric oxide (NO), in the liver and repressing the immune response. In addition, ZEA and DON inhibited Lipoteichoic acid (LTA)-induced expression of TLR2 and myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) in Buffalo Rat Liver (BRL 3A) cells in vitro, downregulating the TLR2/NF kappa B signaling pathway and resulting in the decreased expression levels of NO, causing immunosuppressive effects. In summary, ZEA and DON can negatively regulate NO levels through TLR2/NF kappa B, inhibiting the innate immune responses of the liver, and aggravate L. monocytogenes infections in mouse livers.

AB  - The hippocampus (HPC) may compete with other memory systems when establishing a representation, a process termed overshadowing. However, this overshadowing may be mitigated by repeated learning episodes, making a memory resistant to post-training hippocampal damage. In the current study, we examined this overshadowing process for a hippocampal-dependent visual discrimination memory in rats. In Experiment 1, male rats were trained to criterion (80% accuracy on two consecutive days) on a visual discrimination and then given 50 additional trials distributed over 5 days or 10 weeks. Regardless of this additional learning, extensive damage to the HPC caused retrograde amnesia for the visual discrimination, suggesting that the memory remained hippocampal-dependent. In Experiment 2, rats received hippocampal damage before learning and required approximately twice as many trials to acquire the visual discrimination as control rats, suggesting that, when the overshadowing or competition is removed, the non-hippocampal memory systems only slowly acquires the discrimination. In Experiment 3, increasing the additional learning beyond criterion by 230 trials, the amount needed in Experiment 2 to train the non-hippocampal systems in absence of competition, successfully prevented the retrograde amnesic effects of post-training hippocampal damage. Combined, the findings suggest that a visual discrimination memory trace can be strengthened in non-hippocampal systems with overtraining and become independent of the HPC.

   The present study aimed to investigate the success rate of fences and classify the behavioural responses of Korean water deer (Hydropotes inermis argyropus) to different fence heights. The dominant behaviours before the deer crossed the fences by performing vertical and running jumps were recession and rest when the fence heights were lower or higher than 1.2 m, respectively. The general threshold (fence height) for discriminating success or failure was 0.9 m; however, we recommend a fence height of 1.5 m, considering the cost and roadkill risk. Placing exit pathways for deer and eliminating possible resting areas outside fences are essential for reducing the number of successful jump attempts.
   Fences have been widely implemented to reduce the risk of wildlife-vehicle collisions, wildlife disease spread, and crop damage. To manufacture fences, it is imperative to assess the behavioural responses of the target species. Here, we investigated the success rate of fences and classified eight behavioural responses of Korean water deer (Hydropotes inermis argyropus) to different fence heights. We explored the association of 801 behavioural responses and defined a threshold based on 40 events by applying non-metric multidimensional scaling and a binary logistic generalised linear mixed model. With fences lower and higher than 1.2 m, recession and rest were the dominant behaviours, respectively, before the deer crossed the fences by performing vertical and running jumps. Considering all independent events, 0.9 m was the marginal threshold, with highly variable outliers over this value. Placing exit pathways for deer and eliminating possible resting areas outside fences are essential for reducing the number of successful jump attempts. The optimal fence height could differ based on conditional factors; however, we recommend a height of 1.5 m considering the cost and roadkill risk. In conclusion, exploring and classifying the behavioural responses of the target species may be critical for establishing appropriate fence protocols.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Guilu Erxian Jiao (GLEXJ) is a renowned traditional Chinese herbal formula used to tonify the kidney. It is employed to treat psychiatric disorders, and alleviate memory impairment, cognitive dysfunction, and behavioral disorders. Modern pharmacological studies have demonstrated GLEXJ's ability to significantly inhibit the fear response in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and facilitate the extinction of fear memory. However, the underlying pharmacological mechanisms remain elusive. Aim of the study: Fear memory generalization, a fundamental characteristic of PTSD, remains poorly understood, and optimal pharmacological treatments are lacking. This study aimed to investigate GLEXJ's inhibitory effects on fear memory generalization in PTSD rats and elucidate its underlying mechanisms. Materials and methods: PTSD rats were induced using the single prolonged stress and electrical stimulation (SPS&S) protocol and treated with GLEXJ or paroxetine (PRX). Fear memory generalization was assessed using a contextual fear memory test. Hippocampal dendritic spine morphology was analyzed using Golgi-Cox staining. The chemical composition of GLEXJ was determined using ultra-high performance liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). Network pharmacology was employed to predict GLEXJ's therapeutic mechanism in PTSD treatment. Western blotting and immunofluorescence were used to measure indicators of the transient receptor potential channel 6 (TRPC6)-mediated calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV-cAMP response element-binding protein (CaMKIV-CREB) signaling pathway. In vitro, TRPC6 was suppressed in rat adrenal pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells using lentiviral vectors, and phalloidin staining was employed to examine changes in Fibros actin (F-actin), elucidating the mechanistic effects of GLEXJ-containing serum. Results: GLEXJ significantly mitigated fear memory generalization in PTSD rats, even with repeated stress exposure. It also alleviated abnormal hippocampal dendritic spine morphology. Network pharmacology analysis confirmed that GLEXJ was closely related to the Ca2+ signaling pathway in PTSD treatment. PTSD rats exhibited disrupted TRPC6-mediated CaMKIV-CREB signaling and impaired synaptic plasticity. GLEXJ upregulated TRPC6 expression, reactivated the CaMKIV-CREB pathway, and promoted synaptic remodeling. In vitro studies confirmed that TRPC6 suppression reduced F-actin levels while GLEXJ-containing serum increased TRPC6 expression and F-actin content. Conclusions: GLEXJ activates CaMKIV-CREB signaling by upregulating TRPC6 in the hippocampus of PTSD rats, leading to the positive modulation of dendritic spine morphology and synaptic remodeling. This mechanism contributes to the attenuation of fear memory generalization. Given the limitations of current PTSD treatments, these findings offer potential avenues for developing more effective therapeutic strategies.

AB  - BACKGROUND Metabolic reconfiguration in plants is a hallmark response to insect herbivory that occurs in the attack site and systemically in undamaged tissues. Metabolomic systemic responses can occur rapidly while the herbivore is still present and may persist in newly developed tissue to counterattack future herbivore attacks. This study analyzed the metabolic profile of local and newly developed distal (systemic) leaves of husk tomato (Physalis philadelphica) plants after whitefly Trialeurodes vaporariorum infestation. In addition, the effect of these metabolomic adjustments on whitefly oviposition and development was evaluated. RESULTS Our results indicate that T. vaporariorum infestation induced significant changes in husk tomato metabolic profiles, not only locally in infested leaves, but also systemically in distal leaves that developed after infestation. The distinctive metabolic profile produced in newly developed leaves affected whitefly nymphal development but did not affect female oviposition, suggesting that changes driven by whitefly herbivory persist in the young leaves that developed after the infestation event to avoid future herbivore attacks. CONCLUSIONS This report contributes to further understanding the plant responses to sucking insects by describing the metabolic reconfiguration in newly developed, undamaged systemic leaf tissues of husk tomato plants after whitefly infestation.

AB  - Milk holds a high nutritional value and is associated with diverse health benefits. The understanding of its composition of (poly)phenolic metabolites is limited, which necessitates a comprehensive evaluation of the subject. This study aimed at analyzing the (poly)phenolic profile of commercial milk samples from cows and goats and investigating their sterilization treatments, fat content, and lactose content. Fingerprinting of phenolic metabolites was achieved by using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple-quadrupole mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QqQ-MS/MS). Two hundred and three potential microbial and phase II metabolites of the main dietary (poly)phenols were targeted. Twenty-five metabolites were identified, revealing a diverse array of phenolic metabolites in milk, including isoflavones and their microbial catabolites equol and O-desmethylangolensin, phenyl-gamma-valerolactones (flavan-3-ol microbial catabolites), enterolignans, urolithins (ellagitannin microbial catabolites), benzene diols, and hippuric acid derivates. Goat's milk contained higher concentrations of these metabolites than cow's milk, while the sterilization process and milk composition (fat and lactose content) had minimal impact on the metabolite profiles. Thus, the consumption of goat's milk might serve as a potential means to supplement bioactive phenolic metabolites, especially in individuals with limited production capacity. However, further research is needed to elucidate the potential health effects of milk-derived phenolics.

AB  - Simple Summary The term wasting is a clinical name describing a physical condition characterized by growth retardation, usually of multifactorial origin. The present study describes an apparently new condition of pigs characterized clinically by wasting and pathologically by vacuolization of the brain. During 2016-2018, animals from eight farms were weaned in good body condition, and after 1-2 weeks, they started losing weight. To investigate potential causes of this condition, apparently sick and healthy pigs from each herd of eight affected farms were studied by means of histopathology, transmission electron microscopy and detection of usual infectious agents. Histopathologically, the most consistent lesion was neuropil vacuolization of the prosencephalon, mainly located in the thalamic nuclei and in the transition between the white and grey matter of the neocortex. Electron microscopy of some of these sick animals showed preserved axons, with dilated myelin sheaths (interpreted as edema of myelin sheath). The literature suggests this lesion type is linked to congenital or metabolic (toxic/deficiency) scenarios. The present case was probably a vitamin/mineral deficiency since supplementation with nutritional complexes solved the problem. The term wasting refers to a clinical sign used to describe a physical condition characterized by growth retardation, usually of multifactorial origin. The objective of the present study was to describe for the first time a pathological process characterized by forebrain neuropil vacuolization in pigs showing wasting without conspicuous neurological signs. To characterize the lesions pathologically, affected and non-affected pigs from eight of these farms were investigated. Histologically, the most consistent lesion was neuropil vacuolization of the prosencephalon, mainly located in the thalamic nuclei and in the transition between the white and grey matter of the neocortex (40/56 in sick and 4/30 in healthy pigs). In the most severe cases, the vacuolation also involved the midbrain, cerebellar nuclei and, to a lesser extent, the medulla oblongata. Vacuolization of the forebrain was associated with pigs experiencing marked emaciation and growth retardation. Although the specific cause of the present case remained unknown, the preventive use of multivitamin and mineral complexes in drinking water ameliorated the condition, strongly suggesting a metabolic origin of the observed condition.

AB  - The present study examined the effects of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) antagonist, scopolamine, on standard contextual fear conditioning (sCFC). It compared effects of the drug on acquisition (post-shock freezing) versus 24-hr retention of a context-shock association acquired after one or three pairings of a context with unsignaled shock. During single-trial sCFC, systemic scopolamine (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) prior to training abolished both post-shock and retention freezing (Experiment 1). This same injection during multiple-trial sCFC also abolished post-shock freezing and impaired 24-hr retention freezing (Experiment 2). These results indicate that cholinergic signaling mediates both acquisition and 24-hr retention of a context-shock association across different trial parameters. Experiment 3 further explored these effects by infusing scopolamine (35 mu g per side) into the dorsal hippocampus (dHPC) prior to training in single versus multiple-trial sCFC. This infusion spared post-shock but abolished retention test freezing in single-trial sCFC (Experiment 3A), and had no effect on multiple-trial sCFC (Experiment 3B). The current findings suggest that brain-wide cholinergic signaling mediates acquisition and retention of single-trial sCFC. Despite this, while muscarinic cholinergic signaling in the dHPC does mediate retention of single-trial sCFC, it is not required for acquisition of either variant, or retention of multiple-trial sCFC. These findings also rule out impaired sensory processing of contextual cues as a mechanism of impaired context learning by dHPC scopolamine. The results are discussed in relation to the role of cholinergic function across multiple brain memory systems in elemental versus configural forms of contextual fear conditioning (Fanselow, 2010; Rudy, 2009).

AB  - Simple Summary Mannheimia haemolytica is a key bacterial pathogen contributing to important ruminant diseases and accounting for a large proportion of overall antimicrobial use in cattle and sheep. The recent emergence of ovine strains with reduced susceptibility to antimicrobials-which could lead to treatment failure, increased costs of livestock production, and the dissemination of antimicrobial-resistant genes to other bacteria and possibly the environment-is of concern. This study investigated the levels of antimicrobial resistance of M. haemolytica isolated from clinically healthy sheep at slaughter and the genetic bacterial resistance mechanisms. Low levels of phenotypic resistance were detected for most of the antimicrobials tested except for tetracycline (4.3%) and tylosin (89.1%). A few antimicrobial resistance determinants were found in the genome of six out of nine isolates, consisting of genes conferring resistance to tetracyclines (tetH), aminoglycosides (strA), and sulfonamides (sul2), which were sometimes linked to the presence of plasmids but did not always lead to resistance phenotypes. Our results suggest that there is limited resistance in M. haemolytica strains of veterinary origin, but the presence of several resistance genes, some of which were found in mobile genetic elements that play a major role in the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance in members of the Pasteurellaceae family, deserves further consideration. Mannheimia haemolytica is the main pathogen contributing to pneumonic pasteurellosis in sheep. The aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial resistance levels in M. haemolytica isolates from the lungs of slaughtered sheep and to examine the genetic resistance mechanisms involved. A total of 256 M. haemolytica isolates, 169 from lungs with pneumonic lesions and 87 from lungs without lesions, were analyzed by the disk diffusion method for 12 antimicrobials, and the whole genome of 14 isolates was sequenced to identify antimicrobial resistance determinants. Levels of phenotypic resistance ranged from <2% for 10 antimicrobials (amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic, ceftiofur, cefquinome, lincomycin/spectinomycin, gentamicin, erythromycin, florfenicol, enrofloxacin, and doxycycline) to 4.3% for tetracycline and 89.1% for tylosin. Six isolates carried tetH genes and four isolates carried, in addition, the strA and sul2 genes in putative plasmid sequences. No mutations associated with macrolide resistance were identified in 23 rDNA sequences, suggesting that the M. haemolytica phenotypic results for tylosin should be interpreted with care in the absence of well-established epidemiological and clinical breakpoints. The identification of strains phenotypically resistant to tetracycline and of several resistance genes, some of which were present in plasmids, highlights the need for continuous monitoring of susceptibility patterns in Pasteurellaceae isolates from livestock.

AB  - Accurately identifying pain is a critical first step required to adequately mitigate pain and improve pig health, welfare and quality of life. The objective of this study was to verify whether random forest and support vector machine algorithms trained utilizing experienced evaluators could improve the accuracy of pain diagnosis in untrained and inexperienced evaluators using the Unesp-Botucatu Pig Composite Acute Pain Scale (UPAPS). Four-minute, pre-recorded video clips of 45 male pigs in pain-free (pre-surgical castration) and painful conditions (post-surgical castration) were used. Previously generated scores from three experienced evaluators using UPAPS on a video database were used to train and test random forest and support vector machine models. Following this, ten inexperienced evaluators were recruited to assess the same video clips using the UPAPS. Scores from inexperienced evaluators were then inputted for machine learning algorithms and pain diagnosis was adjusted accordingly. Both machine learning models performed well based on area under the curve, sensitivity > 90 %, and specificity > 95 %. Area under the curve, specificity, and sensitivity of untrained inexperience evaluators were statistically (p < 0.05) equivalent between the original UPAPS, and UPAPS adjusted by random forest and support vector machine. In conclusion, the random forest and support vector machine algorithms trained using experienced evaluators did not modify the discriminatory diagnostic ability of untrained inexperienced evaluators scoring UPAPS. In future studies, additional machine learning techniques could be implemented to investigate whether they improve the accuracy of pain diagnostic. In addition, further studies are needed to develop a concise and standard training program for inexperienced evaluators and investigate its effects on the accuracy of pain diagnosis.

AB  - In this paper, on the basis of the differences in the hydrogen ion concentration (pH) of the diluent dairy goat semen on X/Y sperm motility, an X/Y sperm enrichment study was conducted to establish a simple and effective method for gender control in dairy goats. Dairy goat semen was diluted using different pH dilutions and was incubated. Then, the X/Y sperm ratio in the isolated upper sperm was determined using the double TaqMan qPCR method. The internal pH change pattern of sperm cells at different pH dilutions was measured using BCECF-AM probe, and the functional parameters of the isolated sperm were tested with the corresponding kit. Next, an in vitro fertilization test was conducted using isolated spermatozoa and oocytes to determine their fertilization rates, the percentages of female embryos, and the expression of genes related to developing potentially fertilized embryos. Results showed that the percentages of the X sperm cells in the upper sperm layer were 67.24% +/- 2.61% at sperm dilution pH of 6.2 and 30.45% +/- 1.03% at sperm dilution pH of 7.4, which was significantly different from 52.35% +/- 1.72% of the control group (pH 6.8) (P < 0.01). Results also showed that there is a relationship between the external pHo and internal pHi of sperm cells. Furthermore, the percentages of female embryos after the in vitro fertilization of the isolated upper sperm with mature oocytes at pH 6.2 and 7.4 were 66.67% +/- 0.05 and 29.73% +/- 0.04%, respectively, compared with 48.57% +/- 0.02% in the control group (pH 6.8). Highly significant differences occurred between groups (P < 0.01). Additionally, no significant difference was observed during the expression of genes related to embryonic development between the blastocysts formed from sperm isolated by changing the pH of the diluent and the control sperm (P > 0.05). Therefore, this study successfully established a simple and effective method for enriched X/Y sperms from dairy goats, which is important for regulating the desired sex progeny during dairy goat breeding and for guiding dairy goat production.

AB  - The human digestive system's electrical activity may be recorded noninvasively by Electrogastrography (EGG). Electrogastrograms are recordings of the electrical activity produced by the stomach muscles. EGG Several gastrointestinal disorders may be diagnosed and their severity measured using EGG signal properties. The literature has several contributions to the categorization of EGG signals. The majority of them make use of either the EGG's frequency or time data. The wide variety of EGG signals is a challenge for current automated categorization methods. Therefore, this study's objective is to develop a lightweight classifier that achieves high classification accuracy while using little processing resources. To acquire normal and abnormal EGG signals at a reasonable cost, a three -electrode measuring device is created here, with classification performed by a hybrid of Linear Vector Quantization and the African Buffalo Search Algorithm (HLVQ-ASO). The results show that the information richness of recorded EGG signals from healthy persons is greater for EGG signals captured using a surface electrode with a contact diameter of 19 mm as compared to 16 mm. To demonstrate their validity and degree of classification accuracy, the results computed using the suggested classifiers are compared with the current classifiers like Artificial Neural Network, Multimodal Support Vector Machine (MSVM), and Improved Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Additionally, the HLVQ-ASO-based classification method is effective in differentiating between normal and diabetic EGG signals, found a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 98.8%. For a dataset of 500 samples, the classification accuracy is 97%.

AB  - We reconstructed Stomaphis phylogeny and analyzed evolutionary host-plant shifts. The molecular phylogeny revealed 23 well-supported lineages, each specialized to use specific host plant family, whilst host plants of Stomaphis aphids ranged across 6 orders, 11 families, 21 genera, and 28 species. This combination of high host specificity with evolutionarily distant host shifts is exceptional in herbivores. To explain this pattern, we propose one hypothesis among several possibilities: Stomaphis aphids are generalists with respect to the defensive chemicals produced by the plant, but specialists with respect to the stem surface structure of the host tree. This hypothesis predicts that tree taxa having stem surface structures preferred by Stomaphis would be used again and again by genetically distinct Stomaphis lineages. Consistent with this prediction, we found that different (occasionally phylogenetically distant) Stomaphis lineages shared the same host plant genera such as Alnus and Betula. This result suggests that, in the course of their evolutionary history, Japanese Stomaphis aphids have repeatedly colonized a limited number of host plant genera.

AB  - Insufficient sleep is a global problem with serious consequences for cognition and mental health.1 1 Synapses play a central role in many aspects of cognition, including the crucial function of memory consolidation during sleep.2 2 Interference with the normal expression or function of synapse proteins is a cause of cognitive, mood, and other behavioral problems in over 130 brain disorders.3 3 Sleep deprivation (SD) has also been reported to alter synapse protein composition and synapse number, although with conflicting results.4-7 4-7 In our study, we conducted synaptome mapping of excitatory synapses in 125 regions of the mouse brain and found that sleep deprivation selectively reduces synapse diversity in the cortex and in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Sleep deprivation targeted specific types and subtypes of excitatory synapses while maintaining total synapse density (synapse number/area). Synapse subtypes with longer protein lifetimes exhibited resilience to sleep deprivation, similar to observations in aging and genetic perturbations. Moreover, the altered synaptome architecture affected the responses to neural oscillations, suggesting that sleep plays a vital role in preserving cognitive function by maintaining the brain's synaptome architecture.

AB  - The bypass hole lowers the traditional pig velocity and brings significant uneven pig velocity which rises the pigging stuck risks. Aiming to give the quick evaluations of the uneven pig motion, this paper first proposed a transient steady-state analytical model to describe the trend and the fluctuation range of the uneven pig velocity, then developed the stoppage model to estimate the stoppage time as the result of inlet mass flow, friction force, and bypass character. The accuracy of the analytical model was verified by the consistency between the model calculated velocity, experimental data and the simulated velocity trend. And the stoppage model was verified by the simulated velocity trends. On considering the gas compressibility effect and the variation in friction profile, this paper studied the occurrence of pig stoppage and the extent of slippage with the designed abnormal friction section in simulation procedure. The variation in friction aggravates the slippage and stimulates the occurrence of stoppage. The positive friction deviation is largely responsible for the sudden deceleration and then stoppage. While, the gas compressibility is primarily responsible for the occasional stoppage after the pig acceleration-deceleration procedure when the pig travels into the lower friction region.

AB  - Subchronic exposure to cyanuric acid (CA) and its structural analogue melamine induces long-term effects on brain and behavior in male rodents. To examine if this exposure induced negative effects on cognitive function in females, we examined the behavioral performance and further attempted to investigate synaptic and neuronal function. CA was intraperitoneal treated with 20 or 40 mg/kg/day to adolescent female rats for 4 consecutive weeks. Multiple behavioral tests were employed to assess spatial cognition, learning strategy, locomotion and motivation. Hippocampal synaptic function at Schaffer collaterals-CA1 synapses and excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in CA1 pyramidal neurons was evaluated. Meanwhile, the glutamate transport inhibitor DLthreo-beta-benzyloxyaspartate (DL-TBOA) was infused into hippocampal CA1 region to certify the underlying mechanism. We found that subchronic CA exposure impairs reversal learning ability with dose-dependent effects but did not affect spatial learning and memory, or learning strategy. The expression and phosphorylation of Nmethyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) GluN2B subunits were simultaneously reduced in the hippocampus and the GluN2B-mediated synaptic function, including long-term depression (LTD) and paired-pulse facilitation (PPF), was suppressed. CA could also diminish postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95) expression but did change the levels of alpha-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate receptor (AMPAR) GluA1 or NMDAR GluN2A subunit, or hippocampal spine density. Meanwhile, CA depressed frequency and amplitude of GluN2Bmediated EPSCs, indicating the presynaptic and postsynaptic actions of CA on neuronal activity. Furthermore, the DL-TBOA infusions could effectively mitigate the diminished GluN2B-LTD and GluN2B-EPSCs and the impairments in behavioral flexibility. Our findings provide the first evidence that CA can exert neurotoxic effects on females and certify that one of the potential mechanisms for neuronal and synaptic dysfunction is the GluN2Bmediated signaling pathway.

AB  - BackgroundThe conditioned medium from human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UCMSCs-CM) provides a new cell-free therapy for tumors due to its unique secretome. However, there are many contradictory reports about the effect of UCMSCs-CM on tumor cells. The loss of contact inhibition is a common characteristic of tumor cells. A relationship between the effect of UCMSCs-CM on tumor cells and contact inhibition in tumor cells is rarely concerned. Whether the effect of UCMSCs-CM on tumor cells is affected by cell density? Here, we explored the effect of UCMSCs-CM on granulosa tumor cell line (KGN) cells at low or high density.MethodsGrowth curve and CCK8 assay were used to assess cell proliferation and viability. Scratch wound and matrigel invasion assay were implicated to detect cell motility of KGN cells. UCMSCs-CM effects on cell cycle, apoptosis and pathway-related proteins were investigated by flow cytometry, TUNEL assay, western blot and immunofluorescence analysis respectively.ResultsIn growth curve analysis, before KGN cells proliferated into confluence, UCMSCs-CM had no effect on cell proliferation. However, once the cells proliferate to contact each other, UCMSCs-CM significantly inhibited proliferation. Meanwhile, when KGN cells were implanted at high density, UCMSCs-CM could induce cell cycle arrest at G1 phase, inhibit cell migration, invasion and promote apoptosis. While it had no similar effect on KGN cells implanted at low density. In mechanism, the UCMSCs-CM treatment activated the Hippo pathway when KGN cells were implanted at high density. Consistently, the MST1/2 inhibitor, XMU-MP-1, inhibited the activation of the Hippo pathway induced by UCMSCs-CM treatment and accordingly declined the anti-tumor effect of UCMSCs-CM on KGN cells.ConclusionsThe effect of UCMSCs-CM on tumor cells is affected by cell density. UCMSCs-CM exerted anti-tumor effect on KGN cells by activating Hippo pathway to restore contact inhibition. Our results suggest that UCMSCs-CM is a promising therapeutic candidate for GCT treatment.

AB  - Simple Summary Low reproductive performance during anestrus restricts the potential for year-round sheep production in temperate areas, precisely when food security is urgently demanded. Hormonal strategies used to improve this performance have largely relied on progesterone and equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG). The last is a hormone obtained from the blood of pregnant mares that promotes follicular development (FSH activity in ruminants). However, recent information assigns LH, instead of FSH, the essential role of driving this development to ovulation. Therefore, we assessed this possibility using human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in anestrous sheep. The last has specific LH activity and is obtained from gestating woman urine. In this study, we showed that the fundamental restriction for better reproductive output during anestrus is a limitation not in the number of follicles but in their functional competence for ovulation. We also showed that a single administration of hCG seems as effective as eCG in promoting follicular development, ovulation, and fertility in sheep, provided that the hCG dose is appropriate. Our results could lead to better reproduction output during anestrus in sheep.Abstract The study tested the hypothesis that a single administration of hCG supports the LH-dependent phase of terminal follicular development in synchronized sheep during anestrus, using eCG as a functional reference. Using a clinical approach, four experiments were designed to achieve the following: (1) Identify the inhibitory influence of anestrus on reproduction efficiency; (2) Assess the potential of hCG to keep functional blood concentrations after a single dose; (3) Characterize the effect of different doses of hCG on reproductive functional markers; (4) To compare the ability of hCG to that of eCG to support follicular development and fertility based on the same markers. The results showed that anestrus seems to affect follicular and luteal function under LH dependency as FSH-dependent markers are not compromised; hCG maintains higher blood concentrations than controls for at least 48 h; hCG improves follicular development and ovulatory rates compared to controls and at standards comparable to a breeding season; and ewes treated with hCG exhibit similar performance to those treated with eCG. Our results conclude that hCG can be used to support follicular function during anestrus in sheep, aiming to perfect its regulation in assisted reproduction.

AB  - This checklist is the fourth contribution resulting from a long-term multidisciplinary project which combined morphological analyses and molecular techniques (mitochondrial DNA markers) for accurate identification of marine and coastal decapod crustaceans of Sao Paulo State (Brazil). We provide a list of 63 species of the following 11 families of 4 superfamilies of Anomura: Albuneidae (4 spp.), Blepharipodidae (1 sp.), Chirostylidae (1 sp.), Diogenidae (18 spp.), Hippidae (1 sp.), Munididae (8 spp.), Munidopsidae (1 sp.), Paguridae (13 spp.), Parapaguridae (2 spp.), Porcellanidae (13 spp.), and Pylochelidae (1 sp.). Seven species previously reported from the region were neither collected nor found in museum collections during our study, including one (Sympagurus dimorphus) that we suggest to be removed from Sao Paulo coast fauna lists. We generated new sequences of cytochrome oxidase subunit I (barcode region) and 16S genes of 44 species. This anomuran inventory may serve as guideline for future studies on taxonomy, conservation, population genetics, biogeography, and phylogenetics, which might flag species that deserve further investigations and concerns.

AB  - Bird nests are fascinating microcosms harboring a wide range of arthropods parasitizing the nesting birds or feeding on prey remains, feces, and the nest material. Studies of these communities have been entirely based on emergence traps which collect live organisms out of the nests. The analysis of nest contents and environmental DNA (eDNA) via metabarcoding could expand our knowledge and identify prey, exuviae, and other animal remains in bird nests. Here, we investigated the potential of arthropod remains, nest dust, and feathers to better describe arthropod diversity accumulated in 20 bird nests collected in Guelph (Canada). We used subsampling strategies and tested two extraction approaches to investigate the distribution of DNA in nests, account for low -quality DNA, and the presence of inhibitory substances. In total, 103 taxa were detected via metabarcoding. Arthropod remains delivered the highest number of taxa (n = 67), followed by nest dust (n = 29). Extractions with the PowerSoil kit outperformed DNeasy extractions coupled with PowerClean Pro inhibitor removal. Per nest, on average 5.5% taxonomic overlap between arthropod remains of different size classes was detected and subsamples of nest dust extracted with the PowerSoil kit showed 47.3% taxonomic overlap indicating a heterogeneous eDNA distribution in nests. Most detected species were either feeding in the nest, i.e., herbivorous / predatory, or bird food. We also detected molecular traces of 25 bird species, whose feathers were likely used as nest material. Consequently, the metabarcoding of bird nest materials provides a more complete picture of nest communities, which can enable future studies on functional diversity and better comparisons between nesting species.

AB  - Neijiang (NJ) and Yacha (YC) are two indigenous pig breeds in the Sichuan basin of China, displaying higher resistance to diseases, lower lean ratio, and slower growth rate than the commercial Western pig breed Yorkshire (YS). The molecular mechanisms underly-ing the differences in growth and development between these pig breeds are still unknown. In the present study, five pigs from NJ, YC, and YS breeds were subjected to the whole genome resequencing, and then the differential single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were screened using a 10-kb window sliding in 1-kb step using the Fst method. Finally, 48,924, 48,543, and 46,228 nonsynony-mous single-nucleotide polymorphism loci (nsSNPs) were identified between NJ and YS, NJ and YC, and YC and YS, which highly or moderately affected 2,490, 800, and 444 genes, respectively. Moreover, three nsSNPs were detected in the genes of acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase 1 (ACAT1) insulin-like growth factor 2 receptor (IGF2R), insulin-like growth factor 2 and mRNA-binding protein 3 (IGF2BP3), which potentially affected the transformation of acetyl-CoA to acetoacetyl-CoA and the normal functions of the insulin sig-naling pathways. Moreover, serous determinations revealed significantly lower acetyl-CoA content in YC than in YS, supporting that ACAT1 might be a reason explaining the differences in growth and development between YC and YS breeds. Contents of phosphati-dylcholine (PC) and phosphatidic acid (PA) significantly differed between the pig breeds, suggesting that glycerophospholipid metabo-lism might be another reason for the differences between Chinese and Western pig breeds. Overall, these results might contribute basic information to understand the genetic differences determining the phenotypical traits in pigs.

AB  - Anthelmintics (AHs) control animal infections with gastrointestinal nematodes. They reach soil through animal faeces deposited on soils or through manuring. Although soil constitutes a major AH sink, we know little about the mechanisms controlling their soil dissipation. We employed studies with fumigated and non-fumigated soils collected from 12 sheep farms with a variable record of albendazole (ABZ), ivermectin (IVM) and eprinomectin (EPM) use. From each farm, we collected soils from inside small ruminant barn facilities (series A, high exposure) and the associated grazing pastures (series B, low exposure). We asked the following questions: (a) What is the role of soil microorganisms in AH dissipation? (b) Does repeated exposure of soils to AHs lead to their accelerated biodegradation? (c) Which soil physicochemical properties control AH dissipation? Soil fumigation significantly retarded ABZ (DT50 1.9 and 4.33 days), IVM (34.5 and 108.7 days) and EPM dissipation (30 and 121 days) suggesting a key role of soil microorganisms in AH dissipation. No significant acceleration in AH dissipation was evident in soils from units with a record of the administration of AHs or in soil series A vs series B, suggesting that the level of prior exposure was not adequate to induce their enhanced biodegradation. Significant positive and negative correlations of soil total organic carbon (TOC) and ABZ and IVM dissipation, respectively, were observed. Soil adsorption of AHs increased in the order IVM > ABZ > EPM. TOC controlled soil adsorption of IVM and EPM, but not of ABZ, in support of the contrasting effect of TOC on IVM and ABZ dissipation.

AB  - Goat milk is rich in various fatty acids that are beneficial to human health. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) and RNA-seq analyses of goat mammary glands at different lactation stages revealed a novel lactation regulatory factor, Prospero homeobox 1 (PROX1). However, the mechanism whereby PROX1 regulates lipid metabolism in dairy goats remains unclear. We found that PROX1 exhibits the highest expression level during peak lactation period. PROX1 knockdown enhanced the expression of genes related to de novo fatty acid synthesis (e.g., SREBP1 and FASN) and triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis (e.g., DGAT1 and GPAM) in goat mammary epithelial cells (GMECs). Consistently, intracellular TAG and lipid droplet contents were significantly increased in PROX1 knockdown cells and reduced in PROX1 overexpression cells, and we observed similar results in PROX1 knockout mice. Following PROX1 overexpression, RNA-seq showed a significant upregulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PPARGC1A) expression. Further, PPARGC1A knockdown attenuated the inhibitory effects of PROX1 on TAG contents and lipid-droplet formation in GMECs. Moreover, we found that PROX1 promoted PPARGC1A transcription via the PROX1 binding sites (PBSs) located in the PPARGC1A promoter. These results suggest a novel target for manipulating the goat milk-fat composition and improving the quality of goat milk.

AB  - Buffalo milk is nutrient-rich and contains less cholesterol than cow milk. Dairy buffaloes are widely distributed at different altitudes in the Yunnan Province, China; however, the impacts of altitude on the whey-derived functional metabolites of buffalo milk whey are not well understood. Here, we used non-targeted and targeted metabolomics to evaluate the differential metabolites in the milk whey of buffaloes raised at low altitudes (LA), medium altitudes (MA), and high altitudes (HA). ANOVA statistical test was performed to acquire differential metabolites using IBM SPSS statistics 22 software. The results showed that LA- and MA-milk whey had higher levels of amino acids (glutamine and pyroglutamic acid) and vitamin B6 than HA-milk whey. LA-milk whey had higher levels of the carbohydrates involved in galactose, amino sugar, and nucleotide sugar metabolism than MA- and HA-milk whey, but HA-milk whey showed significantly higher levels of free fatty acids. In conclusion, owing to the biological functions of their most abundant components, LA-milk is more suitable for the production of functional milk with high levels of amino acids, vitamin B6, and carbohydrates; while HA-milk is suitable as raw milk for the production of dairy products with high free fatty acid content.

AB  - The purpose of the present study was to obtain estimates of variance components and genetic parameters for direct and maternal effects on various growth traits in Beetal goat by fitting four animal models, attempting to separate direct genetic, maternal genetic and maternal permanent environmental effects under restricted maximum likelihood procedure. The data of 3,308 growth trait records of Beetal kids born during the period from 2004 to 2019 were used in the present study. Based on best fitted models, the direct additive h(2) estimates were 0.06, 0.27, 0.37, 0.17 and 0.10 for birth weight (BWT), weight at 3 (WT3), 6 (WT6), 9 (WT9) and 12 (WT12) months of age, respectively. Maternal permanent environmental effects significantly contributed for 10% and 7% of total variance for BWT and WWT, respectively, which reduced direct heritability by 40 and 10% for respective traits from the models without these effects. For average daily gain (ADG1) and Kleiber ratios (KR1) up to weaning period (3 months) traits, maternal permanent environmental effects accounted for 7% and 8% of phenotypic variance, respectively, and resulted in a reduction of 6.6% and 5.4% in direct h(2) of respective traits. For post-weaning traits, the maternal effects were non-significant (p > .05) which indicates diminishing influence of mothering ability for these traits. High and positive genetic correlations were obtained among WT3-WT6, WT6-WT9 and WT9-WT12 with correlations of 0.96 +/- 0.25, 0.84 +/- 0.23 and 0.90 +/- 0.13, respectively. Thus, early selection at weaning age can be practised taking into consideration maternal variation for effective response to selection in Beetal goat.

AB  - Measurements of ultrafine particles (UFP) over several years were carried out across seven different locations in New York State. The locations include urban background sites (Queens College and Albany), near road sites (Queens, Buffalo and Rochester) and rural sites (Pinnacle State Park and Whiteface Mountain). UFP at the urban background and near road sites generally show highest concentrations in the morning during the early commute period. Concentrations decrease during the day but increase again in the afternoon or evening period. Weekday concentrations are higher than on weekends. UFP correlates well with traffic related co-pollutants black carbon (BC) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). At the rural locations, UFP concentrations show less variation during the day with highest concentrations in the early afternoon to late evening hours particularly in spring. Seasonally, UFP concentrations across urban background and near road sites, are highest in winter (Dec, Jan, Feb) and lowest in summer (Jun, Jul, Aug). The variation in UFP concentration with temperature, relative humidity and wind speed was investigated. At the Queens College site, particle number concentrations in six different size fractions were measured using a TSI 3031 instrument. Annual average UFP concentrations at Queens College were found to decrease over time consistent with emission control strategies.

AB  - Mitochondria play a pivotal role in energy production, metabolism, and cellular signaling, serving as key regulators of cellular functions, including differentiation and tissue-specific adaptation. The interplay between mitochondria and the nucleus is crucial for coordinating these processes, particularly through the supply of metabolites for epigenetic modifications that facilitate nuclear-mitochondrial interactions. To investigate tissue-specific mitochondrial adaptations at the molecular level, we conducted RNA sequencing data analyses of kidney, heart, brain, and ovary tissues of female buffaloes, focusing on variations in mitochondrial gene expression related to amino acid metabolism. Our analysis identified 82 nuclear-encoded mitochondrial transcripts involved in amino acid metabolism, with significant differential expression patterns across all tissues. Notably, the heart, brain, and kidney-tissues with higher energy demands-exhibited elevated expression levels compared to the ovary. The kidney displayed unique gene expression patterns, characterized by up-regulation of genes involved in glyoxylate metabolism and amino acid catabolism. In contrast, comparative analysis of the heart and kidney versus the brain revealed shared up-regulation of genes associated with fatty acid oxidation. Gene ontology and KEGG pathway analyses confirmed the enrichment of genes in pathways related to amino acid degradation and metabolism. These findings highlight the tissue-specific regulation of mitochondrial gene expression linked to amino acid metabolism, reflecting mitochondrial adaptations to the distinct metabolic and energy requirements of different tissues in buffalo. Importantly, our results underscore the relevance of mitochondrial adaptations not only for livestock health but also for understanding metabolic disorders in humans. By elucidating the molecular mechanisms of mitochondrial function and their tissue-specific variations, this study provides insights that could inform breeding strategies for enhanced livestock productivity and contribute to therapeutic approaches for human metabolic diseases. Thus, our findings illustrate how mitochondria are specialized in a tissue-specific manner to optimize amino acid utilization and maintain cellular homeostasis, with implications for both animal welfare and human health.

AB  - Associational resistance to herbivore and pathogen attack is a well documented ecological phenomenon and, if applied to agriculture, may reduce impact of pests and diseases on crop yields without recourse to pesticides. The value of associational resistance through intercropping, planting multiple crops alongside each other, as a sustainable control method remains unclear, due to variable outcomes reported in the published literature. We performed a meta-analysis to provide a quantitative assessment of benefits of intercropping for target plant resistance to plant-parasitic nematodes and soil-borne diseases. We found that intercropping reduced damage to focal crops from nematodes by 40% and disease incidence by 55%. Intercropping efficacy varied with biological variables, such as field fertilisation status and intercrop family, and methodology, including whether study samples were potted or in fields. Nematode control using intercropping was sufficient to offset reductions in focal crop yield from intercrop presence, making intercropping a viable agricultural tool. We identify key drivers for underpinning the success of intercropping and indicate areas for future research to improve efficacy. This study also highlights the potential benefits of harnessing ecological knowledge on plant-enemy interactions for improving agricultural and landscape sustainability.

AB  - Effects of hydroxyapatite (HA) particles with bone morphogenetic BMP-2 or GDF-5 were compared in sheep lumbar osteopenia; in vitro release in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or sheep serum was assessed by ELISA. Lumbar (L) vertebral bone defects (o 3.5 mm) were generated in aged, osteopenic female sheep (n = 72; 9.00 +/- 0.11 years; mean +/- SEM). Treatment was: (a) HA particles (2.5 mg; L5); or (b) particles coated with BMP-2 (1 mu g; 10 mu g) or GDF-5 (5 mu g; 50 mu g; L4; all groups n = 6). Untouched vertebrae (L3) served as controls. Three and nine months post-therapy, bone formation was assessed by osteodensitometry, histomorphometry, and biomechanical testing. Cumulative 14-day BMP release was high in serum (76-100%), but max. 1.4% in PBS. In vivo induction of bone formation by HA particles with either growth factor was shown by: (i) significantly increased bone volume, trabecular and cortical thickness (overall increase HA + BMP vs. control close to the injection channel 71%, 110%, and 37%, respectively); (ii) partial significant effects for bone mineral density, bone formation, and compressive strength (increase 17%; 9 months; GDF-5). Treatment effects were not dose-dependent. Combined HA and BMPs (single low-dose) highly augment long-term bone formation and biomechanical stabilization in sheep lumbar osteopenia. Thus, carrier-bound BMP doses 20,000-fold to 1000-fold lower than previously applied appear suitable for spinal fusion/bone regeneration and improved treatment safety.

AB  - In adult pre-clinical models, traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been shown to prime microglia, exaggerating the central inflammatory response to an acute immune challenge, worsening depressive-like behavior, and enhancing cognitive deficits. Whether this phenomenon exists following mTBI during adolescence has yet to be explored, with age at injury potentially altering the inflammatory response. Furthermore, to date, studies have predominantly examined hippocampal-dependent learning domains, although pre-frontal cortex-driven functions, including attention, motivation, and impulsivity, are significantly affected by both adolescent TBI and acute inflammatory stimuli. As such, the current study examined the effects of a single acute peripheral dose of LPS (0.33 mg/kg) given in adulthood following mTBI in mid-adolescence in male Sprague-Dawley rats on performance in the 5-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT). Only previously injured animals given LPS showed an increase in omissions and reward collection latency on the 5-CSRTT, with no effect noted in sham animals given LPS. This is suggestive of impaired motivation and a prolonged central inflammatory response to LPS administration in these animals. Indeed, morphological analysis of myeloid cells within the pre-frontal cortex, via IBA1 immunohistochemistry, found that injured animals administered LPS had an increase in complexity in IBA1+ve cells, an effect that was seen to a lesser extent in sham animals. These findings suggest that there may be ongoing alterations in the effects of acute inflammatory stimuli that are driven, in part by increased reactivity of microglial cells.

AB  - Simple Summary Insects use antennae to perceive the chemical environment, and olfaction (the sense of smell) is essential for a variety of behavioral responses. Termites are social insects that display a division of labor based on an elaborate caste system consisting of reproductive (queen and king) and non-reproductive individuals (workers and soldiers). Whether these castes have different senses of smell is poorly understood. In this study, we characterized the morphology of antennae in alates (winged reproductives), workers, and soldiers in the Formosan subterranean termite, Coptotermes formosanus, and further analyzed the diversity and abundance of the antennal sensilla (sensory receptors) in each caste. We found that both female and male alates had longer antennae and greater numbers of sensilla than workers and soldiers, but all castes possessed the same nine types of antennal sensilla. Each type of sensilla had a specific spatial distribution along the antenna. The quantitative composition of sensilla differed between the reproductive and non-reproductive castes, but few differences were found between female and male alates or between worker and soldier castes. These results suggest that the olfactory morphology is associated with the reproductive division of labor in subterranean termites. Antennae are the primary sensory organs in insects, where a variety of sensilla are distributed for the perception of the chemical environment. In eusocial insects, colony function is maintained by a division of labor between reproductive and non-reproductive castes, and chemosensation is essential for regulating their specialized social activities. Several social species in Hymenoptera display caste-specific characteristics in antennal morphology and diversity of sensilla, reflecting their differential tasks. In termites, however, little is known about how the division of labor is associated with chemosensory morphology among castes. Using light and scanning electron microscopy, we performed antennal morphometry and characterized the organization of sensilla in reproductive (female and male alates) and non-reproductive (worker and soldier) castes in the Formosan subterranean termite, Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki. Here, we show that the antennal sensilla in alates are twice as abundant as in workers and soldiers, along with the greater number of antennal segments and antennal length in alates. However, all castes exhibit the same types of antennal sensilla, including basiconicum, campaniformium, capitulum, chaeticum I, chaeticum II, chaeticum III, marginal, trichodeum I, and trichodeum I. The quantitative composition of sensilla diverges between reproductive and non-reproductive castes, but not between female and male alates or between worker and soldier castes. The sensilla display spatial-specific distribution, with basiconicum exclusively and capitulum predominantly found on the ventral side of antennae. In addition, the abundance of chemosensilla increases toward the distal end of antennae in each caste. This research provides morphological signatures of chemosensation and their implications for the division of labor, and suggests future neurophysiological and molecular studies to address the mechanisms of chemical communication in termites.

AB  - In this study, we present the first characterization of herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) released from infested olive leaves. The gall midge Dasineura oleae is a specific pest of Olea europaea and endemic of the Mediterranean Basin, an area in which severe outbreaks currently occurred. Little is known about the damage caused by the pest and the relationship with its host. Since gall formation and larval feeding activity may lead to the release of specific plant volatile compounds, we investigated the volatile profiles emitted from infested plants compared with healthy plants under both laboratory and field conditions. Additionally, the volatiles emitted from mechanically damaged plants were considered. A blend of 12 volatiles was emitted from olive trees infested by D. oleae. Of these, beta-copaene, beta-ocimene, cosmene, unknown 1 and unknown 3 were found to be exclusively emitted in infested plants. The emission of germacrene-D, (E,E)-alpha-farnesene, and (Z,E)-alpha-farnesene, alpha-copaene, (E)-4,8-dimethylnona-1,3,7-triene, (E)-beta-guaiene and heptadecane significantly increased in infested trees. Linalool, beta-copaen-4-alpha-ol, beta-bourbonene, beta-cubebene, beta-elemene, beta-copaene and delta-amorphene were found only in the field trial and showed differences depending on the level of infestation and the plant stage. (Z)-3-Hexenol, (E)-4-oxohen-2-enal, and 2-(2-butoxyethoxy)-ethanol, were exclusively emitted from the leaves after mechanical damage. In a field trial in Italy, we also demonstrated spring synchronization between adults of D. oleae and O. europaea trees. Analyses of morphoanatomical malformations of gall leaves showed that tissue alterations occur at the spongy parenchyma causing an increase of the leaf blade thickness. We speculate that tissue alterations may lead to HIPV release, in turn potentially attracting D. oleae natural enemies.

AB  - Potato protein concentrate (PPC) has been included in piglet diets for many decades because of its properties with respect to piglets' protein requirements. The inclusion level was limited because of the content of toxic anti-nutritional factors, such as glycoalkaloids (GA). Glycoalkaloid content in PPC is reduced via resource-requiring processing, but if piglets tolerate GA in levels like in the standard PPC, energy-consuming processing can be reduced. The concern when increasing standard PPC levels is the potential negative effects of GA on growth performance. In the experiment, it was shown that piglets' growth performance was not affected negatively, nor was the fecal score, when fed increasing levels of PPC and hence increasing GA. All diets were formulated to meet the national nutritional requirements for weaner pigs. Interestingly, one of the dietary treatments with high inclusion of standard PPC (and thus GA) displayed greater performance as compared with the group fed a diet without standard PPC. Therefore, it was concluded that standard PPC can be included with high inclusion rates in weaner diets without negatively affecting growth performance or fecal score and that the focus must be on the GA content of the diets rather than the inclusion rate of the standard PPC. Glycoalkaloids (GA) are anti-nutritional factors in standard potato protein concentrate (PPC) fed to piglets. Increasing levels of standard PPC was expected to affect growth performance and fecal score negatively. Seven-hundred-and-twenty pigs (7-30 kg) were fed one of the following four diets within three feeding phases (days 0-13, 13-24, and 24-45): control (CTRL), PPC standard inclusion (PPC-S; 4%, 2%, and 0%), high PPC inclusion (PPC-H; 8%, 3.5%, and 2%), and extremely high PPC inclusion (PPC-EH; 12%, 5%, and 3.5%). During days 0-13, CTRL displayed no difference in growth performance compared with the three experimental groups (PPC-S, PPC-H, and PPC-EH). During days 13-24, PPC-H achieved greater (p < 0.001) average daily feed intake (ADFI) compared to CTRL. During days 24-45, no differences between groups were observed. For the overall experimental period (0-45 days), PPC-H displayed greater average daily gain (ADG) (p = 0.010) and ADFI (p = 0.024) compared to CTRL. The feed conversion ratio (FCR) remained unaffected between the groups for all experimental periods. Increasing levels of PPC and hence GA did not affect the probability of diarrhea. In conclusion, increased standard PPC and hence increased levels of GA in isonitrogenous diets did not negatively affect growth performance nor fecal score in piglets (7-30 kg).

AB  - In the northern spurs of the Manchurian-Korean Mountains (Primorskii krai), an assembly of dung beetles inhabiting cow dung has been studied. Data on the species composition, population dynamics, and number and biomass of the dung beetles are presented. A comparison of the assemblies of sheep and cow dung beetles in the conditions of the northern spurs of the Manchurian-Korean Mountains has shown that, despite the fact that these assemblies are geographically located in identical areas, formed on the basis of a common pool of species, and have a similar species composition of beetles, the structural features of these assemblies, as well as the dynamic processes taking place in them, have significant differences. This is expressed in a richer species composition in cow dung, in the number of species in individual functional groups, in differences in dominant species, in features of the seasonal distribution of abundance and biomass (including the peak values of these indicators for individual functional groups of dung beetles), and in aggregate indicators of overlapping temporal aspects and ecological niches of coprophilous scarab beetles. It is suggested that the above differences are due to both the historical processes of the formation of assemblies and abiotic factors, first and foremost, by the size and consistency of substrate.

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs), as post-transcriptional gene mediators, regulate the biological characteristics of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs), including proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. However, the potential roles and mechanisms by which miR-101-5p affected the biological characters of goat SSCs have not been fully elucidated. Herein, we reported that miR-101-5p overexpression decreased cell viability (P < 0.01), arrested cell cycle in the G1 phase (P < 0.05), and aggravated apoptosis of goat SSCs (P < 0.01) compared with negative control (NC), as determined by CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry analysis. Additionally, PCNA protein expression was attenuated by miR-101-5p overexpression (P < 0.05). Notably, the expression of SSCs specific genes Oct4 (P < 0.05), PLZF (P < 0.01) and DAZL (P < 0.01) were decreased in miR-101-5p overexpressed SSCs. Furthermore, the dual luciferase reporter assay showed that, when cotransfected with miR-101-5p mimics, the relative luciferase activity of EZH2 wide-type (WT) was inhibited (P < 0.05) compared with the transfection of EZH2 mutant (MUT). EZH2 expression was negatively correlated with miR-101-5p expression in goat SSCs. Collectively, our data implicates that miR-101-5p overexpression aggravates cell apoptosis, and suppresses cell proliferation of goat SSCs via targeting EZH2, which may impair spermatogenesis.

AB  - Simple Summary Animal houses are the main place for animal production in intensive breeding and adopting related housing and management systems can improve the environment in houses. The present experiment was designed and conducted to study the effects of housing and management systems on the growth, immunity, antioxidant, and related biochemical indexes of donkeys in a cold climate. The results showed that adopting windproof facilities can effectively improve growth performance, enhance immune function and antioxidant enzyme activity, and maintain relatively steady biochemical indicators of donkeys. The study was designed with a 2 x 2 factorial experiment to evaluate the effects of growth performance, immune function, antioxidant status, blood biochemical indexes, and hormone levels of donkeys in different housing and management systems in cold weather. Twenty-four male donkeys with similar body weight and age were randomly allocated into four treatment groups that were as follows: a cold-water-drinking group without a windproof facility, a lukewarm-water-drinking group without windproof facilities, a cold-water-drinking group with a windproof facility, and a lukewarm-water-drinking group with a windproof facility. The experiment lasted for 42 days. The results showed that windproof facilities increased average daily gain (ADG) and decreased average daily feed intake (ADFI) and feed-to-gain ratio (F:G) at all time periods (p < 0.01) of the experiment. Windproof facilities increased the digestibility of dry matter (DM), crude fat (CF), crude protein (CP), ash, calcium (Ca), and phosphate (P) on day 21 (p < 0.01), and increased the digestibility of DM, CF, ash, and P on day 42 (p < 0.01). The respiration rate and the skin temperature of the abdomen and legs increased (p < 0.05) and rectal temperature tended to increase (p = 0.083) by adopting windproof facilities at 07:00; the windproof facilities tended to increase the skin temperature of the ears and abdomen (p = 0.081, p = 0.091) at 14:00. For the blood parameters, with windproof facilities, the concentrations of total protein (TP), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), triglyceride (TG) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) increased (p < 0.05) and glucose (GLU) concentration decreased (p < 0.05) at 07:00 on day 21; the concentrations of TG and cholesterol (CHO) increased and the concentrations of TP, BUN, and GLU decreased at 07:00 on day 42 (p < 0.05). The concentrations of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol (COR), triiodothyronine (T3), and thyroxine (T4) decreased (p < 0.05) at 07:00 on day 21, and T4 concentration decreased (p < 0.05) at 07:00 on day 42. The concentrations of interleukin-4 (IL-4), immunoglobulin A (IgA), immunoglobulin G (IgG), and immunoglobulin M (IgM) increased (p < 0.01) and the concentrations of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) decreased (p < 0.01) on days 21 and 42. The activities of total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) increased (p < 0.05), and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration decreased (p < 0.01) on day 21; the activities of T-SOD and catalase (CAT) increased (p < 0.05), and MDA concentration decreased (p < 0.01) on day 42. However, under the conditions of this experiment, water temperature did not affect the above indexes on days 21 and 42. These results indicated that adopting windproof facilities in a cold climate can mitigate the effects of atrocious weather on the production performance of donkeys.

AB  - Background: The CTNND2 gene which encodes a delta-catenin protein (CTNND2) is associated with multi-ple severe neurological disorders. However, the specific role of CTNND2 in spatial cognition and related mecha-nisms remains obscure. Methods: In this study, we gen-erated a new line of Ctnnd2-Knock out (KO) mice with its exon2 deleted, and then characterized their behavioral phenotypes and explore the Biological mechanism. Re-sults: Ctnnd2-KO mice were with typical autism-like be-haviors as evidenced by reduced social interaction in three-chamber sociability test, more frequent stereotypic behav-iors (self-grooming), and deficits in spatial learning and memory tested by the Morris water maze. Furthermore, the expression of Rictor protein, a core component of the mTORC2 complex, was significantly decreased in the hippocampus of mutant mice. ShRNA-induced knockdown of Rictor protein in the hippocampus of both Ctnnd2-KO mice and wild-type mice exacerbated spatial learning and memory deficits but did not affect their autism-like behaviors. Mechanistically, the hippocampal CA1 neurons of Ctnnd2-KO mice showed decreased actin polymerization, postsynaptic spine density. Down-regulation of Rictor resulted in altered expression of post-synaptic proteins such as GluR1 and ELKS, but not presynaptic protein Synapsin1, implying abnormal synaptic changes in KO mice. Conclusion: The CTNND2 gene is involved in spatial learning and memory via Rictor-mediated actin polymerization and synaptic plasticity. Our study provides a novel insight into the role and mechanisms of the Ctnnd2 gene in cognition at the molecular and synaptic levels.

AB  - Purpose The boom in Burkina Faso's artisanal gold mining since 2007 has attracted populations from Cote d'Ivoire and Guinea, which are the West African countries most affected by human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) and therefore increases its risk of re-emergence. Our aim was to update the HAT data in Burkina Faso in the risk of the re-emergence context with the advent of artisanal gold mining. Methods The study was carried out in the southwestern Burkina Faso where entomological surveys were conducted using biconical traps in March 2017. Follow by an active medical survey in April 2017, which was targeted the gold panners in 7 villages closer to artisanal gold sites, using CATT, mini-anion exchange centrifugation technique, trypanolysis test (TL) and ELISA test to measure human/tsetse contacts. The buffy coat technique and the TL were also applied in pigs to check their reservoir role of human trypanosomes. Results Our results have shown no case of HAT among 958 individuals tested and all the 50 pigs were also negative, but the level of antibodies against tsetse saliva evidenced by ELISA revealed low human/tsetse contact. Moreover, gold panners practise agriculture and breeding in an infected tsetse area, which are increased the risk. Conclusion Our results illustrate that the risk of re-emergence is low. The passive surveillance system implemented in 2015 in southwestern Burkina Faso is needed to increase the sentinel sites to better cover this area by taking into account the gold mining. Finally, awareness-raising activities are needed among populations about HAT.

AB  - Heat stress (HS) poses a substantial threat to animal growth and development, resulting in declining performance and economic losses. The intestinal system is susceptible to HS and undergoes intestinal hyperthermia and pathological hypoxia. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha), a key player in cellular hypoxic adaptation, is influenced by prolyl-4-hydroxylase 2 (PHD2) and heat shock protein 90 (HSP90). However, the comprehensive regulation of HIF-1 alpha in the HS intestine remains unclear. This study aims to explore the impact of HS on pig intestinal mucosa and the regulatory mechanism of HIF-1 alpha. Twenty-four Congjiang Xiang pigs were divided into the control and five HS-treated groups (6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h). Ambient temperature and humidity were maintained in a thermally-neutral state (temperature-humidity index (THI) < 74) in the control group, whereas the HS group experienced moderate HS (78 < THI <84). Histological examination revealed villus exfoliation after 12 h of HS in the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum, with increasing damage as HS duration extended. The villus height to crypt depth ratio (V/C) decreased and goblet cell number increased with prolonged HS. Quantitative real-time PCR, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry analysis indicated increased expression of HIF1 alpha and HSP90 in the small intestine with prolonged HS, whereas PHD2 expression decreased. Further investigation in IPEC-J2 cells subjected to HS revealed that overexpressing PHD2 increased PHD2 mRNA and protein expression, while it decreases HIF-1 alpha. Conversely, interfering with HSP90 expression substantially decreased both HSP90 and HIF-1 alpha mRNA and protein levels. These results suggest that HS induces intestinal hypoxia with concomitant small intestinal mucosal damage. The expression of HIF-1 alpha in HS-treated intestinal epithelial cells may be co-regulated by HSP90 and PHD2 and is possibly linked to intestinal hyperthermia and hypoxia.

AB  - The impact of COVID-19 restrictions on human and vehicular mobility on the number of roadkills of wild mammals, and roe deer in particular, was assessed in Lithuania. We statistically analyzed the distribution of all mammals and roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) as the most abundant species annually from 2002 to 2022 and monthly from 2020 to 2021, including during the two restriction periods. Notably, there was a marked decrease in roadkill incidents on main, national and regional roads, particularly in April-May 2020 (the beginning of lockdown period I) and November-December 2020 (the beginning of lockdown period II), 5.1-20.8% and 33.6-54.4%, respectively. During these months, collisions with mammals on the A14 main road were reduced by 75-90%. However, there was a significant increase in the number of roadkills in urban areas, resulting in the total number of mammal-vehicle and roe deer-vehicle collisions in 2020 and 2021 being higher than expected based on long-term trends. However, after restrictions were eased, collision numbers with wildlife on the main, national and regional roads increased again and became higher than expected.

AB  - For data-limited fish species, sustainable management frequently relies on biological metrics that are derived from life-history trait data, as opposed to high-resolution time series of catch and abundance. These biological metrics are used to assess a species' recovery potential at low population densities, as well as their extinction risk. However, for really data poor species, the life-history traits required to derive these metrics are also often only partially known. Addressing this gap is essential for informing regulatory and conservation actions for vulnerable species and stocks lacking assessments. We developed a generalisable, phylogenetically informed framework for imputing missing life-history traits across different taxa and applied it to 57 species within the order Rhinopristiformes (rhino rays), an evolutionarily distinct and highly threatened group with notably sparse life-history data. We then used the imputed traits to derive four key management and conservation metrics: steepness of the Beverton-Holt stock-recruitment relationship, spawning potential ratio at maximum sustainable yield, maximum intrinsic population growth rate and generation length. We found strong correlations between mean life-history traits and three management metrics. While uncertainty in management metrics remained high due to intraspecific variability, measurement error and limited data, using reconstructed traits reduced uncertainty compared to using surrogate trait data from other populations or congeneric species. We provide imputed trait values and corresponding management and conservation metrics alongside uncertainty bounds that should be recognised in any subsequent conservation assessments and management strategy evaluations. The proposed framework enables the generation of first-order, evidence-based management and conservation metrics for data-limited taxa, thereby supporting more informed decision-making for species without comprehensive species-level assessments.

AB  - While transgenic Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) maize provides pest resistance and a reduced application of chemical pesticides, a comprehensive environmental risk assessment is mandatory before its field release. This research determined the concentrations of Bt protein in plant tissue and in arthropods under field conditions in Gongzhuling City, northeastern China, to provide guidance for the selection of indicator species for non-target risk assessment studies. Bt maize expressing Cry1Ab/2Aj and non-transformed near-isoline were grown under identical environmental and agricultural conditions. Cry1Ab/2Aj was detected in plant tissues and arthropods collected from Bt maize plots during pre-flowering, flowering, and post-flowering. The expression of Cry1Ab/2Aj varied across growth stages and maize tissues, as well as in the collected arthropods at the three growth stages. Therefore, representative species should be chosen to cover the whole growing season and to represent different habitats and ecological functions. Dalbulus maidis (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae), Rhopalosiphum padi (Hemiptera: Aphididae), Heteronychus arator (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae), and Somaticus angulatus (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) are suitable non-target herbivores. Propylea japonica (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), Paederus fuscipes (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae), Chrysoperla nipponensis (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae), and spiders are suggested predators. Apis cerana and Apis mellifera ligustica (both Hymenoptera: Apidae) represent pollinators and Folsomia candida (Collembola: Isotomidae) decomposers.

AB  - Tetranychus evansi mite is a specialist pest of tomato plants. The resistance of tomatoes to these pests relies upon biochemical reactions that increase levels of defensive compounds. Here, we evaluated the effects of T. evansi associated microbiota in the defensive biochemical responses of tomatoes as well as in the proteolytic activity of the mite. Furthermore, we assessed the oviposition rate of T. evansi mites feeding on tomato plants previously infested by antibiotic-treated(+TCN) or not(-TCN) and T. urticae. When treated with the antibiotic, T. evansi induced lipase and lipoxygenase activities in tomato leaflets to levels similar to the non-suppressor T. urticae. Unlike T. urticae, there was no induction of protease inhibitors by T. evansi even in the plants infested by mites with compromised microbiota. The polyphenol oxidase activity only increased in plants infested by T. evansi with their microbiota intact. Although the total proteolytic capacity was unaffected on antibiotic-treated T. evansi, their trypsins and chymotrypsins showed increased and reduced activities over non-treated mites, respectively. Furthermore, T. evansi presented similarly reduced oviposition when feeding on plants previously infested by antibiotic-treated(+TCN) co-specifics and T. urticae. This study showed that tomato defense responses change on the presence of associated bacteria in the mite T. evansi. The removal of bacteria associated with T. evansi forces the mites on changing their proteolytic profile to maintain total proteases activity at normal levels. The reduced capacity of manipulating plant's defenses and the metabolic cost spent to keep normal proteolysis when losing bacteria associated are mirrored in T. evansi reproduction.

AB  - Deformed wing virus (DWV) infection is believed to be closely associated with colony losses of honeybee (Apis mellifera) due to reduced learning and memory of infected bees. The adenosine (Ado) pathway is important for maintaining immunity and memory function in animals, and it enhances antivirus responses by regulating carbohydrate metabolism in insects. Nevertheless, its effect on the memory of invertebrates is not yet clear. This study investigated how the Ado pathway regulates energy metabolism and memory in honeybees following DWV infection. Decreased Ado receptor (Ado-R) expression in the brain of infected bees resulted in a carbohydrate imbalance as well as impairments of glutamate-glutamine (Glu-Gln) cycle and long-term memory. Dietary supplementation with Ado not only increased the brain energy metabolism but also rescued long-term memory loss by upregulating the expression of memory-related genes. The present study demonstrated the regulation of the Ado pathway upon DWV infection and provides insights into the mechanisms underlying energy regulation and the neurological function of honeybees.

AB  - Mammalian spermatozoa are a notable example of metabolic compartmentalization.(1) Energy in the form of ATP production, vital for motility, capacitation, and fertilization, is subcellularly separated in sperm cells. While glycolysis provides a local, rapid, and low-yielding input of ATP along the flagellum fibrous sheath, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), far more efficient over a longer time frame, is concentrated in the midpiece mitochondria.(2) The relative weight of glycolysis and OXPHOS pathways in sperm function is variable among species and sensitive to oxygen and substrate availability.(3-5 )Besides partitioning energy production, sperm cell energetics display an additional singularity: the occurrence of sperm-specific gene duplicates and alternative spliced variants, with conserved function but structurally bound to the flagellar fibrous sheath.(6,7 )The wider selective forces driving the compartmentalization and adaptability of this energy system in mammalian species remain largely unknown, much like the impact of ecosystem resource availability (e.g., carbohydrates, fatty acids, and proteins) and dietary adaptations in reproductive physiology traits.(8) Here, we investigated the Cetacea, an iconic group of fully aquatic and carnivorous marine mammals, evolutionarily related to extant terrestrial herbivores.(9) In this lineage, episodes of profound trait remodeling have been accompanied by clear genomic signatures.(10-14) We show that toothed whales exhibit impaired sperm glycolysis, due to gene and exon erosion, and demonstrate that dolphin spermatozoa motility depends on endogenous fatty acid b-oxidation, but not carbohydrates. Such unique energetic rewiring substantiates the observation of large mitochondria in toothed whale spermatozoa and emphasizes the radical physiological reorganization imposed by the transition to a carbohydrate-depleted marine environment.

AB  - This research took two varieties of Camellia oleifera ("Huajin" and "Ganzhou No 70") with significantly different aluminum (Al) tolerance as subjects and adopted the soil culture method to study the effects of phosphorus (P) on the growth of Camellia oleifera, and the Al forms and enzyme activity in the rhizosphere soil of Camellia oleifera under Al stress. The research results revealed that for the two varieties Huajin and Ganzhou No 70 applied with 0.2 g/kg aluminum and 0.45 g/kg phosphorus, the root biomass respectively increased by 52.17 and 145% compared with the group without phosphorus application. Phosphorus can significantly alleviate the inhibitory effect of aluminum on the root growth of Camellia oleifera, increase root biomass and root-shoot (R/S) ratio, and such effect is more obvious on the Al-sensitive variety. Under the effect of Al-P interaction, the content of exchangeable aluminum in the rhizosphere soil decreased significantly, and the content of adsorbed hydroxy aluminum and complexed aluminum with smaller toxicity increased significantly. Soil enzyme activity was more sensitive to the mass fraction of phosphorus, the application of phosphorus enhanced catalase activity and decreased the activity of urease and invertase, indicating that phosphorus could activate catalase in Al-stressed soil, which is beneficial to the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide in the rhizosphere soil and plant body of Camellia oleifera, and alleviating the inhibitory effect of aluminum toxicity on plant growth.

AB  - PurposeOver the past three decades, open-pit mining has been expanding in arid and semi-arid areas of China.Open-pit mining profoundly changes the soil environment and has a profound impact on the circulation of soil water in the aeration zone.Therefore, this research explores the impacts of open-pit coal mining on soil moisture processes in the semi-arid grasslands of Eastern Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China.Materials and methodsSoil samples were collected from depths of 0-500 cm at Shengli No. 1 open-pit mine's inner dump and a nearby natural grassland. These soil samples were analyzed for stable isotope characteristics (delta 2H,delta 18O\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${\delta <^>2 H, \delta <^>{18} O}$$\end{document}) and moisture content. Collection of underground water samples inside and outside the mining area for conductivity analysis.Results and discussionSoil evaporation loss in the mine's inner dump was significantly higher than in the grassland, with rates of 22.26% for delta 18O\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${\delta <^>{18} O}$$\end{document} and 6.61% for delta 2H\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${\delta <^>2 H}$$\end{document}. The limiting depth of soil evaporation at the mine was found to be 260 cm, compared to 200 cm in the grassland. The increased underground water conductivity in the mine area was linked to heightened soil evaporation loss. Isotopic profiling of the soil indicated that the open-pit mining led to deeper preferential flow infiltration during heavy precipitation, reaching 280 cm in the mine area versus 220 cm in the grassland.ConclusionsThe surface soil moisture content (SMC) increased due to mining activities intensified water-heat exchanges with the atmosphere, leading to more frequent and severe wet-dry cycles. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of open-pit mining's impact on SMC, evaporation, and infiltration in semi-arid areas, offering critical insights for ecological reclamation and sustainable mine construction.

AB  - Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz is one of the oldest oilseed crops in Europe. Over the last twenty years, it has reemerged as a very promising alternative oilseed crop. Camelina has broad environmental adaptability, a wide range of resistances to pests and diseases, low-input requirements, and multiple industrial and feed applications exist for its seed oil and meal. In a multi-environment study conducted in Serbia, seven yield-related traits, including plant height (PH), height to the first branch (HFB), number of lateral branches (NLB), number of seed capsules per plant (NSCP), number of seeds per plant (NSP), mass of seeds per plant (MSP), and the total percentage of oil in the seed (TPOS), were analyzed in 20 spring camelina accessions. The combination of two years, two locations, and two sowing dates (autumn and spring) resulted in eight different environments across which the performance of the accessions was evaluated. The aims of the study were (a) to provide a phenotypic characterization and performance evaluation of the camelina accessions, (b) to identify correlations between the selected traits, and (c) to determine the effect of environmental factors on the traits. Environments contributed to the largest proportion in the total variance, explaining approximately 90% of the variance for all traits, except for NLB (70.96%) and TPOS (42.56%). The additive main effects and multiplicative interaction model (AMMI) showed that the weather conditions, and seeding dates were the most influential environmental factor. Location had a minor to moderate effect on the investigated traits. Lines CK3X-7 and Maksimir had the highest seed yields, and CK2X-9 and CJ11X-43 had the highest seed oil contents. All four lines had good adaptability and yield stability, making them the most suitable candidates for cultivation in the environmental conditions of Serbia in southeastern Europe. The present results reveal a potential for developing higher-yielding camelina cultivars with increased seed oil content and improved adaptability to various environmental conditions.

AB  - AimsThe present study employed a network analysis approach to scrutinize a pig supply chain in a repeated outbreak province for human streptococcosis in Thailand and identified important actors that should be focused on for tailoring appropriate interventions.Methods and ResultsNakhon Sawan province was chosen as the study site as the cases of human streptococcosis have been consecutively reported since 2014, with the number of cases ranging from 21 to 63. A questionnaire survey was used to collect data from actors along the pig supply chain, including pig farms, slaughterhouses, pork sellers, restaurants and customers. A one-mode-directed network was then constructed. Degree and betweenness centrality values were measured. We found that the supply chain of pork products comprised 314 nodes and 296 directed ties. A retailer got the highest overall degree, out-degree and betweenness centrality values at 35, 34, and 65.3, respectively. For in-degree centrality, the highest was identified in a customer at 9. Interestingly, this customer bought pork products from nine different mobile groceries.ConclusionsBoth public health and veterinary authorities should extend their surveillance activities to cover all actors in the supply chain to strengthen overall disease prevention and control for streptococcosis.

AB  - Colostrum is gaining popularity in cosmetic products. The present study compared the composition and selected biological properties of colostrum from Polish sheep (colostrum 1) and Swiss sheep (colostrum 2), particularly those that can affect healthy or diseased skin. The antioxidant activity of the colostrums was measured using ABTS and DPPH assays. The effect on the proliferation of human skin fibroblasts, neonatal epidermal keratinocytes, and human diabetic fibroblast (dHF) cells isolated from diabetic foot ulcers was also assayed in vitro by MTT and Presto Blue tests, respectively. The colostrum simulated dHF cell proliferation by up to 115.4%. The highest used concentration of colostrum 1 stimulated normal fibroblast proliferation by 191.2% (24 h) and 222.2% (48 h). Both colostrums inhibited epidermal keratinocyte viability. The influence of the colostrums on the expression of genes related to proliferation (Ki67) and immune response (IL-6, PTGS-2, TSG-6) in dHF cells were compared. Colostrum 1 increased the rate of wound closure (scar test). Analysis of total fat, protein and fatty acid content found the Polish colostrum to be a richer source of fat than the Swiss colostrum, which contained a larger amount of protein. Both colostrums exhibit properties that suggest they could be effective components in cosmetic or medicinal formulations for skin care, especially supporting its regeneration, rejuvenation, and wound healing.

AB  - Simple Summary African swine fever is a deadly disease affecting pigs worldwide, causing major economic losses. The virus strain causing the current outbreak in Europe and Asia, known as genotype II, was first identified in Georgia in 2007. This study aimed to analyze the genetic makeup of a strain found in Thailand to better understand its characteristics and how it compares to other strains in Asia. The viral DNA from an infected pig was analyzed and was found to be almost identical to strains from Georgia and China. The Thai strain had eight unique genetic changes, including small mutations in specific genes and deletions in others. This detailed genetic analysis helps track the spread and evolution of the virus, providing important information for developing strategies to control future outbreaks. By understanding these genetic differences, improved measures to protect pig populations can be implemented, thereby reducing the economic impact on the agricultural industry.Abstract African swine fever virus (ASFV) has been responsible for the globally devastating epidemics in wild and domesticated pigs. Of the 24 identified ASFV genotypes, genotype II is the primary cause for the pandemic occurring in Europe and Asia since its emergence in Georgia in 2007. The current study aimed to characterize the full-length genomic pattern of the ASFV strain from Thailand, TH1_22/CR (Accession No. PP915735), which was then compared with genomic diversity across other Asian isolates using Georgia 2007/1 (Accession No. FR682468) as the reference. Viral DNA was isolated from the pig spleen sample following library preparation and paired-end sequencing using the MiSeq Illumina platform. The sequenced TH1_22/CR isolate spanned 189,395 nucleotides encoding 193 open reading frames (ORFs), exhibiting maximum nucleotide similarity (99.99%) with Georgian (Georgia 2007/1) and Chinese (Wuhan 2019-1 and China HLJ) isolates. Based on phylogenetic analysis, the TH1_22/CR isolate (Accession No. PP915735) was characterized as genotype II, serogroup 8, and IGR-II due to the presence of three tandem repeat sequences (TRSs). Genetic variations including SNPs and single and polynucleotide indels were identified in TH1_22/CR in agreement with other Asian isolates. For comprehensive analysis, the genome was divided into four regions (I-IV) based on gene location. Overall, the TH1_22/CR isolate demonstrated eight SNPs and indels in its genome. Two unique SNPs were reported in the coding regions of the TH1_22/CR isolate, out of which, a C-591-T substitution was seen in MGF 360-4L and a C-297-T was found in A238L, and four unique SNPs were reported in non-coding regions (NCRs). Furthermore, a 29 bp deletion was observed in the IGR between MGF 110-13La and MGF 110-13Lb, as well as 52 bp deletion in the ASFV G ACD 00350 gene. This comparative analysis establishes the foundational information for future studies on the diversity and phylogeography of this regionally significant genetic sub-group of ASFV.

AB  - In the eastern North Pacific, the Guadalupe Island Biosphere Reserve (GIBR) is one of the most renowned white shark (Carcharodon carcharias) aggregation sites studied to date, and an important tourism activity has been developed in the reserve. This study used tourist-based cage diving activities to biologically monitor white sharks from 2014 to 2019 within the GIBR. The data indicated a gradual increase in the overall abundance of white sharks with an age-structure shift, as young of the year and juvenile sharks were more prevalent during the latter part of the study period (2016-2019). The arrival of young of the year and juvenile white sharks coincided with regional changes in oceanographic conditions off California and Baja California. The arrival of adult female white sharks coincided with the seasonal peak in elephant seal abundance. Records of high-risk white shark behaviours, a shift to sharks of younger ages, and the high prevalence of small individuals during cage diving activities supports the need for the continued revision of tourism operational protocols. This study highlights the importance of white shark biological monitoring to identify threats and challenges to the growing tourism industry and the management of the species in Guadalupe Island and in other aggregation sites.

AB  - Bisphenol S (BPS) exerts toxic effects on hippocampal HT22 cells, endocrine secretion, and reproductive capacity. However, whether BPS exerts toxic effects on the heart requires further investigation. Therefore, we investigated the effects of BPS on mouse heart tissues and predicted possible underlying molecular mechanisms of action. Our study showed that BPS induced apoptosis, increased oxidative stress response. Using electron microscopy, we found that BPS disrupted sarcomere arrangement in myocardial cells and caused reduction in the number of plasmalemmal vesicles in endothelial cells in the mouse heart tissues. Also, BPS increased expression levels of P-NF-xB in mouse heart tissues. Furthermore, we found that BPS induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, NF-xB activation, promoted apoptosis, elevated expression of BAX and Caspase 3, and decreased expression of Bcl-2 in H9c2 cells and HUVECs. However, after the addition of n-acetylcysteine or pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate, ROS generation, NF-xB activation, apoptosis, and expression of BAX and Caspase 3 were reduced, whereas expression of Bcl-2 was elevated.

AB  - Simple Summary S100A7 plays an essential role in goat mammary glands for a broad spectrum of resisting the invasion and infection of pathogenic microorganisms, and also is considered an alternative strategy for preventing and treating mastitis to broad-spectrum antibacterial strategies, with almost no resistance. As we know, estrogen also participates in the body's immune functions, acting either as pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory mediators, yet whether estrogen is involved in the expression and secretion of S100A7 remains unclear. In the present study, the relationship between estrogen and S100A7 concentration in goat milk was positive, and the regression equation was y = 0.3206x + 23.459; then the goat mammary epithelial cells (gMECs) were isolated and treated with estradiol; the results showed that the expression and secretion of S100A7 were induced with estradiol treatment via the ERK1/2-signaling pathway, and both nuclear and membrane receptors participated in this process. This study provides evidence that estradiol induces the expression and secretion of antimicrobial peptide S100A7 in gMECs through the ERK1/2-signaling pathway, and lays a theoretical foundation for exploring the phenomenon that the incidence of clinical mastitis is highest during the dry period and perinatal period, and the role of estradiol in regulating the synthesis and secretion of S100A7 in gMECs. S100A7 has received extensive attention in the prevention and treatment of mastitis across a broad spectrum, yet there is a little information about its mechanism, especially in the immunomodulatory effects of estrogen. In the present study, based on the milk bacteriological culture (BC) of 30 dairy goats, the concentration of both estrogen and S100A7 in the BC-positive samples was not significantly different than in the BC-negative samples; the estrogen abundance in subclinical and clinical mastitis samples also showed only a limited difference; compared with healthy samples, the S100A7 abundance in subclinical mastitis samples differed little, while it was significantly decreased in clinical mastitis samples. Moreover, the relationship between estrogen and S100A7 was positive, and the regression equation was y = 0.3206x + 23.459. The goat mammary epithelial cells (gMECs) were isolated and treated with 1, 10, 100 nM E2 and/or 5 mu g/mL lipopolysaccharide (LPS), respectively, for 6 h. Compared with control samples, 5 mu g/mL LPS, 10 nM E2 and 100 nM E2 markedly induced S100A7 expression and secretion. More than separated treatment, the cooperation of LPS and E2 also significantly increased S100A7 expression, rather than S100A7 secretion. The p-ERK was up-regulated markedly with 100 nM E2 treatment, while the expression of p-JNK, p-p38 and p-Akt had little effect. The G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1(GPER1) agonist G1 markedly induced S100A7 expression and secretion in gMECs, and the estrogen nuclear receptor antagonist ICI and GPER1 antagonist G15 significantly repressed this process. In conclusion, E2 binds to nuclear and membrane receptors to regulate the expression and secretion of S100A7 via the ERK1/2-signaling pathway in gMECs.

AB  - Extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from oviductal epithelial cells help with fertilization and embryo development. Although the effects of EVs on the developmental competence of somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) embryos are known, their impact on the production efficiency of cloned pigs in surrogate mothers is unclear. We evaluated the effects of porcine oviductal fluid-derived EVs (oEVs) on the in vitro development of SCNT embryos and production efficiency in cloned pigs. Embryos were treated with isolated and characterized oEVs for 48 h, corresponding to the residence time of fertilized embryos in the oviduct. In both parthenogenetic activation (PA) and SCNT embryos, oEV-treated groups exhibited higher rate of blastocyst formation than the controls. Gene expression analysis revealed increased expression of genes essential for early embryonic development in four-cell stage SCNT embryos, including those involved in pluripotency (POU5F1; POU class 5 homeobox 1), genome stability (Zinc finger and SCAN domain containing 4), and DNA damage response (Checkpoint kinase 1). Additionally, gene expression analysis of blastocysts from SCNT embryos showed increased expression of pluripotency (POU5F1) and Wnt signal transduction (Axis inhibition protein 2). Transfer of day-2 in vitro cultured SCNT embryos into surrogate mothers revealed no significant difference in production efficiencies between the control and experimental groups. Thus, enhanced early embryonic developmental competence observed in vitro following oEV treatment of PA or SCNT embryos did not translate into improved production efficiency of cloned pigs following embryo transfer to surrogate mothers. Hence, the impact of oEV treatment on live birth outcomes requires further investigation.

AB  - Herbivore-induced plant volatiles play a crucial role in enhancing plant resistance and adaptability. However, the key volatiles triggering this response and their activation mechanisms remain largely unknown. Although tea aphids (Toxoptera aurantii) are common tea plantation pests, the underlying biochemical pathways by which aphid-induced volatiles in Camellia sinensis contribute to aphid resistance are not well understood. In this study, we measured jasmonic acid (JA) accumulation induced by aphid feeding using LC-MS and DESI-IMS analysis. We also identified a diverse array of aphid-induced volatiles through GC-MS. Notably, tea aphids stimulated beta-Elemene accumulation, enhancing 'Shuchazao' resistance to tea aphids. We also evaluated the insecticidal activity of beta-Elemene through contact toxicity and repellent bioassays. For the first time, we identified aphid-induced CsELE as a terpene synthase enzyme catalyzing the final step in beta-Elemene biosynthesis from farnesyl pyrophosphate. Transient overexpression and gene silencing of CsELE affected beta-Elemene accumulation, thereby influencing tea plant resistance to aphids. Furthermore, Dual-Luciferase and Y1H assays revealed that MYC2a, a core transcription factor in the JA signaling pathway, positively regulates CsELE expression. Overall, this study advances our understanding of the transcriptional regulation of tea volatiles in response to pest attacks, providing new insights into the ecological significance of terpene volatiles under biotic stress.

AB  - Low selenium levels are closely associated with reduced cognitive performance and lipid dysregulation, yet the mechanism of action remains unclear. The physiological function of selenium is primarily mediated by selenoproteins. Selenoprotein H (SELENOH), as one of the selenium-containing proteins, has an unelucidated role in regulating cognitive status and lipid metabolism. In this study, we established a Selenoh gene knockout (HKO) mouse model to investigate whether Selenoh mediates the impact of selenium on cognitive function. We found that HKO mice showed a significant decline in cognition compared with the wild-type (HWT) littermates, and were not affected by deficient or excessive selenium, while no differences in anxiety and depression behavior were observed. HKO mice showed reduced myelin basic protein expression in hippocampal oligodendrocytes, with decreased glycolipid levels and increased phospholipid and sphingolipid levels in the hippocampus. Furthermore, the high-fat diet (HFD) exerted no effect on cognition and limited impact on the gene profile in the hippocampus of HKO mice. Compared with those of HWT mice, the myelination pathways in the hippocampus of HKO mice were downregulated as revealed by RNA-seq, which was further confirmed by the reduced expression levels of myelin-related proteins. Finally, HKO increased the expression of hippocampal fatty acid transporter (FATP) 4, and HFD increased the FATP4 expression in HWT mice but not in HKO mice. In summary, our study demonstrated that HKO induced cognitive decline by impairing myelination in oligodendrocytes with disrupted hippocampal lipid metabolism, which provided a novel viewpoint on the selenoprotein-mediated neurodegenerative diseases of selenium.
   This study utilizing Selenoh gene knockout mice identified that Selenoh mediates low selenium-related cognitive decline in female mice, an effect attributed to impaired oligodendrocyte myelination with disrupted lipid metabolism in the hippocampus.

AB  - Microplastics have emerged as a prominent global environmental contaminant, and they have been found in both human placenta and breast milk. However, the potential effects and mechanisms of maternal exposure to microplastics at various gestational stages on offspring neurodevelopment remain poorly understood. This investigation delves into the potential neurodevelopmental ramifications of maternal exposure to polystyrene nanoplastics (PS-NPs) during distinct phases of pregnancy and lactation. Targeted metabolomics shows that coexposure during both pregnancy and lactation primarily engendered alterations in monoamine neurotransmitters within the cortex and amino acid neurotransmitters within the hippocampus. After prenatal exposure to PS-NPs, fetal rats showed appreciably diminished cortical thickness and heightened cortical cell proliferation. However, this exposure did not affect the neurodifferentiation of radial glial cells and intermediate progenitor cells. In addition, offspring are accompanied by disordered neocortical migration, typified by escalated superficial layer neurons proliferation and reduced deep layer neurons populations. Moreover, the hippocampal synapses showed significantly widened synaptic clefts and diminished postsynaptic density. Consequently, PS-NPs culminated in deficits in anxiolytic-like behaviors and spatial memory in adolescent offspring, aligning with concurrent neurotransmitter and synaptic alterations. In conclusion, this study elucidates the sensitive windows of early -life nanoplastic exposure and the consequential impact on offspring neurodevelopment.

AB  - Adenosine 5 '-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a key regulator of sperm function and physiological metabolism. Metformin, an inexpensive and effective antioxidant, is known to play an important role in the activation of AMPK. Therefore metformin has potential to improve sperm cryopreservation. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of metformin during semen cryopreservation of sheep and to find the most effective concentration in freezing extender. Semen were cryopreserved with extender containing different concentrations of metformin (0, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 mmol/L). Sperm motility, acrosome integrity and plasma membrane integrity were measured after semen freezing and thawing. All results showed that sperm quality was significantly increased in the 1.0 mmol/L metformin-treated group compared with the control group (P < 0.05). In addition, the study showed that metformin effectively reduced the content of malondialdehyde (MDA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), and increased the activity of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) of freeze-thawed sperm (P < 0.05). The optimal concentration of metformin was 1.0 mmol/L. Moreover, the results showed that AMPK was localized in the acrosome region, junction and midsection of sperm, and p-AMPK was distributed in the post-acrosomal region, junction and midsection. Western blot analysis indicated that 1.0 mmol/L metformin stimulated the phosphorylation of AMPK in sperm. Further results showed that 1.0 mmol/L metformin significantly increased the mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta Psi m), ATP content, glucose uptake and lactate efflux of post-thawed sperm through the AMPK pathway, improved sperm quality, and increased the cleavage rate of in vitro fertilization (P < 0.05).

AB  - Background Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) is a rapid and powerful method for gene functional analysis in plants that pose challenges in stable transformation. Numerous VIGS systems based on Agrobacterium infiltration has been widely developed for tender tissues of various plant species, yet none is available for recalcitrant perennial woody plants with firmly lignified capsules, such as tea oil camellia. Therefore, there is an urgent need for an efficient, robust, and cost-effective VIGS system for recalcitrant tissues.
   Results Herein, we initiated the Tobacco rattle virus (TRV)-elicited VIGS in Camellia drupifera capsules with an orthogonal analysis including three factors: silencing target, virus inoculation approach, and capsule developmental stage. To facilitate observation and statistical analysis, two genes predominantly involved in pericarp pigmentation were selected for silencing efficiency: CdCRY1 (coding for a key photoreceptor affecting light-responsive perceivable anthocyanin accumulation in exocarps) and CdLAC15 (coding for an oxidase catalyzing the oxidative polymerization of proanthocyanidins in mesocarps, resulting in unperceivable red-hued mesocarps). The infiltration efficiency achieved for each gene was similar to 93.94% by pericarp cutting immersion. The optimal VIGS effect for each gene was observed at early (similar to 69.80% for CdCRY1) and mid stages (similar to 90.91% for CdLAC15) of capsule development.
   Conclusions Using our optimized VIGS system, CdCRY1 and CdLAC15 expression was successfully knocked down in Camellia drupifera pericarps, leading to fading phenotypes in exocarps and mesocarps, respectively. The established VIGS system may facilitate functional genomic studies in tea oil camellia and other recalcitrant fruits of woody plants.

AB  - BackgroundGlobally, approximately 60% of primate taxa are in danger of extinction and the population of 75% of primate species are declining in their natural habitats. The Endangered R. roxellana hubeiensis monkeys in Shennongjia National Park face threats due to their limited genetic diversity and restricted habitat.MethodOur study aimed to assess the health of these monkeys through focal animal sampling observations of 90 individuals from June 2023 to July 2024. Additionally, we compared the prevalence of health concerns on days with and without snow. We identified health issues in 32 individuals (46%), including wounds, signs suggesting disease, and deaths.ResultsNine lactating females one juvenile and one infant had eye injuries. We noticed three females and one male exhibiting symptoms of eye diseases. We observed that one adult male and three females showed signs of respiratory disease, while three females exhibited signs of skin disease. We found that one adult male and three females indicated signs of respiratory disease and three females showed signs of skin disease. We found that seven monkeys of different ages, including adults, juveniles and infants, died from injuries, diseases and unknown causes. Respiratory and skin disease symptoms were more common on snowy days than on non-snowy days. Additionally, physical and eye injuries were also more prevalent on snowy days.ConclusionsIn general, our study investigated the health status of Shennongjia golden snub-nosed monkeys and found signs of disease, wounds, and death. Our study also highlighted health issues in monkeys, which can help guide conservation efforts to ensure their survival in their natural habitats.

AB  - The Mountain Caracara (Phalcoboenus megalopterus) and White-throated Caracara (Phalcoboenus albogularis) are two sister species each with a limited distribution along the Andes from Ecuador to Tierra del Fuego. They occur in remote areas and are among the least known caracaras, and their diet has been little studied, particularly for the White-throated Caracara. We investigated the diet of these two caracaras by analyzing photographs provided by citizen scientists and obtained from the Macaulay Library (eBird) and iNaturalist platforms. We obtained 43 photographs for Mountain Caracara and 42 photographs for White-throated Caracara that could be used to identify food items. Photographs of the Mountain Caracara showed the species mainly feeding on carrion, often of domestic animals, followed by human foods and garbage. Photographs of the White-throated Caracara showed this species mainly feeding on carrion and garbage. However, we did find photographs of both caracaras feeding on wild species including camelids, rodents, birds, lizards, and some invertebrates. Further research should investigate possible effects of human-derived items in the diet of these caracaras, such as malnutrition due to consumption of inappropriate foods, and effects of ingestion of plastics and toxic substances.

AB  - The development of carbon dioxide removal methods, coupled with decreased CO2 emissions, is fundamental to achieving the targets outlined in the Paris Agreement limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees C. Here we are investigating the importance of the organic carbon feedstock to support silicate mineral weathering in small-scale flow through bioreactors and subsequent CO2 sequestration. Here, we combine two bacteria and two fungi, widely reported for their weathering potential, in simple flow through bioreactors (columns) consisting of forsterite and widely available, cheap organic carbon sources (wheat straw, bio-waste digestate of pig manure and biowaste, and manure compost), over six weeks. Compared to their corresponding abiotic controls, the inoculated straw and digestate columns release more total alkalinity (similar to 2 times more) and produce greater dissolved and solid inorganic carbon (29% for straw and 13% for digestate), suggesting an increase in CO2 sequestration because of bio-enhanced silicate weathering. Microbial biomass is higher in the straw columns compared to the digestate and manure compost columns, with a phospholipid fatty acid derived total microbial biomass 10 x greater than the other biotic columns. Scanning Electron Microscopy imaging shows the most extensive colonisation and biofilm formation on the mineral surfaces in the straw columns. The biotic straw and digestate columns sequester 50 and 14 mg C more than their abiotic controls respectively, while there is no difference in the manure columns. The selection of organic carbon sources to support microbial communities in the flow through bioreactors controlls the silicate weathering rates and CO2 sequestration.

AB  - Alpacas are increasingly used as a guardian species in Australian sheep flocks in an effort to improve lamb survival rates. Yet little is documented about the role and mechanisms of alpaca guarding behaviours within this environment. The first phase of this study, evaluated the temperament of 44 alpacas by assessing their behaviour when individuals were separated from herd mates. Tests included agitation while in an isolation enclosure, flight speed and behaviour in observation arena tests. The second phase of the study evaluated alpaca responses to different auditory, olfactory and visual cues representative of young lambs, adult sheep (ewes) and other novel stimuli. Alpacas (n = 24) which had not previously been exposed to sheep were individually presented with stimuli in a test arena. Behavioural responses were recorded over 2 min and analysed to compare differences between stimuli type (lamb/ewe/other) and stimuli cue form (live animal/auditory only/olfactory only/visual only). In phase one of this study alpacas exhibited little agitation while retained in an isolation enclosure with 67% of animals demonstrating a low agitation score. Females appeared to have a more 'reactive' temperament than males, exhibiting significantly faster flight speeds (P < 0.01) and more frequent pacing behaviour (P < 0.01) in the observational pen. In the arena test both male (n = 12) and female (n = 12) alpacas consistently exhibited greater attraction towards the lamb stimuli type (for all cue forms) compared to the ewe and other atypical stimuli (P < 0.05 for all comparisons). Alpacas showed the greatest attraction towards the live lamb compared to visual (P < 0.01), auditory (P < 0.01) and olfactory lamb cues (P < 0.001). Both male and female alpacas demonstrated similar response times and there were no significant differences between alpaca sex in the total time spent reacting to the lamb and ewe stimuli. This study demonstrates that alpacas exhibit a greater attraction towards or interest in young vulnerable animals such as lambs and supports the available anecdotal evidence that the use of alpacas as livestock guardians may be useful in improving lamb survival rates.

AB  - Novel food-derived anti cancerogenic bioactive peptides were characterized by goat milk pepsin hydrolysate. Pepsin treated casein fraction of goat milk caused an apoptotic cell death on the HCT116 cell lines. These bioactive peptides are encrypted in the protein structure in the inactive form and can become active during gastrointestinal digestion in the body. In this study, the possible therapeutic effect of goat milk-based bioactive peptides on human colorectal cancer cell lines was investigated. Goat milk-derived bioactive peptides were extracted from the casein and whey protein fractions using trypsin, pepsin, and papain enzymes. The bioactive peptides were characterized by the liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry. Both enzyme-treated casein and whey fractions were incubated with the HCT116 cell lines, and then the cell cytotoxicity was evaluated using MTT assay. The type of cell death was analyzed by flow cytometry using Annexin V and propidium iodide.
   Among all applications, the pepsin-treated casein fraction was the highest potential peptides that cause 80.92% apoptotic cell death. In conclusion, pepsin treated casein fraction exhibited antiproliferative activity against HCT116 cells. The bioactive peptides of this fraction can be considered as a potential source for the development of new anti cancerogenic agents.

AB  - To evaluate the phytobiotic effect of Anacardium occidentale leaf powder (AOLP) on growth performance, diarrhea incidence, blood biochemistry, and intestinal traits, seventy-two weaned piglets were randomly distributed into four groups (six replicates/group and three pigs/replicate) for 28 days, receiving a control diet (T0) or being supplemented with 5 (T1), 10 (T2), or 15 (T3) g/kg of AOLP. The diets did not affect the growth performance (p > 0.05); however, the AOLP groups had a decreased diarrhea incidence and malondialdehyde concentration (p < 0.05; 28 days). However, the AOLP groups had increased immunoglobulins (G and M) and villus heights (p < 0.05) in the duodenum. Likewise, T3 improved the number of goblet cells in the villi and the whole intestine (p < 0.01), the Mucin2 area in the jejunum and ileum (p < 0.05), occludin gene expression in the jejunum (p < 0.01), and acetic and valeric acid production (p < 0.05). Microbial diversity at the genus level was not different (p > 0.05); however, T3 increased the abundance of the Lactobacillus genus. These findings suggest that dietary supplementation with AOLP improved intestinal health by increasing antioxidant, immune, anti-inflammatory, and antidiarrheal activity in the weaned piglets.

AB  - High-fat diet-induced metabolic changes are not restricted to the onset of cardiovascular diseases, but also include effects on brain functions related to learning and memory. This study aimed to evaluate mitochondrial markers and function, as well as cognitive function, in a rat model of metabolic dysfunction. Eight-week-old male Wistar rats were subjected to either a control diet or a two-hit protocol combining a high fat diet (HFD) with the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-NAME in the drinking water. HFD plus L-NAME induced obesity, hypertension, and increased serum cholesterol. These rats exhibited bioenergetic dysfunction in the hippocampus, characterized by decreased oxygen (O2) consumption related to ATP production, with no changes in H2O2 production. Furthermore, OPA1 protein expression was upregulated in the hippocampus of HFD + L-NAME rats, with no alterations in other morphology-related proteins. Consistently, HFD + L-NAME rats showed disruption of performance in the Morris Water Maze Reference Memory test. The neocortex did not exhibit either bioenergetic changes or alterations in H2O2 production. Calcium uptake rate and retention capacity in the neocortex of HFD + L-NAME rats were not altered. Our results indicate that hippocampal mitochondrial bioenergetic function is disturbed in rats exposed to a HFD plus L-NAME, thus disrupting spatial learning, whereas neocortical function remains unaffected.
   A two-hit protocol using HFD + L-NAME induces metabolic dysfunction in rats.Spatial memory is impacted in HFD + L-NAME rats.Hippocampal but not neocortex bioenergetics is affected in HFD + L-NAME rats.OPA-1 expression is upregulated in the hippocampus of HFD + L-NAME rats.Cortical calcium dynamics was not affected by HFD + L-NAME.

AB  - Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) play a crucial role in emission control, being one of the most important sources of odor while also serving as significant precursors to secondary organic aerosols and ozone formation. Appropriate sampling methods are essential for accurately assessing the concentration and composition of VOCs within swine barns. In this study, the effects of both passive air sampling and active air sampling on VOCs were evaluated, and the influence of storage time on the VOC stability in sampling canisters for both methods was investigated. SUMMA canisters, which are electropolished and passivated with silanization, offer excellent corrosion protection and resistance to high pressure and temperature and were used in this study. The predominant component categories prevailing within the pig house were found to be oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs) and volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs), with ethanol emerging as the most abundant component of VOCs detected. Notably, the statistical analysis results revealed no significant differences between passive and active sampling regarding the impact of storage time on substance concentration. Changes in canister pressure also did not significantly affect substance stability. The results showed that the C2-C3 compounds remained relatively stable, especially within 3 days, with recoveries above 80% within 20 days. Methyl sulfide, dimethyl disulfide, and ethanol were more stable within the first week, but their recoveries significantly dropped by day 20, with methyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide at 62.3% and 65.3%, respectively. This study contributes to the development of a foundation for selecting appropriate VOC sampling methods in swine facilities for conducting a rational analysis of VOC samples.

AB  - BackgroundThis study aimed to compare sublingual microcirculatory parameters between anesthetized pigs and conscious adult humans using sidestream darkfield videomicroscopy. The overarching aim of the work was to validate the pig as an experimental model of changes in microcirculatory function following traumatic haemorrhagic shock and resuscitation.MethodsFourteen large white pigs and 14 humans were recruited for the study. Sublingual sidestream darkfield videomicroscopy clips were captured in anesthetized pigs and conscious humans. Clips underwent manual analysis in Automated Vascular Analysis 3.2 software. The total vessel density (TVD), perfused vessel density (PVD), proportion of perfused vessels (PPVs) and microvascular flow index (MFI) were quantified. An independent samples t test was used for between species comparison of microcirculatory parameters.Results and ConclusionsConscious humans had a significantly lower TVD, PVD and MFI than anesthetized pigs. No significant difference in PPVs was observed between the species. Perfusion of the microcirculation is a critical determinant of tissue metabolic function and viability. Whilst it may not be surprising that some interspecies differences in the sublingual microcirculatory anatomy were identified between pig and human subjects, it is interesting to report the insignificant difference in PPVs. This direct microcirculatory measure represents a relative change which should hold translatable value across species. We therefore conclude the pig is a suitable model for microcirculatory research and may be a suitable species to investigate changes in microcirculatory perfusion following perturbations in cardiovascular homeostasis, for example during traumatic haemorrhagic shock and resuscitation.
   Pigs are commonly used to model human microcirculatory function in various clinical states. We have compared the sublingual microcirculation in anesthetized pigs and conscious humans using sidestream darkfield videomicroscopy to validate the pig as a suitable model organism. Pigs had a higher total vessel density than humans, indicating an interspecies difference in microcirculatory anatomy. The proportion of perfused vessels (critical measure for tissue perfusion) however was not significantly different between the species (functional similarity).image

AB  - Ageratum conyzoides is a very aggressive and fast-spreading weed plant of great economic importance. Chemical herbicides have been used to control this weed, but this method has contributed to health hazards and environmental pollution. The present study evaluated the potency and safety of metabolites produced by rhizospheric fungi on the post-emergence of A. conyzoides. Fungi were isolated, and identified by phenotypic and molecular methods. The in-vitro herbicidal activity of the fungal isolates was carried out using a detached leaf necrosis assay. The secondary metabolites produced by the fungal strains were tested on post-emergence of A. conyzoides plants both in the green house and field. The fungal isolates from the rhizosphere were identified as belonging to the genera Aspergillus, Trichophyton, Fusarium, Penicillium, Mucor, Alternaria, Paecilomyces, Rhizoctonia, and Rhizopus. The in-vitro herbicidal assay revealed that 40% of the isolates induced necrotic activity. The metabolites produced by Fusarium oxysporum RF2, Alternaria alternata RF3 and F. incarnatum-equiseti RF4 showed stronger phytotoxic activities on the post-emergence of A. conyzoides in the greenhouse (70 - 90%) and field (86.5 - 100%) experiments. The safety experiments revealed that the metabolites had no toxic effect on soil microbes and crop plants. The findings of this study suggest that the metabolites from Fusarium oxysporum RF2, F. incarnatum-equiseti RF4, and Alternaria alternata RF3 could be explored as potential post-emergent biological agents for Ageratum conyzoides control on fields.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the impact of five different dietary protein levels on meat quality, serum antioxidant capacity, and intestinal microorganisms of Ningxiang pigs, thus providing new insights into their nutritional needs. One hundred and twenty-five healthy Ningxiang barrows with an average body weight of 53.19 +/- 2.12 kg were randomly divided into five groups with five replicates and five pigs per replicate. The diet was formulated using corn, soybean meal, and rice bran meal as raw materials based on net energy. Following the nutritional requirements outlined in the Nutrient Requirements of Swine in China (2020), diets with five different protein levels (crude protein: 11.09%, 12.09%, 13.09%, 14.09%, 15.09%) were formulated. The amino acid levels of lysine, threonine, tryptophan, methionine, valine, isoleucine, and other amino acids were standardized to meet the recommended values, as were other essential amino acids. The experiment lasted for 62 days. The results indicated a linear decrease in the redness and yellowness values of the Longissimus dorsi muscle with increased dietary protein, alongside a quadratic decrease in intramuscular fat (p < 0.01). Notably, muscles from pigs fed with 13.09%, 14.09%, and 15.09% protein diets exhibited significantly lower redness and yellowness than those on a 12.09% protein diet (p < 0.05). Additionally, higher dietary protein levels linearly enhanced the presence of specific fatty acids (C17:0, C17:1, C18:3n3, and C18:3n6) and certain amino acids in the Longissimus dorsi muscle, following a quadratic trend (p < 0.01). The serum GSH-Px content increased linearly with greater dietary protein levels (p < 0.05). Significant variations in cecal and colonic metabolites were observed across different protein levels, affecting the contents of putrescine, cadaverine, spermine, spermidine, and short-chain fatty acids (p < 0.05). Additionally, the increase in dietary protein levels correlates with the growth performance and amino acid profile of the Longissimus dorsi muscle in Ningxiang pigs, presenting a quadratic relationship. Concurrently, the serum antioxidant capacity and cecal bioamine content demonstrate a linear increase. Despite a balanced inclusion of six essential amino acids, both excessively high and low protein levels adversely affect growth and intestinal health. Notably, dietary protein levels of 12.09% and 13.09% yield the optimal growth performance under the specified experimental conditions.

AB  - The neurotypical spatiotemporal patterns of gene expression are disrupted in Down syndrome (DS) by trisomy of human chromosome 21 (Hsa21), resulting in altered behavioral development and brain circuitry. The Ts65Dn DS mouse model exhibits similar phenotypes to individuals with DS due to three copies of approximately one-half of the genes found on Hsa21. Dual-specificity Tyrosine Phosphorylation-regulated Kinase 1a (Dyrk1a), one of these triplicated genes, is an attractive target to normalize brain development due to its influence in cellular brain deficits seen in DS. We hypothesized that postnatal development of DYRK1A expression is dysregulated in trisomic animals, and found significant overexpression of DYRK1A in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and cerebellum at postnatal day (P) 15 in male-but not female-Ts65Dn mice. We then hypothesized the existence of sex-dependent effects of trisomy on neurobehavioral attributes during P16-17, and that administration of a DYRK1A inhibitor (CX-4945, ~75 mg/kg) beginning on P14 would normalize aberrant behavior in trisomic animals. Both male and female trisomic mice given control injections of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) displayed sustained levels of locomotor activity over a 10-minute test in contrast to the PBS-treated euploid animals that showed significant within-session habituation. Trisomic animals were more persistent in choosing to remain in home shavings in a preference test. Treatment with CX-4945 failed to confirm therapeutic effects. CX-4945 prevented growth, and both CX-4945 and its 10% dimethyl sulfoxide vehicle affected locomotor activity in trisomic and euploid groups, indicating a non-specific disruption of behavior. Despite the negative outcomes for CX-4945, the novel demonstration of sexually dimorphic DYRK1A expression in trisomic animals at P15 supports the broader hypothesis that overexpression of trisomic genes in DS can vary with age, sex, and brain region. Identifying the developmental timing of periods of dysregulated DYRK1A may be important for understanding individual differences in neurodevelopmental trajectories in DS and for developing effective therapeutic interventions targeting DYRK1A.

AB  - Introduction Cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (cVEMPs) provide an objective measure of the integrity of the sacculo-collic pathway leading to their widespread use as a clinical tool in the diagnostic vestibular test battery. Though the application of cVEMPs in preclinical models to assess vestibular function, as performed in relevant clinical populations, remains limited. The present study aimed to establish a rodent model of cVEMP with standardized methods and protocols, examine the neural basis of the responses, and characterize and validate important features for interpretation and assessment of vestibular function.Methods We compared air-conducted sound (ACS)-evoked VEMPs from the sternocleidomastoid muscles in naive Brown Norway rats. A custom setup facilitated repeatable and reliable measurements which were carried out at multiple intensities with ACS between 1 and 16 kHz and over 7 days. The myogenic potentials were identified by the presence of a positive (P1)-negative (N1) waveform at 3-5 ms from the stimulus onset. Threshold, amplitude, and latency were compared with intensity- and frequency-matched responses within and between animals.Results cVEMP responses were repeatedly evoked with stimulus intensities between 50-100 dB SPL with excellent test-retest reliability and across multiple measurements over 7 days for all frequencies tested. Suprathreshold, cVEMP responses at 90 dB SPL for 6-10 kHz stimuli demonstrated significantly larger amplitudes (p < 0.01) and shorter latencies (p < 0.001) compared to cVEMP responses for 1-4 kHz stimuli. Latency of cVEMP showed sex-dependent variability, but no significant differences in threshold or amplitude between males and females was observed.Discussion The results provide a replicable and reliable setup, test protocol, and comprehensive characterization of cVEMP responses in a preclinical model which can be used in future studies to elucidate pathophysiological characteristics of vestibular dysfunctions or test efficacy of therapeutics.

AB  - Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease (American trypanosomiasis), is a highly complex zoonosis that is present throughout South America, Central America, and Mexico. The transmission of this disease is influenced by various factors, including human activities like deforestation and land use changes, which may have altered the natural transmission cycles and their connection to the environment. In this study conducted in the Argentine Chaco region, we examined the transmission dynamics of T. cruzi by collecting blood samples from wild and domestic animals, as well as triatomine bugs from human dwellings, across five sites of varying anthropic intervention. Samples were analyzed for T. cruzi infection via qPCR, and we additionally examined triatomines for bloodmeal analysis via NGS amplicon sequencing. Our analysis revealed a 15.3% infection rate among 20 wild species (n = 123) and no T. cruzi presence in 9 species of domestic animals (n = 1359) or collected triatomines via qPCR. Additionally, we found chicken (34.28%), human (21.59%), and goat (19.36%) as the predominant bloodmeal sources across all sites. These findings suggest that anthropic intervention and other variables analyzed may have directly impacted the spillover dynamics of T. cruzi's sylvatic cycle and potentially reduced its prevalence in human habitats.

AB  - Background No doubt that the corpus luteum (CL) plays a vital role in the regulation of female cyclicity in mammals. The scenarios among microRNAs (miRNAs) and their target genes and steroid hormones {estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4)} are required for better understanding the molecular regulation of CL during its formation, maturation, and regression. We aimed to (I) study the changes in the relative abundance of miR-205, miR-26a-5p, miR-17-5p, and let-7b-5p and their target genes: LHCGR, CASP3, PCNA, AMH, and PLA2G3, during different stages of corpus luteum in Egyptian buffaloes, and (II) and to address different scenarios between steroid concentrations in the serum and the expression pattern of selected miRNAs and their targets. Methods The paired ovaries and blood samples were collected from apparently healthy 50 buffalo cows at a private abattoir. The ovaries bearing CL were macroscopically divided according to their morphological structure and color into hemorrhagic (CLH), developing (CLD), mature (CLM), regressed (CLR), and albicans (CLA). Small pieces from different stages of CL (CLH, CLD, CLM, CLR, and CLA) were cut and immediately kept at - 80 degrees C for total RNA isolation and qRT-PCR. The serum was separated for steroid level estimation. Results The LHCGR was expressed during different stages of CL, and the peak of expression was at the mid-luteal stage. The CASP3 revealed a stage-specific response at different stages of CL. The PCNA has an essential role in cellular proliferation in buffaloes CL. Both expression patterns of PLA2G3 and AMH were found over the various developmental and regression stages. It was noticed that miR-205 is conserved to target LHCGR and CASP3 transcripts. Moreover, CASP3 and AMH were targeted via miR-26a-5p. Additionally, the CASP3 and PLA2G3 were targeted via let-7b-5p. The P4 level reached its peak during CLM. There were positive and negative strong correlations between miRNAs (miR-26a-5p and miR-205), target genes (LHCGR and CASP3) during different stages of CL, and steroid hormones in the serum. Conclusions Taken together, the orchestrated pattern among miRNAs, target genes, and steroid hormones is essential for maintaining the proper development and function of CL in buffalo cows.

AB  - Background: There is no previous evidence in the literature that documents the presence of extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) or the exomorphology of domatia in Nephelium lappaceum (rambutan), a fruit tree native to Malaysia introduced in various American countries.Question: It is the presence of EFNs responsible for the frequent visit of ants to young leaves of Nephelium lappaceum?Study site and dates: This study was conducted in a commercial rambutan orchard in the town of Francisco I. Madero, municipality of Frontera Hidalgo (Chiapas, Mexico) during the period September 2020-February 2021.Methods: External morphology of EFNs and domatia were studied using scanning electron microscopy. Nectar sugar concentration produced by EFNs was determined by refractometry. EFNs location on the plant and the frequency of visiting ants were quantified by visual counting. Results: A description of the external morphology of EFNs and domatia, as well as their location on rambutan leaflets are presented. A volume of 0.3 +/- 0.2 mu L/EFN of a nectar (9.3 +/- 0.6 degrees Bx) was collected each day. Ten species of ants feeding on the nectar excreted by the EFNs were identified.Conclusion: Evidence of the presence of NEFs on rambutan leaflets is presented, which have an external morphology and location different from that observed in domatia, producing a sweet nectar used as food by a large community of ants.

TI  - A sheep pangenome reveals the spectrum of structural variations and their effects on tail phenotypes

AB  - Structural variations (SVs) are a major contributor to genetic diversity and phenotypic variations, but their prevalence and functions in domestic animals are largely unexplored. Here we generated high-quality genome assemblies for 15 individuals from genetically diverse sheep breeds using Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) high-fidelity sequencing, discovering 130.3 Mb nonreference sequences, from which 588 genes were annotated. A total of 149,158 biallelic insertions/deletions, 6531 divergent alleles, and 14,707 multiallelic variations with precise breakpoints were discovered. The SV spectrum is characterized by an excess of derived insertions compared to deletions (94,422 vs. 33,571), suggesting recent active LINE expansions in sheep. Nearly half of the SVs display low to moderate linkage disequilibrium with surrounding single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and most SVs cannot be tagged by SNP probes from the widely used ovine 50K SNP chip. We identified 865 population-stratified SVs including 122 SVs possibly derived in the domestication process among 690 individuals from sheep breeds worldwide. A novel 168-bp insertion in the 5 ' untranslated region (5 ' UTR) of HOXB13 is found at high frequency in long-tailed sheep. Further genome-wide association study and gene expression analyses suggest that this mutation is causative for the long-tail trait. In summary, we have developed a panel of high-quality de novo assemblies and present a catalog of structural variations in sheep. Our data capture abundant candidate functional variations that were previously unexplored and provide a fundamental resource for understanding trait biology in sheep.

AB  - Two species of sawfish (Pristidae) formerly inhabited the eastern Atlantic: the smalltooth sawfish (Pristis pectinata) and the largetooth sawfish (Pristis pristis). Both are listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List. Limited information is available on the historical occurrence of sawfishes in the Gulf of Guinea, or on current landings of sawfishes and other Rhinopristiformes. A rapid interview study was conducted in 2018 to assess the current status of sawfishes and to collect basic information on fisheries for guitarfishes in Ghanaian waters. Of 28 interviewees, only five recalled seeing a sawfish during their lifetime. At least two species of guitarfishes - blackchin guitarfish (Glaucostegus cemiculus) and common guitarfish (Rhinobatos rhinobatos) - were caught by fishermen and were primarily landed between November and February. Opportunistic photographs of landings suggested that G. cemiculus was the most commonly caught guitarfish species. Interviewees reported catching between two and 60 individuals per week during the peak guitarfish season. Guitarfish meat is sold and consumed locally; fishermen could sell guitarfish fins for up to US$55 per kg. The findings suggest that sawfishes are locally extinct in Ghana and that management of the guitarfish fishery is urgently required to ensure those species do not meet the same fate.

AB  - Organic fertilizers from animal production might contain undesirable components, such as veterinary medical product (VMP) residues, that are released into the environment during application. In addition to measures to reduce the use of VMPs through animal health measures, manure management could be an expedient strategy to prevent VMPs from entering the environment. The quantity applied is mainly determined by the nitrogen content. In addition, the depth of incorporation into the soil plays a major role in the environmental risk assessment of VMPs. The new regulations of the German fertilizer ordinance (DuV, 2020), which came into force at the beginning of 2020, as well as the changes that have not yet been fully implemented, will result in adjustments to the storage, application and incorporation practices for organic fertilizer. The aim of this study was to gain more information about the practice of storage, application and incorporation and the challenges for farmers in Germany. An online survey among farmers was conducted to determine the status quo. Almost all of the 125 participants kept livestock, predominantly cattle (68%) and pigs (33%). A third of participants (30%) needed a temporary storage site, for example at neighboring farms. Of the participants, 81% (n = 125) owned cropland and/or grassland. On cropland, manure was mostly incorporated at a depth of 3-15 cm, whereas on grassland, it was mostly applied superficially. On grassland lower-emission application techniques such as slot drill or injector procedures have so far rarely been used. The survey results provided important insights about storage, application and incorporation practices for organic fertilizers in Germany which could be used for the calculation of predicted environmental concentrations (PEC) as part of the environmental risk assessments of veterinary pharmaceuticals.

AB  - SHCBP1 (Shc SH2-domain binding protein 1) is a member of the Src and collagen homolog (Shc) protein family and is closely associated with multiple signaling pathways that play important roles during hair follicle induction, morphogenesis, and cycling. The purpose of this study was to investigate SHCBP1 gene expression, polymorphisms, and the association between SHCBP1 and wool quality traits in Chinese Merino sheep. The SHCBP1 gene was shown, by qPCR, to be ubiquitously expressed in sheep tissues and differentially expressed in the adult skin of Chinese Merino and Suffolk sheep. Four SNPs (termed SHCBP1SNPs 1-4) were identified by Sanger sequencing and were located in exon 2, intron 9, intron 12, and exon 13 of the sheep SHCBP1 gene, respectively. SHCBP1SNPs 3 and 4 (rs411176240 and rs160910635) were significantly associated with wool crimp (P < 0.05). The combined polymorphism (SHCBP1SNP3-SHCBP1SNP4) was significantly associated with wool crimp (P < 0.05). Bioinformatics analysis showed that the SNPs associated with wool crimp (SHCBP1SNPs 3 and 4) might affect the pre-mRNA splicing by creating binding sites for serine-arginine-rich proteins and that SHCBP1SNP4 might alter the SHCBP1 mRNA and protein secondary structure. Our results suggest that SHCBP1 influences wool crimp and SHCBP1SNPs 3 and 4 might be useful markers for marker-assisted selection and sheep breeding.

AB  - In this paper, we present a conceptual framework of human-elephant conflict (HEC) management embodying community aspects gleaned from the importance-performance analysis (IPA) for a National Park in Vietnam. Nine approaches were proposed to prevent and mitigate HEC (HEC indicators), of which six fell into different quadrants based on the respective estimations of farmer and non-farmer respondents. Both the levels of importance and performance (I-P) of the HEC indicators are evaluated between (I-P) among farmers and non-farmers. Locals perceived the importance of all HEC indicators highly, but they thought its performance is poor. Third, we confirm the factors affecting the locals' participation behavior towards HEC management based on their demographics, awareness, and behavior in terms of HEC, and their perceptions of HEC. Compared to the non-farmer residents, the farmers recognized that the management strategy of HEC must focus on the aspects of building an insurance scheme and implementing appropriate land use planning. The characteristics that affect the differentiation of the locals' participation of HEC management are: (1) higher income residents, (2) farmers, (3) residents who would like to participate in an insurance scheme, and (4) the HEC management factors. Theoretical insights and management implications are also addressed in this study.

AB  - Epidemic encephalitis B caused by Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a common zoonotic disease that poses threats to both pigs and humans. The cellular defense mechanism is closely tied to the body's resistance to viral invasion. Regulated cell death, such as ferroptosis, is a strategy employed by host cells to defend against viral invasions. To understand the effect of ferroptosis on the proliferation of JEV, experimentally infected PK15 cells were treated with a ferroptosis agonist or antagonist. The results indicated that the ferroptosis agonist can suppress JEV proliferation, whereas the ferroptosis antagonist promotes JEV proliferation. Functional enrichment analysis showed that the ferroptosis agonist Erastin and antagonist SP600125 could affect JEV proliferation through the TNF, IL-17, Toll-like receptor, PI3K-AKT, and chemokine signaling pathways, as well as ECM-receptor interactions. Combined transcriptome and proteome analyses revealed 31 important genes, which are significantly associated with ferroptosis and the inflammatory response. Our results provide a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms through which ferroptosis affects the proliferation of JEV.

AB  - The genetic diversity of endangered deer species, such as Mazama jucunda, can be preserved with the help of somatic cell cryopreservation. This procedure allows obtaining several cells from the individual even after its death, which is very important for applications in reproductive biotechnologies. This study's objective was to test cryopreservation protocols of skin fragments of M. jucunda, using different cryoprotectants in slow freezing. We evaluated four treatments, composed of three cryoprotectants, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), and ethylene glycol (EG), used alone and in combination. There was also a control group where the tissue did not undergo cryopreservation. Skin fragments were collected from the medial region of the pelvic limbs of three individuals. Each fragment was divided into 10 equal parts, standardized by weight, making two pieces for each treatment and control from each animal. The collected fragments were evaluated in culture, based on the speed of occupation of the free spaces of the cell culture flask. Cell viability was also evaluated using Trypan Blue dye and the mitotic index to understand the effect of toxicity and freezing on cell membrane integrity and cell division capacity, respectively. The treatments that used association with PVP proved to be more damaging to the cells, taking longer to reach confluence. EG alone showed better results than DMSO in the slow-freezing protocol. Clinical Trial Registration Number is 1390/21.

AB  - In the EU, sheep bred for dairy and meat purposes are of low quality, their economic value is not even enough to cover shearing costs, and their wool is generally seen as a useless by-product of sheep farming, resulting in large illegal disposal or landfilling. In order to minimize environmental and health-related problems considering elemental compositions of discarded materials such as waste wool, there is a need to recycle and reuse waste materials to develop sustainable innovative technologies and transformation processes to achieve sustainable manufacturing. This study aims to examine the application of waste wool in biocomposite production with the help of a sustainable hydrolysis process without any chemicals and binding material. The impact of superheated water hydrolysis and mixing hydrolyzed wool fibers with kraft pulp on the performance of biocomposite was investigated and characterized using SEM, FTIR, tensile strength, DSC, TGA, and soil burial testing in comparison with 100% kraft pulp biocomposite. The superheated water hydrolysis process increases the hydrophilicity and homogeneity and contributes to increasing the speed of biodegradation. The biocomposite is entirely self-supporting, provides primary nutrients for soil nourishment, and is observed to be completely biodegradable when buried in the soil within 90 days. Among temperatures tested for superheated water hydrolysis of raw wool, 150 degrees C seems to be the most appropriate for the biocomposite preparation regarding physicochemical properties of wool and suitability for wool mixing with cellulose. The combination of a sustainable hydrolysis process and the use of waste wool in manufacturing an eco-friendly, biodegradable paper/biocomposite will open new potential opportunities for the utilization of waste wool in agricultural and packaging applications and minimize environmental impact.

AB  - Simple Summary Toxoplasma gondii, Neospora caninum, and Besnoitia besnoiti are important causes of production losses in small and large ruminants. These parasites could result in severe economic losses to farmers if they are not effectively controlled. The prevalence of these parasites in smallholder farms in Malaysia is underreported. Thus, this study attempted to determine the level of exposure of cattle and goat population from 19 farms in Selangor, Malaysia to T. gondii, N. caninum, and B. besnoiti using ELISA test kits. Results revealed that the prevalence of T. gondii, N. caninum, and B. besnoiti antibodies in the sampled cattle was 5.3%, 2.5%, and 5.7%, respectively. The corresponding seroprevalence in the sampled goats was 69.8% for T. gondii and 3.9% for N. caninum antibodies. Further analyses demonstrated that older animals, semi-intensive management systems, the presence of dogs or cats on farms, a large herd size (>100 animals), and the source of replacement stock increased the risk of exposure to T. gondii. These findings reflect the extent of T. gondii, N. caninum, and B. besnoiti infections in smallholder farms in Selangor. More research is required to develop effective measures to control these important parasites at the national level. Apicomplexan parasites such as Toxoplasma gondii, Neospora caninum, and Besnoitia besnoiti are widely recognized as causes of production diseases in ruminants. This study aimed to investigate the serological occurrence of T. gondii, N. caninum, and B. besnoiti in cattle and goats from smallholder farms in Selangor, Malaysia. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 19 farms by collecting 404 bovine (n = 225) and caprine (n = 179) serum samples, which were then essayed for T. gondii, N. caninum, and B. besnoiti antibodies using commercially available ELISA test kits. Farm data and animal characteristics were documented, and the data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and logistic regression models. The seroprevalence of T. gondii at animal and farm levels in cattle was 5.3% (95% CI 1.2-7.4%) and 36.8% (95% CI 22.4-58.0%), respectively. Animal-level seropositivity for N. caninum was 2.7% (95% CI 0.4-4.2%) and 5.7% for B. besnoiti (95% CI 1.3-9.4%) with corresponding farm-level seropositivity of 21.0% and 31.5%, respectively. For the goat samples, a high animal- (69.8%; 95% CI 34.1-82.0%) and farm-level (92.3%) seropositivity was recorded for T. gondii, but was relatively lower for N. caninum antibodies, at 3.9% (95% CI 1.5-6.2%) and 38.4% (5/13). The factors associated with T. gondii seropositivity were older animals (above 12 months) (OR = 5.3; 95% CI 1.7-16.6), semi-intensive farms (OR = 2.2; 95% CI 1.3-6.2), the presence of either dogs or cats (OR = 3.6; 95% CI 1.1-12.3), a large herd size (>100 animals) (OR = 3.7; 95% CI 1.4-10.0), and a single source of replacement animals (OR = 3.9; 95% CI 1.6-9.6). These findings are vital in developing effective control measures against these parasites in ruminant farms in Selangor, Malaysia. More national epidemiological research is required to elucidate the spatial distribution of these infections and their potential impact on Malaysia's livestock industry.

AB  - Hisorb and solid-phase microextraction (SPME), two environmentally friendly micro-extraction techniques based on the same fundamental principles, were evaluated for their extraction efficiency of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from goat cheese whey wastewater. For this purpose, a sample preparation method based on the headspace-HiSorb technique was developed and evaluated for its efficiency in terms of the amount of extracted compounds and reproducibility of results. Thermal desorption-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (TD-GC/MS) and GC/MS analytical methods were used to perform the wastewater analysis, respectively. The experimental parameters of HiSorb were evaluated in terms of probe coating, extraction time, stirring speed, sample volume, extraction temperature and salt addition. Under optimal extraction conditions, it was observed that the use of the divinylbenzene/carbon wide range/polydimethylsiloxane (DVB/CWR/PDMS) triple coating for HiSorb and DVB/Carboxen (CAR)/PDMS for SPME, was best suited to extract a broader range of VOCs with higher peak intensities. A total of 34 VOCs were extracted and determined with the DVB/CWR/PDMS HiSorb probe, while only 23 VOCs were determined with the conventional DVB/CAR/PDMS SPME fiber. The DVB/ CWR/PDMS HiSorb probe has a higher adsorbent capacity which results in a higher sensitivity for VOCs compared to the DVB/CAR/PDMS SPME fiber. Furthermore, the HiSorb technique exhibits better reproducibility, as indicated by the lower relative standard deviation (RSD) of 3.7% compared to 7.1% for SPME. Therefore, the HiSorb technique is an effective method for detecting VOCs in complex matrices, such as wastewater.

AB  - Leymus chinensis (Trin.) Tzvel., also known as the "Alkali Grass", is a major forage grass in the eastern and northeastern steppe vegetation in the Songnen Prairie. It is of great practical significance for grassland management to understand the influence of animal saliva on L. chinensis during animal feeding. In this study, we used clipping and daubing animal saliva to simulate responses to grazing by L. chinensis, and analyzed the physiological and metabolomic changes in response to simulated animal feeding. Results showed that the effects of animal saliva on physiological and metabolic processes of the treated plants produced a recovery phenomenon. Moreover, the effects of animal saliva produced a large number of differential metabolites related to several known metabolic pathways, among which the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway has undergone significant and persistent changes. We posit that the potential metabolic mechanisms of L. chinensis in response to simulated animal feeding are closely related to flavonoid biosynthesis.

AB  - The sheep tick, Ixodes ricinus L. (Acari: Ixodidae), is an important vector of many pathogens of medical and veterinary significance. Determining vector abundance is a requisite of assessing potential vector-borne disease risk. Estimation of tick abundance is often conducted by blanket drag sampling a site, conducted at one time point during the day. The time of day chosen for sampling can vary, is not widely standardized and is often unreported by the investigator. This study investigated whether the time of day chosen for sampling had an effect on tick collection at an open grassland coastal site in North Devon, U.K., during May 2019 to July 2019. Tick abundance for both adults and nymphs in the evening period was more than twice that found in the mid-day sampling period. Overall abundance differed with site aspect, ground temperature and relative humidity. This study shows that for this open grassland recreational site, the time of day chosen for sampling has important implications for tick collection and the assessment of the relative risk of human exposure to ticks and tick-borne infections.

AB  - Copulatory behavior and genital morphology interact to deliver sperm more effectively during mating, but the nature of this interaction has not been explored in depth in most vertebrates. Alpacas have unusually long copulations lasting 15-20min, and a unique copulatory behavior, where the penis intromits all the way past the cervix, into the uterine horns. Here we describe the morphology of male and female genitalia and report unique morphological characteristics that may be associated with this unusual insemination mode. Vaginal shape is highly variable, and seemingly not associated with age or parity. The cranial vagina varies between bulbous and cylindrical, while the caudal vagina is typically narrower and always cylindrical. The cervix consists of a series of two to three spirals or rings, and it is often found in a relaxed state that may prevent damage caused by the cartilaginous penis tip as it pushes through the cervix to reach the uterine horns. The uterus and uterine horns have a complex shape with multiple constrictions. The cartilaginous penis tip has a sharp urethral process that may help to push against these constrictions. The diameter of the vaginal lumen is much greater than the diameter of the penis suggesting that there is little direct interaction between them, and that female vaginal shape is not under strong copulatory selection. In effect, the entire female reproductive tract of the female is interacting with the penis during copulation.

AB  - Chronic stress (Ch.S) has detrimental effects on the brain's structure and function, particularly in the hippocampus. The noradrenergic and orexinergic systems play crucial roles in the stress response and regulation of stress-related behaviors. This study aimed to investigate the interaction between noradrenergic activation and orexin receptor 1 inhibition on chronic stress-induced hippocampal alterations. The study conducted experiments on male Wistar rats, subjected to Ch.S, OXr1 blocking, noradrenergic activation, or a combination of these treatments. Plasma corticosterone level was measured using a fluorometric method. Behavioral assessment of social maze, elevated plus maze (EPM) and novel object recognition (NOR) test were performed. Then, the expression of prepro-orexin, OXr1, and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) was analyzed using semiquantitative RT-PCR. Neuronal populations were quantified through Nissl staining. The data revealed that all stress and yohimbine groups had elevated plasma corticosterone levels. Ch.S significantly altered behavior, impairing social interaction, disrupting object recognition memory and increasing anxiety-like responses in the EPM. OXr1 blocking reversed these stress-induced behavioral deficits, while yohimbine did not improve these behavioral outcomes. Chronic stress led to a significant increase in preproorexin, OXr1, and GR expression. While blocking OXr1 helped counteract these stress-induced changes, yohimbine failed to restore the expression levels. Ch.S reduced hippocampal neuronal populations, while OXr1 blocking partially reversed this effect, and yohimbine further recovered the reversal. These findings indicate that blocking hippocampal OXr1 can mitigate the adverse effects of chronic stress on both hippocampal structure and anxiety-like behaviors, while noradrenergic signaling appears to have differential effects on behavioral and cellular measures.

AB  - Body temperature is a critical indicator of pig health. This study proposes a non-contact method for detecting body temperature in group-housed pigs by extracting temperature data from thermal images of ear roots. Thermal images in the drinking trough area were captured using a thermal camera, with real-time data transmitted to a monitoring room via optical fibers. The YOLO v11m-OBB model was utilized to detect the ear root areas with oriented bounding boxes, while a novel algorithm, the two-stage left and right ear root pairing algorithm (YOLO TEPA-OBB), paired the ear roots of individual pigs using center distance clustering and angular relationships in a polar coordinate system. The maximum temperature of the ear roots was extracted to represent the body temperature. Experimental results based on 749 ear roots show that the YOLO TEPA-OBB achieves 98.7% precision, 98.4% recall, and 98.7% mean average precision (mAP) in detecting ear roots, with an ear root pairing accuracy of 98.1%. The Pearson correlation coefficient (r) between predicted and reference temperatures is 0.989, with a mean bias of 0.014 degrees C and a standard deviation of 0.103 degrees C. This research facilitates real-time body temperature monitoring and precise health management for group-housed pigs.

AB  - With further climate change still expected, it is predicted to increase the frequency with plants will be water stressed, which subsequently influences phytophagous insects, particularly Lepidoptera with limited mobility of larvae. Previous studies have indicated that oviposition preference and offspring performance of Lepidoptera insects are sensitive to drought separately. However, the integration of their two properties is not always seen. Here, we evaluated changes in oviposition selection and offspring fitness of a Lepidoptera insect under three water-stressed treatments using a model agroecosystem consisting of maize Zea mays, and Asian corn borer Ostrinia furnacalis. Results found that female O. furnacalis preferred to laying their eggs on well-watered maize, and then their offspring tended to survive better, attained bigger larvae mass, and developed more pupae and adults on the preferred maize. Oviposition selection of O. furnacalis positively correlated with height and leaf traits of maize, and offspring fitness positively related with water content and phytochemical traits of hosts. Overall, these results suggest that oviposition choice performed by O. furnacalis reflects the maximization of offspring fitness, supporting preference-performance hypothesis. This finding further highlights that the importance of simultaneous evaluation of performance and performance for water driving forces should be involved, in order to accurately predict population size of O. furnacalis under altered precipitation pattern.

AB  - Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is considered as one of the most important contagious viral diseases affecting cloven-footed animals. For effective control of FMD, immunization along with herd immunity is essential in the field conditions. To assure and track the coverage and effectiveness of the vaccination program, the serological studies are very much required after the vaccination program. The present study was aimed to investigate the prevalence of antibodies against structural proteins of FMD virus (FMDV) serotypes of O, A and Asia -1 in seven districts of western Uttar Pradesh, India, and assure the efficacy of vaccination under National Animal Disease Control Program. A total of 308 sera samples were collected from apparent healthy vaccinated cattle and buffaloes from seven districts including Amroha, Baghpat, Bareilly, Bulandsahar, Gautam Budh Nagar, Meerut and Muzaffarnagar of western Uttar Pradesh, India. Determination of antibodies against structural proteins of FMDV was carried out using solid -phase blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The protective level of the FMDV serotypes O, A and Asia -1 included in the inactivated trivalent vaccine was 66.55, 48.05 and 47.08% in bovines, respectively. To provide the higher level of protection against the circulating FMDV, the present study recommended the thorough investigation of the immunogenic interaction between the vaccine strains and the field strains. Further investigations should also be conducted with larger sample size and across diverse geographical regions to gain a more comprehensive understanding of herd immunity. (c) 2024 Urmia University.

AB  - Simple Summary Developing new antibiotic substitutes to promote pig growth and health, as well as new feed to improve feed utilization and reduce manure production during the breeding process, have become important ways to solve the current dilemma and promote the pig industry. In this study, we have documented that adding a 2% and 3% digestion-promoting fermented Chinese herbal formula to feed effectively promoted the growth of growing pigs, improved serum immune and antioxidant activities, ameliorated the structure of colonic microbiota, and altered the composition of metabolites in colon contents. In particular, adding a 2% digestion-promoting fermented Chinese herbal formula to feed effectively reduced opportunistic pathogens and increased potential probiotics in the colonic microbiota. This study provides experimental data for the application and feed development of digestion-promoting fermented Chinese herbs for pig production and expands the understanding of the impact of fermented Chinese herbs on the host's gut microbiota and metabolism.Abstract (1) Background: the development of new antibiotic substitutes to promote pig growth and health has become an important way to solve the current dilemma and promote the pig industry. (2) Methods: to assess the effects of a fermented Chinese herbal (FCH) formula on the growth and immunity of growing pigs, 100 Duroc x Landrace x Yorshire three-way crossed growing pigs were randomly divided into control and treatment groups that were fed a basal diet, and a basal diet with 1% (group A), 2% (group B), and 3% (group C) FCH formulas, respectively. A sixty-day formal experiment was conducted, and their growth and serum indices, colonic microbiota, and metabolites were analyzed. (3) Results: the daily gain of growing pigs in groups A, B, and C increased by 7.93%, 17.68%, and 19.61%, respectively, and the feed-to-gain ratios decreased by 8.33%, 15.00%, and 14.58%, respectively. Serum immunity and antioxidant activities were significantly increased in all treatment groups. Particularly, adding a 2% FCH formula significantly changed the colon's microbial structure; the Proteobacteria significantly increased and Firmicutes significantly decreased, and the metabolite composition in the colon's contents significantly changed. (4) Conclusions: these results indicate that the FCH formula is a good feed additive for growing pigs, and the recommended addition ratio was 3%.

AB  - The moth Semiothisa cinerearia (Lepidoptera: Geometridae) is a major pest of Chinese scholar trees (Sophora japonica L.). Olfaction is very important for insects to locate host plants and oviposition sites. Here, we identified the binding abilities of ScinGOBP2 for host plant volatiles using fluorescence-based competitive binding assays. We also confirmed the key amino acid residues that bind to plant volatiles in ScinGOBP2 via three-dimensional structure modeling and molecular docking. The ScinGOBP2 ligands had attractive or repellent behavioral effects on S. cinerearia for oviposition. Overall, ScinGOBP2 may play important roles in detecting host plant volatiles, and ScinGOBP2 ligands could be used as candidate olfactory regulators for the management of S. cinerearia. Herbivorous insects rely on volatile chemical cues from host plants to locate food sources and oviposition sites. General odorant binding proteins (GOBPs) are believed to be involved in the detection of host plant volatiles. In the present study, one GOBP gene, ScinGOBP2, was cloned from the antennae of adult Semiothisa cinerearia. Reverse-transcription PCR and real-time quantitative PCR analysis revealed that the expression of ScinGOBP2 was strongly biased towards the female antennae. Fluorescence-based competitive binding assays revealed that 8 of the 27 host plant volatiles, including geranyl acetone, decanal, cis-3-hexenyl n-valerate, cis-3-hexenyl butyrate, 1-nonene, dipentene, alpha-pinene and beta-pinene, bound to ScinGOBP2 (K-D = 2.21-14.94 mu M). The electrical activities of all eight ScinGOBP2 ligands were confirmed using electroantennography. Furthermore, oviposition preference experiments showed that eight host volatiles, such as decanal, cis-3-hexenyl n-valerate, cis-3-hexenyl butyrate, and alpha-pinene, had an attractive effect on female S. cinerearia, whereas geranyl acetone, 1-nonene, beta-pinene, and dipentene inhibited oviposition in females. Consequently, it can be postulated that ScinGOBP2 may be implicated in the perception of host plant volatiles and that ScinGOBP2 ligands represent significant semiochemicals mediating the interactions between plants and S. cinerearia. This insight could facilitate the development of a chemical ecology-based approach for the management of S. cinerearia.

AB  - Unlike many animals that reduce activity during fasting, northern elephant seals (NES) undergo prolonged fasting during energy-intensive life-history stages such as reproduction and molting, fueling fasting energy needs by mobilizing fat stores accrued during foraging. NES display several unique metabolic features such as high fasting metabolic rates, elevated blood lipid and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, efficient protein sparing and resistance to oxidative stress during fasting. However, the cellular mechanisms that regulate these adaptations are still not fully understood. To examine how metabolic coordination is achieved during prolonged fasting, we profiled changes in blubber, skeletal muscle and plasma proteomes of adult female NES over a 5 week fast associated with molting. We found that while blubber and muscle proteomes were remarkably stable over fasting, over 50 proteins changed in abundance in plasma, including those associated with lipid storage, mobilization, oxidation and transport. Apolipoproteins dominated the blubber, plasma and muscle proteome responses to fasting. APOA4, APOE and APOC3, which are associated with lipogenesis and triglyceride accumulation, decreased, while APOA1, APOA2 and APOM, which are associated with lipid mobilization and HDL function, increased over fasting. Our findings suggest that changes in apolipoprotein composition may underlie the maintenance of high HDL levels and, together with adipokines and hepatokines that facilitate lipid catabolism, may mediate the metabolic transitions between feeding and fasting in NES. Many of these proteins have not been previously studied in this species and provide intriguing hypotheses about metabolic regulation during prolonged fasting in mammals.

AB  - Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (ARAS) is associated with irreversible parenchymal renal disease and regenerative stem cell therapies may improve renal outcomes. Hypoxia preconditioning (HPC) may improve the regenerative functions of adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AMSC) by affecting DNA 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) marks in angiogenic genes. Here, we investigated using a porcine ARAS model, whether growth of ARAS AMSCs in hypoxia (Hx) versus normoxia (Nx) would enhance renal tissue repair, and comprehensively analyze how HPC modifies DNA hydroxymethylation compared to untreated ARAS and healthy/normal pigs (n=5 each). ARAS pigs exhibited elevated serum cholesterol, serum creatinine and renal artery stenosis, with a concomitant decrease in renal blood flow (RBF) and increased blood pressure (BP) compared to healthy pigs. Renal artery injection of either autologous Nx or Hx AMSCs improved diastolic BP, reduced kidney tissue fibrosis, and inflammation (CD3+ T-cells) in ARAS pigs. In addition, renal medullary hypoxia significantly lowered with Nx but not Hx AMSC treatment. Mechanistically, levels of epigenetic 5hmC marks (which reflect gene activation) estimated using DNA immunoprecipitation technique were elevated in profibrotic and inflammatory genes in ARAS compared with normal AMSCs. HPC significantly reduced 5hmC levels in cholesterol biosynthesis and oxidative stress response pathways in ARAS AMSCs. Thus, autologous AMSCs improve key renovascular parameters and inflammation in ARAS pigs, with HPC mitigating pathological molecular effects on inflammatory and profibrotic genes which may play a role in augmenting regenerative capacity of AMSCs.

AB  - The investigation of social bonds as a measure to improve reproduction in farmed species is an underrepresented research area. This study investigated the effects of preferential associations between group housed sows (average herd size, n = 59) on stillborn and crushed piglet numbers. Preferential associations were described as resting within < 1 m of a conspecific in which the proximity was tolerated > 60 s. The study occurred over 63 consecutive days, broken down into three 21-day periods referred to as cycles. The 21-day cycles represent the time between reintegrating events. Seven days per cycle were selected for observations providing 63 h of footage covering the functional areas of the barn. Production data were taken from one farrowing that occurred after a sow had been transferred from the barn to the farrowing house during the study period. For group-level analysis, the sows were categorised as socially prominent or non-socially prominent. Social prominence is defined as an individual that engages in significantly higher levels of interactions than their sub-group conspecifics. The subgroups were determined by our previous work that identified assortment by social connectivity within the same study herd. Each subgroup was defined as a k-core, in which the k-value represents the level of connectivity of those in the group (i.e., subgroup K1 means sows are connecting with at least one other conspecific). For individual-level analysis, sows were categorised as a sow with stillborn (at least one stillborn piglet) or a sow without stillborn (no stillborn piglets) and as a crushing sow (at least one crushed piglet) or a non-crushing sow (no crushed piglets). Degree centrality was applied to determine the number of interactions that individuals initiated and received. Results showed no overall effects of social prominence on live-born piglets (p = 0.436). Socially prominent sows demonstrated a lower mean rate of stillborn than non-socially prominent sows. Sows with stillborn had significantly lower degree centrality than sows without stillborn (p < 0.05). The numbers of crushed piglets between socially prominent and non-socially prominent sows were variable with crushing sows demonstrating significantly higher degree centrality than non-crushing sows (p < 0.05). Overall, the evidence does not provide a clear relationship between social prominence during gestation and the reproductive outputs of sows. Therefore, further work is required to validate the effects of social position in affiliative networks on the production indices of farmed pigs.

AB  - Stable isotopic analyses of the remains of plants that have been unearthed from archaeological sites are often featured as key indicators of crop cultivation and the living environment. However, systematic archaeobotanical studies have not been applied widely in Chinese historical sites, especially in those from the Tang dynasty. This paper aims to use carbon and nitrogen isotopic analyses to reveal the potential influence of water and fertilizer conditions on the size of millet chaffs that were excavated from the Chashancun cemetery. To achieve this, >3600 uncharred broomcorn and foxtail millet chaff remains were measured. Furthermore, 30 broomcorn millet samples and 30 foxtail millet samples were selected to analyze the carbon and nitrogen isotopes, respectively. The widths and thicknesses of the broomcorn millet chaffs ranged from 1.11 to 2.38 mm and from 0.95 to 2.24 mm, respectively, while those of the foxtail millet chaffs ranged from 0.95 to 1.94 mm and from 0.69 to 1.90 mm, respectively. The delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of the broomcorn millet chaffs ranged from -13.0 parts per thousand to -12.0 parts per thousand and from 15.7 parts per thousand to 17.8 parts per thousand, respectively, while those of the foxtail millet chaffs ranged from -14.0 parts per thousand to -12.9 parts per thousand and from 15.7 parts per thousand to 18.8 parts per thousand, respectively. The results show correlations between the millet chaff size and the carbon/nitrogen isotopic values, suggesting that water and fertilizer conditions might have significantly affected millet grain yield during the late seventh century in northwestern China.

AB  - Simple Summary Developing a sustainable agroforestry system requires the utilization of byproducts. Poultry production and forestry are the two largest agricultural industries in Mississippi (USA) with loblolly pine being one of the most predominant timber species in the southeast. Poultry litter is a high-nutrient waste generated in poultry systems that is used as a fertilizer. However, poultry litter can release pollutants that reduce air and water quality and carries a heavy microbial load. Biochar and wood vinegar effects on nutrient retention and microbial activity vary due to the source material, production conditions, and application rate. This research evaluated how loblolly pine biochar and wood vinegar influence nutrients and microbial activity over time. The study found that wood vinegar reduced microbial growth in poultry litter-biochar blends. Fungi thrived in higher biochar proportions and bacteria preferred less biochar. Nitrogen and phosphorous were retained in 10% and 20% biochar blends. Furthermore, 10% and 20% biochar treatments were observed to be less odorous and compact, and the high pH of the biochar would be an effective conditioner for acidic soils. This study provides valuable information to stakeholders on how to utilize these materials to meet their objectives using regionally generated waste streams in the southeastern USA. Biochar, wood vinegar, and poultry litter are waste streams that can be utilized as soil amendments and fertilizers. However, poultry litter releases several pollutants through nutrient leaching and carries heavy microbial loads, including potential human pathogens. Improving nutrient retention and reducing microbial load in poultry litter may help protect environmental and human health and improve its value as a soil amendment. The objectives of this study were to determine how blending varying proportions of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) biochar, wood vinegar, and poultry litter affected nutrient profiles and microbial abundance over time. Biochar inclusion rates were 0%, 5%, 10%, and 20%, and wood vinegar was applied at 2% w/w. Samples were taken at Day 0, 57, and 112 to measure nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, pH, total fungi, and total bacteria. Nutrient levels generally decreased with increasing biochar level; however, biochar inclusion rates of 10% and 20% retained nitrogen and phosphorus and exhibited improved physical properties. Overall, adding wood vinegar decreased nutrient concentrations and showed a biocidal effect for bacteria and fungi. Bacteria and fungi showed different relationships with biochar inclusion rates, with fungi preferring higher biochar inclusion rates and bacteria flourishing at lower biochar inclusion rates.

AB  - BACKGROUND Ergot alkaloids are secondary metabolites produced by fungi in the genus Claviceps. They contaminate a large variety of cereals, such as rye, triticale, wheat and barley. The ingestion of contaminated cereals might cause adverse health effects in humans and animals. In fact, pigs, cattle, sheep, and poultry are involved in sporadic outbreaks and, although there are several studies about occurrence of ergot alkaloids in grain cereals, there are scarce studies focused on compound feed.
   RESULTS Twelve ergot alkaloids have been quantified in 228 feed samples intended for swine. The analytes were extracted using QuEChERS with Z-Sep+ as sorbent in the clean-up step, which reduced the matrix effect, allowing limits of quantification between 2.1 and 21.7 mu g kg(-1). The analytes were subsequently quantified by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). A total of 29 samples (12.7%) revealed contamination by at least one ergot alkaloid, and among contaminated samples, 65% were contaminated by more than one. Only 6 of 12 target ergot alkaloids showed concentrations above the limit of quantification. The concentrations for individual ergot alkaloids ranged between 5.9 mu g kg(-1) for ergosinine to 145.3 mu g kg(-1) for ergometrine (the predominant ergot alkaloid), while the total ergot alkaloid content ranged from 5.9 to 158.7 mu g kg(-1).
   CONCLUSIONS The occurrence of ergot alkaloids in feed samples in Spain seems to be lower than in other regions of Europe. All the samples fulfilled current recommendations of the feed industry about practical limits for ergot alkaloids in pig feeds. This suggests that the feeds are safe for pig consumption, regarding the presence of ergot alkaloids. (c) 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Simple Summary Animal models are widely used to study various aspects of human diseases and disorders. Likewise, they are indispensable for preclinical testing of medicals and vaccines. Human adenovirus infections are usually self-limiting, and can cause mild respiratory symptoms with fever, eye infection or gastrointestinal symptoms, but occasional local outbreaks with severe disease courses have been reported. In addition, adenovirus infections pose a serious risk for children and patients with a weakened immune system. Human adenovirus research in animal models to study adenovirus-induced disease and tumor development started in the 1950s. Various animal species have been tested for their susceptibility to human adenovirus infection since then, and some have been shown to mimic key characteristics of the infection in humans, including persistent infection. Furthermore, some rodent species have been found to develop tumors upon human adenovirus infection. Our review summarizes the current knowledge on animal models in human adenovirus research, describing the pros and cons along with important findings and future perspectives. Human adenovirus (HAdV) infections cause a wide variety of clinical symptoms, ranging from mild upper respiratory tract disease to lethal outcomes, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. To date, neither widely available vaccines nor approved antiadenoviral compounds are available to efficiently deal with HAdV infections. Thus, there is a need to thoroughly understand HAdV-induced disease, and for the development and preclinical evaluation of HAdV therapeutics and/or vaccines, and consequently for suitable standardizable in vitro systems and animal models. Current animal models to study HAdV pathogenesis, persistence, and tumorigenesis include rodents such as Syrian hamsters, mice, and cotton rats, as well as rabbits. In addition, a few recent studies on other species, such as pigs and tree shrews, reported promising data. These models mimic (aspects of) HAdV-induced pathological changes in humans and, although they are relevant, an ideal HAdV animal model has yet to be developed. This review summarizes the available animal models of HAdV infection with comprehensive descriptions of virus-induced pathogenesis in different animal species. We also elaborate on rodent HAdV animal models and how they contributed to insights into adenovirus-induced cell transformation and cancer.

AB  - Polistes dominula is an invasive social wasp that preys on the grasshopper Dichroplus elongatus, which constitutes a potential agricultural pest in Northwest Patagonia. This grasshopper feeds on a wide variety of plants, the 'Dandelion' (Taraxacum officinale) being one of the main food resources. In this study, by means of a Y-tube olfactometer, we analysed the use of olfactory cues by P. dominula in the detection of grasshoppers. Specifically, we evaluated the attractiveness of live grasshoppers, their traces (i.e. leaves with herbivory traces + prey faeces or only faeces) and herbivory-free leaves. The results showed that foragers equally chose olfactory cues emitted by grasshoppers and leaves with herbivory traces + faeces and herbivory-free leaves, suggesting that the leaves of the host plant also have an important role in the searching behaviour. The current research is the first to demonstrate that the invasive paper wasp orients its search towards either the presence of grasshopper prey or the volatiles of plant leaves. These findings shed new light on predator-prey interactions mediated by olfactory cues in P. dominula, which may play a biological role as a natural controller of D. elongatus, phytophagous pest in the invaded ecosystems.

AB  - The potential management of waterlogging-damaged plants can be through the promotion of aliphatic polyamine accumulation, such as spermidine (SPD), in non-accumulator and accumulator species under stress. Camellia oleifera, commonly called tea oil, is an evergreen shrub confronting waterlogged soils in Hainan forest plantations during the pluvial season. As far as we know, few studies focused on the responses of C. oleifera to abiotic stresses, such as waterlogging (WL), and the involvement of SPD in WL tolerance remains unclear. Therefore, two cultivars of C. oleifera (CoH1 and CoH2) were subjected to WL and exogenous SPD to shed light on the role of SPD on WL tolerance via the morphological and physio-biochemical responses of C. oleifera under stress. The results showed that the two varieties of C. oleifera were sensitive to WL stress, and spraying SPD enhanced WL tolerance via root activities, photosynthesis, redox-homeostasis, antioxidant machinery, and compatible solute components. Thus, exogenous SPD significantly reduced the damages caused by WL in C. oleifera seedlings. Moreover, the alternative oxidase (AOX) protein content was down regulated by WL in both varieties of C. oleifera, whereas exogenous SPD enhanced the AOX protein under stress. The two varieties of C. oleifera generally had similar morphological and physiological responses to WL. However, CoH2 demonstrated better photosynthesis compared to CoH1. The results of the present study provide a significant outlook to improve the accumulation of SPD in trees under abiotic stress, particularly via genome editing techniques.

AB  - Honey bee colonies in the USA have suffered from increased die-off in the last few years with a complex set of interacting stresses playing a key role. With changing climate, an increase in the frequency of severe weather events, such as heat waves, is anticipated. Understanding how these changes may contribute to stress in honey bees is crucial. Individual honey bees appear to have a high capacity to endure thermal stress. One reason for this high-level endurance is likely their robust heat shock response (HSR), which contributes to thermotolerance at the cellular level. However, less is known about other mechanisms of thermotolerance, especially those operating at the tissue level. To elucidate other determinants of resilience in this species. we used thermal stress coupled with RNAseq and identified broad transcriptional remodeling of a number of key signaling pathways in the honey bee, including those pathways known to be involved in digestive tract regeneration in the fruit fly such as the Hippo and JAK/STAT pathways. We also observed cell death and shedding of epithelial cells, which likely leads to induction of this regenerative transcriptional program. We found that thermal stress affects many of these pathways in other tissues, suggesting a shared program of damage response. This study provides important foundational characterization of the tissue damage response program in this key pollinating species. In addition, our data suggest that a robust regeneration program may also be a critical contributor to thermotolerance at the tissue level, a possibility which warrants further exploration in this and other species.

While energy stress is known to activate the Hippo pathway and inhibit its effector YAP, the precise role of the Hippo pathway in energy stress response remains unclear. Here, we report a YAP-independent function of the Hippo pathway in facilitating autophagy and cell survival in response to energy stress, a process mediated by its upstream components MAP4K2 and STRIPAK. Mechanistically, energy stress disrupts the MAP4K2-STRIPAK association, leading to the activation of MAP4K2. Subsequently, MAP4K2 phosphorylates ATG8-family member LC3, thereby facilitating autophagic flux. MAP4K2 is highly expressed in head and neck cancer, and its mediated autophagy is required for head and neck tumor growth in mice. Altogether, our study unveils a noncanonical role of the Hippo pathway in energy stress response, shedding light on this key growth-related pathway in tissue homeostasis and cancer.

AB  - This study investigated the altering effect of moisture on the emission pattern of gases and the evolutionary dynamics of physicochemical indices in corn straw and cow manure composting. Exploring this effect was reasonable to unravel the use of moisture as a cheap alternative to control gaseous emissions and improve the final properties of compost. The nutrient dynamics of the compost showed 21.6% losses in total organic carbon content, with a 33.3% increase in total nitrogen content at the end of composting. All the gases (CH4, CO2, N2O and NH3) yielded a common emission pattern despite the differences in moisture content. Except for CH4, the peak and stable emission periods of all the gases were observed on the 5th day (thermophilic phase) and after the 27th day (late mesophilic phase) of composting, respectively. Emission reductions of 89%, 91%, 95% and 100% were recorded for CH4, CO2, N2O and NH3, respectively, during the late mesophilic phase of composting. From the study, the 65% moisture content was efficient in reducing the loss rate of the gasses and nutrient contents of the compost. This study would enable farmers to channel organic residues generated into compost while minimizing pollution and nutrient losses associated with the composting process.

AB  - Vasoactive endothelin (ET) is generated by ET converting enzyme (ECE)-induced proteolytic processing of pro-molecule big ET to biologically active peptides. H2O2 has been shown to increase the expression of ECE1 via transactivation of its promoter. The present study demonstrates that H2O2 triggered ECE1-dependent ET1-3 production in neonatal pig proximal tubule (PT) epithelial cells. A uniaxial stretch of PT cells decreased catalase, increased NADPH oxidase (NOX)2 and NOX4, and increased H2O2 levels. Stretch also increased cellular ECE1, an effect reversed by EUK-134 (a synthetic superoxide dismutase/catalase mimetic), NOX inhibitor apocynin, and siRNA-mediated knockdown of NOX2 and NOX4. Short-term unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO), an inducer of renal tubular cell stretch and oxidative stress, increased renal ET1-3 generation and vascular resistance (RVR) in neonatal pigs. Despite removing the obstruction, UUO-induced increase in RVR persisted, resulting in early acute kidney injury (AKI). ET receptor (ETR)-operated Ca2+ entry in renal microvascular smooth muscle (SM) via transient receptor potential channel 3 (TRPC3) channels reduced renal blood flow and increased RVR. Although acute reversible UUO (rUUO) did not change protein expression levels of ETR and TRPC3 in renal microvessels, inhibition of ECE1, ETR, and TRPC3 protected against renal hypoperfusion, RVR increase, and early AKI. These data suggest that mechanical stretch-driven oxyradical generation stimulates ET production in neonatal pig renal epithelial cells. ET activates renal microvascular SM TRPC3, leading to persistent vasoconstriction and reduction in renal blood flow. These mechanisms may underlie rUUO-induced renal insufficiency in infants.

AB  - Camelina (Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz), an oilseed crop, belongs to the Brassicaceae family. Two unique features of camelina in comparison with the main oil crops are an adaptation to different environments and also its unique oil composition. The development of doubled haploid plants is one of the essential methods for crop improvement. The study of genetic diversity is an important step in planning crop breeding programmes. This research was conducted to evaluate the genetic variation of 81 camelina doubled haploid lines obtained from 15 crosses by inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers. The total number of amplified bands was 243, of which 239 bands (98.3%) showed polymorphism. The percentage of polymorphic bands varied between 93.75 and 100. The size of the bands ranged from 50 to 1700 base pairs. The informative ISSRs were identified by estimating marker features: polymorphism information content, effective multiplex ratio, marker index and resolving power. Three markers had higher resolving power values (9.88, 8.5 and 7.46) and were the most informative markers to identify the lines. Cluster analysis based on the complete algorithm divided the lines into five groups, indicating relatively clear configuration from the geographic distribution patterns of the parents of the doubled haploid lines. Principal coordinate analysis classified the 81 camelina doubled haploid lines into six groups. The ISSR markers detected high polymorphism to reveal the genetic variation of camelina lines. The findings of this research, along with the characterization of biochemical traits of the lines, can improve breeding programmes achieve high-yielding camelina varieties with higher and better oil content.

AB  - In this study, it was aimed to investigate the association between inflammatory reaction of tumoral microenvironments with interleukin responses in ovine pulmonary adenocarcinomas (OPAs). Material of the study consisted of 26 sheep lung tissue samples being brought to the Pathology Department for routine diagnosis. Cases were collected between years 2009 -2021; pre-diagnosis was based on clinical symptoms, anamnesis and gross lesion of the lungs. These tissues were designated in two groups as control (n = 6) and OPA (n = 20) groups. Choice of immunohistochemical staining was avidin-biotin peroxidase method. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to confirm Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus from paraffin-embedded tissues. On gross examination of OPAs, lesions seen were mostly in the caudal lobes of the lung, 1.00 -2.00 cm in diameter as gray-white consolidated foci and in microscopic observation, tumor cells showed acinar, papillary or mixed growths. No expressions of interleukin (2 and 8) were observed in the control group. All OPAs cases were positive for interleukins (2 and 8) expressions. A total of eight tissue samples were detected as positives through RT-PCR. In conclusion, in this study, it was determined that interleukin-2 and interleukin-8 were produced from tumor microenvironment elements, especially tumor -associated macrophages, and these interleukins showed pro-inflammatory effects. Interleukins and the inflammatory reaction may promote the development of OPA.(c) 2023 Urmia University. All rights reserved.

AB  - Infrared thermography (IRT) is a non-invasive method to estimate body temperature in many animal species. The eye has been indicated as the ideal region for IRT, potentially serving as an early indicator of variations in body temperature triggered by various events and stimuli. Studies are being conducted to understand sources of variation in IRT temperature of the eye and develop comprehensive guidelines for veterinary medicine and animal production purposes. The present study adds information about variation in temperature estimated from different eye regions in sheep due to analysers. Thirty-one thermal images, fifteen of the right and sixteen of the left eyes of a ewe, captured with a FLIR E8-XT camera, were analysed by each of three analysers, and minimum (Tmin), maximum (Tmax) and average (Tavg) temperature in lacrimal caruncle (R1), medial canthus of the eye (R2) and eyeball (R3) were estimated. Differences among analysers were analysed by ANOVA (normal distribution) or Friedman test (non-normal distribution), considering thermal images as blocks. Limits of Agreement with the Mean (LOAM) were estimated and agreement plots were drawn. There were no differences (P > 0.05) among analysers in temperature (degrees C, mean +/- standard deviation or median and 2.5%-97.5% quantiles) estimated in R1 (Tmin = 36.3 +/- 0.87, Tmax = 37.2 (35.9-37.7), Tavg = 36.7 +/- 0.67), R2 (Tmax = 37.2 (36.0-37.8)) and R3 (Tavg = 36.1 (34.9-37.3)) for the right eye (n = 45), and in R1 (Tmin = 36.0 (34.3-37.3), Tmax = 36.8 +/- 0.49, Tavg = 36.4 +/- 0.53), R2 (Tmin = 35.9 +/- 0.71, Tmax = 36.7 (35.8-37.7), Tavg = 36.3 (35.5-37.5)) and R3 (Tavg = 35.9 (34.8-36.6)) for the left eye (n = 48); but differences (P < 0.05) were present in R3 (Tmin, Tmax) for both eyes and in R2 (Tmin and Tavg) for the right eye. The highest mean differences in temperature (degrees C) (P < 0.05) among analysers were in R3 from the right eye (Tmin = 0.70, Tmax = 0.25) and the left eye (Tmin = 0.64, Tmax = 0.10), and in R2 from the right eye (Tmin = 0.54, Tavg = 0.50). Considering both eyes and all eye regions, the total range for the LOAM (degrees C) was lower for Tmax (0.42-0.93) and Tavg (0.63-1.17) than for Tmin (1.49-2.70), indicating a higher, medium, and lower agreement among analysers for Tmax, Tavg and Tmin, respectively. Considering the eyes, the total range for the LOAM (degrees C) was lower in all regions from the left eye (0.42-1.59) compared to the right eye (0.79-2.70), indicating a higher agreement among analysers from the left eye. Considering the eye regions, the total range for the LOAM (degrees C) was generally higher in R3 (0.84-3.70) than in R1 (0.61-1.79) and R2 (0.42-2.03), indicating the lowest agreement among analysers in R3 for Tmin (3.70). The present study shows that in sheep, the lacrimal caruncle confers the best agreement among analysers for all estimated temperatures, and that Tmax, across all eye regions, should be regarded as the most reliable estimation.

AB  - Nanowires are nanoscale devices that can perform complex tasks and move in liquids. They can incorporate multifunctional segments designed with different materials and therefore have multiple properties simultaneously. Here, the first lipase loaded reduced graphene oxide/nickel/platin nanowires for tributyrin degradation was introduced in this paper. In this study, covalent bonds were formed between the reduced graphene segment of the nanowire and lipase from the hog pancreas via carbodiimide/N-hydroxysuccinimide chemistry. The amount of attached lipase was calculated as 600 mg/g micromotor. The Pt segment in the tail of the nanowire produces O-2 by decomposition of H2O2, and the occurred bubbles allow the nanowires to move by pushing themselves. Ni segment allows the nanowires to be remotely controlled via an external magnetic field, while also allowing the separation of nanowires from the reaction medium. Characterization of nanowires was performed by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray analysis. Activity assays of free lipase and the lipase-loaded nanowires were carried out by using p-nitrophenyl laurate as a substrate. Optimum pH, optimum temperature, and kinetic parameter studies were also performed to show the stability and catalytic activity of the enzyme. Finally, the lipase-loaded nanowires demonstrated good tributyrin degradation capacity (100% at 65 min) with superior reusability properties and directed movement in tributyrin solution.

AB  - This study determined the effect of temperament on antioxidant capacity and the relationship between antioxidant capacity and the contents of amino acids (AA) and fatty acids (FA) in muscle of Hu sheep. Organ and muscle samples of five calm and five nervous Hu sheep were collected to determine the antioxidant capacity and the contents of AA and FA in muscle tissue. The concentrations of malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide excretion enzyme (SOD) in muscle and intestinal tissue of calm Hu sheep were lower than those of nervous Hu sheep (p < 0.01), and the activity of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) in liver of calm Hu sheep was significantly higher than that of nervous Hu sheep (p = 0.050). The content of AA of calm Hu sheep was higher than that of nervous Hu sheep, especially the content of reductive amino acids, which was significantly higher than that of nervous Hu sheep (p = 0.029). Fatty acid content of nervous Hu sheep was higher than that of calm type, and saturated fatty acid content was significantly higher than that of calm type (p = 0.001). The SOD content in muscle tissue was positively correlated with the contents of aspartic acid (Asp), alanine (Ala) and lysine (Lys). Catalase (CAT) activity was positively correlated with Ala content. There was a significant positive correlation between total antioxidants (T-AOC) and glutamate (Glu) (p < 0.05). MDA concentration was positively correlated with lauric acid (C12:0), triseconic acid (C13:0), myristic acid (C14:0) content (p < 0.01), and ginkgo acid (C15:0) content. The total antioxidants (T-AOC) was negatively correlated with stearic acid (C18:0) (p < 0.05). Our conclusion is that the antioxidant capacity of calm Hu sheep is superior to that of nervous Hu sheep, which may be due to the higher AA (especially reductive amino acids (Arg, Lys, Ala and Glu)) content in the muscle and the lower FA (especially SFA) content, which improve the antioxidant capacity of the organism and allow for further exploration of the mechanisms by which animal temperament affects antioxidant performance.

AB  - The commercial swine industry utilizes artificial insemination (AI) in their breeding programs. With this assisted reproductive technology, the process starts by obtaining fresh ejaculates from desirable boars who are housed in a dedicated facility (i.e., stud) that also contains a clean-room laboratory where semen quality is assessed and then ejaculates processed into AI doses. In concert with AI adoption, disruptions in sow herd reproductive performance have been traced back to contributions made from the boar stud. Through field investigations and research, several extrinsic contaminants have been identified that impact semen quality either at the boar or AI- dose level. These contaminants can be categorized as either biological or chemical in origin, eliciting reprotoxic outcomes at the boar level and/or spermatotoxicity at the AI-dose level. Biological contaminants include multiple genera of primarily opportunistic microbes (i.e., bacteria, fungi), along with their secondary metabolites (e.g., endotoxins, exotoxins, mycotoxins). Chemical contaminants appear to originate from products used at the stud, and include cleaning agent/disinfectant residues, leachates from gloves and plastics, semen extender impurities, purified and drinking water impurities, and pesticides (i.e., biocides, fungicides, herbicides, insecticides, wood preservatives). In conclusion, contaminants are a real and constant threat to the health and productivity of a stud, and have caused significant reproductive and economic losses in the swine industry. The knowledge gained in recognizing the types and sources of contaminants provides a solid foundation for the development and implementation of pro-active strategies that mitigate risk to the industry.

AB  - The implementation of new technologies and best practices on factory farms is crucial for reducing the environmental pollution burden. This study aimed to evaluate the use of natural sorbents in the cows' diet to reduce gaseous pollutants released on the farm and the content of faecal biogenic compounds. To this end, a mixture of natural sorbents (65% beechwood biochar, 25% aluminosilicate, and 10% glycerine) was added to cows' feed. Pollutants released from all groups of cows were continually monitored on the farm during the experiment. Blood samples were also collected from the cows for haematological and biochemical analysis to determine the sorbents' impact on their health. The average level of gaseous pollutants in the air on the farm were highest in the control group and lowest in the experimental groups. The levels of NH3, CH4, and H2S were statistically significant at p < 0.05. The results demonstrated that the added sorbents effectively reduced gaseous pollutants without adversely affecting the health of cows. Natural additives in the cows' diet, including sorbents, bind harmful substances such as NH3 and CH4, which are common gaseous by-products of digestion. This leads to improvements in animal welfare and the natural environment.

AB  - This study addresses the critical challenge of safe disposal and resource utilization of pig waste from intensive farming by investigating its pyrolysis behavior, product mechanisms, and heavy metal immobilization. The pyrolysis process was divided into four distinct stages, with kinetic parameters determined using the model-free FWO and KAS methods, ensuring accuracy without prior assumptions, complemented by the master plot method 3 to elucidate reaction mechanisms. The optimal kinetic models identified as f(alpha) = 4 alpha 4, f(alpha) = 3(1- 2 2 1 alpha)[- ln(1- alpha)]3, f(alpha) = 3 alpha 3, f(alpha) = 2 alpha 2. The volatile products, identified via TG-FTIR and Py-GC/MS, included COB, HBO, CH4, CO, carbonyl compounds, while pyrolysis oils were enriched with nitrogen-containing organics and ketones. Biochar produced at 450-750 degrees C demonstrated rich porosity, aromaticity, and high biochemical stability, with heavy metals predominantly immobilized in oxidizable and residual fractions (F3 +F4). FactSage 7.1 simulations provided novel insights into the phase transformations and migration trends of Zn, Mn, Cu, and Cr, highlighting the formation of stable slag or solid compounds at elevated temperatures, consistent with experimental findings. TCLP tests and ecological risk assessments confirmed the environmental safety of pig waste biochars, emphasizing the potential of pyrolysis for heavy metal stabilization. This work advances the understanding of pyrolysis mechanisms for pig waste from intensive farming and offers innovative solutions for sustainable pig waste management.

AB  - Biogas production is a suitable option for producing energy from dairy and pig manure types. During manure storage, organic matter degradation results in methane emissions decreasing the potential biogas yield. The present research advances the understanding of the biochemical methane potential (BMP) and the chemical characteristics of manure collected year-round from sequential stages of the liquid manure management chain of commercial dairy cow and pig farms. To this end, manure samples from six livestock farms in Germany were analyzed. The results showed that changes in chemical composition during storage led to a 20.5% decrease in the BMP of dairy manure from the barn to outdoor storage. For fattening pig manure samples, there was a 39.5% decrease in the BMP from intermediate to outdoor storage. An analysis of BMP according to manure age showed that pig manure degrades faster than dairy manure; the importance of promptly feeding manure to the biogas plant in order to avoid significant CH4 emission losses and reduction in energy producing capacity was highlighted. The best BMP predictors for dairy manure were the contents of dry matter, volatile solids and lignin, whereas best BMP predictors for pig manure were dry matter and volatile fatty acid (VFA) content. Prediction models performed well for samples from outdoor storages; refinements for predicting BMP of less aged samples presenting lower chemical variability would be necessary.

AB  - BACKGROUND Ionophore antibiotics improve the efficiency of energy metabolism, which has driven their use as a feed additive in ruminants for decades. Currently, they have not been approved in many countries, generating a challenge for the immediate search for plant extracts with a similar mode of action on rumen metabolism. This study evaluated the effects of enriched Prosopis juliflora (mesquite) piperidine alkaloid extract (MPA) levels as an alternative phytoadditive to sodium monensin (MON) in sheep. RESULTS The MPA diet did not differ from MON with regard to nutrient intake. A quadratic effect (P < 0.05) was observed for organic matter and neutral detergent fibre digestibility, with respective maximum point at 25.40 and minimum point at 0.95 mg kg(-1) MPA. The MPA levels linearly decreased (P < 0.05) faecal nitrogen loss. MPA did not differ from MON with regard to nutrient digestibility, and MPA levels increased (P < 0.05) the proportion of digestible energy and metabolizability from dietary gross energy. The MPA levels linearly decreased (P < 0.05) enteric CH4 production, the yield showing lower (P < 0.05) energy loss as CH4 than MON. CONCLUSION The results show that MPA levels of 17.3 and 27.8 mg kg(-1) are enteric CH4 inhibitors and enhance energy and protein utilization, indicating a promising alternative to MON for ruminants.

AB  - Ankyrin 1 (ANK1) gene has been demonstrated to be a functional candidate gene for meat quality that helps to constitute and maintain the structure of the cell skeleton. In this study, three contiguous ANK1 regions from yak were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction-single-stranded conformational polymorphism (PCR-SSCP). As a result, nine single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified, four of them in the coding region and three (c.179 C/A, c.250 G/C, and c.313 C/T) putatively resulting in amino acid changes (p. Ala 60 Glu, p. Asp 84 His, and p. Pro 105 Ser). Some SNPs in promoter region were located within or nearby the putative transcription factor binding sites, such as Sp1 and GATA, which might have an impact on the expression of the yak ANK1 gene. The presence of C-1-D-3 and C-1-A(3) were associated with an increased hot carcass weight (p = 0.0045) and a decreased drip loss rate (p = 0.0046). The presence of B-1-B-3, C-1-A(3) and C-1-D-3 had decreased Warner-Bratzler shear force (p = 0.0066, p = 0.0343 and p = 0.0004). The presence of one and two copies of B-1-B-3 and C-1-A(3) had decreased Warner-Bratzler shear force (p = 0.0005 and p = 0.0443), and C-1-A(3) had also decreased drip loss rate (p = 0.0164). These findings indicated that genetic variations of the ANK1 gene would be a preferable biomarker for the improvement of yak meat quality.

AB  - Automatic identification of breeds of sheep can be valuable to the sheep industry. Due to the lack of open source datasets of multiple breeds in some researches, which leads to poor robustness of models for automatic sheep breed recognition. This paper proposes a sheep face image dataset of 10 breeds, which consists of 5200 original images of 823 sheep from seven farms in Inner Mongolia. The dataset is expanded to 44,747 images after data enhancement. A sheep breed recognition model DT-YOLOv5s based on knowledge distillation is proposed for the dataset. The model transfers the knowledge of sheep face features learned by the teacher network YOLOv5x, which has a large number of parameters but high recognition accuracy, to the lightweight student network YOLOv5s through a 15-dimensional high-dimensional semantic feature vector, so as to improve the student network's PANet feature extraction capability and recognition accuracy, achieving the purpose of lightweight and accurate recognition of the overall network model. The experimental results show that the accuracy of our proposed model is 92.75%, which is 11.19%, 13.1% and 13.65% higher than that of SSD, Faster R-CNN and YOLOv5s models, respectively. The mean average precision (mAP@[0.5:0.95]) is 94.67%, which is 7.85%, 2.35% and 4.83% higher than that of SSD, Faster R-CNN and YOLOv5s models, respectively. Meanwhile, the inference time of the model is 12.63 ms, which is 33.9 ms, 53.13 ms and 74.61 ms less than SSD, Faster R-CNN and YOLOv5x, respectively. The proposed DT-YOLOv5s model in this paper has good robustness and generalization ability, which can provide technical support for the real-time accurate identification of the sheep breed for farmers.

AB  - Simple Summary Horses are herbivores and forage-based diets are a natural choice for them. Traditionally, horse diets have included a large portion of cereals and have been associated with different intestinal problems. Feeding more forage and less concentrate has been shown to promote both physical and mental health and performance in horses. However, the nutritional quality of forage can differ greatly. This study compared the effect of two different forage diets and the more conventional forage and concentrate diets, on the hindgut microorganisms and the environment. No differences were found between the three diets in the concentration of total bacteria, fungi and protozoa, of cellulose-utilising bacteria or in the concentration of short-chain fatty acids. It can be concluded that a forage diet which fulfils the energy and protein requirements without having to add starch rich concentrate can benefit hindgut health. In addition, further studies on plant-fibre and forage diets for horses are of great importance for horse feeding, for advisors, veterinarians and for the diet formulations industry. Fibrous feeds are essential for horses. When developing feeding regimens promoting health and performance, we need to understand the digestion of plant cell walls and the functioning of the hindgut microbial ecosystem. Our objective was to investigate the effect of grass fibre maturity and legume forage on the hindgut microbiota and its activity. Six caecum and colon fistulated geldings were fed three diets differing in fibre composition: concentrate and late harvested grass haylage (35:65 energy ratio) (C); early and late harvested grass haylage (80:20) (G); lucerne and late harvested grass haylage (80:20) (L) for 28 days in a Latin-square design. No differences were measured in total bacteria concentrations, fungi and protozoa numbers nor in cellulolytic bacteria concentrations between the diets. Short-chain fatty acid concentrations did not differ between diets, but a lower (acetate + butyrate)/propionate ratio when the horses were fed Diet C, compared to G and L, was observed, suggesting lower fibrolytic and higher amylolytic activity. The pH increased when the horses were fed Diet L and decreased when fed C and G from caecum to faeces. The buffering capacity (BC) of hindgut digesta was five to fifteen-fold higher than that of the feeds, suggesting a decreased effect of feed BC as digesta travelled through the digestive tract. In conclusion, an early harvested forage opens up the possibility for forage-only diets, providing high energy without the negative effects of concentrate.

AB  - Brachycaudus helichrysi, also known as peach leaf curl aphid is a destructive pest that poses a grave threat to peach and nectarine cultivation. The existing management practices primarily rely on applying synthetic insecticides whose indiscriminate use has led to a myriad of problems. To address these issues, biological control agents like ladybirds (Oenopia sauzeti) have emerged as an environment friendly alternative strategy. Till now, there has been a dearth of precise information on the biology, fecundity as well as functional response of O. sauzeti against B. helichrysi. The present study assesses the demographic parameters and functional response of O. sauzeti preying on B. helichrysi under laboratory conditions at 25 +/- 1 C-degrees, 70 +/- 5% RH and 12 L: 12 D photoperiod and aims to provide valuable insights for its potential use in pest management. The findings showed a net reproductive rate, gross reproductive rate, true generation time and intrinsic rate of increase of 59.92 females/predator, 76.95 offspring per individual, 33.36 days and 0.12, respectively. The results showed that O. sauzeti exhibited a type II functional response. The highest predation rate was observed in the adults (78.21), which was significantly different from 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th larval instars (19.68, 32.30, 36.49 and 51.64, respectively) of the coccinellid. This research provides essential information for using O. sauzeti as a biocontrol agent for B. helichrysi and would prove beneficial to sustainable pest management strategies in stone fruit cultivation.

AB  - Dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius) are widespread in the desert and semi-desert areas of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, some parts of southwest Asia and Australia. In the Arabian Peninsula, these well-adapted species have been classified based on their ecology into Desert camels, found mainly in the north and center of the Peninsula, Mountain camels, distributed along the west and south of the Peninsula, and Beach camels, populating the west to southwest of the Peninsula. Here, we aimed to investigate the genetic relationship between 386 camels corresponding to 12 dromedary populations from different geographical locations and ecology in the Arabian Peninsula with the genotyping of 17 microsatellite loci. No significant deviation was observed in heterozygosity, allelic richness, Fis (inbreeding coefficient) among the studied populations had a mean value of 0.5849, 4.808 and 0.04, respectively. A mean Fst (fixation index) value of 0.0304 was calculated for the various populations with the highest value obtained between racing Omani and Awarik camel populations (0.079). Both the neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree and the STRUCTURE analysis divided the populations into three different groups corresponding to their Arabian Peninsula geographic location (North, Central and West, South-West, and South-East of the Arabian Peninsula), rather than their ecological classification, with a high level of genetic admixture and gene flow among them. Investigating the genetic relationship of dromedary populations in the Arabian Peninsula can be considered as the first milestone to conserve this well-adapted species. The results obtained here need to be further validated using whole genome sequencing data. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of King Saud University.

AB  - Introduction Plant disease detection is critical for ensuring agricultural productivity, yet traditional methods often suffer from inefficiencies and inaccuracies due to manual processes and limited adaptability.Methods This paper presents the PlantDisease Multi-task Joint Detection Model (PMJDM), which integrates an enhanced ConvNeXt-based shared feature extraction, a texture-augmented N-RPN module with HOG/LBP metrics, multi-task branches for simultaneous plant species classification and disease detection, and CRF-based post-processing for spatial consistency. A dynamic weight adjustment mechanism is also employed to optimize task balance and improve robustness.Results Evaluated on a 26,073-image dataset, PMJDM achieves 71.84% precision, 61.96% recall, and 61.83% mAP50, surpassing Faster - RCNN (51.49% mAP50) and YOLOv10x (59.52% mAP50) by 10.34% and 2.31%, respectively.Discussion The superior performance of PMJDM is driven by multi-task synergy and texture - enhanced region proposals, offering an efficient solution for precision agriculture.

AB  - The use of endophytic fungi has dramatically increased plant performance through the enhancement of plant protection against abiotic and biotic stressors. We previously demonstrated that the endophytic fungus Trichoderma asperellum M2RT4 improves tomato defenses against the tomato leafminer Tuta absoluta through the reduction of oviposition, leafmining, pupation, and adult emergence. However, the underlying mechanism by which the presence of this endophytic fungus within tomato host plant affects T. absoluta host selection and life-history traits is unknown. We tested the behavioral responses of T. absoluta in Y-tube olfactometer bioassays and found that females preferred non-inoculated tomato plants against those inoculated by endophytes. Additionally, T. absoluta females were not attracted to non-inoculated infested nor to inoculated-infested tomato plants. Chemical analysis revealed the emission of methyl salicylate in inoculated tomato plant and an increase in the amounts of monoterpenes emitted from non-inoculated infested plants. Additionally, we found that upon herbivory, T. asperellum M2RT4 modulates tomato plant chemistry through the production of (Z)-jasmone thus activating both salicylic and jasmonic acid defense pathways. Further, T. absoluta females were attracted to monoterpernes including alpha-pinene, 2-carene, and beta-phellandrene but repelled by methyl salicylate. Methyl salicylate could therefore be considered as a good semiochemical-based candidate for sustainable T. absoluta management using a "push-pull" approach. However, in dose-response bioassays, females of T. absoluta did not show any preference to the four component-blend (alpha-pinene, 2-carene, beta-phellandrene, and methyl salicylate). (Z)-jasmone-treated tomato leaflets significantly reduced the leafmining activity of the pest at the concentration of 10 ng/mu L and causing the highest larval mortality rate (83%) with the shortest LT50 (1.73 days) 7 days post-treatment. T. asperellum M2RT4 effect on herbivore performance was then (Z)-jasmone-mediated. These findings expand our understanding of how the endophytic fungus T. asperellum M2RT4 could mediate chemical interactions between T. absoluta and its host plant which are potentially important for development of environmentally friendly T. absoluta management programs.

AB  - This paper presents a state-of-the-art tethered unmanned aerial vehicle (TUAV) for structural integrity assessment of underground stone mine pillars. The TUAV, powered by its tether, works in tandem with an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) that hosts the TUAV batteries, a self-leveled landing platform, and the tether management system. The UGV and the TUAV were named Rhino and Oxpecker, respectively, given that the TUAV stays landed on the UGV while the ensemble moves inside a mine. The mission of Oxpecker is to create, using a LiDAR sensor, 3D maps of the mine pillars to support time-lapse hazard mapping and time-dependent pillar degradation analysis. Given the height of the pillars (7-12 m), this task cannot be executed by Rhino alone. This paper describes the drone's hardware and software. The hardware includes the tether management system, designed to control the tension of the tether, and the tether perception system, which provides information that can be used for localization and landing in global navigation satellite systems (GNSS)-denied environments. The vehicle's software is based on a state machine that controls the several phases of a mission (i.e., takeoff, inspection, and landing) by coordinating drone motion with the tethering system. The paper also describes and evaluates our approach for tether-based landing and autonomous 3D mapping of pillars. We show experiments that illustrate and validate our system in laboratories and underground mines.

AB  - The conservation of Nigerian cattle is of increasing concern because of their historical and genetic value. Phenotypic characterization involves the differentiation of groups and/or breeds and provides support for conservation programmes. In this study, we reported quantitative examination of four Nigerian cattle breeds using multivariate technique. Data were collected from a total of 2,120 randomly selected trade cattle of both sexes (1,008 males and 1,112 females) comprising 859 Bunaji, 674 Sokoto Gudali, 409 Rahaji and 178 Kuri transported from the northern parts to the south western part of the country for sale. The animals were divided into four ages viz., 2-tooth, 4-tooth, 6-tooth and 8-tooth ages, respectively based on the eruption of permanent incisors. Eight biometric traits were taken on each animal namely height at withers (HTW), height at shoulders (HTS), body length (BDL), shoulder to tail drop (STD), heart girth (HTG), cannon circumference (CNC), ear length (ERL) and tail length (TLL). The fixed effects of breed, sex and age including their interactions on body traits were tested using General linear model (GLM). Pearson's coefficients of correlation among the various linear body measurements were computed. The multivariate approach involved the use of principal component (PC) analysis. Based on univariate analysis, the Kuri cattle had significantly (P<0.05) higher morphometric variables compared to other breeds. Sex and age also influenced (P<0.05) all the body parameters while there were breed and sex; breed and age; sex and age; and breed and sex and age interaction effects on the body traits. Phenotypic correlation Coefficients among the traits were positive and significant (P<0.01), ranging from 0.13-0.92. In the PC analysis, two parameters (STD and HTS) were sufficient for breed differentiation based on eigenvalue lower than 0.7. The present information may be useful for animal evaluation and when complemented with molecular diversity analysis, could be exploited in future efforts aimed at conserving the indigenous cattle.

AB  - Background The systematic status of sect. Tuberculata and its taxonomy have recently attracted considerable attention. However, the different bases for defining the characteristics of sect. Tuberculata has led to many disagreements among the plants in this group. Camellia neriifolia and Camellia ilicifolia have been the subject of taxonomic controversy and have been treated as different species or varieties of the same species. Therefore, it is important to use multiple methods, i.e., integrative taxonomy, to determine the taxonomic status of C. neriifolia and C. ilicifolia. This is the first study to systematically explore the taxonomic position of these two plants on the basis of Morphology, Anatomy, Palynology and Molecular Systematics. Results Extensive specimen reviews and field surveys showed that many differences exist in C. neriifolia and C. ilicifolia, such as the number of trunk (heavily debarked vs. slightly peeling), leaf type (smooth thin leathery, shiny vs. smooth leathery, obscure or slightly shiny), leaf margin (entire vs. serrate), flower type (subsessile vs. sessile), number of styles (3-4 vs. 3), and sepal (ovate vs. round). Moreover, C. neriifolia has a more distinctive faint yellow flower color, and trunk molting was more severe in C. neriifolia than that in C. ilicifolia. In addition, micromorphological analysis of the leaf epidermis showed that the two species differed in the anticlinal wall, stomatal apparatus, and stomatal cluster, and pollen morphology analyses based on pollen size, germination furrow, and polar and equatorial axes showed that they are both distinct from each other. The results of the phylogenetic tree constructed based on the whole chloroplast genome, protein-coding genes, and ITS2 showed that both C. ilicifolia and C. neriifolia were clustered in different branches and gained high support. Conclusions The results combine morphology, anatomy, palynology, and molecular systematics to treat both C. neriifolia and C. ilicifolia as separate species in the sect. Tuberculata, and the species names continue to be used as they were previously. In conclusion, clarifying the taxonomic status of C. neriifolia and C. ilicifolia deepens our understanding of the systematic classification of sect. Tuberculata.

AB  - Objectives RNF20 is recognized as a main E3 ligase for monoubiquitination of histone H2B at lysine 120 (H2Bub). The critical role of RNF20 and H2Bub in various molecular events, such as DNA replication, RNA transcription, and DNA damage response, has been widely investigated and documented. However, its role in porcine adipogenesis remains unknown. In this study, we aimed to clarify the effect of RNF20 on porcine preadipocyte differentiation. Materials and Methods Backfat tissues from fat-type pigs (Bama and Meishan) and lean-type pigs (Yorkshire and Landrace) were collected to detect the expression level of RNF20. Preadipocytes were isolated from Bama piglets and induced to differentiation. Small interfering RNAs were applied to deplete RNF20. Oil Red O staining, quantitative real-time PCR, RNA-seq, Western blot analysis, and EdU assays were performed to study the regulatory mechanism of RNF20 during adipogenesis. Results We found that the expression levels of RNF20 and H2Bub were significantly higher in backfat tissues from fat-type pigs than in those from lean-type pigs. Consistently, the significantly induced expression of RNF20 and H2Bub was also observed in porcine differentiated adipocytes. In addition, knockdown of RNF20 greatly inhibited porcine adipogenesis, as evidenced by dramatically decreased lipid droplet formation and lower expression levels of adipogenic transcription masters in RNF20 knockdown cells. Mechanistically, the depletion of RNF20 decreases the cell proliferation and the level of p-C/EBP beta via the Ras-Raf-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 cascade pathway at the mitotic clonal expansion phase and therefore suppresses cell differentiation. Conclusions Our results demonstrate that RNF20 is required for porcine preadipocyte differentiation.

AB  - Bisphenol A (BPA), an endocrine disruptor, has been replaced by structural analogues including bisphenol S (BPS). BPA and BPS exhibited similar effects regarding reproductive functions. Moreover, metabolic status and lipid metabolism are related to female fertility and could worsen BPS effects. The objective was to determine BPS in vivo effects on folliculogenesis and embryo production after chronic exposure through diet, and the influence of metabolic status in adult ewes. Sixty primiparous 2.5 year-old ewes, undergoing a restricted or well fed diet, were exposed to BPS (0, 4 or 50 mu g/kg/day) for at least three months. After hormonal oestrus synchronisation and ovarian stimulation, ewes were subjected to ovum pick-up (OPU) procedures to collect immature oocytes, that underwent in vitro maturation, fertilisation and embryo production. Body weight, body condition score and plasma glucose were higher in well-fed compared to restricted ewes, while plasma NEFA was lower during the 4-5 months after the beginning of the diets. Plasma progesterone levels increased on day 5 before OPU session in well-fed compared to restricted ewes. No effect of BPS dose was observed on follicle population, plasma AMH levels and embryo production numbers and rates. However, a significant diet x BPS dose interaction was reported for cleaved embryos, > 4-cell embryos, blastocyst and early blastocyst numbers, and plasma triiodothyronine levels. Our study showed that a contrasted diet did not affect follicle population nor embryo production in adult ewes but could affect the quality and progesterone secretion of the corpus luteum. Chronic low BPS exposure had no effect on follicular population and oocyte competence. Nevertheless, the significant diet x dose interactions observed on embryo production suggest that BPS effect is modulated by metabolic status. Further studies are required to assess the risk of BPS exposure for public reproductive health.

AB  - The ability of cities worldwide to feed themselves is of increasing concern to Urban Planning and Design professions. In recent years, interest in reintegrating agricultural production back into cities of the Global North has grown, particularly with regard to plant-based urban agriculture. Research focused on animal-based urban agriculture however has been notably absent from the literature and case studies set within cities of the Global North. This study aims to contribute to this emerging area of research and seeks to better understand the enablers and barriers to integrating grazing animals within urban greenspace from a 'neighbor' perspective. This paper presents survey responses from residents living around Cornwall Park, an urban greenspace in Aotearoa New Zealand's largest city, Tamaki Makaurau Auckland, that integrates a working sheep and beef farm as part of the 172 ha urban greenspace. Findings revealed that the grazing animals were highly valued by the neighboring community with 99% of respondents feeling 'positive' towards the inclusion of grazing animals as part of the public park. Our findings have implications for cities of the Global North considering the reintegration of animal-based urban agriculture, providing support for decision-making when defining policies for enabling animal-based agriculture within public greenspace.

AB  - We provide novel genomic resources to help understand the genomic traits involved in elephant health and to aid conservation efforts. We sequence 11 elephant genomes (5 African savannah, 6 Asian) from North American zoos, including 9 de novo assemblies. We estimate elephant germline mutation rates and reconstruct demographic histories. Finally, we provide an in-solution capture assay to genotype Asian elephants. This assay is suitable for analyzing degraded museum and noninvasive samples, such as feces and hair. The elephant genomic resources we present here should allow for more detailed and uniform studies in the future to aid elephant conservation efforts and disease research.

AB  - Simple Summary The objective of this study is to examine the effects of a phytobiotic-prebiotic feed additive (PPFA) containing a combination of carob pulp, chicory, and fenugreek on growth performance, carcass traits, and fecal microbiota in fattening pigs. One kg/T of the PPFA shows a significant effect on growth promotion and a positive effect on lean meat production and carcass quality of fattening pigs. Moreover, the PPFA has the ability to regulate intestinal microbiota by improving beneficial bacteria while inhibiting some pathogen bacteria. This PPFA could be an effective antibiotic-free feed additive to enhance growth performances, improve carcass grade, and promote healthy gut development in fattening pigs.Abstract The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a phytobiotic-prebiotic feed additive (PPFA, which contains a combination of chicory and extracts of carob pulp and fenugreek) in the diets of fattening pigs on growth indicators, carcass characteristics, and fecal microbiota. A total of 329 crossbred pigs were randomly divided into two dietary treatments, including a basal diet without additives as the control group and a basal diet supplemented with 1 kg/T PPFA as the trial group. The PPFA supplementation led to a significant increase in the body weight gain and average daily gain of the trial group compared to those of the control group after 70 days of feeding. Through the S-EUROP evaluation system, we also found that the fattening pigs fed PPFA significantly improved their carcass indicators. Furthermore, it was shown that PPFA regulated porcine intestinal microbiota, including promoting the growth of the beneficial commensal bacteria (i.e., Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus) while inhibiting some potential pathogen bacteria (i.e., Bacteroidaceae and Campylobacteraceae). Our work revealed that the phytobiotic-prebiotic feed additive containing carob pulp, chicory, and fenugreek positively influences the intestinal microbiota, growth performance, and carcass traits in fattening swine.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the potential of Pichia kudriavzevii (PK), a newly discovered yeast strain, in alleviating the deleterious effects induced by aflatoxins on broilers. Eighty one-day-old broiler chicks were divided into four groups and subjected to various combinations of aflatoxin dosages at 300 mu g/kg of feed alongside PK supplementation at 1 g/kg of feed. Assessment encompassed a comprehensive array of parameters including performance metrics, hepatic and renal biomarkers, interleukin concentrations, blood cell counts, hemoglobin concentration, packed cell volume, antibody response to sheep red blood cells, lymphoproliferative response to PHA-P, phagocytic response utilizing the carbon clearance assay system, as well as evaluation of oxidants and antioxidants. Additionally, gross and microscopic lesions on liver and kidney were examined. The study highlights Pichia kudriavzevii as a promising agent for mitigating aflatoxin-induced toxicity in broiler chicks by improving antioxidant and immunomodulatory status, normalizing biomarkers, and reversing pathological alterations through multifaceted protective mechanisms.

AB  - Tea (Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze) is predominantly grown in acidic soils with severe limitations of P-nutrition. The present study evaluated the effects of an arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus, Claroideoglomus etunicatum, on root morphology, leaf and root P concentration, phosphatase activity in soils and roots, and the relative expression of root P transporter genes (PT1 and PT4) in Camellia sinensis 'Fuding Dabaicha' seedlings in sands under two levels of P viz., 0.5 mu M (P-0.5) and 50 mu M (P-50) through Hoagland solutions (pH 4.2) for 24 weeks. Under both P-0.5 and P-50 conditions, AM seedlings displayed a higher growth performance (shoot biomass, root biomass, and plant height), root morphology (total length, taproot length, 2nd- and 3rd-lateral root number, and volume), and root-hair length, but lower root-hair density than non-AM seedlings. Mycorrhizal inoculation significantly increased root P concentrations in P-0.5 and P-50 and leaf P concentrations in P-0.5 over non-mycorrhizal treatment. The AM seedlings recorded considerably higher soil acid, neutral, and total phosphatase activity under P-0.5 treatment, and soil neutral and total phosphatase activity under P-50 treatment, compared with the non-AM seedlings. Root acid phosphatase activity was reduced due to mycorrhization at both of P-0.5 and P-50. AM fungal inoculation up-regulated the relative expression of root CsPT1, while down-regulated the CsPT4 expression in P-0.5 and P-50 treatments. It was concluded that AM fungal inoculation significantly promoted P acquisition capacity of tea plants, especially in roots through improving root growth and enhancing soil acid phosphatase activity and root CsPT1 expression.

AB  - The replacement of soybean meal with sweet white lupin (Lupinus albus L.) seeds was investigated in the diets of Iberian pigs during the growing and fattening phases, evaluating its effects on growth performance, carcass traits, and meat quality. Iberian pigs (n = 50) were divided into two dietary groups (n = 25 per group), receiving either a lupin-based concentrate or a soybean meal-based concentrate. The data were analysed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), with a significance level of p < 0.05. The results showed that lupin substitution had no adverse effect on body weight, average daily gain, or carcass characteristics. No significant differences were observed in meat quality parameters such as pH, colour, and texture. However, significantly (p = 0.007) lower levels of saturated fatty acids (SFA) content were found in the intramuscular fat of pre-finishing (primor) pigs fed lupin-based diets. In addition, these pigs had lower plasma triglyceride levels at the end of the growing phase. Overall, the results suggest that sweet white lupin is a viable alternative protein source in Iberian pig production, offering potential health benefits in line with consumer preferences for sustainably produced, healthier meat products, without compromising production efficiency or product quality.

AB  - Acylsugars are secondary metabolites that are produced in the trichomes of some solanaceous species and can help control several herbivorous insect pests. Previously, knockout mutations (asat2 mutants) were shown to significantly reduce the acylsugar content of Nicotiana benthamiana, and significantly improve the fitness of six generalist insect herbivores. The current study compared the significant mortality and fitness costs in Spodoptera litura conferred by acylsugar protection of N. benthamiana (wild-type plants) compared to S. litura strains reared in acylsugar-deficient plants with depleted acylsugar biosynthesis. Acylsugar protection prolonged the developmental duration and decreased viability in the larval stages. Further, the fecundity of females and the hatching rate of eggs significantly decreased under acylsugar protection. For F-1 offspring, acylsugar protection still exerted significant negative effects on larval survival rate and fecundity per female. The net reproductive rate and relative fitness of the S. litura strain were strongly affected by acylsugar. Altogether, these results indicate that acylsugar could contribute to plant protection due to toxicity to pests, diffused availability, and low environmental persistence. This could represent a complementary and alternative strategy to control populations of insect pests.

AB  - The objective was to evaluate the differences between hair lambs, born from single or twin births, regarding the latency periods for standing up and suckling, the vitality, glycemic, cortisol, and triiodothyronine concentrations, as well as the phenotypic characteristics related to the maintenance of homeothermy in the immediate postpartum. Single (n = 10) or twin (n = 12) Morada Nova lambs were evaluated after birth, during the first successful suckling (M0 = Timepoint 0), and at regular intervals of 20 min (M20, M40, M60). Lambs from single births had higher birth weight (3.09 vs 2.58 kg; P <= 0.05) and higher serum triiodothyronine concentration (267 vs 209 ng/dL; P <= 0.05) compared to twin lambs. There was a positive correlation between weight and blood glucose (0.57; P <= 0.05) for both single and twin lambs. The type of birth did not affect vitality, which was negatively associated with cortisol concentration (-0.53; P <= 0.05). Twin lambs had higher internal and ocular temperatures (39.29 vs 38.67 degrees C and 38.84 vs 38.13 degrees C; P <= 0.05, respectively). Body surface temperatures increased over time in both groups (P <= 0.05). An increase in the temperature of the hips region (ysingle = 27.88 + 0.019*time; R2 = 0.96; P = 0.019 and ytwin = 28.74 + 0.019*time; R2 = 0.94; P = 0.029) was observed for both single and twin lambs, which coincides with the region of brown adipose tissue deposition. The lowest absolute thermal variabilities between twin and single lambs in M0 and M60 were recorded in the midloin and integral dorsal area. The parturition type did not influence the latencies to stand up (P = 0.908) and for the first suckling (P = 0.888), and the vitality score (P = 0.353). Thus, single and twin lambs do not differ in neonatal behavior, but they presented specific metabolic strategies to regulate body temperature over time. Midloin and integral dorsal areas are anatomical regions suggested for use in serial thermographic monitoring. Infrared thermography may be an important complementary resource in neonatal care.

AB  - NH3 and greenhouse gases emission are big problems during composting, which can cause great nitrogen nutrient loss and environmental pollution. This study investigated effects of the porous bulking agent of oil shale semicoke and its activated material on the gases emission during the continuous thermophilic composting. Results showed addition of semicoke could significantly reduce the NH3 emission by 74.65% due to its great adsorption capacity to NH4+-N and NH3, further the effect could be enhanced to 85.92% when utilizing the activated semicoke with larger pore volume and specific surface area. In addition, the CH4 emission in the semicoke and activated semicoke group was also greatly mitigated, with a reduction of 67.23% and 87.62% respectively, while the N2O emission was significantly increased by 93.14% and 100.82%. Quantification analysis of the functional genes found the abundance of mcrA was high at the massive CH4-producing stage and the archaeal amoA was dominant at the N2O-producing stage in all the composting groups. Correlation and redundancy analysis suggested there was a positive correlation between the CH4 emission and mcrA. Addition of semicoke especially activated semicoke could reduce the CH4 production by inhibiting the methanogens. For the NH3 and N2O, it was closely related with the nitrification process conducted by archaeal amoA. Addition of semicoke especially activated semicoke was beneficial for the growth of ammonia-oxidizing archaea, causing the less NH4+-N transformation to NH3 but more N2O emission.

AB  - Plants employ various defense mechanisms to protect themselves from invaders such as microorganisms and herbivores. By recognizing these threats, plants can trigger a cascade of responses throughout their tissues, effectively priming their defenses and enhancing their resistance to future attacks. In this study, we examined the indirect effects of the entomopathogenic fungi Beauveria bassiana strain GHA and Metarhizium anisopliae strain F01 on tomato growth, expression of selected plant genes, production of secondary metabolites, and preference and performance of the tomato leafminer (Tuta absoluta). Both B. bassiana and M. anisopliae colonized tomato endophytically. Plants treated with B. bassiana had greater biomass than the untreated control and M. anisopliae treated plants. Oviposition was lower on plants treated with B. bassiana and M. anisopliae than on untreated controls in both choice and no-choice studies, and both endophytic EPF also affected the development of leafminer larvae. Gene expression analysis of tomato leaves inoculated with endophytic EPF provided evidence of triggering plant immune response genes, and of priming genes for herbivore attack, making plants more resistant to herbivory. These findings provide important insights into the mechanisms by which B. bassiana and M. anisopliae promote tomato plant growth and rapidly respond to T. absoluta infestation by priming the immune system. This knowledge could improve the development of entomopathogenic fungi for use in plant-protection strategies.

AB  - Simple Summary Red pandas are a threatened species, and zoos worldwide are working to conserve the species through international captive breeding programs. However, information on the physiology of captive red pandas is limited, which is hampering efforts to increase reproductive success and meet captive breeding goals. This study measured concentrations of fecal glucocorticoid (fGCM), progestagen (fPM), and androgen (fAM) metabolites in relation to environmental and biological factors among captive red pandas housed at three Indian zoos. Data revealed that fGCM concentrations were influenced by social time together (-), visitor numbers (+), number of nests (+), frequency of feedings (-), log density (-), and enclosure area (+). The fPM results suggested that enclosure area negatively affected concentrations in females. By contrast, fAM in males was not affected by these factors. This study suggests that employing more frequent feeding schedules and controlling the number of visitors may have positive effects on the welfare of red pandas, while higher fGCM and lower fPM in larger enclosures might be related to the limited enrichment and hiding spaces in those areas. Animals in human care are affected by stressors that can ultimately reduce fitness. When reproduction is affected, endangered species conservation programs can be severely compromised. Thus, understanding factors related to stress and reproduction, and related hormones, is important to ensure captive breeding success. Red pandas (Ailurus fulgens) are endangered, and populations in the wild are threatened with extinction. A global captive breeding program has been launched to conserve the species with the goal of reintroduction. However, there is little information on how stressors impact physiological aspects of the species. This study measured fecal glucocorticoid (fGCM), progestagen (fPM), and androgen (fAM) metabolite concentrations in 12 female and 8 male red pandas at 3 zoos in India to determine predictors of adrenal and gonadal steroid activity, and the influence of fGCM on reproduction. Based on the generalized linear mixed model (GLMM), fGCM concentrations were positively correlated with the number of visitors, number of nests and enclosure areas, and negatively related to frequency of feedings, log density, and social time, while fPM concentrations were negatively associated with enclosure areas. A confounder for enclosure areas and number of nests was the fact that these spaces were relatively barren, with limited hiding spaces, compared to the smaller enclosures. By contrast, no significant relationships were found for fAM, perhaps due to the smaller sample size. A negative relationship between fGCM and fPM was observed, indicating increasing adrenal hormones may decrease reproductive function among female red pandas. Results suggest that zoo management should consider increasing feeding frequency, providing larger enclosures with more enrichment and more nests in larger spaces, and regulating visitor numbers to support good welfare and potentially improve reproductive fitness of red pandas in captivity.

AB  - Atta leaf-cutter ants are the prime herbivore in the Neotropics: differently sized foragers harvest plant material to grow a fungus as a crop. Efficient foraging involves complex interactions between worker size, task preferences and plant-fungus suitability; it is, however, ultimately constrained by the ability of differently sized workers to generate forces large enough to cut vegetation. In order to quantify this ability, we measured bite forces of Atta vollenweideri leaf cutter ants spanning more than one order of magnitude in body mass. Maximum bite force scaled almost in direct proportion to mass; the largest workers generated peak bite forces 2.5 times higher than expected from isometry. This remarkable positive allometry can be explained via a biomechanical model that links bite forces with substantial size-specific changes in the morphology of the musculoskeletal bite apparatus. In addition to these morphological changes, we show that bite forces of smaller ants peak at larger mandibular opening angles, suggesting a size dependent physiological adaptation, probably reflecting the need to cut leaves with a thickness that corresponds to a larger fraction of the maximum possible gape. Via direct comparison of maximum bite forces with leaf mechanical properties, we demonstrate (i) that bite forces in leaf-cutter ants need to be exceptionally large compared with body mass to enable them to cut leaves; and (ii), that the positive allometry enables colonies to forage on a wider range of plant species without the need for extreme investment in even larger workers. Our results thus provide strong quantitative arguments for the adaptive value of a positively allometric bite force.

AB  - Snow has numerous effects on traffic, including reduced traffic volumes, greater crash risk, and increased travel times. This research examines how snow affects crash risk, traffic volume, and toll revenue on the New York State Thruway. Daily data from January for a 10-yr period (2010-19) were analyzed for the Thruway from the Pennsylvania state line in western New York to Syracuse. Anywhere from 35% to 50% of crashes are associated with inclement weather, with smaller impacts, proportionally, in areas with greater traffic volumes. As expected, snow was almost always involved when weather was a factor. "Unsafe speed" was the most common cause of crashes in inclement weather with all other factors (e.g., animals, drowsiness) much less likely to play a role. The percentage of crashes resulting in an injury did not change significantly with inclement conditions when compared with crashes occurring in fair conditions, and there were too few fatal crashes to make any inferences about them. Daily snowfall rates predicted about 30% of the variation in crash numbers, with every 5.1 cm of snowfall resulting in an additional crash, except in Buffalo where 5.1 cm of snow resulted in an additional 2.6 crashes. Confirming earlier results, daily snowfall had a large impact on passenger vehicle counts whereas commercial vehicle counts were less affected. Revenue data showed a similar pattern, with passenger revenue typically decreasing by 3%-5% per 2.5 cm of snow, whereas commercial revenue decreases were 1%-4% per 2.5 cm of snow.

AB  - Alternative splicing (AS) increases the diversity of transcripts and proteins through the selection of different splice sites and plays an important role in the growth, development and stress tolerance of plants. With the release of the reference genome of the tea plant (Camellia sinensis) and the development of transcriptome sequencing, researchers have reported the existence of AS in tea plants. However, there is a lack of a platform, centered on different RNA-seq datasets, that provides comprehensive information on AS. To facilitate access to information on AS and reveal the molecular function of AS in tea plants, we established the first comprehensive AS database for tea plants (TeaAS, ). In this study, 3.96 Tb reads from 66 different RNA-seq datasets were collected to identify AS events. TeaAS supports four methods of retrieval of AS information based on gene ID, gene name, annotation (non-redundant/Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes/gene ontology annotation or chromosomal location) and RNA-seq data. It integrates data pertaining to genome annotation, type of AS event, transcript sequence, and isoforms expression levels from 66 RNA-seq datasets. The AS events resulting from different environmental conditions and that occurring in varied tissue types, and the expression levels of specific transcripts can be clearly identified through this online database. Moreover, it also provides two useful tools, Basic Local Alignment Search Tool and Generic Genome Browser, for sequence alignment and visualization of gene structure. The features of the TeaAS database make it a comprehensive AS bioinformatics platform for researchers, as well as a reference for studying AS events in woody crops. It could also be helpful for revealing the novel biological functions of AS in gene regulation in tea plants.

AB  - Tea, as one of the most popular beverages in the world, possesses a plethora of secondary metabolites that are beneficial to human health. Tea plants (Camellia sinensis) exhibit rich genetic diversity, where different cultivars can vary significantly in terms of yield, adaptability, morphology, and composition of secondary metabolites. Many tea cultivars have been the subject of much research interest, which have led to the accumulation of publicly available RNA-seq data. As such, it has become possible to systematically summarize the characteristics of different cultivars at the transcriptomic level, identify valuable functional genes, and infer gene functions through co-expression analysis. Here, the transcriptomes of 9 cultivars of Camellia sinensis were assembled and combined with the coding sequences of 13 cultivars of Camellia sinensis to study the differences and similarities of gene expression and biological functions among cultivars. To give access to this data, we present TeaNekT (https://teanekt.sbs.ntu.edu.sg/), a web resource that provides user-friendly tools and interactive visualizations that facilitates the prediction of gene functions of various tea cultivars. We used TeaNekT to perform cross-cultivar comparison of co-expressed gene neighborhoods, clusters, and tissue-specific gene expression. We observed that'Anji Baicha'possesses the highest number of cultivar-specific genes and the second-highest number of expanded genes. These genes in 'Anji Baicha'tend to be enriched infunctions associated with cold stress response,chloroplast thylakoid structure, and nitro-gen metabolism. Notably, we identified three significantly expanded homologous genesin'Anji Baicha'encoding the ICE1, SIZ1, and MAPKK2, which are closely associated withthe cold sensitivity of'Anji Baicha'. Additionally, one significantly expanded homologousgene in'Anji Baicha'encoding regulatory factor RIQ may play a crucial role in the abnor-mal chloroplast structure and absence of thylakoid membranes in 'Anji Baicha'.

AB  - Introduced grasses can aggressively expand their range and invade native habitats, including protected areas. Miscanthus sinensis is an introduced ornamental grass with 100+ cultivars of various invasive potential. Previous studies have demonstrated that the invasive potential of M. sinensis cultivars may be linked to seed viability, and some of the physiological traits, such as growth rate. Little is known, however, about whether these traits are associated with response of M. sinensis to insect herbivory, and whether plant tolerance and resistance to herbivory vary among its cultivars; which, in turn, can contribute to the invasive potential of some of M. sinensis cultivars. To address this issue, in our study we explored the response of five cultivars of M. sinensis to herbivory by Melanoplus grasshoppers. We demonstrated that plant responses varied among the cultivars during a season; all the cultivars, but "Zebrinus", demonstrated a significant increase in plant tolerance by the end of the growing season regardless of the amount of sustained leaf damage. Different patterns in plant responses from "solid green" and "striped/spotted" varieties were recorded, with the lowest plant resistance detected for "Autumn Anthem" in the cage experiment. Our results have important applications for monitoring low-risk invaders in protected areas, as well as for biotic resistance of native communities to invasive grasses.

AB  - Directional freezing (in 2 or 10 ml hollow glass tubes) has been reported to improve post-thaw sperm survival parameters compared to conventional methods (in 0.5 ml straws). However, the biophysical properties that increase post-thaw survival are poorly understood. Therefore, the aim for the current study was to investigate the effect of ice morphology on the post-thaw survival of domestic boar spermatozoa directionally and conven-tionally cryopreserved in 0.5 ml straws. Ice morphology was quantitatively analyzed using a combination of cryo-scanning electron microscopy and Fiji Shape Descriptors. Multivariate analysis found a significant, non-linear effect (p < 0.05) of interface velocity on ice morphology, with an increase in both ice-lake size, as indi-cated by area and in aspect ratio, at an interface velocity of 0.2 mm/s. By contrast, post-thaw sperm survival (defined as spermatozoa with both intact plasma membranes and acrosomes) was biphasic, with peaks of survival at interface velocities of 0.2 mm/s (54.2 +/- 1.9%), and 1.0 or 1.5 mm/s (56.5 +/- 1.5%, 56.7 +/- 1.7% respectively), and lowest survival at 0.5 (52.1 +/- 1.6%) and 3.0 mm/s (51.4 +/- 1.9%). Despite numerical differences in Shape Descriptors, there was no difference (p > 0.05) in the post-thaw survival between conventionally and direc-tionally cryopreserved samples at optimal interface velocities of 1.0 or 1.5 mm/s. These findings suggest that: 1) ice morphology has little impact on post-thaw survival of boar spermatozoa, and 2) directional freezing in 0.5 ml straws (rather than 2 or 10 ml hollow glass tubes) may attenuate benefits of directional freezing.

AB  - PM 2.5 is known to be a potential risk factor for the progression of diabetes, particularly type 2 diabetes (T2D). Guilu Erxian Jiao (GEJ), a traditional Chinese medicine containing deer antlers and turtle shells, has been shown to have multiple health benefits. Given the synergistic association between PM 2.5 levels and T2D prevalence, as well as the therapeutic properties of GEJ, this study used treatment of PM 2.5 and glucose to assess the mitigating effects of GEJ intervention in A549 cells. This study aimed to mimic the effects of a GEJ intervention on cell growth, cell death, wound healing, and oxidative stress after T2D patients' exposure to PM2.5. Our findings showed that A549 cells exposure to PM 2.5 or glucose led to a significant decrease in cell growth, an increase in cell death, and impaired wound healing, even at low levels of PM 2.5 (10 mu g mL-1) and glucose (20 mM). Cotreatment with PM 2.5 and glucose at 50 mu g mL-1 and 120 mM, respectively, exacerbated these effects. The administration of 200 mu g mL-1 GEJ resulted in the most significant improvement, regardless of the presence of PM 2.5 orglucose treatment. GEJ was revealed to upregulate antioxidant genes in A549 cells, such as MnSOD and CAT, indicating its potential radical-scavenging effects in cells treated with PM 2.5 and glucose. The findings also revealed that cotreatment with high levels of PM 2.5 and glucose in A549 cells leads to more severe health consequences, including reduced cell growth (decreased by 1.65-2.32%), increased cell death (increased by 4.8%-7.2%), impaired wound healing (reduced by -14-5.0%), and upregulation of reactive oxygen species. In contrast, GEJ intervention helped repair cellular damage (repaired by 3.2-7.9%), improving the wound healing rate from 51% to 63%. GEJ might have the potential to modulate oxidative stress and ameliorate the effects of high PM 2.5 and glucose.

AB  - To meet the current need for sustainable development, vermicomposting (VC), a natural, eco-friendly, and cost-effective technology, can be a wise selection for the bioconversion of organic wastes into value-added by-products. However, no one has tried to establish the VC technology as an economically sustainable technology by exploring its linkage to circular bioeconomy. Even, no researcher has made any effort to explore the usability of the earthworms (EWs) as a protein supplement while assessing the economic perspectives of VC technology. Very few studies are available on the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission potential of VC technology. Still, the contribution of VC technology towards the non-carbon waste management policy is not yet explored. In the current review, a genuine effort has been made to inspect the contribution of VC technology towards the circular bioeconomy, along with evaluating its capability to bioremediate the organic wastes generated from domestic, industrial, and agricultural premises. The potential of the EWs as a protein source has also been explored to strengthen the contribution of VC technology towards the circular bioeconomy. Moreover, the linkage of the VC technology to the non-carbon waste management policy has been comprehensively demonstrated by highlighting its carbon sequestration and GHG emission potentials during the treatment of organic wastes. It has been observed that the cost of food production was reduced by 60-70% by replacing chemical fertilizers with vermicompost. The implication of the vermicompost significantly lessened the harvesting period of the crops, thereby helping the farmers attain higher profits by cultivating more crops in a single calendar year on the same plot. Furthermore, the vermicompost could hold the soil moisture for a long time, lessening the water demand up to 30-40%, which, in turn, reduced the frequency of irrigation. Also, the replacement of the chemical fertilizers with vermicompost resulted in a 23% increment in the grapes' yield, engendering an extra profit of up to 110000 rupees/ha. In Nepal, vermicompost has been produced at a cost of 15.68 rupees/kg, whereas it has been sold to the local market at a rate of 25 rupees/kg as organic manure, ensuring a net profit of 9.32 rupees/kg of vermicompost. EWs embraced 63% crude protein, 5-21% carbohydrates, 6-11% fat, 1476 kJ/100 g of metabolizable energy, and a wide range of minerals and vitamins. EWs also contained 4.11, 2.04, 4.43, 2.83, 1.47, and 6.26 g/kg (on protein basis) of leucine, isoleucine, tryptophan, arginine, histidine, and phenylalanine, respectively, enhancing the acceptability of the EW meal (EWM) as the protein supplement. The inclusion of 3 and 5% EWM in the diet of broiler pullets resulted in a 12.6 and 22.5% increase in their feed conversion ratio (FCR), respectively after one month. Similarly, when a 100% fish meal was substituted by 50% EWM and 50% fish meal, the FCR and growth rate of Parachanna obscura were increased substantially. The VC of maize crop residues mixed with pig manure, cow dung, and biochar, in the presence of Eisenia fetida EWs, yielded only 0.003-0.081, 0-0.17, and 130.40-189.10 g CO2-eq.kg(-1) emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O, respectively. Similarly, the VC of tomato stems and cow dung ensured 2.28 and 5.76 g CO2-eq.kg(-1) CO2 emissions of CH4 and N2O, respectively.
   Additionally, the application of vermicompost at a rate of 5 t/ha improved the soil organic carbon proportion and aggravated carbon sequestration. The land application of vermicompost improved micro-aggregation and cut down the tillage, reducing GHG emissions and triggering carbon sequestration. The significant findings of the current review suggest that VC technology potentially contributes to the concept of circular bioeconomy, substantially negotiates potential GHG emissions, and complies with the non-carbon waste management policy, reinforcing its acceptability as an economically sound and environmentally benevolent organic waste bioremediation alternative.

AB  - Oxidative stress impairs pigs' health and production performance. This study examined the effects of level and source of methionine (Met) supplementation against the diquat-induced oxidative stress in pigs. Forty growing barrows were randomly assigned to four groups. Groups 1 and 2 received a basal diet that was adequate in energy and nutrients (Diet 1), Group 3 received a DL-Met-supplemented diet, and Group 4 received an MHA-Ca-supplemented diet. After 3 weeks of feeding (Phase 1), pigs were injected with 10 mL saline (Group 1) or 10 mg/kg-BW diquat in 10 mL saline (Groups 2, 3, and 4), and then continually fed for one week (Phase 2). During or at the end of Phase 1, there were no differences in nearly all of the growth performance and redox parameters among the four groups. During or at the end of Phase 2, however, the ADFI and ADG were lower (p < 0.01) in Group 2 than in Group 1 while the serum malondialdehyde content was higher (p < 0.05) in Group 2 than in Group 1. The serum glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity and liver superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were lower (p < 0.05) in Group 2 than in Group 1. The serum GPX activity, the serum total antioxidant capacity, and the liver GPX activity were higher (p < 0.05) in Group 3 than in Group 2. There were nearly no differences in these redox parameters between Groups 3 and 4. In conclusion, MHA-Ca and DL-Met, when used at an equivalent bioefficacy level, had similar effects on the pigs' growth performance and antioxidative status. Therefore, increased Met supplementation can improve pigs' antioxidative status.

AB  - Background and aims: The practice of restoration is a source of valuable experience that, analyzed and disseminated, contributes to the improvement of interventions for the recovery of degraded areas. From this conception, in this work we evaluate an outplanting of Prosopis denudans var. denudans in an arid zone located at Auca Mahuida Protected Area (Neuquen, Argentina). The objectives were: to analyze the effect of hydrogel applications after 11 months after planting: and determine the incidence of predation of herbivorous vertebrates in the same period.
   M&M: A total of 651 nursery seedlings were planted distributed in two abandoned quarries. We apply the treatments 1/2 l of hydrogel; 1 l of hydrogel and control (without hydrogel), and protection vs. no protection of metal mesh to evaluate survival and predation. The results were analyzed with generalized linear models.
   Results: The survival was significantly higher and statistically different for seedlings with 1/2 l of hydrogel and metal mesh protection. The protected plants were no predated, and survival in no protected plants was reduced 50% approximately.
   Conclusions: The results show that the chances of survival may be greater with protectors against herbivorous mammals and hydrogel in restoration plantations. However, it is necessary to increase studies on the relationships between root growth and hydrogel doses in different edaphic conditions, particularly in species that can be the framework for the recovery of degraded areas.

AB  - Biological invasions threaten global ecosystems and economies, highlighting the need for sustainable management approaches like classical biological control (CBC), which involves releasing natural enemies from their native range. While releasing multiple natural enemies may enhance the CBC effectiveness, their interactions with host plant defenses remain poorly understood. This study explored the interactions between two congeneric specialist herbivores introduced to control Dioscorea bulbifera (air potato) in Florida, USA: Lilioceris cheni (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), primarily a leaf feeder, and L. egena, primarily a bulbil (aerial reproductive structures) feeder. We examined whether foliar herbivory by L. cheni or induced defenses by jasmonic acid (JA) or salicylic acid (SA) influenced L. egena's feeding behavior and performance on bulbils. We conducted feeding assays to measure bulbil consumption and its relationship with pupal and adult mass as performance indicators. We used dose-dependent assays to test how varying concentrations of diosgenin, a key saponin defense compound in D. bulbifera, influenced the feeding and survival of both beetle species. Results indicated no significant differences in L. egena bulbil feeding across treatments; however, SA-treated plants produced significantly heavier pupae and adults than controls. Dose-response assays revealed non-linear, hump-shaped feeding and survival patterns in L. cheni, while L. egena's feeding and survival decreased with increasing saponin concentrations. These findings suggest that the beetles respond differently to plant defenses while occupying distinct feeding niches, likely allowing for additive impacts on D. bulbifera. This study contributes to understanding plant defenses in CBC and informs strategies to optimize biocontrol programs for managing invasive species.

AB  - Due to their hematophagous life cycle, hard-bodied ticks including the genus Ixodes are a potential vector for numerous pathogenic organisms including bacteria, protozoa, viruses, and infectious prions. The natural geographic range of several hard tick species, includig Ixodes scapularis, has expanded over recent decades. Consequently, there is an ongoing need to maintain, feed, and propagate ticks for host-pathogen interaction studies to better understand and mitigate their impact on human and animal health. Artificial membrane feeding of hard ticks has advanced in recent years, has study design advantages, and should be used, when possible, to reduce animal use, but it also has several limitations that require the continued use of mammalian hosts including mice, guinea pigs, and rabbits. In this overview, we discuss the best management practices for these relevant species with respect to biosafety, health, and optimal host comfort when used in studies that depend on tick feeding. The capsule-jacket method is preferred over the ear sock-E-collar method of tick feeding on rabbit hosts because of better host health, comfort, and increased study versatility.

AB  - Simple Summary: When sows approach birthing in most commercial farms, they are often exposed to continuous light to help farm workers monitor pig health and progress. Being in constant lighting may have a negative effect on sows as mammals often prefer a quiet environment with low stimulation during birthing. In our study, we placed 15 sows in a 12 h light/12 h dark environment, and 15 sows in 24 h light. Sows were watched for ease of farrowing (measured in total time farrowing, birthing interval, and behavior during farrowing). We also measured total piglets born alive and stillborn piglets. Overall, we observed that sows who received darkness gave birth earlier in gestation. Light availability had no effect on total piglets born alive, farrowing behavior, or total length of time giving birth. It was observed that there were more stillborn animals for the sows who received darkness. Overall, it is possible that light availability could have an impact on farrowing behavior and health; however, more factors should be considered in the environment.<br></p>
   <br></p>
   The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of light exposure on farrowing performance in sows. Thirty sows were moved to the farrowing unit at d 110 of gestation and assigned a treatment: 12 h light/12 h dark cycle (Dark) or 24 h light (Light). Treatments began upon entry into the farrowing unit. Video was recorded continuously from initiation of the treatments until completion of farrowing. Data collected included duration of farrowing, birthing interval, and behavior during farrowing. Additionally, the number of total born, liveborn, and stillborn piglets was recorded. Gestation length was different between treatments, with a shorter gestation in Dark treatment sows than Light treatment sows (116.4 vs. 117.1 & PLUSMN; 0.2 d, respectively; p = 0.027). The total duration of parturition and number of liveborn did not differ (p = 0.393). Number of stillborn piglets between treatments did differ (p = 0.018). Dark had more stillborns compared to Light treatment sows (1.5 vs. 0.7 & PLUSMN; 0.2 piglets, respectively). Neither the interval between piglets nor farrowing behavior differed between treatments (p > 0.100). The results from this experiment indicate that a sudden change in photoperiod has the potential to impact the gestation length of sows and number of stillborn pigs.</p>

AB  - Plants of the Elaeagnaceae family are widely used to treat various health disorders owing to their natural phytochemicals. Seabuckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L.) is an economically and ecologically important species within the family with richness of biologically and pharmacologically active substances. Here, we present a chromosome-level genome assembly of seabuckthorn (http://hipp.shengxin.ren/), the first genome sequence of Elaeagnaceae, which has a total length of 849.04 Mb with scaffold N50 of 69.52 Mb and 30 864 annotated genes. Two sequential tetraploidizations with one occurring similar to 36-41 million years ago (Mya) and the last similar to 24-27 Mya were inferred, resulting in expansion of genes related to ascorbate and aldarate metabolism, lipid biosynthesis, and fatty acid elongation. Comparative genomic analysis reconstructed the evolutionary trajectories of the seabuckthorn genome with the predicted ancestral genome of 14 proto-chromosomes. Comparative transcriptomic and metabonomic analyses identified some key genes contributing to high content of polyunsaturated fatty acids and ascorbic acid (AsA). Additionally, we generated and analysed 55 whole-genome sequences of diverse accessions, and identified 9.80 million genetic variants in the seabuckthorn germplasms. Intriguingly, genes in selective sweep regions identified through population genomic analysis appeared to contribute to the richness of AsA and fatty acid in seabuckthorn fruits, among which GalLDH, GMPase and ACC, TER were the potentially major-effect causative genes controlling AsA and fatty acid content of the fruit, respectively. Our research offers novel insights into the molecular basis underlying phytochemical innovation of seabuckthorn, and provides valuable resources for exploring the evolution of the Elaeagnaceae family and molecular breeding.

AB  - PurposeMetabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is a prevalent disease caused by high fat and high cholesterol intake, which leads to systemic deterioration. The aim of this research is to conduct a psychobiological exploration of MASH in adult male rats.MethodsSubjects who were administered a high-fat and high-cholesterol diet for 14 weeks. Then, we assessed the acoustic startle response and alertness through the prepulse inhibition paradigm as well as the associative learning by the use of the passive avoidance test. Also, we explored the astrocyte density in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus.ResultsOur results showed that, whereas the MASH group did not display an impaired associative learning, a lower exploration rate was found in this group. Moreover, a reduced prepulse inhibition was found in these subjects in the case of the weaker and closer-to-the-stimulus prepulse, which indicates a mild alteration in this process. No differences were found in astrocyte density in the MASH group in comparison with controls.ConclusionMASH seems to be linked with cognitive dysfunction. Further research is needed to elucidate the pathway involved in this disease and its underlying mechanism, as well as the potential implication in human health.

AB  - One of the challenges of the energy sector is the identification of renewable resources with less impact on the environment and that are economically viable. This study aimed to estimate the genetic diversity of eleven full-sib families of elephant grass, using quantitative traits associated with bioenergy production. The trial followed a randomized blocks design, with four replications and each plot (family) consisting of five plants, totaling 220 genotypes. Five quantitative traits were measured: dry matter yield, dry matter percentage, plant height, stem diameter and number of tillers. The genetic diversity was estimated using multivariate methods (principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering). The analysis revealed a significant genetic diversity among the full-sib of elephant grass, with a greater variability observed for dry matter yield and number of tillers. The families 1, 2, 5, 7 and 8 exhibited superior genotypes for bioenergy production-related traits. The grouping analysis generated twenty clusters, enabling the differentiation of genotypes. Eight clusters comprised genotypes with a high dry matter yield and plant height, simultaneously, surpassing the overall mean for number of tillers.

AB  - Ninety-five wild forage plants (belonging to 22 species of 18 families) and their corresponding rhizosphere soil samples were collected from wastelands of a large-scale abandoned Hg mining region for total Hg (THg) and methylmercury (MeHg) analysis. The forage plant communities on the wastelands were dominated by the Asteraceae, Crassulaceae, and Polygonaceae families. The THg and MeHg concentrations in the forage plants varied widely and were in the range of 0.10 to 13 mg/kg and 0.19 to 23 mu g/kg, respectively. Shoots of Aster ageratoides showed the highest average THg concentration of 12 +/- 1.1 mg/kg, while those of Aster subulatus had the highest average MeHg concentrations of 7.4 +/- 6.1 mu g/kg. Both the THg and MeHg concentrations in the aboveground plant parts exhibited positive correlations with the THg (r = 0.70, P < 0.01) and MeHg (r = 0.68, P < 0.01) concentrations in the roots; however, these were not correlated with the THg and MeHg concentrations in their rhizosphere soils. The species A. ageratoides, A. subulatus, and S. brachyotus showed strong accumulation of Hg and are of concern for herbivorous/omnivorous wildlife and feeding livestock. Taking the provisional tolerable weekly intake (PTWI) values for IHg recommended by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA in Summary and conclusions of the seventy-second meeting of the joint FAO/WHO expert committee on food additives Rome, Italy, 2010) for human dietary exposure of 4 ng/g into account, the daily intake of IHg by a 65 kg animal grazing on 1.0 kg of forage (dry weight) would be between 190 and 13,200 mu g, three to five orders of magnitude higher than the permitted limit, suggesting a potential risk of exposure.

AB  - Modulating mechanotransduction by inhibiting yes-associated protein (YAP) in mice yields wound regeneration without scarring. However, rodents are loose-skinned and fail to recapitulate key aspects of human wound repair. We sought to elucidate the effects of YAP inhibition in red Duroc pig wounds, the most human-like model of scarring. We show that one-time treatment with verteporfin, a YAP inhibitor, immediately after wounding is sufficient to prevent scarring and to drive wound regeneration in pigs. By performing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on porcine wounds in conjunction with spatial proteomic analysis, we found perturbations in fibroblast dynamics with verteporfin treatment and the presence of putative pro-regenerative/profibrotic fibroblasts enriched in regenerating/scarring pig wounds, respectively. We also identified differences in enriched myeloid cell subpopulations after treatment and linked this observation to increased elaboration of interleukin-33 (IL-33) in regenerating wounds. Finally, we validated our findings in a xenograft wound model containing human neonatal foreskin engrafted onto nude mice and used scRNA-seq of human wound cells to draw parallels with fibroblast subpopulation dynamics in porcine wounds. Collectively, our findings provide support for the clinical translation of local mechanotransduction inhibitors to prevent human skin scarring, and they clarify a YAP/IL-33 signaling axis in large animal wound regeneration.

AB  - Objective: The study was conducted to assess the effect of supplementation with Lactobacillus lactis (LL) on growth performance, hematological parameters, meat quality and intestinal flora in pigs from growing until slaughter. Methods: A total of 72 growing pigs (30.46 +/- 3.08 kg) were randomly assigned to 3 groups (including 3 pens for each group, with 8 pigs in each pen). The three treatments comprised a basal diet (O-0) and two experimental diets supplemented for 14 weeks with 0.01% (O-100) and 0.03% (O-300) LL, respectively. Results: The final body weights of the pigs in the O-100 and O-300 groups were significantly higher (p < 0.05) than those of the O-0 group. In the grower phase, the average daily weight gain (ADG) and average daily feed intake (ADFI) of pigs fed the O-300 diet were higher (p < 0.05) than those of pigs fed the O-0 diet during the grower phase. BUN and MDA were significantly higher (p < 0.05 for all) in the O-0 group than in the O-100 and O-300 groups during the grower phase. No difference (p > 0.05) was observed in the hematological parameters among the three groups during the finisher phase. Counts of LL in the stomach were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in the O-300 group than in the O-0 group. Counts of Escherichia coli in the jejunum were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in the O-0 group than in the O-300 group. Furthermore, the hardness, cohesiveness, gumminess and resilience of longissimus dorsi muscle collected from pigs fed the O-300 diet were higher (p < 0.01; p = 0.024; p = 0.003; p = 0.014, respectively) than those of tissue collected from pigs fed the O-0 diet. Conclusion: Dietary LL supplementation increased final body weight, increased ADG in the grower phase and enhanced meat quality.

AB  - Simple Summary In the livestock industry, intramuscular fat content is an important indicator of the meat quality of domestic animals. The variations of the Acyl-CoA Synthetase Long-Chain Family Member 4 (ACSL4) gene locus are associated with intramuscular fat content in different pig populations, but the detailed molecular function of ACSL4 in pig intramuscular adipogenesis remains obscure. Our study reveals the function of ACSL4 in pig intramuscular adipogenesis and provides new clues for improving the palatability of meat and enhancing the nutritional value of pork for human health. The intramuscular fat is a major quality trait of meat, affecting sensory attributes such as flavor and texture. Several previous GWAS studies identified Acyl-CoA Synthetase Long Chain Family Member 4 (ACSL4) gene as the candidate gene to regulate intramuscular fat content in different pig populations, but the underlying molecular function of ACSL4 in adipogenesis within pig skeletal muscle is not fully investigated. In this study, we isolated porcine endogenous intramuscular adipocyte progenitors and performed ACSL4 loss- and gain-of-function experiments during adipogenic differentiation. Our data showed that ACSL4 is a positive regulator of adipogenesis in intramuscular fat cells isolated from pigs. More interestingly, the enhanced expression of ACSL4 in pig intramuscular adipocytes could increase the cellular content of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as gamma-L eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). The above results not only confirmed the function of ACSL4 in pig intramuscular adipogenesis and meat quality attributes, but also provided new clues for the improvement of the nutritional value of pork for human health.

AB  - Because of the important role that fracture plays in the behavior of ceramic UO2 fuel in a nuclear reac-tor environment, fracture models are a major component of fuel performance codes. As with any aspect of fuel performance, it is crucial to validate these fracture models against experimental data; however, obtaining well-controlled data for conditions representative of a reactor environment is difficult. Quench-ing is proposed here as a relatively simple approach for using in a laboratory environment to achieve conditions that approximate those of a reactor environment. In this paper, an experimental apparatus containing a single instrumented fuel pellet in a sealed section of copper tubing is developed and ap-plied to a series of seven experiments in which the apparatus is first heated to a high temperature (580- 680 degrees C) by immersion in a molten salt bath, then quenched in a cold bath (-10-4 degrees C). Development of these experiments was guided by numerical simulations, and post-test simulations were performed to aid in understanding the experimental behavior and assessing the accuracy of the predictions of fracture initiation and propagation. In addition, similar experiments were performed on solid copper rods to pro-vide temperature-dependent heat transfer coefficients for use in simulations of these experiments. This study demonstrates that quenching is a viable approach for generating thermal gradients representative of those in prototypical light-water reactor conditions at powers of about 5-10 kW/m. Fracture is ex-pected to begin at these power levels, and moderate amounts of radial and axial cracking was observed in these quenching tests.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Non-nutritive sweeteners (NNS) are widely used food additives with unclear reproductive effects. This study examined how dietary NNS supplementation affects taste receptors T1R2/T1R3 expression in female guinea pig reproductive organs. Four groups of ten animals either received the control (basal diet) or basal diet supplemented with either rebaudioside A (RA, 330 mg/kg), saccharin sodium (SS, 800 mg/kg), or sucralose (TGS, 167 mg/kg) for 28 consecutive days. All NNS significantly increased serum progesterone and estradiol levels (P < 0.05). RA significantly upregulated ovarian T1R2/T1R3 expression (P < 0.05), while SS and TGS groups showed higher incidence of follicular cysts and structural disorganization. In uterine tissues, T1R2 expression was significantly higher in TGS and SS groups compared to control and RA groups (P < 0.05), while T1R3 expression was significantly elevated in the SS group compared to all others (P < 0.05). Our findings suggest that dietary NNS supplementation induces ovarian histological alterations, activates sweet taste receptors in reproductive tissues, and elevates serum P-4 and E-2 levels, indicating potential risks to female reproductive health through sweet taste receptor-mediated modulation of steroidogenesis and disruption of follicular development.

AB  - Chickpea is a cool season crop that is highly vulnerable to abiotic stresses such as heat and drought. High temperature during early flowering and pod development stages significantly reduces the crop yield. The wild relatives of chickpeas can be potential donors for the introgression of heat and drought tolerance into cultivated chickpeas for crop improvement. Initially, 600 interspecific lines were derived from crosses between two elite cultivars, CDC Leader (kabuli chickpea) and CDC Consul (desi chickpea), and 20 accessions of Cicer reticulatum. The F-5 interspecific lines were tested for agronomic and seed quality traits including reaction to ascochyta blight disease under field conditions at two locations in 2018. A subset of 195 lines were selected based on resistance to ascochyta blight and acceptable seed quality. These lines were evaluated for their performance under suboptimal conditions at Lucky Lake (2019 and 2020) and Moose Jaw (2019), Saskatchewan, Canada, and Yuma, Arizona, United States (2019-2020). The lines were grown and evaluated at two seeding dates, normal (SD1) and late (SD2) seeding dates, at each location and year. The same lines were genotyped using Cicer60K Axiom (R) SNP chip. The population structure was determined based on 35,431 informative SNPs using fastStructure, and the interspecific lines were clustered at a k-value of 15. Significant marker-trait associations were identified for seed yield from SD1 and SD2 seeding dates, and stress tolerance indices (ATI, K1STI, MP, SSPI, and TOL) using phenotypic values both from individual locations and combined analyses based on BLUP values. SNP marker Ca2_34600347 was significantly associated with yield from both the seeding dates. This and other SNP markers identified in this study may be useful for marker-assisted introgression of abiotic stress tolerance in chickpea.

AB  - Lignocellulosic crop wastes (LCW) are refractory solid wastes that are not biodegradable at appreciable rates in most environments, causing management of LCW been environmental concerns for years. This study investigated the feasibility of low waste emission complete LCW (rice straw (RS), rice husk (RH), and corn straw (CS)) recycling through feeding to Tenebrio molitor Linnaeus larvae (mealworms) using egested frass to produce organic fertilizers. For larvae fed RS, CS, and RH plus nutrients co-diets groups, the 48-day average specific rates of LCW consumption increased by 118.09%, 155.30%, and 87.14%, respectively when compared with that of sole diet groups. The order of the feed consumption rate and conversion rate in a mealworm farm fed on the three LCWs agreed with the trend obtained with lab-scale experiments, with RS>CS>RH. The forty-eight days cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin biodegradation increased by 1.48-17.61%, 4.26-11.50%, and 4.20-15.75%, respectively, for co-fed larvae. Enterococcus sp. and Erwinia sp., which previous reports have indicated are strongly associated with lignocellulose degradation, were identified in the gut microbiome of mealworms fed with RS and CS co-diets. Furthermore, the RS-fed frass quickly formed a high-quality compost within 32 days of composting, which had a germination rate ratio of 8% and 17% higher than that of WB and CS-fed frass. LCA (life cycle assessment) proved a relatively promising environmental-friendly alternative to dispose of RS, using their excreted frass for composting with low waste emissions. This study provides new insight into insect-involved crop waste utilization, and economical strategies for sustainable in situ recycling of LCWs into high-valueadded products.

AB  - Glia-neuron interaction is a crucial feature in aged hippocampus during the occurrence of postoperative cognitive impairment. However, the regulatory effects of microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes in this glia-neuron interaction, the potential mechanisms and gene targets are still to be elucidated. Here, single-cell RNA sequencing was performed to detect the perioperative genomic expression characteristics of neuroglial system in the hippocampus of aged mice, and to investigate the potential cross-cellular mechanisms and valuable treatment options for glia-neuron interaction-related cognitive impairment. We found that postoperative neurons and glia cells exhibited protein dysmetabolism and mitochondrial electron misrouting. Impaired autophagy and circadian rhythm worsened microglia activation/neuroinflammation, and exacerbated these metabolic alterations. Reactive microglia also aggravated astrocyte and oligodendrocyte cytotoxicity through the PGD2/DP and complement pathways, altering glutamate level and synaptic function via the "tripartite synapses" model, and affecting neuronal myelination. Ligand-receptor communication also indicated these synaptic and axonal dysfunctions via enhanced MDK and PTN pathways. Additionally, we found that anesthetic dexmedetomidine hold therapeutic potential within the disrupted neuroglial system. It enhanced neuronal metabolic rebalance (Atf3-related) and reduced neuroinflammation from a multicellular perspective, therefore improving postoperative cognitive impairment. Together, our study proposes an aged hippocampal cell atlas and provides insights into the role of disrupted glia-neuron cycle in postoperative cognitive impairment. Our findings also elucidate the therapeutic potential and mechanism of dexmedetomidine intervention.

AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) function to extensively suppress various problematic factors and are considered a new alternative for improving livestock health and enhancing immunomodulation. In this study, we explored whether AMP regulation has positive influences on Ochratoxin A (OTA) exposure using a porcine intestinal epithelial cell line (IPEC-J2 cells). We constructed a beta-defensin 1 (DEFB1) expression vector and used it to transfection IPEC-J2 cells to construct AMP overexpression cell lines. The results showed that OTA induced cytotoxicity, decreased cell migration, and increased inflammatory markers mRNA in IPEC-J2 cells. In DEFB1 overexpressing cell lines, OTA-induced reduced cell migration and increased inflammatory markers mRNA were alleviated. Additionally, a natural product capable of inducing DEFB1 expression, which was selected through high-throughput screening, showed significant alleviation of cytotoxicity, cell migration, and inflammatory markers compared to OTA-treated IPEC-J2 cells. Our finding provides novel insights and clues for the porcine industry, which is affected by OTA exposure.

AB  - Ocean forecasting is critical for various applications and is essential for understanding air-sea interactions, which contribute to mitigating the impacts of extreme events. While data-driven forecasting models have demonstrated considerable potential and speed, they often primarily focus on spatial variations while neglecting temporal dynamics. This paper presents the TSformer, a novel non-autoregressive spatio-temporal transformer designed for medium-range ocean eddy-resolving forecasting, enabling forecasts of up to 30 days in advance. We introduce an innovative hierarchical U-Net encoder-decoder architecture based on 3D Swin Transformer blocks, which extends the scope of local attention computation from spatial to spatio-temporal contexts to reduce accumulation errors. The TSformer is trained on 28 years of homogeneous, high-dimensional 3D ocean reanalysis datasets, supplemented by three 2D remote sensing datasets for surface forcing. Based on the near-real-time operational forecast results from 2023, comparative performance assessments against in situ profiles and satellite observation data indicate that the TSformer exhibits forecast performance comparable to leading numerical ocean forecasting models while being orders of magnitude faster. Unlike autoregressive models, the TSformer maintains 3D consistency in physical motion, ensuring long-term coherence and stability. Furthermore, the TSformer model, which incorporates surface auxiliary observational data, effectively simulates the vertical cooling and mixing effects induced by Super Typhoon Saola.

AB  - In mammals, sperm acquire fertilization ability after capacitation in vitro or when in the female reproductive tract. The motility patterns of sperm undergo continuous changes from the moment of ejaculation until fertilization in the female reproductive tract. In vitro, hyperactivated motility can be induced through high glucose mediums, while in vivo, it is induced by oviduct fluids. Conversely, sperm maintain linear motility in seminal plasma or uterine fluids that contain low glucose levels. In dairy goat sperm, energy metabolism associated with capacitation depends on the energy sources in vitro, seminal plasma, or the female reproductive tract, especially the glucose levels. However, there is little experimental knowledge that glucose levels affect sperm energy metabolism in dairy goats. To clarify these hypotheses, we incubated dairy goat spermatozoa with different concentrations of rotenone-glucose (ROT), carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone (FCCP), and tigecycline (TIG) in vitro. Sperm motility attributes, ATP content, pyruvate and lactate levels, mitochondrial permeability transition pore fluorescence intensity, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and protein synthesis were analyzed. Sperm motility patterns changed from circular to linear under low glucose conditions compared with those in high glucose conditions and showed a significant improvement in progressive motility and straight line speed, whereas lactate and pyruvate levels and MMP decreased remarkably. Incubation of spermatozoa with ROT, FCCP, and TIG inhibited sperm mitochondrial activity, protein synthesis, oxidative phosphorylation, and ATP levels, thereby reducing sperm motility, including the progressive motility, straight line speed, and total motility. Simultaneously, incubation of spermatozoa with Compound C under low glucose conditions significantly decreased the ATP levels and MMP, as well as liver kinase B1 and AMPK protein expression. Under low glucose conditions, sperm mainly produce ATP through mitochondrial OXPHOS to achieve high speed linear movement, inhibit ferroptosis through the LKB1/AMPK signaling pathway, and further maintain energy metabolism homeostasis.

AB  - Animals protect themselves against pathogens or abiotic factors by innate or adaptive mechanisms. Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega 3) of microalgae modify both human and mice' immune systems resulting in a beneficial balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory pathways. However, scarce information exists on their impact on lactating animals' immunity. The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of dietary inclusion of Schizochytrium sp. (rich in docosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acid), on the expression of several genes involved in the innate immunity of goats. Twenty-four dairy goats were divided into four homogeneous sub-groups (n = 6). All goats were fed individually with alfalfa hay and concentrate. The concentrate of the control group (CON) had no microalgae while those of the treated groups were supplemented daily with 20 (ALG20), 40 (ALG40), and 60 (ALG60) g Schizochytrium sp. Monocytes and neutrophils were isolated from goats' blood in the 20th, 40th, and 60th days from the beginning of the experimental period. The relative transcript levels of TLR4, MYD88, MAPK, IRF3, IFNG, and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL1B, IL2, IL8, TNF), and chemokines (CCL5 and CXCL16) were decreased in monocytes of microalgae treated goats compared to the CON. In contrast, MAPK and IL1B relative transcript levels were increased in neutrophils of ALG40 and ALG60 groups. In conclusion, the supplementation of goats' diet with 20 g Schizochytrium sp. resulted in a downregulation of the pro-inflammatory transcriptions, and following further research could be considered as a sustainable alternative strategy to improve immune function.

AB  - In nature, all plants live with microbes, which can directly affect their host plants' physiology and metabolism, as well as their interacting partners, such as herbivores. However, to what extent the microbiota shapes the adaptive evolution to herbivory is unclear. To address this challenge, it is essential to quantify the intra-specific variations of microbiota effects on plant fitness. Here, we quantified the fitness effects of microbiota on the growth, tolerance, and resistance to herbivory among six genotypes of the giant duckweed, Spirodela polyrhiza. We found that the plant genotypes differed in their intrinsic growth rate and tolerance, but not in their resistance to a native herbivore, the great pond snail. Inoculation with microbiota associated with S. polyrhiza growing outdoors reduced the growth rate and tolerance in all genotypes. Additionally, the microbiota treatment altered the herbivory resistance in a genotype-specific manner. Together, these data show the potential of microbiota in shaping the adaptive evolution of plants.

AB  - Simple Summary: For this paper, we investigated the differences in adipose tissue deposition between sheep breeds with fat and thin tails, relying on advanced techniques like meta-analyses and machine learning to analyze gene expression data. Our findings revealed key genes associated with fat metabolism, shedding light on the genetic factors influencing tail fat in sheep. Notably, three specific genes (POSTN, K35, and SETD4) were identified as significant biosignatures related to fat deposition. This innovative approach (combining data analysis and machine learning) enhances our understanding of how to optimize fat deposition in sheep breeds, which holds potential for more efficient animal breeding strategies and carcass fat reduction. It has been shown that tail fat content varies significantly among sheep breeds and plays a significant role in meat quality. Recently, significant efforts have been made to understand the physiological, biochemical, and genomic regulation of fat deposition in sheep tails in order to unravel the mechanisms underlying energy storage and adipose tissue lipid metabolism. RNA-seq has enabled us to provide a high-resolution snapshot of differential gene expression between fat- and thin-tailed sheep breeds. Therefore, three RNA-seq datasets were meta-analyzed for the current work to elucidate the transcriptome profile differences between them. Specifically, we identified hub genes, performed gene ontology (GO) analysis, carried out enrichment analyses of the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways, and validated hub genes using machine learning algorithms. This approach revealed a total of 136 meta-genes, 39 of which were not significant in any of the individual studies, indicating the higher statistical power of the meta-analysis. Furthermore, the results derived from the use of machine learning revealed POSTN, K35, SETD4, USP29, ANKRD37, RTN2, PRG4, and LRRC4C as substantial genes that were assigned a higher weight (0.7) than other meta-genes. Among the decision tree models, the Random Forest ones surpassed the others in adipose tissue predictive power fat deposition in fat- and thin-tailed breeds (accuracy > 0.85%). In this regard, combining meta-analyses and machine learning approaches allowed for the identification of three important genes (POSTN, K35, SETD4) related to lipid metabolism, and our findings could help animal breeding strategies optimize fat-tailed breeds' tail sizes.

AB  - Italy is among the most important countries in Europe for milk production. The new European policies encourage a transition towards sustainability and are leading European dairy farms to follow new trajectories to increase their economic efficiency, reduce their environmental impact, and ensure social sustainability. Few studies have attempted to classify dairy farms by analyzing the relationships between the structural profiles of farms and the social, environmental, and economic dimensions of sustainability. This work intends to pursue this aim through an exploratory analysis in the Italian production context. The cluster analysis technique made it possible to identify three types of dairy farms, which were characterized on the basis of indicators that represented the three dimensions of sustainability (environmental, social, and economic sustainability) and the emerging structural relationships based on the structural characteristics of the dairy farms. The classification made it possible to describe the state of the art of the Italian dairy sector in terms of sustainability and to understand how different types of farms can respond to the new European trajectories.

AB  - The objective was to evaluate the effects of benzoic acid, bromelain, adipic acid, and humic substance supplementation on nitrogen balance, urinary pH, slurry pH, and manure odorous compounds in pigs. Fifteen castrated male pigs with an initial body weight of 37.9 kg (standard deviation = 4.1) were individually housed in metabolism crates. The animals were allocated to a triplicated 5 x 2 incomplete Latin square design with 15 animals, 5 experimental diets, and 2 periods. The basal diet mainly consisted of corn, soybean meal, and rapeseed meal. Four experimental diets were prepared by supplementing each additive at a concentration of 10 g/kg at the expense of corn starch to the basal diet. Each period consisted of a 4-day adaptation period, a 24 h collection period for slurry sampling, and a 4-day collection period for feces and urine. The feces and urine collected for 24 h on day 5 were mixed at a ratio of fecal weight and urine weight to obtain slurry samples. The apparent total tract digestibility N in pigs fed the humic substance diet was the least (p < 0.05) compared to the other groups. The daily retained N and N retention as % ingested tended (p < 0.10) to be the lowest in the adipic acid group among the treatments. The urinary pH in pigs fed the adipic acid diet was less (p < 0.05) than that in other groups except the benzoic acid group. The slurry pH tended to differ among the treatment groups (p = 0.074) with the lowest value in the pigs fed the adipic acid diet. The concentrations of indole in slurry (p = 0.084) and isovalerate in feces (p = 0.062) tended to differ among the groups with the lowest values in the pigs fed the humic substance diet. In conclusion, adipic acid supplementation in pig diets can decrease urinary pH and slurry pH. Although benzoic acid and adipic acid have limited effects in reducing odorous compounds, humic substances have the potential to reduce some odorous compounds.

AB  - Numerous studies have been devoted to the performance of excavations. However, few studies have focused on the deformation of excavations induced by the construction of other projects. A shield utility tunnel was excavated beneath a deep excavation with high risk in Shenyang, China. Taking this project as an engineering example, the monitoring data were analysed. Then, a three-dimensional finite element simulation considering a hardening soil model with small-strain stiffness was conducted, and the simulation results were verified by field measurements. The results show that the structure and horizontal struts in the excavation exhibit a hogging deformation pattern. The ground settlement outside the excavation is composed of tunnelling-induced settlement and additional settlement caused by the deformation of the disturbed retaining structure, and the additional settlement ratio can reach 1.8 if countermeasures are not taken. In contrast, the additional settlement ratio decreases significantly when the base slab or part of the structure is completed. The internal convex deformation of the retaining structure is induced by tunnelling. In addition, the maximum vertical settlement of the ground increases linearly with the maximum lateral deformation of the retaining wall during tunnelling. An antidisturbance stiffness factor was proposed to evaluate the influence of tunnelling beneath an excavation. The results reveal that the bored piles between the twin tunnels are subjected to repeated disturbances. Properly designed column piles combined with the base slab in the excavation can form a frame, which have a "shelter effect" during tunnelling.

AB  - RNA editing generates genetic diversity in mammals by altering amino acid sequences, miRNA targeting site sequences, influencing the stability of targeted RNAs, and causing changes in gene expression. However, the extent to which RNA editing affect gene expression via modifying miRNA binding site remains unexplored. Here, we first profiled the dynamic A-to-I RNA editome across tissues of Duroc and Luchuan pigs. The RNA editing events at the miRNA binding sites were generated. The biological function of the differentially edited gene in skeletal muscle was further characterized in pig muscle-derived satellite cells. RNA editome analysis revealed a total of 171,909 A-to-I RNA editing sites (RESs), and examination of its features showed that these A-to-I editing sites were mainly located in SINE retrotransposons PRE-1/Pre0_SS element. Analysis of differentially edited sites (DESs) revealed a total of 4,552 DESs across tissues between Duroc and Luchuan pigs, and functional category enrichment analysis of differentially edited gene (DEG) sets highlighted a significant association and enrichment of tissue-developmental pathways including TGF-beta, PI3K-Akt, AMPK, and Wnt signaling pathways. Moreover, we found that RNA editing events at the miRNA binding sites in the 3 '-UTR of HSPA12B mRNA could prevent the miRNA-mediated mRNA downregulation of HSPA12B in the muscle-derived satellite (MDS) cell, consistent with the results obtained from the Luchuan skeletal muscle. This study represents the most systematic attempt to characterize the significance of RNA editing in regulating gene expression, particularly in skeletal muscle, constituting a new layer of regulation to understand the genetic mechanisms behind phenotype variance in animals.

AB  - The high propensity of dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) to oxidation can induce a cascade of cellular immune-oxidative imbalances. On the other hand, PUFA, namely docosapentaenoic acid (omega 6-DPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) can exert immunomodulatory effects by suppressing a pro-inflammatory response. Thus, the objective of this study was to investigate the effect of dietary supplementation with Schizochytrium spp. levels, rich in both omega 6-DPA and DHA on the transcriptional profiling of genes involved in oxidative homeostasis and innate immunity of dairy goats' monocytes and neutrophils. Twenty-four dairy goats were divided into four homogeneous sub-groups; the diet of the control group (CON) had no Schizochytrium spp. while those of the treated groups were supplemented daily with 20 (ALG20), 40 (ALG40), and 60 (ALG60) g/goat/day. The mRNA levels of MGST1 in neutrophils were downregulated (p = 0.037), while in monocytes, SOD2 and SOD3 were downregulated (p = 0.010 and p = 0.044, respectively) in ALG60 compared to the CON group. GPX2 mRNA levels were downregulated (p = 0.036) in ALG20 and ALG60 compared to the CON group in neutrophils. NOX1 was upregulated (p = 0.043) in the neutrophiles of ALG60-goats. NOX2 was upregulated (p = 0.042) in the monocytes of ALG40-fed goats, while higher (p = 0.045) levels were also found in the ALG60 group in neutrophils. The mRNA levels of COX2 were downregulated (p = 0.035) in monocytes of the ALG40 and ALG60 groups. The mRNA levels of PTGER2 were also downregulated (p = 0.004) in monocytes of Schizochytrium-fed goats, while in neutrophils, significant downregulation (p = 0.024) was only found for ALG60 compared to the CON group. ALOX5AP mRNA levels were significantly decreased (p = 0.033) in ALG60 compared to the CON group in monocytes. LTA4H mRNA levels were increased (p = 0.015) in ALG60 compared to ALG20 and ALG40 groups in monocytes, while in neutrophils, a significant downregulation (p = 0.028) was observed in ALG20 compared to the CON group. The inclusion of more than 20 g Schizochytrium spp./day in goats' diet induced imbalances in mechanisms that regulate the antioxidant system, while downregulated the expression of pro-inflammatory pathways in monocytes and neutrophils.

AB  - BACKGROUNDHerbivorous insects cause substantial losses in cotton production worldwide. To resolve insect resistance and environmental pollution challenges, an innovative and eco-friendly strategy for pest management is needed. Insects acquire sterols from dietary sources because they cannot endogenously synthesize them de novo. CrSMT, a sterol methyltransferase gene, can alter sterol profiles. We introduced CrSMT into cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) to modify sterol content. This has enabled the investigation of the potential of CrSMT in pest management.RESULTSCrSMT-transgenic lines were generated via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, and CrSMT was successfully expressed in the transgenic lines L17 and L25. The proportional expression of the three main phytosterols was altered in transgenic cotton. RNA sequencing results showed that numerous pathways associated with insect resistance were enriched in the L17 and L25 transgenic lines, and these pathways contribute to the ability of plants to produce large quantities of volatile secondary metabolites, helping them build defense responses against herbivorous insects. Spodoptera litura preferred R15 (wild-type) to L17 and L25 leaves in selective and non-selective feeding assays. Feeding experiments revealed that growth and development were delayed in S. litura fed transgenic cotton. Similar results were obtained for Apolygus lucorum and Helicoverpa armigera. Larval growth and development were delayed, and the length significantly decreased. In addition, the mortality rate of A. lucorum increased.CONCLUSIONThe results of functional and molecular mechanism analyses of CrSMT overexpression in cotton indicate that CrSMT transgenesis is a promising broad-spectrum and eco-friendly insect-resistance strategy that can alter the sterol content of plant tissues without adverse effects on plants.

AB  - This research investigated antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) in soil receiving wastewater and sludge of smallholder swine farms in northern Thailand. Soil samples were collected from four study sites including soil that received untreated effluent, soil that received sludge from a pond system, soil that received sludge from a biogas system, and soil around swine farm without swine waste amendment. Properties of the soil samples were also examined and the results showed that the soil receiving untreated swine wastewater and soil receiving sludges contained a high volume of nitrogen, phosphorus, and organic matter when compared to soil without swine waste amendment. Most of the ARBs found in the soil were circular-form colonies, rod-shaped cells, and gram-positive and most of them resisted Lincomycin and Amoxicillin. ARBs in soil receiving untreated effluent and soil receiving sludges appeared to be Serratia, Bacillus, Rossellomorea, and Aeromonas. While, ARBs in the groups of Chryseobacterium and Pseudomonas were found only in the soil without swine waste amendment. Almost all the ARBs found in this study were identified to be multidrug resistant bacteria. The findings indicated the appearance of ARBs in the swine farm environment were encouraged by releasing of antibiotic contaminated swine wastes into the environment. This affects antibiotics use in swine farms, antibiotics use for infectious disease treatments and control in humans, and public health systems.

AB  - There is a worldwide focus on reducing the environmental impacts of livestock manure management. In China, there are different manure treatment and application modes, including complete treatment to remove nitrogen (N) for direct discharge into watercourses. But we lack a systematic quantitative comparison of the environmental losses that occur from different management modes. We used an example farm of 10,000 finisher pigs to quantitatively analyze the annual N losses from land application (LA) and treatment to remove N from manure to the level of discharge consent (DS) under 24 sub-modes. This is an important study to unravel the effect of choice of different manure management systems on subsequent N losses. The results showed that the N losses from the LA mode (52.6% of total N excretion) were significantly lower than that from the DS mode (75.9%). Compared with other sub-modes, N emission from whole slurry injection was the smallest, accounting for 43.2% of total N excretion. NH3-N was the main source of N loss which accounted for 72.9% and 50.2% in LA and DS mode, respectively. The lowest N emission of LA mode with mitigation options, including slurry store covers, composting with bio-filter deodorization and injection application, was 28.8% of total N excretion, which is only 42.2% of N emission from DS mode with mitigation options. Insights from this systematic study of different manure management modes in China show the imperative of control ammonia emission for China, and provide guidance to the sustainable manure management in rapidly developing countries.

AB  - The present study investigated the growth performance, immune status, gut morphology, and gut microflora modulation in growing-to-finishing pigs (n = 72; 24 pigs/group) after dietary supplementation with Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis; two groups (experiment 1 (E1) and experiment 2 (E2): 63 and 98 days, respectively) and control (Ct, basal diet). The results revealed that both 1-98 d and 1-63 d groups significantly improved growth performance, including an increase in midtest body weight (MBW) P = 0.0114, final body weight (FBW) P < 0.0001, and average daily gain (ADG) P < 0.0001 and a decrease in the ratio of feed to gain (F/G) P < 0.0001. There was an increase in serum IgG and SOD levels after supplementation with B. subtilis P = 0.0074. Furthermore, B. subtilis potentiated the integrity of intestinal morphology (villus height (VH) P < 0.0001 and villus height/crypt depth (VH/CD) P = 0.0009) in growing-to-finishing pigs. The LEfSe analysis identified 11 and 13 biomarkers in the fecal samples of the 1-63 d group and 1-98 d, respectively. The gut microflora alterations of growth-finishing pigs suggested that dietary B. subtilis could promote gut health by altering the relative abundances of different bacterial communities. A correlation analysis showed that B. subtilis could regulate the functional network of the intestine microflora and their interactions with its host. Taken together, dietary B. subtilis supplementation had a positive influence on the growth performance, gut health, and the composition of gut microorganisms, suggesting that B. subtilis can be used as a functional probiotic candidate for application in the production of growing-to-finishing pigs. Practical Applications. The addition of probiotics in the diet can modulate intestinal health, improve the digestibility of nutrients, and thus, help improve the nutrient utilization and production performance of pigs. It is one of the ideal substitutes for antibiotics. This study will help us understand the function of B. subtilis in the regulation of pig intestinal health, so as to provide scientific basis for the rational use of probiotics in the future pig industry.

AB  - In this study, we examined the interaction between arsenic (As) and nutrients in paddy soil which received pig manure and chemical fertilizers for 36 years (since 1984). The treatments consisted of: CK (without fertilization); NPK (chemical nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium fertilization); NPK30%M (70% NPK plus 30% manure); NPK50%M (50% NPK plus 50% manure); and NPK70%M (30% NPK plus 70% manure). The combined application of pig manure and chemical fertilizer improved grain yield, soil pH and nutrient levels compared to chemical fertilizer application treatment. In comparison to CK, grain yield increased by 55.9%, 75.0%, 74.9% and 71.9%, respectively under the NPK, NPK30%M, NPK50%M and NPK70%M treatments. Soil As concentration increased by increasing the amount of manure input, and the highest concentration of As was 0.64 mg kg(-1) found in the NPK70%M treatment. Increasing the rate of manure application decreased the As bioaccumulation coefficient (BAC) for rice grain. SOC, total N and P showed a positive correlation with the soil-available As concentration and negative correlation with BAC. Furthermore, the partial least square model (PLS) showed that the soil pH and SOC were the most influencing factors on BAC among the different properties of soil, which explained the 75.4% and 17.6% of total variations, respectively. This study concluded that the addition of pig manure together with chemical fertilizers can increase crop production by supplying essential nutrients, but the concentration of As in manure should be monitored to reduce soil and food contamination.

AB  - Simple Summary A unique structure of ruminants, the horn trait is not only closely related to natural and sexual selection but is also an important trait for polled sheep breeding. RXFP2 may be a crucial gene in regulating sheep horn. However, the underlying genetic mechanisms of sheep horn development remain largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the gene expression profile of the horn buds in sheep fetuses using RNA-seq technology. We identified 68 differentially expressed genes in the horn buds of 105-day-old Altay sheep fetuses, including RXFP2, FOXL2, and TNN. Further, we found that the Wnt signaling pathway may be responsible for horn development. Our study provides new possible marker genes for horn development, which may promote our understanding of the genetic mechanisms of sheep horn formation. Horns, also known as headgear, are a unique structure of ruminants. As ruminants are globally distributed, the study of horn formation is critical not only for increasing our understanding of natural and sexual selection but also for the breeding of polled sheep breeds to facilitate modern sheep farming. Despite this, a significant number of the underlying genetic pathways in sheep horn remain unclear. In this study, to clarify the gene expression profile of horn buds and investigate the key genes in horn bud formation, RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) technology was utilized to investigate differential gene expression in the horn buds and adjacent forehead skin of Altay sheep fetuses. There were only 68 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified, consisting of 58 up-regulated genes and 10 down-regulated genes. RXFP2 was differentially up-regulated in the horn buds and had the highest significance (p-value = 7.42 x 10(-14)). In addition, 32 DEGs were horn-related genes identified in previous studies, such as RXFP2, FOXL2, SFRP4, SFRP2, KRT1, KRT10, WNT7B, and WNT3. Further, Gene Ontology (GO) analysis showed that the DEGs were mainly enriched with regard to growth, development, and cell differentiation. Pathway analysis revealed that the Wnt signaling pathway may be responsible for horn development. Further, through combining the protein-protein interaction networks of the DEGs, it was found that the top five hub genes, namely, ACAN, SFRP2, SFRP4, WNT3, and WNT7B, were also associated with horn development. Our results suggest that only a few key genes, including RXFP2, are involved in bud formation. This study not only validates the expression of candidate genes identified at the transcriptome level in previous studies but also provides new possible marker genes for horn development, which may promote our understanding of the genetic mechanisms of horn formation.

AB  - In Cuba, beans are part of the traditional gastronomy and livelihood of the people. During bean harvest, farmers generate high volumes of stubble, which they burn, thus adversely affecting soil health and organic matter, air quality, and greenhouse gas emissions. Bean harvest occurs during the dry season, a period of feed shortage for livestock, such that integrating farming and livestock production could be a way to feed and fatten sheep at little cost. We assessed the feasibility of feeding bean stubble to sheep by determining 1) volumes produced and nutritional value of stubble, 2) acceptability, performance, and carcass yields of lambs fed stubble, and 3) feasibility for this integrated farming-livestock system at local and regional levels. During harvest, 650 tons of stubble are produced in the municipality of Mor & oacute;n by 190 farmers, which represents a potential to feed more than 3,500 lambs, with acceptable average daily gains of 90 g per day with minimal supplementation. We thus affirm this is a viable technological practice with economic, ecological, and social implications as an acceptable alternative to burning stubble to enhance food security and livelihoods of small and medium-sized farms, while generating new employment opportunities, especially for rural women. Future studies are needed to evaluate the economic, ecological, and social impacts of this agriculture-livestock integration technology.

AB  - Liquid swine slurry (LSS) can improve soil quality when applied to agricultural areas. However, when applied indiscriminately, it can cause contamination of soil and water resources. In this context, this study aimed to evaluate the effects on chemical, physical, and water attributes of the soil, resulting from the application of LSS, as well as on water infiltration. In this research, two areas were evaluated, namely: area 1 (treatment 1), where LSS is not applied; and area 2 (treatment 2), with LSS applied to the soil for a period of three years, twice a year. For the physical characterization of the soil, data on moisture, particle density, soil density, and total porosity were analyzed. For the chemical characterization of the soil, analyses were performed for potential hydrogen (pH), organic calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), sodium (Na), sum of bases (SB), cation exchange capacity (CEC), and base saturation (V%). A doublering infiltrometer was employed in order to determine water infiltration into the soil. Treatment 2 showed a higher average water infiltration velocity, in addition to higher levels of organic matter, moisture, and K. However, this treatment resulted in a more acidic soil, with a lower pH and a higher value of H+Al when compared to treatment 1. Significant statistical differences were found between the two treatments for pH, H+Al, K, SB, V, Mg, and organic matter. It can be concluded that the application of LSS in the soil contributes to improving soil quality.

AB  - The earliest Vallesian (similar to 11.2 Ma) sites of Castell de Barber & agrave; (CB) and Creu de Conill 20 (CCN20), in the Vall & egrave;s-Pened & egrave;s Basin (NE Iberian Peninsula), are similarly well sampled but display differences in faunal composition that hint at paleoenvironmental differences. Most importantly, CB records one of the few co-occurrences of hominoids and pliopithecoids in the Miocene of Europe, while primates are seemingly absent from CCN20. Differences are also reflected in the more diverse suid assemblage from CB. To ascertain the paleoecological basis for such differences, here we investigate the diets of the suids from these sites-the suine Propotamochoerus palaeochoerus, the tetraconodontines Parachleustochoerus valentini and Versoporcus steinheimensis, and the listriodontine Listriodon splendens. We use 3D dental topography to infer paleodiet and provide further insight into the local paleoenvironmental differences between these sites. We measure four variables-orientation patch count, relief index, angularity, and mean surface slope-and distinguish herbivorous from omnivorous taxa, with the former categorized as browsers, mixed feeders, and grazers. The analyzed suids are similar in terms of angularity but differ in mean surface slope, orientation patch count and relief index. A canonical variate analysis classifies the CB and CCN20 suids as herbivorous (mixed feeders), except for P. palaeochoerus from CCN20, which displays greater similarities to omnivores (higher surface complexity), suggesting more varied diets in the latter locality. We conclude that, despite being roughly coeval and geographically close (similar to 10 km), these two sites record different local paleoenvironments-with CB representing a very humid and densely forested habitat, and CCN20 recording a more open, arid, and seasonal environment. This confirms previous inferences based on faunal composition and would explain the absense of primates from CCN20. Our study further highlights the relevance of local paleoenvironments for understanding differences in faunal composition among past communities from the same area.

AB  - This study describes the use of a novel activated carbon (AC) adsorbent produced from pig hoove waste for the effective removal of Methyl Green (MG) from aqueous solutions. The AC, synthesized through KOH activation, boasts a substantial surface area of 334.031 m2/g and a total pore volume of 0.007 cm(3)/g. Comprehensive characterization was performed using proximate and ultimate (CHNS) analysis, BET, SEM, TEM, EDX, XRD, FT-IR, XPS, TGA, particle size analysis, zeta potential and zero-point charge (pHZPC). Adsorption data fit the Langmuir isotherm model exceptionally well (R2 = 0.99) indicating monolayer adsorption and followed pseudo-second-order kinetics implying chemisorption. The thermodynamic studies revealed that the adsorption of the MG dye is a spontaneous and endothermic phenomenon. Density Functional Theory (DFT) computations elucidated the adsorption mechanism, highlighting the critical role of oxygen functional groups. The AC's unique properties enabled the development of a bio-adsorbent carbon column capable of removing Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus from raw water samples with a 99% removal efficiency. The study also explored the potential for AC regeneration, demonstrating its versatility and sustainability for various applications. This research not only presents an efficient method for dye removal but also underlines the significance of repurposing waste materials, thereby supporting waste reduction and promoting eco-friendly practices for long-term environmental solutions and pollutant mitigation.

AB  - Simple Summary This study aims to investigate the effects of maternal dietary supplementation with ornithine on productive performance and placental angiogenesis of sows. We found that maternal dietary supplementation with 0.15% ornithine increased the average birth weight of piglets and intestinal development of suckling piglets. In addition, Orn facilitated placental angiogenesis by regulating vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A). These results indicated that dietary supplementation with 0.15% ornithine is an effective strategy to improve the productive performance of sows.Abstract The blood vessels of the placenta are crucial for fetal growth. Here, lower vessel density and ornithine (Orn) content were observed in placentae for low-birth-weight fetuses versus normal-birth-weight fetuses at day 75 of gestation. Furthermore, the Orn content in placentae decreased from day 75 to 110 of gestation. To investigate the role of Orn in placental angiogenesis, 48 gilts (Bama pig) were allocated into four groups. The gilts in the control group were fed a basal diet (CON group), while those in the experimental groups were fed a basal diet supplemented with 0.05% Orn (0.05% Orn group), 0.10% Orn (0.10% Orn group), and 0.15% Orn (0.15% Orn group), respectively. The results showed that 0.15% Orn and 0.10% Orn groups exhibited increased birth weight of piglets compared with the CON group. Moreover, the 0.15% Orn group was higher than the CON group in the blood vessel densities of placenta. Mechanistically, Orn facilitated placental angiogenesis by regulating vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A). Furthermore, maternal supplementation with 0.15% Orn during gestation increased the jejunal and ileal villi height and the concentrations of colonic propionate and butyrate in suckling piglets. Collectively, these results showed that maternal supplementation with Orn promotes placental angiogenesis and improves intestinal development of suckling piglets.

AB  - Prenatal single and combined exposure to lead (Pb) and stress (Ps) impairs neurodevelopment. Prenatal single exposure to Pb or Ps affects the composition of intestinal microbiota, and bidirectional communication between gut microbiota and central nervous system has been well recognized. However, whether gut microbiota mediated the effects of prenatal Pb+Ps co-exposure on neurodevelopmental deficits remains unclear. This study estab-lished rat models with prenatal single and combined exposure to Ps and Pb. We investigated the effects of such prenatal single and combined exposure on hippocampal structures using morphological analyses, on learning/ memory using the Morris-water-maze test, and on fecal microbiota using 16S rRNA sequencing. The mediating roles of gut microbiota were analyzed using the bootstrap method. The study found both single and combined exposure affected hippocampal ultra-structures and spatial learning/memory, and the most significant impair-ments were observed in the Pb+Ps group. Prenatal Pb+Ps co-exposure decreased fecal microbial alpha/beta-diversity. Significantly lower levels of B/F-ratio, class-Bacteroidia, order-Bacteroidales, and family-S24-7, and significantly higher levels of class-Bacilli, order-Lactobacillales, family-Lactobacillaceae, and genus -Lactobacillus were observed in the co-exposure group, compared with the controls. Increased relative abundances of genus-Helicobacter mediated the detrimental effect of prenatal Ps+Pb co-exposure on learning/memory [beta (95%CI) for the total and indirect effects: -10.70 (-19.19,-2.21) and -4.65(-11.07,-1.85)], accounting for 43.47% of the total effect. As a result, increased relative abundances of genus -Lactobacillus alleviated the adverse effects of the co-exposure on learning/memory, and the alleviation effect accounted for 44.55% of the direct effect [beta (95% CI) for the direct and indirect effects: -0.28(-0.48,-0.08) and 0.13(0.01, 0.41)]. This study suggested that prenatal combined exposure to Pb and Ps induced more impairments in offspring gut microbiota and neuro-development than single exposure, and alterations in fecal microbiome may mediate the developmental neurotoxicity induced by such prenatal co-exposure.

AB  - Simple Summary The speed by which amino acids are absorbed into the blood after intake of different protein sources may affect their metabolism and utilization. A better understanding of the absorption pattern can be used to optimize the formulation of diets for pigs and to reduce the nitrogen excretion to the environment. We studied the amino acid appearance in blood of growing pigs after a meal, as influenced by protein source (wheat, soybean meal, enzyme-treated soybean meal, hydrothermally-treated rapeseed meal, casein, or hydrolyzed casein). The amino acid concentration in plasma was influenced by both time after feeding and the protein source. Overall, the highest concentrations were found at 60 min after feeding for all diets, and soybean meal had a prolonged AA absorption compared to especially casein and hydrolyzed casein. We conclude that the AA absorption profiles did not indicate clear differences among protein sources, allowing categorizing in fast and slow proteins sources, but the results show differences in the duration of AA absorption. The aim of the present study was to determine postprandial amino acid (AA) appearance in the blood of growing pigs as influenced by protein source. Seven growing pigs (average body weight 18 kg), in a 7 x 5 Youden square design, were fitted with a jugular vein catheter and fed seven diets containing wheat, soybean meal, enzyme-treated soybean meal, hydrothermally-treated rapeseed meal, casein, hydrolyzed casein, and a crystalline AA blend with the same AA profile as casein. The latter was not eaten by the pigs, therefore being excluded. Blood samples were collected at -30, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, and 360 min after a meal and analyzed for free AA. Overall, plasma AA concentrations were highest 60 min after feeding. There were no differences in plasma AA concentration between casein and hydrolyzed casein, but soybean meal resulted in lower AA plasma concentrations compared with enzyme-treated soybean meal at 60 and 120 min after feeding. There were no differences between hydrothermally-treated rapeseed meal and soybean meal. In conclusion, the ingredients could not clearly be categorized as being slow or fast protein with regard to protein digestion and absorption of AA, but soybean meal resulted in a prolonged appearance of plasma AA compared to casein and hydrolyzed casein.

AB  - The aim of this study was to study the relationship between the methylation level of the promoter region of follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) gene and the mRNA expression of Duolang sheep fed different energy diets. In this experiment, three groups of diets with different energy levels (dietary nutrient level reference (NY/T816 - 2004)) were designed to obtain medium energy level diets with metabolic energy of 10.88 MJ/d. The treatments with high and low energy levels increased and decreased by 15%, 12.51, and 9.25 MJ/d, respectively, on the basis of medium energy level. Total RNA and genomic DNA were extracted from the ovaries of Duolang sheep, and qPCR was performed. Bisulfite genomic sequencing PCR and sequence alignment were used to detect the relationship between the relative expression level of FSHR and methylation. The results showed that the expression of FSHR in high-energy group and medium-energy group was significantly higher than that in low-energy group (p < 0.01), and there was no significant difference between high-energy group and medium-energy group (p > 0.05). The methylation rate of the target fragment in the promoter region of FSHR gene was 41.67% in the high-energy group, 75.00% in the medium-energy group, and 83.33% in the low-energy group. This study revealed that different dietary energy levels had certain effects on DNA methylation level of FSHR gene and then affected gene expression, and the expression level was negatively correlated with methylation level.

AB  - Although advances in the porcine embryo culture system have been achieved, the artificial environment continues to be stressful for the embryos, which hinders development. To identify areas of improvement, transcriptional profiling was performed on in vivo-derived, in vivo-matured and in vitro-cultured, and in vitro-matured and cultured porcine blastocyst-stage embryos. Numerous differentially expressed genes were detected between in vitro-cultured vs in vivo-derived (489 downregulated, 701 upregulated), in vitro-matured and cultured vs in vivo-derived (435 downregulated, 1124 upregulated), and in vitro-matured and cultured vs in vitro-cultured (32 downregulated, 168 upregulated). Moreover, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis revealed upregulation of the p53 signaling pathway in vitro-matured and cultured embryos compared to in vivo-derived embryos. Therefore, in vitro-matured and cultured embryos were cultured with different p53 inhibitors, pifithrin-alpha, pifithrin-beta, or pifithrin-mu, to determine if the stress response could be suppressed to improve development to the blastocyst stage. Culture with 50 mu M pifithrin-alpha improved development to the blastocyst stage (P < 0.05), but total cell number and transcript abundance of p53 target genes remained unaltered. No difference in development was observed after culturing embryos with pifithrin-beta, and embryos cultured with pifithrin-mu demonstrated decreased development. Lastly, two embryo transfers of embryos cultured with pifithrin-alpha demonstrated that the inhibitor did not disrupt developmental competence. Overall, the addition of pifithrin-alpha in the porcine embryo culture medium was shown to have beneficial effects on development and is suitable for generating live pigs with this system.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the addition of wild garlic leaves on the sensory quality, volatiles, color, and texture of sheep milk soft rennet-curd cheese. The sensory evaluation of color, appearance, texture, odor, and taste was performed using a 5-point scale. The intensity of selected taste and odor discriminants was also assessed. Volatiles were analyzed by the GC-MS method. Color and textural characteristics were determined instrumentally. The wild garlic addition had no effect on the sensory characteristics of the cheese (p > 0.05). However, cheese with herbs exhibited a less intensive sour odor (p <= 0.05), sheep's milk odor, and taste (p <= 0.01). (E)-7-methyl-4-decene, dichloroacetic acid undecyl ester, and 3,5-dimethyl-octane, described as creamy, acetic, and acid pungent in smell, were not detected in the cheese with wild garlic while they were present in the natural one. Moreover, herbal cheese was more piquant (p <= 0.01). PCA showed that the differences in volatiles resulted both from the use of wild garlic and the time of storage. Herbal addition affected almost all color characteristics, except for the hue angle (h), but caused an increase only in hardness and chewiness. In conclusion, wild garlic leaves can be recommended as an additive in the production of soft sheep's milk rennet-curd cheese.

AB  - Most intensive swine production systems use invasive practices that increase stress and compromise animal welfare. Apparently, the way in which animals respond to stress is sexually dimorphic. To cope with stress and improve the life of animals, environmental enrichment (EE) is used. The objective of the study was to evaluate how EE and weaning affect the behavior and cortisol levels of barrows and female piglets. Forty piglets were divided into two groups: (1) WEE: piglets that received EE from birth until 21 days of age and whose mothers received EE from week six of gestation until farrowing; (2) NEE: piglets for whom neither them nor their mothers received EE. Cortisol fecal metabolites and frequency, latency and duration of behaviors associated with stress were evaluated and compared before and after weaning. Before weaning, WEE barrows showed less inactive and ingestion behaviors and shorter duration of aggression (p < 0.05), while WEE females showed longer duration of aggression and higher frequency of ingestion behavior (p < 0.05). After weaning, WEE barrows and NEE females had higher cortisol levels, and NEE females showed longer duration of aggression (p < 0.05). In conclusion, piglets' response to EE and the way they learnt to cope with stress were sexually dimorphic.

AB  - Sperm present a highly particular DNA condensation that is acquired during their differentiation. Protamines are key elements for DNA condensation. However, whereas the presence of protamine 1 (P1) is conserved across mammalian species, that of protamine 2 (P2) has evolved differentially, existing only few species that use both protamines for sperm DNA condensation. In addition, altered P1/P2 ratios and alterations in the expression of P1 have previously been associated to infertility and DNA damage disorders. On the other hand, different methods evaluating DNA integrity, such as Sperm Chromatin Dispersion (SCD) and Comet tests, need a previous complete DNA decondensation to properly assess DNA breaks. Related with this, the present study aims to analyze the resilience of sperm DNA to decodensation in different eutherian mammals. Sperm samples from humans, horses, cattle, pigs and donkeys were used. Samples were embedded in low melting point agarose and treated with lysis solutions to induce DNA decondensation and formation of sperm haloes. The treatment consisted of three steps: (1) incubation in SDS + DTT for 30 min; (2) incubation in DTT + NaCl for 30 min; and (3) incubation in DTT + NaCl with or without proteinase K for a variable time of 0, 30, or 180 min. How incubation with the third lysis solution (with or without proteinase K) for 0, 30, and 180 min affected DNA decondensation was tested through analyzing core and halo diameters in 50 sperm per sample. Halo/core length ratio was used as an indicator of complete chromatin decondensation. While incubation time with the third lysis solution had no impact on halo/core length ratios in species having P1 and P2 (human, equine and donkey), DNA decondensation of pig and cattle sperm, which only present P1, significantly (P < 0.05) increased following incubation with the third lysis solution for 180 min. In addition, the inclusion of proteinase K was found to accelerate DNA decondensation. In conclusion, longer incubations in lysis solution including proteinase K lead to higher DNA decondensation in porcine and bovine sperm. This suggests that tests intended to analyze DNA damage, such as halo or Comet assays, require complete chromatin deprotamination to achieve high sensitivity in the detection of DNA breaks.

AB  - Seahorses (Genus Hippocampus; Family Syngnathidae) are iconic fish characterised by tails with prehensile capabilities, which develop after the transition from planktonic to benthonic lifestyle. As a result, seahorses remain attached to vegetal structures or other elements most of the time, both in the wild and under rearing conditions. In the present simulation study, we assessed the effect of artificial holdfast structures on the welfare of Hippocampus reidi juveniles maintained for 30 days under culture conditions. For that, both availability and patchiness of holdfast elements were considered, simulating different levels of habitat complexity. The results attained on the bioindicators assessed (survival, growth, distribution and final colouration) suggest that the viability of juveniles deprived of holdfast elements was not hampered. However, the differences observed in the final colouration of juveniles would be the result of superior welfare condition in fishes maintained in the presence of attachment structures. In addition, lower aggregation of juveniles was promoted by low complexity in simulated habitats. The results seem to indicate that habitat complexity in the wild does not affect juvenile's viability but provides better conditions for shelter and fast access to prey. However, further investigations are needed to evaluate potential detrimental effects of holdfast unavailability as a potential physiological stressor factor.

AB  - As a global focus of animal husbandry, pigs provide essential meat resources for humans. Therefore, analyzing the genetic basis of adaptability, domestication, and artificial selection in pigs will contribute to further breeding. This study performed a genome-wide selection sweep analysis to identify candidate genes related to domestication and adaptive selection via data from 2413 public genotypes. Two complementary statistical analyses, FST (fixation index) and XP-EHH (cross-population extended haplotype homozygosity) were applied. The results revealed that numerous candidate genes were associated with high-altitude adaptability (e.g., SIRPA, FRS2, and GRIN2B) and habitat temperature adaptability (e.g., MITF, PI3KC2A, and FRS2). In addition, candidate genes related to the domestic genetic imprint of indigenous pigs (e.g., TNR, NOCT, and SPATA5) and strong artificial selection pressure in commercial breeds (e.g., ITPR2, HSD17B12, and UGP2) were identified in this study. Specifically, some MHC-related genes (e.g., ZRTB12, TRIM26, and C7H6orf15) were also under selection during domestication and artificial selection. Additionally, a phylogenetic comparative analysis revealed that the genetic divergence between populations does not fully follow the geographical distribution and management history in the major histocompatibility complex region/major histocompatibility complex II haplotypes, unlike that of the genome-wide genotypes. Furthermore, the higher heterozygosity and haplotype alleles of MHC reduce the differences between populations. Briefly, this study not only helps promote the relative theoretical understanding of environmental adaptive selection and domestication but also provides a theoretical reference for disease-resistant breeding in pigs.

AB  - After the drastic redevelopment of the banks of the River Meuse in recent years, on both the Dutch and Belgian sides of the river, numerous exceptional exotic plants unexpectedly appeared. Although their precise introduction vector is difficult to determine with certainty, most of these species have most likely germinated from the old, long-buried seed bank that was uncovered by the works. The seeds were introduced many decades ago (at least 50 but perhaps more like 100 years ago, or even longer) via the wool processing industry, about 50 km further upstream, along the River Vesdre in Belgium. Here, we present a commented and illustrated overview of the 59 taxa observed in recent years. They belong to a very limited number of families that are known to have hard, long-lived seeds (mainly Fabaceae and Malvaceae, which together represent 48 taxa). Most taxa are native to the Mediterranean area, but are often widely naturalized elsewhere in the world, including in wool farming areas, while some are endemic to Australia, South Africa, or South America. The following species had not been recorded before in the Netherlands: Cullen cinereum, Dichondra micrantha, Erodium carolinianum, Lotus ornithopodioides, Malva olbia, Malvastrum americanum, Sida acuta, S. rohlenae, S. sivarajanii, Sphaeralcea purpurata, Tarasa tenella, Trifolium hirtum, T. spumosum, and T. squarrosum. Nicotiana glauca was reported for the first time in Belgium. The most remarkable species are depicted. Perhaps these records are of limited relevance for the Dutch and Belgian flora, because - as in the past - probably none of these wool aliens will be able to establish permanently (although this cannot be ruled out entirely, given the changing climate). Our findings highlight the exceptional longevity of seeds of certain plant families.

AB  - Drought stress represents a prevalent environmental challenge that significantly impedes plant growth. The Chinese hog-peanut (Amphicarpaea edgeworthii Benth.), an amphicarpic legume, can produce both aerial seeds (ASs) and subterranean seeds (SSs). However, it is largely unknown whether there are differences between the seedlings from ASs and SSs in response to drought stress. In this study, the 30-day old AS and SS seedlings of A. edgeworthii are subjected to drought stress by withholding watering for five or ten days. Then, we identify the morphological and physio-biochemical characteristics of seedlings from both ASs and SSs under drought stress. Following ten days of drought treatment, the contents of proline (PRO) and malondialdehyde (MDA), the root shoot ratio, and the rate of water loss were significantly increased, whereas the chlorophyll content and the relative water content were significantly decreased in both AS and SS seedlings. Moreover, compared to AS seedlings, SS seedlings accumulated more hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) while exhibiting significantly lower peroxidase (POD) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities after exposure to ten days of drought stress. These findings indicate that SS seedlings are more susceptible to drought stress. To identify drought-associated genes and reveal the mechanisms underlying drought adaptability in AS and SS seedlings, we performed an RNA-seq-based transcriptomic analysis in AS and SS seedlings exposed to drought stress. We identified 1317 and 2029 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in AS seedlings five and ten days post-drought treatment, respectively, and 1793 DEGs in SS seedlings ten days post-drought treatment compared to the normal treatment (CK). These DEGs were commonly enriched in response-related GO terms. Furthermore, hundreds of transcription factor (TF) genes were identified among the DEGs in AS and SS seedlings after drought treatment. Notably, the ERF, bHLH, NAC, and C2H2 families were predominant in AS seedlings five days following drought treatment, while the bHLH, ERF, MYB-related, and WRKY families were prevalent in both AS and SS seedlings ten days following drought treatment. These findings suggest that the identified TFs may play crucial roles in the response of AS and SS seedlings of A. edgeworthii to drought stress.

AB  - Background/aim: Zygophyllum geslini, an endemic Algerian species, has numerous properties, especially as an antidiabetic drug. In Algeria, this herb serves as condiment in Saharan dishes and as animal feed (Sheep, Goat and Camel). However, few scientific studies have reported on the medicinal properties of this Saharan species. The aims of the present work were to study 1) the chemical aspects of polysaccharides extracted from this plant, 2) their inhibitory effect on pancreatic alpha-amylase in vitro, and 3) theirantihyperglycemic effect in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats in vivo. Materials and methods: First, polysaccharides were extracted from Z. geslini aerial part (ZGAP) in hot water and precipitated with ethanol to obtain ethanolic polysaccharides and with acetone to obtain acetonic polysaccharides. The extracts were characterized using Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. In vitro antidiabetic evaluation was performed using pancreatic alpha-amylase, an enzymerelated to diabetes. In addition, ethanolic polysaccharides were tested in vivo in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats for 4 weeks. The rats received 100 mg/kg ZGAP ethanolic polysaccharides. Results: FTIR spectra showed that ZGAP polysaccharides were heterogeneous in composition, with extraction yield of 14.07 +/- 2.61and 4.48 +/- 1.01 g/100 g of dry ZGAP and had a neutral pH (7.03 and 7.2) for ethanolic and acetonic polysaccharides, respectively. Furthermore, ZGAP polysaccharides showed potential as an alpha-amylase inhibitor, with IC50 = 3.53 +/- 0.09 mu g/mL for ethanolic and 7.31 +/- 0.42 mu g/mL for acetonic polysaccharides. Ethanolic polysaccharides were able to correct hyperglycemia caused by streptozotocin damage. A significant decrease in blood glucose levels and improvement in oral glucose tolerance were observed with ethanolic polysaccharides. Ethanolic polysaccharides extract enhanced the body weight evolution in diabetic rats. Conclusion: Based on these findings, we conclude that ZGAP polysaccharides have interesting in vivo and in vitro antidiabetic activities.

AB  - The results of studying the implemented reproduction of local migratory flows of the Taimyr wild reindeer population in the middle course of Pyasina River, at the border between the western and central parts of Taimyr Peninula (71 degrees 30'-71 degrees 43' N), Siberia, are presented in the postnatal period of 2007. Reproduction studied in two different migratory flows showed a lower fecundity in the Puropyasina branch of the reindeer population, with 47 calves per 100 adult females recorded. In the second, Tareya-Pyasina local branch, the reproduction rates were estimated to have amounted to 64 calves per 100 adult females. In both migratory flows studied (n = 546), with various values of barreness in age groups, animals of all reproductive ages participated in breeding, ranging from 2 to 15 years. Based on the sampling volume (n = 72), the maximum reproduction contribution belonged to 7-year old females, the most numerous and fecund in both flows (lim: 0.450-0.475). Nevertheless, the highest values of age fecundity were recorded in 16-year old females (n = 14): 0.5 female per female of that age group, as well as in females of the oldest ages of 13-16 years (n = 16): 0.438 female per female of those age cohorts. However, because of their already low numbers (2.67 and 3.05% of the sample, respectively), their combined reproduction contribution to maintaining the productivity of the Pyasina flows yielded to the contribution by 7-year old females, which was estimated to have amounted to 13.74%. The greatest percentage of barren females was recorded among the youngest reproductive groups of 2 or 3 years old, being 76.0% and 83.7%, respectively. Fecundity was revealed to increase in wild Taimyr reindeers to a 4-year old age: 0.254 female per female of that age group, with barrness amounting to 49.2%. With each next year of age, the fecundity values grew to reach 0.404 female per 8-year old female. But then those fecundity parameters decreased: 0.393 or 0.342 female per 9- or 11-year old female, respectively. A gradual drop was likewise observed in the productivity of older reproductive groups due to their natural death or commercial elimination. During the 2006-2007 reproduction cycle, the fecundity value of adult wild reindeer females of the combined Pyasina migratory flows was estimated to have amounted to 38.7%, and the offspring value to 23.9%, or 61 calves per 100 mature females, The estimated weighted value of fecundity for these migratory reindeer flows averaged 0.306 female per adult female.

AB  - Vitamin E (VE) is widely used as an antioxidant in boar semen preservation. Its low water solubility and limited bioavailability, however, compromise its functional efficacy during storage. To address these limitations, we developed a lecithin-stabilized vitamin E nanoemulsion (NE) to enhance its dispersibility and antioxidant efficacy. Semen from Duroc boars was diluted in Beltsville thawing solution (BTS) containing either 0.6 mM NE, 4 mM free VE, or no additive, and stored at 17 degrees C. Compared to VE and control groups, NE significantly enhanced sperm motility, preserved the structural integrity of the plasma and acrosomal membranes, and maintained mitochondrial function, while reducing oxidative stress and DNA fragmentation over a 7d storage period (P < 0.01). Untargeted metabolomics revealed that NE supplementation regulated key pathways including unsaturated fatty acid metabolism and glutathione-related antioxidation. Artificial insemination (AI) trials involving 637 sows confirmed that NE-treated semen improved total and healthy piglet numbers per litter (P < 0.05), without adverse effects. These findings suggest that NE provides an effective and practical strategy for enhancing boar semen preservation and reproductive outcomes in porcine production.

AB  - The Tibetan sheep is a typical hypoxia-tolerant mammal, which lives on the plateau, at an altitude of between 2500 and 5000 m above sea level; the study of its hypoxic adaptation mechanism provides a reference for exploring the hypoxic adaptation mechanism of other animals. To grope for the genetic mechanism of adaptation to the hypoxic environment at the transcriptional level in Tibetan sheep testicular tissue, and to identify candidate genes and key pathways related to sheep adaptation, histological observation of testicular tissues from two sheep breeds was carried out using haematoxylin-eosin (HE) conventional staining. A total of 103 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were authenticated in high altitude Tibetan sheep (ZYH) and low altitude Tibetan sheep (ZYM) by RNA sequencing technology (RNA-Seq), which included 50 up-regulated genes and 53 down-regulated genes. Functional analyses revealed several terms and pathways that were closely related to testis adaptation to the plateau. Several genes (including GGT5, AGTR2, EDN1, LPAR3, CYP2C19, IGFBP3, APOC3 and PKC1) were remarkably enriched in several pathways and terms, which may impact the Plateau adaptability of sheep by adjusting its reproductive activity and sexual maturation, and protecting Sertoli cells, various spermatocytes, and spermatogenesis processes. The results make a reasonable case for a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of adaptation to altitude in sheep.

AB  - Simple Summary Mycotoxins in feeds can cause detrimental effects on the growth performance and health of pigs. One of the methods used to overcome the negative effects of mycotoxins in animal feeds is to add toxin sequestering agents to feed. The present work was conducted to determine the efficacy of mycotoxin sequestering agents using an in vitro method. All mycotoxin sequestering agents effectively bound to aflatoxin B1; only activated charcoal effectively sequestered deoxynivalenol; and a bentonite product, an aluminosilicate product, and activated charcoal effectively sequestered zearalenone. The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of mycotoxin sequestering agents for aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), deoxynivalenol (DON), and zearalenone (ZEA) using an in vitro method. The twelve toxin sequestering agents tested were seven bentonite products (bentonite A, B, C, D, E, F, and G), two aluminosilicate products (aluminosilicate A and B), a heulandite product, an activated charcoal product, and a yeast cell wall product. A two-step in vitro procedure was employed to mimic the conditions of temperature, pH, and digestive enzymes in the stomach and small intestine of pigs. All mycotoxin sequestering agents tested were able to bind to AFB1 with a high efficacy (>92%). The DON sequestering rate of activated charcoal (99.1%) was greater (p < 0.05) than that of other products. The ZEA sequestering rate of bentonite F (97.0%), aluminosilicate A (99.6%), and activated charcoal (100.0%) was the greatest (p < 0.05) among the tested mycotoxin sequestering agents. Overall, most mycotoxin sequestering agents had the ability to bind to AFB1, but most products, except activated charcoal, failed to sequester DON and ZEA.

AB  - The mechanisms of the nitrogen deficiency (ND) response are complex and not sufficiently studied in evergreen tree crops. The aim of this study was to investigate the nitrogen deficiency response in two contrasting tea genotypes to reveal molecular crosstalk between tea quality and tolerance to ND. The transcriptional response to two- and four-month nitrogen deficiency was analyzed in tolerant (cv. Karatum) and susceptible (cv. Kolkhida) tea genotypes. Both GO and KEGG analyses indicated that phenylpropanoid pathway was significantly enriched under nitrogen deficiency in both cultivars. Most of the transcription factor DEGs were related to ABA-mediated stress responses; the following transcription factors were upregulated in both genotypes and in both stress periods: TEAK026346 (bZip23), TEAK015869 (RADIALIS-like 3 isoform X1), TEAK022547 (bHLH78) and one was downregulated TEAK030189 (MYB family transcription factor EFM like) indicating their important role for regulation of nitrogen deficiency response. Gene network of phenylpropanoid pathway DEGs indicated the abandoned edges in lignin biosynthesis DEGs. Generally, the results suggest greater stability of the cell wall metabolism and secondary metabolism in tolerant genotype under long term nitrogen deficiency. The revealed lignin biosynthesis genes can be new candidates for molecular breeding to develop tolerant tea genotypes.

AB  - Understanding the deployment ranges and behavior of fishing gear in relation to fishery efficiency will help us grasp the potential impact of future shifts in the fishery on resources and fishing activities. Fisheries for Greenland halibut are conducted by boat in open water during the summer. However, in winter, fishermen travel to fishing grounds on the sea ice using dog sleds, drill holes in the ice, and deploy longlines using metal plate kites. While the scale of deployment varies between boat and ice longlining, the movement of kites used in ice longlining and their effect on the deployment range of the line is not well understood. We conducted experiments using an accelerometer to determine the underwater movement of kites and their effect on the horizontal range of longline deployment. This is the first report describing specific operational information on longline fishing under sea ice, specifically on the effects of the kite on longline deployment. The kite is attached to the leading end of the mainline and deploys the longlines horizontally as it moves downward towards the sea floor. When the kite and mainline are dropped into the sea, the kite extends the line horizontally while shifting forward-facing long side, and forward-aligned short side. The motion resembles a fluttering action primarily influenced by the Reynolds number and moment of inertia. When the mainline is held, the kite descends in a circular motion. With repeated fishing operations and the passage of time, the kite's movement is expected to decrease in both range and speed due to the buoyancy and tension of the mainline. These kite movements suggest that the deployment range of longlines could extend several hundred meters. Therefore, it can be inferred that the impact of winter ice fishing on the Greenland halibut stock is relatively low due to the limited deployment range of the longline when using the kite.

AB  - The feeding of sheep has a significant impact on the processes of wool formation. This especially applies to the fat components of the diet, and in particular, fatty acids. In this regard, the aim of our work was to determine the effect of feeding a watersoluble complex of fatty acids on their content in the internal lipids of the wool of Prekos ewes and lambs obtained from them. The ewes of the experimental group were fed an emulsion of fatty acids consisting of: (9E,12E)-octadeca-9,12-dienoic (& Scy;18:2w6), (9Z)-octadec-9-enoic (& Scy;18:1w9), hexadecanoic (& Scy;16:0), (5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)-icosa-5,8,11,14-tetraenoic (& Scy;20:4w6), octadecanoic (& Scy;18:0) and (9Z,12Z,15Z)-octadeca-9,12,15-trienoic (& Scy;18:3w3). After the removal of surface lipids with carbon tetrachloride, free internal lipids of wool fibers were obtained by extraction with a chloroform/methanol mixture (2:1) in a Soxhlet apparatus, and the bound ones were obtained after preliminary alkaline hydrolysis. Their fatty acid composition was studied using a gas-liquid chromatograph, after converting lipids into methyl esters by direct transesterification of fatty acids. It was established that feeding ewes with a water-soluble complex of fatty acids leads to a significant increase in free internal lipids of hexadecanoic (& Scy;16:0) acid, both in the wool of ewes and in lambs obtained from them. In the covalently bound internal lipids of wool, the content of hexadecanoic (& Scy;16:0), octadecanoic (& Scy;18:0), and (9Z)-octadec-9-enoic (& Scy;18:1w9) acids increased. Although the content of (9Z)-octadec-9-enoic (& Scy;18:1w9) acid only tended to increase, the amount of hexadecanoic (& Scy;16:0) acid significantly increased in ewes from 4.29% to 6.78%, and that of octadecanoic (& Scy;18:0) increased in ewes from 10.62% to 17.35%, and in lambs from 15.20% to 19.04%. This, in turn, led to an increase in the total amount of saturated bound acids in lambs' wool, from 84.49% in the control group to 88.37% in the experimental group. The inclusion of fatty acid emulsions in the diet of sheep, which affect the internal lipids of wool, and in particular, their fatty acid composition, can be used to improve the physical, and therefore technological characteristics of wool raw materials.

AB  - Ammonia (NH3), carbon dioxide (CO2), and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) are predominant gases that are responsible for indoor air quality and air pollution emitted from pig buildings. They are critical for the health of pigs, farm workers, and people living nearby. To achieve an accurate estimation of gas emissions, firstly, hybrid deep learning driven sequential Concentration Transport Emission Model (DL-CTEM) was proposed to estimate the emissions of NH3, CO2, and H2S from a pig building. Then, optimal ventilation control strategies were put forward to improve health-related gas concentrations and air pollution from the pig building. Fifty-three days of hourly measurements data were divided into training data and test data for the DL-CTEM. It was shown that the mean errors between the measurements and the predictions of the proposed model for NH3, CO2, and H2S concentrations were 0.1 ppm, 79.2 ppm, and 106.3 ppb, respectively. The proposed model outperformed when it was built with an optimal structure in the long short-term memory (LSTM) layer. The mean emission rates of NH3, CO2, and H2S based on DL-CTEM were 4.2 mg min(-1), 2887.5 mg min(-1), and 2.1 mu g min(-1). It could provide a feasible way for air pollution emission estimation and health-related ventilation control in a pig building.

AB  - Focused Identification of Germplasm Strategy (FIGS) has been advocated as an efficient approach to predict and harness variation in adaptive traits in genebanks or wild populations of plants. However, a weakness of the current FIGS approach is that it only utilizes a priori knowledge of one evolutionary factor: natural selection. Further optimization is needed to capture elusive traits, and this review shows that nonadaptive evolutionary processes (gene flow and genetic drift) should be incorporated to increase precision. Focusing on plant resistance to insect herbivores, we also note that historic selection pressures can be difficult to disentangle, and provide suggestions for successful mining based on eco-evolutionary theory. We conclude that with such refinement FIGS has high potential for enhancing breeding efforts and hence sustainable plant production.

AB  - Green leaf volatiles (GLV) have been shown in the past to significantly affect herbivore performance in plants by activating direct and indirect defense measures. At the same time, insect herbivores have developed multiple mechanisms to reduce the quantities of Z-3-hexenal, the first product of the pathway. Among the various measures is the abundance of a molecule named hexenal trapping molecule (HALT), which appears to bind large quantities of freshly produced Z-3-hexenal (Z3al). Functional groups like -NH2 within HALT may be responsible for the binding of Z3al. To test for this potential interaction, we tested different amino acids in various binding assays for their capacity to bind Z3al. We found a significant reduction in Z3al production in the presence of these amino acids, presumably through Schiff base formation. In a feeding assay with beet armyworm (Spodoptera exigua), we found a significant impact of a Z3al- or E2al-spiked artificial diet on growth and development. Together, these data indicate that the presence of Z3al in a diet can harm insect herbivores, which may help to further explain the efforts insect herbivores undertake to suppress the biosynthesis of this compound.

AB  - Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins play crucial roles in various enzyme activities, cell signaling and adhesion, and immune responses. While the molecular mechanism underlying GPI-anchored protein biosynthesis has been well studied, the role of zinc transport in this process has not yet been elucidated. Zn transporter (ZNT) proteins mobilize cytosolic zinc to the extracellular space and to intracellular compartments. Here, we report that the early secretory pathway ZNTs (ZNT5-ZNT6 heterodimers [ZNT5-6] and ZNT7-ZNT7 homodimers [ZNT7]), which supply zinc to the lumen of the early secretory pathway compartments are essential for GPI-anchored protein expression on the cell surface. We show, using overexpression and gene disruption/reexpression strategies in cultured human cells, that loss of ZNT5-6 and ZNT7 zinc transport functions results in significant reduction in GPI-anchored protein levels similar to that in mutant cells lacking phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis (PIG) genes. Furthermore, medaka fish with disrupted Znt5 and Znt7 genes show touch-insensitive phenotypes similar to zebrafish Pig mutants. These findings provide a previously unappreciated insight into the regulation of GPIanchored protein expression and protein quality control in the early secretory pathway.

AB  - Isthmus is the region of the oviduct considered a reservoir for spermatozoa, where they are retained and released synchronously with ovulation. Integrins mediate this interaction, and it is suggested that they regulate the viability and capacitation of spermatozoa. Spermatozoa retained in the oviductal epithelial cells show specific characteristics: normal morphology, intact acrosome and plasma membrane, no DNA fragmentation, and low levels of intracellular Ca2+, and protein phosphorylation at Tyr. This work aimed to define spermatozoa's ability to adhere to an immobilized fibronectin matrix and its effects on their viability and capacitation. We found that guinea pig spermatozoa showed a high affinity for adhering to an immobilized fibronectin matrix but not to those made up of type 1 collagen or laminin. This interaction was mediated by integrins that recognize the RGD domain. Spermatozoa adhered to an immobilized fibronectin matrix were maintained in a state of low capacitation: low levels of intracellular concentration of Ca2+, protein phosphorylation in Tyr, and F-actin. Also, spermatozoa kept their plasma membrane and acrosome intact, flagellum beating and showed low activation of caspases 3/7. The spermatozoa adhered to the immobilized fibronectin matrix, gradually detached, forming rosettes and did not undergo a spontaneous acrosomal reaction but were capable of experiencing a progesterone-induced acrosomal reaction. In conclusion, the adhesion of spermatozoa to an immobilized fibronectin matrix alters the physiology of the spermatozoa, keeping them in a steady state of capacitation, increasing their viability in a similar way to what was reported for spermatozoa adhered to oviductal epithelial cells.

AB  - Potential influence of management and handling procedures on alpacas' behavioral and physiological re-sponses has received little research attention so far and these are the first combined observations of alpacas' behavior with physiological stress assessment in Poland. Human influence on a farm animal can be mea-sured by direct contact in neutral conditions and by an animal's reactions during husbandry procedures. Quantifying the strength of the flight response toward approaching persons can help assess an individual's suitability for use in various human-animal contact activities. Shearing is one of the potentially stressful husbandry procedures that can affect alpacas' behavior and welfare. This study aimed to assess flight distance on the pasture and behavioral and physiological reactions during shearing in 34 alpacas. Two related questions have been raised: (1) do reactions to humans affect reactions to the shearing procedure? and (2) is shearing a stressful practice to alpacas based on both salivary cortisol and stress-related behavior? The flight distance toward humans (familiar and unfamiliar person) was measured. The stress reaction during shearing was assessed by behavioral observation and saliva sampling (to determine cortisol level). The animals that had a short flight distance to a familiar person also had a shorter flight distance to an unfamiliar one (P < 0.001). This study did not show that shorter flight distance to humans was connected with less intensive stress response during shearing. There was a difference (P < 0.001) between salivary cortisol levels before and after shearing, indicating that shearing is stressful for alpacas. It was observed that the later in order the animal was shorn, the fewer attempts to break free through abrupt movements were shown (P < 0.05). It was also noticed that the number of agonistic behaviors reduced as the shearing time increased (P < 0.05). Alpacas can adapt to stressful situations, and the animals most sensitive to stress should be shorn last.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The livestock industry negatively impacts the environment by producing high organic and mineral loaded manure and wastewater. On the contrary, manure is also considered as the major focal point of resource recovery. The microfiltration (MF) process in manure treatment is well known for being the least complex and highly energy efficient. However, the major fraction of the dissolve nutrients easily bypasses the MF membranes. In this research work, we reported the efficiency of using MF-nanofiltration (NF) treatment train in a dead-end filtration system for the treatment of raw manure. The objectives were to produce nutrient rich separate streams in reduced volumes and a particle and pathogen-free product water. MF removed TSS above 98% and the COD and phosphorus (P) retention were noticed above 60 and 80%, respectively, within a reduced MF concentrate volume, which accounted for 40% of the initial feed volume. The NF of MF permeate by NF270 showed most promising results by concentrating overall 50 and 70% of the total nitrogen (TN) and potassium (K) within a reduced NF concentrate volume, which accounted for 30% of the initial MF feed volume. Finally, the MF-NF treatment train of raw pig manure could produce a particle-free product water that can be reused in farms to wash barns, to irrigate nearby cultures, or can be applied to specific fields based on the demand.

AB  - Improvement of manure by co-composting with other materials is beneficial to the quality of the amended soil. Therefore, the manure was supplied with either biochar, elemental sulphur or both prior to fermentation in 50 L barrels for a period of eight weeks. The manure products were subsequently analyzed and used as fertilizers in a short-term pot experiment with barley fodder (Hordeum vulgare L.). The experiment was carried out under controlled conditions in a growth chamber for 12 weeks. The sulphur-enriched manure showed the lowest manure pH and highest ammonium content. The co-fermentation of biochar and sulphur led to the highest sulphur content and an abundance of ammonium-oxidizing bacteria in manure. The biochar+sulphur-enriched manure led to the highest dry aboveground plant biomass in the amended soil, whose value was 98% higher compared to the unamended control, 38% higher compared to the variant with biochar-enriched manure and 23% higher compared to the manure-amended variant. Amendment of the sulphur-enriched manure types led to the highest enzyme activities and soil respirations (basal, substrate-induced). This innovative approach to improve the quality of organic fertilizers utilizes treated agricultural waste (biochar) and a biotechnological residual product (elementary sulphur from biogas desulphurization) and hence contributes to the circular economy.

AB  - Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is the main site of adaptive thermogenesis, generates heat to maintain body temperature upon cold exposure, and protects against obesity by promoting energy expenditure. RNA-seq analysis revealed that FGF11 is enriched in BAT. However, the functions and regulatory mechanisms of FGF11 in BAT thermogenesis are still limited. In this study, we found that FGF11 was significantly enriched in goat BAT compared with white adipose tissue (WAT). Gain- and loss-of-function experiments revealed that FGF11 promoted differentiation and thermogenesis in brown adipocytes. However, FGF11 had no effect on white adipocyte differentiation. Furthermore, FGF11 promoted the expression of the UCP1 protein and an EBF2 element was responsible for UCP1 promoter activity. Additionally, FGF11 induced UCP1 gene expression through promoting EBF2 binding to the UCP1 promoter. These results revealed that FGF11 promotes differentiation and thermogenesis in brown adipocytes but not in white adipocytes of goats. These findings provide evidence for FGF11 and transcription factor regulatory functions in controlling brown adipose thermogenesis of goats.

AB  - Galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) is an unavoidable risk to astronauts that may affect mission success. Male rodents exposed to 33-beam-GCR (33-GCR) show short-term cognitive deficits but reports on female rodents and long-term assessment are lacking. We asked: What are the longitudinal behavioral effects of 33-GCR on female mice? Also, can an antioxidant/anti-inflammatory compound (CDDO-EA) mitigate the impact of 33-GCR? Mature (6-month-old) C57BL/6J female mice received CDDO-EA (400 mu g/g of food) or a control diet (vehicle, Veh) for 5 days and Sham-irradiation (IRR) or whole-body 33-GCR (0.75Gy) on the 4th day. Three-months post-IRR, mice underwent two touchscreen-platform tests: (1) location discrimination reversal (tests behavior pattern separation and cognitive flexibility, abilities reliant on the dentate gyrus) and (2) stimulus-response learning/extinction. Mice then underwent arena-based behavior tests (e.g. open field, 3-chamber social interaction). At the experiment's end (14.25-month post-IRR), an index relevant to neurogenesis was quantified (doublecortin-immunoreactive [DCX+] dentate gyrus immature neurons). Female mice exposed to Veh/Sham vs. Veh/33-GCR had similar pattern separation (% correct to 1st reversal). There were two effects of diet: CDDO-EA/Sham and CDDO-EA/33-GCR mice had better pattern separation vs. their respective control groups (Veh/Sham, Veh/33-GCR), and CDDO-EA/33-GCR mice had better cognitive flexibility (reversal number) vs. Veh/33-GCR mice. One radiation effect/CDDO-EA countereffect also emerged: Veh/33-GCR mice had slower stimulus-response learning (days to completion) vs. all other groups, including CDDO-EA/33-GCR mice. In general, all mice showed normal anxiety-like behavior, exploration, and habituation to novel environments. There was also a change relevant to neurogenesis: Veh/33-GCR mice had fewer DCX+ dentate gyrus immature neurons vs. Veh/Sham mice. Our study implies space radiation is a risk to a female crew's longitudinal mission-relevant cognitive processes and CDDO-EA is a potential dietary countermeasure for space-radiation CNS risks.

AB  - Considering the large area of the Indian subcontinent, its known millipede diversity is sparse with only ca. 270 described species in 90 genera, 25 families and 11 orders. So far, not a single polyzoniidan millipede has been described from India. The order Polyzoniida Cook, 1895 is one of the most species-poor millipede groups with less than 80 described species, and includes taxonomically problematic groups, especially in the family Siphonotidae Cook, 1895. Here we report the first representatives of the order Polyzoniida from India, and describe the new genus Theratta n. gen., with the three species Theratta mannavan n. sp., Theratta eravikulam n. sp., and Theratta shola n. sp., using scanning electron microscopy and COI genetic barcoding. Based on the morphological characters we place Theratta n. gen., and the three new species in the tribe Rhinotini Hoffman, 1977 of the family Siphonotidae. The gonopods of the new genus are similar to those of the genus Rhinotus Cook, 1896, but differ from all other Rhinotini in the modification of the podomere II of the anterior telopod, carrying a mesal process on the posterior side and a lamellar process on the anterior side. The three newly described species show a high interspecific genetic distance of 20.9-25.3%. The specimens were collected from the Shola forests (high altitude montane forests) of the southern Western Ghats in Kerala, India. We suggest that more extensive sampling in this area and in the Indian subcontinent in general will yield more new millipede species for science and expand our understanding of the hitherto neglected Indian millipede fauna.

AB  - Bashania fargesii is one of the main food sources for giant pandas in the Qinling Mountains and an important part of forest regeneration after cultivation. The species typically invades old fields through clonal rhizome growth, but we lack knowledge on the importance of clonal integration in this response to episodic changes. Here, we first established 25 transects at eight sites to reveal the invasion of B. fargesii into old-fields. Secondly, we examined the existence of clonal integration (water sharing) in this species using acid fuchsin dye (0.5 %; m/v). Thirdly, we set up a controlled experiment to examine whether clonal integration helps bamboo regeneration under giant panda herbivory. Together, the experiments help understand the use of B. fargesii for giant panda forest management. B. fargesii invasion into old-fields was detected and decreased during change; that is, older fields had less invasion. Clonal integration occurred distally (to old-fields) and proximally (to bamboo forests), with maximum distal distance 3.84 m and proximal 2.13 m. Rhizome severing and culm clipping initially enhanced the performance of bamboo regeneration, especially number of leaves and branches (foraging). Furthermore, for the second year, number of leaves and branches were significantly more while we found no significant effects in the third year. In conclusion, B. fargesii is one of the pioneer plants invading into old-fields but the invasion decreases with change. Ramets at the boundary of old-fields and bamboo forest share water via clonal integration. Intermediate episodic changes (including ramet disconnection and moderate herbivory) could initially help B. fargesii growth, though the impact lessened over time. These findings provided some scientific bases for the management of B. fargesii bamboo forests for giant panda habitat; additional water/soluble nutrients and intermediate episodic changes could be considered for future Bashania bamboo forest management.

AB  - The validation of methods for understanding the effects of many diseases and treatments requires the use of animal models in translational research. In this context, sheep have been employed extensively in scientific studies. However, the imposition of experimental conditions upon these animals may result in the experience of discomfort, pain, and stress. The ethical debates surrounding the use of animals in research have resulted in the adoption of Directive 2010/63/EU. The present study proposes a non-contact method for monitoring the respiration rate of sheep based on video processing. The Detecron2 model was trained to segment the sheep's body, abdominal, and facial regions in the video frames. A motion-tracking algorithm was developed to assess abdominal movement associated with the sheep's respiratory cycle. The method was applied to videos of Rh & ouml;n sheep under experimental and housing conditions, utilising two types of cameras to assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The mean average error (MAE) obtained was 0.79 breaths/minute for the visible and 1.83 breaths/minute for the near-infrared (NIR) method. This study demonstrates the feasibility of video technology for simultaneous and non-invasive respiration monitoring, being a crucial parameter for assessing the health deterioration of multiple laboratory animals.

AB  - The current study aimed at evaluating an untreated pig manure, firstly for its suitability for soil amendment in combination with an agricultural/bio-solid biochar, and secondly for its potential to be used for adsorption of hazardous species, replacing expensive activated carbons. Column soil leaching experiments were designed to simulate field conditions, and physical, chemical and mineralogical analyses were performed for raw materials and/or leachates. For activated carbon production, the manure was gasified by steam or carbon dioxide at high temperatures. Biochars were analyzed for organic and mineral matter, structural characteristics and organic functional groups. Activation by steam or carbon dioxide greatly enhanced specific surface area, reaching values of 231.4 and 233.3 m(2)/g, respectively. Application of manure to the soil promoted leaching of nitrates and phosphates and raised COD values of water extracts. Biochar addition retained these ions and reduced COD values up to 10 times at the end of the three-month period. The concentrations of heavy metals in the leachates were low and, in the presence of biochar in soil blends, they were significantly reduced by 50-70%. The manure presents a significant potential for adsorption of various pollutants or improvement of soil amendment if carefully managed.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Wildlife is an important reservoir for several zoonotic pathogens, and wild animals can contribute to disease transmission to humans or domestic animals via direct or indirect contact. In the One Health approach, the role of wildlife and the wild environment in the maintenance and spread of zoonoses has great importance. Domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) employed in wild boar hunts may be a good indicator to evaluate this. This investigation reports the presence of Leptospira spp. and antimicrobial-resistant Salmonella spp. and Yersinia enterocolitica in wild boar hunting dogs in the Tuscany region (Italy). The results obtained suggest that wildlife may be the source of pathogens detected in dogs; indeed, all pathogens may be carried by wild animals, in particular wild boar. This investigation highlights the possible risk for dogs connected to work activities. Furthermore, considering that humans could be exposed to the same pathogens during outdoor activities, constant monitoring seems necessary to evaluate the transmission risk.
   Domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) used for wild boar (Sus scrofa) hunting may represent incidental hosts for several zoonotic pathogens. This investigation aimed to evaluate the presence of anti-Leptospira antibodies and the occurrence, antimicrobial resistance, and virulence of Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Listeria monocytogenes in sera and rectal swabs collected from 42 domestic hunting dogs in the Tuscany region (Italy). Regarding Leptospira, 31 out of 42 serum samples (73.8%) were positive and serogroup Pomona was the most detected (71.4%) at titers between 1:100 and 1:400. Four Salmonella isolates (9.52%) were obtained, all belonging to serotype Infantis; two of them showed antimicrobial resistance to streptomycin, while pipB and sopE presence was assessed in all but one isolate. Concerning Yersinia enterocolitica, seven isolates (16.7%) were obtained, six belonging to biotype 1 and one to biotype 4. Resistance to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cephalothin, and ampicillin was detected. Biotype 4 presented three of the virulence genes searched (ystA, ystB, inv), while isolates of biotype 1 showed only one gene. No Listeria monocytogenes was isolated from dog rectal swabs. The results suggest that hunting dogs are exposed to different bacterial zoonotic agents, potentially linked to their work activity, and highlight the possible health risks for humans.

AB  - Delving into porcine embryonic myogenesis is the key to elucidate the complex regulation of breed-specific differences in growth performance and meat production. Increasing evidence proves that pigs with less meat production show earlier embryonic myogenesis, but little is known about the underlying mechanisms. In this study, we examine the longissimus dorsi muscle (LDM) by immunohistochemistry and confirm that the differentiation of myogenic progenitors is increased (P < 0.05) in Lantang (LT, fatty) pigs compared with that in Landrace (LR, lean) pigs, which results in more (P < 0.001) differentiated myoblasts (Pax7(-)/MyoD(+)) and less (P < 0.001) myogenic progenitors (Pax7(+)/MyoD(-)) in LT pigs at 35 days post-conception (35dpc). Additionally, embryonic myogenic progenitors isolated from LT pigs show greater (P < 0.001) differentiation capacity with earlier expression of MyoD compared with those from LR pigs. Moreover, Notch signaling is more active (P < 0.05) in LR pig myogenic progenitors than in LT pig myogenic progenitors. Inhibition of Notch signaling in LR myogenic progenitors suppresses Pax7 expression and increases MyoD expression, thus promoting myogenic differentiation. Consistently, the process of myogenic progenitors differentiating into myoblasts in ex vivo embryo limbs is accelerated when Notch signaling is inhibited. These results indicate that Notch signaling facilitates the maintenance of myogenic progenitors and antagonizes myogenic differentiation by promoting Pax7 expression and preventing MyoD expression in LR pigs.

AB  - Homeostasis and survival of various animal species have been affected by changes in environmental temperature, causing animals to evolve physiological systems for sensing ambient and body temperature. Temperature-sensitive transient receptor potential (TRP) channels have multimodal properties that are activated by physical stimuli such as temperature, as well as by various chemical substances. Our goal is to understand the diversity of the vertebrate thermosensory system by characterizing the temperature-sensitive TRPV channels of the elephant shark, which belongs to the Holocephali of the cartilaginous fishes. Since elephant sharks are basal jawed vertebrates, analysis of elephant shark TRPs is critical to understanding the evolution of thermosensory systems in vertebrate lineages. We found that temperature stimulation activated elephant shark TRPVs in an electrophysiological analysis similarly to the mammalian ortholog. The thermal activation threshold of elephant shark TRPV1 (31 degrees C) was similar to the thresholds reported for several other fish species, but was much lower than that of mammalian orthologs. Strikingly, the elephant shark TRPV4 was a cooling-activated channel with a threshold of 20 degrees C, whereas, in several tetrapods, it is activated by warmth. These results suggest that the temperature sensitivity of TRPV4 has changed in vertebrate evolutionary lineages. Furthermore, we also found the elephant shark possesses heat-evoked TRPV3 with a threshold of 42 degrees C, which is absent in more derived teleost fishes. Taken together, our findings elucidate that the vertebrate-type thermosensory system has already emerged in the common ancestor of jawed vertebrates, although their temperature-sensing ranges were different from those of mammals.

Previous studies proved that SIRT2, a member of the sirtuin family, plays a role in oocyte meiosis, but its role in sheep oocyte maturation and its regulating mechanism remains unknown. Firstly, we confirmed the role of Sirt2 in sheep oocytes maturation by supplementation of SIRT2 inhibitor and activator. To further explore the specific mechanism, we performed knockdown of Sirt2 in granulosa cells and then cocultured them with oocytes. Moreover, we determined the effects of Sirt2 on granulosa cell oxidative apoptosis, cell migration, and diffusion, and examined its effects on granulosa cell mitochondrial function, mitophagy, and steroid hormone levels. The results showed that supplementation of SIRT2 inhibitor decreased the oocytes maturation rate (69.28% +/- 1.28 vs. 45.74% +/- 4.74, p < 0.05), while resveratrol, a SIRT2 activator, increased its maturation rate (67.44% +/- 1.68 vs. 78.52 +/- 1.28, p < 0.05). Knockdown of Sirt2 in sheep granulosa cells also reduced the oocytes maturation rate (47.98% +/- 1.43 vs. 33.60% +/- 1.77, p < 0.05), and led to decreased cell migration and expansion ability, oxidative apoptosis, abnormal mitochondrial gene expression, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP level, and increased mitophagy level. Overexpression of Sirt2 improved mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP level and improved mitochondrial function. Furthermore, we found that Sirt2 knockdown in granulosa cells promotes the secretion of P-4 through regulating p-ERK1/2. In conclusion the present study showed that SIRT2 is critical for sheep oocyte maturation through regulating the function of ovarian granulosa cells, especially affecting its mitochondrial function.

AB  - Previous magnetic resonance studies of the dorsal hippocampusin male rats selected for aggressive attitude toward humans revealedlower contents of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), N-acetylaspartate,and creatinine+phosphocreatinine (Cr+PCr), as well as a higher of phosphorylethanolaminecontent, as compared to males selected for tame behavior. The effectof early social instability on the hippocampal volume and spectrumof neurometabolites in the dorsal hippocampus was investigated inadult tame, aggressive, and unselected gray rats Rattus norvegicus. Experimental conditionsof social instability included early weaning, subsequent housingof behaviorally matched males in pairs until the age of 3 months,and daily replacement of cagemates from days 19 to 25. In the controlgroup, rat pups were weaned at the age of 30 days and then keptby 4-5 animals per cage until the age of 3 months. Control aggressivemales were inferior to tame counterparts in hippocampal volumes,both absolute and normalized to individual brain volumes, whileearly social instability had no effect on these indices. In experimentalgroups, lower phosphorylethanolamine and higher alanine contentsin the dorsal hippocampus, as compared to control animals, weredetected in aggressive males only. This fact may be due to a lowerlevel of stress response in these animals, as we observed previously.From the obtained results, it follows that aggressive rats are moresensitive to social instability conditions. Moreover, the earlyinstability conditions and selection for aggressive behavior oppositelyaffect both phosphorylethanolamine metabolism and integral characteristicsof the metabolic profile in the dorsal hippocampus.

AB  - Despite identifying genes regulating the coat colour in Western pig breeds, the genetic basis of the coat colour in Chinese indigenous pigs is still not understood due to the diversity of indigenous breeds and their genetic differences from exotic pigs. In this study, 215 Wuzhishan pigs with three coat colour patterns (white, black, and black-back/white-belly) were used to conduct a genome-wide association analysis. We found that genes responsible for the coat colour in the Wuzhishan breed are located on chromosome 8. Ninety-seven genome-wide significant SNPs are related to the animal's coat colour. Using a haplotype-sharing analysis, we narrowed the potential candidate region to a 10.1 Mb interval encompassing only one gene, RAPGEF2, which participates in the regulation of melanogenesis. Two additional candidate genes, PDGFRA and KIT, are located within 1 Mb of the genome-wide significant SNPs. Gene ontology analysis and literature mining suggest that these candidate genes are associated with the animal's coat colour. mRNA expression results revealed that RAPGEF2 and PDGFRA had significantly higher expressions in black pigs than in white pigs and higher expressions in black skin than in white skin from the same black-back/white-belly pigs. These results suggest that RAPGEF2 and PDGFRA are potential candidate genes regulating the coat colour in Wuzhishan pigs. Interestingly, mutations of KIT (a gene duplication and a G to A substitution at the splicing site in intron 17) were detected in white Wuzhishan pigs but not in black-back/white-belly or black pigs, suggesting a close genetic relationship between white Wuzhishan pigs and Western white pig breeds. In summary, these results indicate that the expression of RAPGEF2 and PDGFRA may cause the coat colour variation by influencing the deposition of melanin, while the mutation of KIT causes the white coat colour. Our results may provide a theoretical basis for the breeding of white coat colour Wuzhishan pigs, and shed light on the complex genetic background of coat colour variations in indigenous Chinese pig breeds.

AB  - The diversity of agricultural systems in European Union (EU) regions and countries is vast and vulnerable to the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reforms. The CAP instruments have suffered several significant changes over the last decades to take into account the new contexts from the various EU enlargements and problems caused by former measures. This dynamic evolution of the farming system calls for updated assessment to better understand the respective policy impacts and to support the design of new and adjusted instruments. In this context, with this research, the intention is to highlight the most recent characteristics of the EU farming system and to assess the respective impacts from CAP measures. To achieve these aims, we considered statistical information from the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) which was exploited through linear programming models. The main findings reveal that EU subsidies have no implication on the structure of EU farming systems. In other words, the most profitable farming systems are the same whether they were provided with the CAP financial support or not, namely those from the 1st Pillar. On the other hand, the CAP rules condition the farmers' options, sometimes towards adopting a more subsidised production, but with lower margins. These frameworks would not be problematic, if the farming systems were more socially and environmentally sustainable, but this is not always the case. In a future scenario of a farming sector which more regulated by the market and less so by the CAP instruments, the environmental impacts will be more short-term than medium- or long-term, where the main problem will be with energy consumption.

AB  - Camels (Camelus dromedarius) are known to have good navigational abilities and can find their home after displacement to far places; however, there are no studies available on the navigational strategies employed by the camels in homing behavior. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate these strategies by displacing female camels equipped with GPS trackers 6 km away from home to totally unfamiliar locations. The experiments comprised displacing nursing or non-nursing female camels 6 km from their living pens to an unfamiliar release site. Some camels were taken to the release site on foot, others were hauled on a truck, both during daytime and nighttime. Displacements journeys were either in a straight direction to the release points, or they consisted of a convoluted path. As a result, camels that had straight outward journeys were able to return home efficiently and rather directly, but camels that had convoluted trips to the release point failed to do so. Moreover, impairing olfactory. visual, and auditory inputs by using mouth/nose muzzles, eye covers and headphones did not affect homing ability. Based on these experiments the most likely hypothesis is that during their small-scale round trips the camels relied on path integration, and that this strategy is disrupted when the camels were subjected to disorientation procedures before release.

AB  - The rat is one of the most commonly used animals in biological research and experimental investigations in medicine. The ultrafine structural components of the epithelium differ depending on the anatomy of the animal and the papilla type. Animal adaptation to food types and environmental circumstances may also be linked to morphological diversity. In the current study, seven male Wistar rat tongues were investigated. For scanning electron microscope (SEM), two rat tongues were immersed in a 10% formalin solution and the other two rat tongues were immersed in a 2.5% glutaraldehyde solution. The tongues of three rats were fixed for regular histological evaluation using triple staining. The three primary components of the Wistar rat tongue are the apex, body and root. The apex had a rounded and bifurcated shape. Filiform papillae and gustatory papillae were easily identified on the dorsal side of the tongue. There were three forms of gustatory papillae; fungiform papillae, vallate papillae and foliate papillae. The purpose of this study was to expose the tongue morphology of the Wistar rat species, which is widely used in investigations. Also, we wanted to show that formalin fixation can be utilized for morphological research in SEM. Finally, the Wistar rat tongue was thoroughly investigated and compared to those of other species.

AB  - Egg parasitoids of herbivorous insects use an interplay of short -and long-range chemical cues emitted by hosts and host plants to find eggs to parasitize. Volatile compounds that attract egg parasitoids can be identified via behavioral assays and used to manipulate parasitoid behavior in the field for biological control of herbivorous pests. However, how and when a particular cue will be used varies over the life of an individual, as well as at and below species level. Future research should expand taxonomic coverage to explore variation in chemical cue use in more natural, dynamic settings. More nuanced understanding of the variability of egg parasitoid host-finding strategies will aid in disentangling the underlying genetics and further enhancing biological control.

AB  - In an abandoned sand pit near Ballendorf (Alb-Donau District, Baden-Wurttemberg), sediments of the Upper Marine Molasse (Lower Miocene) are present. In these sediments, 39 shark and ray species belonging to 29 genera were identified (Aetobatus, Alopias, Araloselachus, Carcharhinus, Carcharias, Centrophorus, Chaenogaleus, Dasyatis, Galeocerdo, Hemipristis, Iago, Isistius, Keasius, Notorynchus, Pachyscyllium, Paragaleus, Physogaleus, Pristiophorus, Raja, Rhinobatos, Rhinoptera, Rhizoprionodon, Rhynchobatus, Scyliorhinus, Sphyrna, Squalus, Squatina, Taeniurops, Triakis). However, in this paper we only illustrate and describe the 23 taxa not already discussed in previous publications on the Upper Marine Molasse deposits of apfingen, Rengetsweiler and Ursendorf, apart from two exceptions: teeth from jaw positions not previously illustrated, and specimens that are better preserved than those in previous publications. Specimens only determined as "sp." were illustrated because it cannot be ruled out that they represent different species to the ones published earlier. Nearly all of the taxa found have Recent relatives; only Araloselachus, Keasius and Physogaleus are extinct. Most of the recovered taxa lived on or near the bottom in the shelf region. Alopias and possibly also Keasius lived higher in the water column. With Isistius, a taxon living in the oceanic realm was present, and the Recent representatives of Centrophorus live in deeper waters. Nearly all taxa fed on invertebrates and/or fishes; Isistius also fed as an ectoparasite. Additionally, two generalist feeders (Galeocerdo, Notorynchus) and one filter feeder (Keasius) were identified. The species Carcharias crassidens, which is not common in the Upper Marine Molasse, was also verified. Other fossils found in this deposit include remnants of odontocete cetaceans, molluscs, balanid barnacles, algae, and teeth of terrestrial mammals. The palaeoenvironment was a warm, shallow-water habitat. Based on greater proximity to the palaeo-coastline, the water depth was probably less than in other Upper Marine Molasse deposits.

AB  - N6-methyladenosine (m(6)A) is the most common reversible epigenetic RNA modification in the mRNA of all higher eukaryotic organisms and plays an important role in the regulation of gene expression and cell function. In this study, m(6)A-modified methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-seq) and transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) were used to identify the key genes with m(6)A modification during mammary gland development and lactation in dairy goats. The results showed that m(6)A methylation occurred at 3,927 loci, which were significantly enriched in the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) and the termination codon region. In the early stage and peak stage of lactation, m(6)A methylation occurred extensively in mammary tissues, and a total of 725 differentially expressed m(6)A-modified genes were obtained, all negatively correlated with mRNA expression. In addition, Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis showed that different methylated genes were mainly involved in the growth and apoptosis of mammary epithelial cells through signaling pathways, such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phospholipase D pathways, and then affected the development and lactation of mammary gland. All in all, we identified and analyzed the methylation events related to the development and lactation regulation of mammary gland at the early and peak lactation stages, and provided a theoretical basis to reveal the physiological regulatory system of mammary gland development and lactation in dairy goats.

AB  - Background: Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) represents a severe threat to human health. Persistent hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia can lead to damaged liver function, while effective interventions for these complications are currently lacking. Deer antler stem cells (AnSCs), a novel type of adult stem cells, significantly reduced liver injury, which was speculated to be achieved through the paracrine pathway. Methods: In this study, AnSC-conditioned medium (AnSC-CM) was used to treat C57BL/6 mice with T1D symptoms induced by streptozotocin (STZ). The therapeutic effects of AnSC-CM on T1D were evaluated, and the underlying mechanism was investigated. Results: It was shown that AnSC-CM alleviated the T1D symptom: decreased body weight, increased blood glucose levels and islet lesions, and reduced insulin secretion. Moreover, AnSC-CM treatment improved liver function and mitigated liver injury in T1D mice. Impressively, the therapeutic effects of AnSC-CM on T1D were better than those of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell-CM (BMSC-CM). The mechanistic study revealed that AnSC-CM significantly downregulated the NF-kappa B signaling pathway in both pancreatic and liver tissues. Conclusions: Therapeutic effects of AnSC-CM on STZ-induced T1D and liver injury may be achieved through targeting the NF-kappa B signaling pathway.

AB  - Bisphenol A (BPA: 2,3-bis (4-hydroxyphenyl) propane) is an environmental chemical widely used in the manufacturing of epoxy polymers and many thermoplastic consumer products. Serious concerns about its safety led to the development of analogs, such as BPS (4-hydroxyphenyl sulfone). Very limited studies about BPS's impact on reproduction, specifically in spermatozoa, exist in comparison with BPA. Therefore, this work aims to study the in vitro impact of BPS in pig spermatozoa in comparison with BPA, focusing on sperm motility, intracellular signaling pathways and functional sperm parameters. We have used porcine spermatozoa as an optimal and validated in vitro cell model to investigate sperm toxicity. Pig spermatozoa were exposed to 1 and 100 mu M BPS or BPA for 3 and 20 h. Both bisphenol S and A (100 mu M) significantly reduce pig sperm motility in a time-dependent manner, although BPS exerts a lower and slower effect than BPA. Moreover, BPS (100 mu M, 20 h) causes a significant increase in the mitochondrial reactive species, whereas it does not affect sperm viability, mitochondrial membrane potential, cell reactive oxygen species, GSK3 alpha/beta phosphorylation or phosphorylation of PKA substrates. However, BPA (100 mu M, 20 h) leads to a decrease in sperm viability, mitochondrial membrane potential, GSK3 beta phosphorylation and PKA phosphorylation, also causing an increase in cell reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial reactive species. These intracellular effects and signaling pathways inhibited might contribute to explaining the BPA-triggered reduction in pig sperm motility. However, the intracellular pathways and mechanisms triggered by BPS are different, and the BPS-caused reduction in motility can be only partially attributed to an increase in mitochondrial oxidant species.

AB  - Understanding the thermal tolerance of insect herbivores and their natural enemies is crucial for biological control programs. The rosy apple aphid Dysaphis plantaginea is one of the most problematic pests of apple or-chards, causing economic losses of up to 30% due to damage to fruits. Dysaphis plantaginea is highly adapted to low temperature, enabling it to appear early in the season. This study aimed at evaluating the critical thermal minimum of D. plantaginea and of two parasitoid species: Aphidius matricariae and Ephedrus cerasicola. For the generalist parasitoid A. matricariae we also evaluated the fitness traits of flight, walking, and oviposition, at four temperatures: 20, 15, 10 and 8 degrees C. We found that both males and females did not fly at the two lowest tem-peratures. Walking, parasitism rate and sex ratio (proportion of female progeny) were reduced at 8 degrees C. In addition, the parasitism rate was significantly lower at 8 and 10 degrees C compared to 15 and 20 degrees C. The progeny emerging from the oviposition experiment at 8 degrees C were significantly larger compared with other temperatures, possibly attributed to longer development time. The fact that the parasitoids were unable to fly at 8 and 10 degrees C, in combination with a more male-biased sex ratio, could reduce their efficiency at low temperature, even though they may still be able to walk and parasitize aphids.

AB  - Understanding the influence of the heavy metal cadmium (Cd) on the phyllosphere microbiome of hyperaccumulator plants is crucial for enhancing phytoremediation. The characteristics of the phyllosphere of Sedum alfredii Hance, a hyperaccumulator plant, were investigated using 16S rRNA and internal transcribed spacer amplicon sequencing of powdery mildew-infected leaves treated or untreated with Cd. The results showed that the colonization of powdery mildew caused severe chlorosis and necrosis in S. alfredii leaves, and the relative abundance of Leotiomycetes in infected leaves increased dramatically and significantly decreased phyllosphere microbiome diversity. However, S. alfredii preferentially accumulated higher concentrations of Cd in the leaves of infected plants than in uninfected plants by powdery mildew, which in turn significantly inhibited powdery mildew colonization in leaves; the relative abundance of the fungal class Leotiomycetes in infected leaves decreased, and alpha and beta diversities of the phyllosphere microbiome significantly increased with Cd treatment in the infected plants. In addition, the inter-kingdom networks in the microbiota of the infected leaves treated with Cd presented many nodes and edges, and the highest inter-kingdom modularity compared to the untreated infected leaves, indicating a highly connected microbial community. These results suggest that Cd significantly inhibits powdery mildew colonization by altering the composition of the phyllosphere microbiome in S. alfredii leaves, paving the way for efficient heavy metal phytoremediation and providing a new perspective on defense strategies against heavy metals.

   A paucity of information on antimicrobial resistance in animals in Rwanda prompted us to conduct this study, the objective of which was to estimate the prevalence of antibiotic resistance among Escherichia coli and Salmonella from the feces of cattle, goats, pigs, and poultry. We found that resistance to tetracycline, ampicillin, and streptomycin were the most frequent among non-type-specific E. coli isolates. Resistance to chloramphenicol, quinolone-based antibiotics, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, and azithromycin were also observed among these bacterial isolates, but with lower percentages. Most of resistant E. coli, including multidrug-resistant strains, were isolated from poultry fecal samples. More than 30% of samples were positive for E. coli resistant to third-generation cephalosporins or quinolone-based antibiotics. All isolated Salmonella were pan-susceptible. These results give an insight into the status of antibiotic resistance in food animals in Rwanda, as well as a call for further research. Also, the findings indicated a need for antibiotic stewardship and antimicrobial resistance surveillance initiatives.
   In Rwanda, information on antibiotic resistance in food animals is scarce. This study was conducted to detect and phenotypically characterize antibiotic-resistant Escherichia coli and Salmonella in feces of cattle, goats, pigs, and poultry in the East province of Rwanda. We isolated non-type-specific (NTS) E. coli and Salmonella using plain culture media. In addition, we used MacConkey agar media supplemented with cefotaxime at 1.0 mu g/mL and ciprofloxacin at 0.5 mu g/mL to increase the probability of detecting E. coli with low susceptibility to third-generation cephalosporins and quinolones, respectively. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed using the disk diffusion test. Among 540 NTS E. coli isolates, resistance to tetracycline was the most frequently observed (35.6%), followed by resistance to ampicillin (19.6%) and streptomycin (16.5%). Percentages of NTS E. coli resistant to all three antibiotics and percentages of multidrug-resistant strains were higher in isolates from poultry. All isolated Salmonella were susceptible to all antibiotics. The sample-level prevalence for resistance to third-generation cephalosporins was estimated at 35.6% with all third-generation cephalosporin-resistant E. coli, expressing an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase phenotype. The sample-level prevalence for quinolone resistance was estimated at 48.3%. These results provided a baseline for future research and the development of integrated surveillance initiatives.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive age-related neurodegenerative pathology of the central nervous system, characterized by a selective loss of dopaminergic neurons of the nigrostriatal pathway and the presence of specific inclusions (Lewy bodies) in dopaminergic neurons. To study the mechanisms of this pathology and to search for possible ways for its correction, genetic mouse models of PD have been designed. Transgenic mice of the B6.Cg-Tg(Prnp-SNCA*A53T)23Mkle/J strain (hereinafter referred to as B6.Cg-Tg), one of such models, carry the A53T mutation in the human alpha-synuclein gene. The aim of this work was to study the locomotor activity and the level of anxiety, as well as the density of neurons in the brain of male B6.Cg-Tg mice aged six months. Sex- and age-matched wild type C57BL/6J mice were used as controls. The obtained results demonstrate that B6.Cg-Tg mice are characterized by a high locomotor activity and low anxiety. In addition, they demonstrate a selective decrease in the density of neurons in the subventricular zone and substantia nigra, as well as in the hippocampal CA1, CA3, CA4 regions and the granular layer of the dentate gyrus. Thus, B6.Cg-Tg mice at the age of six months only partially match the key pathophysiological hallmarks of PD, such as a reduced neuronal density in the substantia nigra and hippocampal CA1 and CA3 regions. Meanwhile, these mice have neither bradykinesia nor high levels of anxiety.

AB  - The Reln gene encodes for the extracellular glycoprotein Reelin, which regulates several brain functions from development to adulthood, including neuronal migration, dendritic growth and branching and synapse formation and plasticity. Human studies have implicated Reelin signaling in several neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. Mouse studies using the heterozygous Reeler (HR) mice have shown that reduced levels of Reln expression are associated with deficits in learning and memory and increased disinhibition. Although these traits are relevant to substance use disorders, the role of Reelin in cellular and behavioral responses to addictive drugs remains largely unknown. Here, we compared HR mice to wild-type (WT) littermate controls to investigate whether Reelin signaling contributes to the hyperlocomotor and rewarding effects of cocaine. After a single or repeated cocaine injections, HR mice showed enhanced cocaine-induced locomotor activity compared with WT controls. This effect persisted after withdrawal. In contrast, Reelin deficiency did not induce cocaine sensitization, and did not affect the rewarding effects of cocaine measured in the conditioned place preference assay. The elevated cocaine-induced hyperlocomotion in HR mice was associated with increased protein Fos expression in the dorsal medial striatum (DMS) compared with WT. Lastly, we performed an RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization experiment and found that Reln was highly co-expressed with the Drd1 gene, which encodes for the dopamine receptor D1, in the DMS. These findings show that Reelin signaling contributes to the locomotor effects of cocaine and improve our understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the cellular and behavioral effects of cocaine.

AB  - Simple Summary The swine industry is constantly looking for efficiency improvement, especially focusing on the artificial insemination (AI) process. One of the trends in AI centers is to maximize the number of doses obtained from one ejaculate. Seminal doses are usually prepared with the sperm-rich fraction or the whole ejaculate, but further studies are needed to understand how to prepare them properly. Thus, this study aims to analyze how accumulative ejaculate fractions may influence sperm storage, AI performance, and offspring. The results indicate that the presence of all ejaculate fractions within seminal doses does not affect either sperm quality or AI performance and offspring health. Therefore, this study highlights the possibility to use the bulk ejaculate for seminal dose preparation, leading to successful AI. Additionally, it results in a more time-efficient preparation of a greater number of seminal doses providing an economic advantage. Boar ejaculate is released in several well-characterized fractions, differing in terms of sperm concentration, seminal plasma volume, and composition. However, the inclusion of the last part of the ejaculate for artificial insemination (AI) purposes is still under debate due to its controversial effects. Thus, there is a need to study the potential synergistic impact of the different ejaculate fractions. We aimed to evaluate the effect of accumulative ejaculate fractions on sperm conservation, AI performance, and offspring health. Ejaculates (n = 51) were collected and distributed as follows: F1: sperm-rich fraction; F2: sperm-rich + intermediate fractions; F3: sperm-rich + intermediate + poor fractions. Each group was diluted in a commercial extender, packaged in seminal doses (2000 x 10(6) sperm/60 mL), and stored at ~16 degrees C. On day 3 of conservation, sperm were analyzed and used for AI (n = 174). High sperm quality was observed after storage without a significant difference between the groups (p > 0.05). Moreover, no differences were obtained for AI performance (pregnancy and farrowing rates, and litter size; p > 0.05) and offspring health (growth and blood analysis; p > 0.05). Conclusively, the presence of all ejaculate fractions within the seminal doses does not impair the reproductive performance, reporting important economic savings according to the economic model included here.

AB  - Background: Intestinal organoids are promising tools in the context of animal experiment reduction but a thorough characterization of the impact of the origin of intestinal stem cells (ISC) on organoid phenotype is needed to routinely use this cellular model. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of ISC donor age on the growth, morphology and cellular composition of intestinal organoids derived from pig. Methods: Organoids were derived from jejunal and colonic ISC obtained from 1-, 7-, 28-, 36- and 180-day-old pigs and passaged three times. Results: We first confirmed by qPCR that the expression of 18% of the >80 studied genes related to various intestinal functions differed between jejunal and colonic organoids after two passages (p < 0.05). Growth and morphology of organoids depended on intestinal location (greater number and larger organoids derived from colonic than jejunal ISC, p < 0.05) but also pig age. Indeed, when ISC were derived from young piglets, the ratio of organoids to spheroids was greater (p < 0.05), spheroids were larger during the primary culture but smaller after two passages (p < 0.05) and organoids were smaller after one passage (p > 0.05) compared to ISC from older pigs. Finally, no difference in cellular composition, evaluated by immunostaining of markers of the major intestinal cell types (absorptive, enteroendocrine and goblet cells) was observed between organoids originating from 7- or 180-day-old pigs, but differences between intestinal site origins were noticed. Conclusion: In conclusion, while the age of the tissue donor affected organoid growth and morphology, it did not influence the phenotype.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a metabolic disease characterized by insulin resistance (IR) and has attracted worldwide attention due to its high prevalence. As a typical persistent organic pollutant, decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-209) has been detected in food and human samples, and the concentration trends increase year by year. In addition, it has been proved to have the potential to increase the risk of IR, but it is rarely reported whether it could aggravate IR in T2DM. Therefore, in this study, the IR-BRL (buffalo rat liver cells with IR) model was applied to study the metabolism toxicity and susceptibility of BDE-209. Results showed that BDE-209 could inhibit glucose absorption and increase the levels of serum total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG), ultimately leading to the disorder of glucolipid metabolism in IR-BRL cells. Besides, it also could cause cell damage by increasing the levels of aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and malondialdehyde (MDA) in cells. Moreover, its potential mechanisms were to: (1) affect the transport of glucose, synthesis of glycogen and fatty acid via IRS-1/GLUT4 and IRS-1/PI3K/AKT/GSK-3 beta pathways; (2) impact the proliferation and differentiation by regulating the expression of Mek1/2, Erk1/2, and mTOR proteins and genes. Furthermore, susceptibility analysis showed that there was a significant synergism interaction between IR and BDE-209, which suggested that IR-BRL cells were more susceptible to the metabolism toxicity induced by BDE-209.

AB  - Pipeline inspection gauges (PIGs) are widely used for nondestructive testing of oil and natural gas pipelines, while above ground markers (AGMs) can locate and track the PIG through a variety of methods, including magnetic flux leakage signals, acoustic signals, and extremely low-frequency (ELF) magnetic signals. Traditional AGMs have the disadvantages of low positioning accuracy and only one-dimensional tracking capability. In this paper, a newly-designed PIG tracking system based on the ELF magnetic field is proposed by assembling dual receivers. Moreover, this paper develops a magnetic field sign-integration algorithm to achieve high-precision and four-dimensional (4-D) tracking of PIG. The simulation and experiment results demonstrate that the tracking system has the capability of 4-D tracking. In comparison with the previously published work, the designed tracking system improves the positioning accuracy and orientation tracking accuracy by more than 50%. The dual receivers tracking system also has the characteristic of high-robustness. Even in the state of lateral offset or tilt, it can still achieve accurate tracking of PIG. The realization of PIG's high-precision 4-D tracking can improve the accuracy of defect location. Moreover, it can also provide the latest pipeline network layout and facilitate pipeline maintenance and pipeline surveying applications.

AB  - Cognitive impairment is a common symptom after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Memory, in particular, is often disrupted during chronic post-injury recovery. To understand the sex-specific effects of brain injury on retrograde and anterograde memory, we examined paired associate learning (PAL), spatial learning and memory, and fear memory after lateral fluid percussion TBI. We hypothesized that male and female mice would display unique memory deficits after TBI. PAL task acquisition was initiated via touchscreen operant conditioning 22 weeks before sham injury or TBI. Post-injury PAL testing occurred 7 weeks post-injury. Barnes maze and fear conditioning were completed at 14- and 15-weeks post-injury, respectively. Contrary to our expectations, behavioral outcomes were not primarily influenced by TBI. Instead, sex-specific differences were observed in all tasks which exposed task-specific trends in male TBI mice. Male mice took longer to complete the PAL task, but this was not affected by TBI and did not compromise the ability to make a correct choice. Latency to reach the goal box decreased across testing days in Barnes maze, but male TBI mice lagged in improvement compared to all other groups. Use of two learning indices revealed that male TBI mice were deficient in transferring information from 1 day to the next. Finally, acquisition and contextual retention of fear memory were similar between all groups. Cued retention of the tone-shock pairing was influenced by both injury and sex. Male sham mice displayed the strongest cued retention of fear memory, evidenced by increased freezing behavior across the test trial. In contrast, male TBI mice displayed reduced freezing behavior with repetitive tone exposure. An inverse relationship in freezing behavior to tone exposure was detected between female sham and TBI mice, although the difference was not as striking. Together, these studies show that retrograde memory is intact after lateral TBI. However, male mice are more vulnerable to post-injury anterograde memory deficits. These behaviors were not associated with gross pathological change near the site injury or in subcortical brain regions associated with memory formation. Future studies that incorporate pre- and post-injury behavioral analysis will be integral in defining sex-specific memory impairment after TBI.

AB  - Incorporation of exotic plants into the diets of native herbivores is a common phenomenon, influencing interactions with natural enemies and providing insight into the tritrophic costs and benefits of dietary expansion. We evaluated how use of an exotic plant, Plantago lanceolata, impacted immune performance, development and susceptibility to pathogen infection in the neotropical herbivore Anartia jatrophae (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae). Caterpillars were reared on P. lanceolata or a native plant, Bacopa monnieri, and experimentally infected with a pathogenic virus, Junonia coenia densovirus. We found that virus-challenged herbivores exhibited higher survival rates and lower viral burdens when reared on P. lanceolata compared to B. monnieri, though immune performance and development time were largely similar on the two plants. These findings reveal that use of an exotic plant can impact the vulnerability of a native herbivore to pathogen infection, suggesting diet-mediated protection against disease as a potential mechanism facilitating the incorporation of novel resources.

AB  - In the context of densely populated urban areas, vertical greenery systems are gaining momentum for their role in reintroducing nature and enhancing buildings sustainability. Despite this trend, the absence of a standardised methodology for designing sustainable vertical greenery systems and guidelines for selecting appropriate growing media for this technology are two crucial gaps in academic research. This study addresses this by testing six alternative growing media derived from local bio-resources (dried M. spicatum, hazelnut shells, coffee grounds, hemp stalks, grinded cork, and raw sheep wool) and comparing them with a standard growing medium. The experiment was conducted over 120 days, monitoring the health and growth of three plant species C. comosum, S. wallisii, and M. spicata. Innovative tools, such as a multi-criteria matrix and the Mean Leaf Growth Index, were introduced to assess sustainability and plant development. The findings highlight promising outcomes for hazelnut shells-based, hemp stalks-based, and grinded cork-based growing media, showcasing their lightweight and stable attributes compared to standard growing medium and assuring good plants health and growth. In contrast, raw sheep wool-based, M. spicatum-based, and coffee grounds-based growing media present challenges in plant health and growth, despite interesting attributes concerning lightweight and low water demand. This research contributes to shaping a design-by-components strategy for more sustainable vertical greenery systems, emphasizing the crucial role of circular bio-resources in nature-based technological innovations.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of ovarian hormones on dopaminergic regulation of prepulse inhibition (PPI), a measure of sensorimotor gating deficient in schizophrenia and other psychiatric illnesses. Either in adulthood (11 weeks of age) or adolescence (5 weeks of age), female mice underwent ovariectomy (OVX) and were implanted with 17(3-estradiol, progesterone, or a combination of these hormones. All mice were tested in adulthood for the acute effect of the dopamine receptor agonist, apomorphine, on PPI. Apomorphine treatment reduced PPI in intact mice and this effect was blocked after OVX in adulthood. A low dose implant of 17(3-estradiol prevented this OVX effect and reinstated apomorphine-induced PPI disruption. Following adolescent OVX, the effect of apomorphine was not altered and it significantly reduced PPI in adulthood. A low dose implant of 17(3-estradiol following adolescent OVX effect blocked apomorphine-induced PPI disruption in adulthood. Apomorphine had no effect on PPI in any of the mice treated with the high dose of 17(3-estradiol or a combination of low-dose 17(3-estradiol and progesterone, irrespective of treatment age, suggesting an antipsychotic action. Apomorphine tended to disrupt PPI in mice treated with progesterone only, irrespective of age of OVX. These results suggest that in adult mice, circulating 17(3-estradiol and progesterone play an important role in dopaminergic regulation of PPI. This role may develop during adolescence as similar effects of OVX and ovarian hormones were not observed following interventions in 5-week old mice. Our results also confirm and extend previous evidence that 17(3-estradiol may have antipsychotic properties.

AB  - Although liquefaction technology has been extensively applied, plenty of biomass remains tainted with heavy metals (HMs). A meta -analysis of literature published from 2010 to 2023 was conducted to investigate the effects of liquefaction conditions and biomass characteristics on the remaining ratio and chemical speciation of HMs in biochar, aiming to achieve harmless treatment of biomass contaminated with HMs. The results showed that a liquefaction time of 1-3 h led to the largest HMs remaining ratio in biochar, with the mean ranging from 84.09% to 92.76%, compared with liquefaction times of less than 1 h and more than 3 h. Organic and acidic solvents liquefied biochar exhibited the greatest and lowest HMs remaining ratio. The effect of liquefaction temperature on HMs remaining ratio was not significant. The C, H, O, volatile matter, and fixed carbon contents of biomass were negatively correlated with the HMs remaining ratio, and N, S, and ash were positively correlated. In addition, liquefaction significantly transformed the HMs in biochar from bioavailable fractions (F1 and F2) to stable fractions (F3) ( P < 0.05) when the temperature was increased to 280-330 degree celsius, with a liquefaction time of 1-3 h, and organic solvent as the liquefaction solvent. N and ash in biomass were positively correlated with the residue state (F4) of HMs in biochar and negatively correlated with F1 or F2, while H, O, fixed carbon, and volatile matter were negatively correlated with F4 but positively correlated with F3. Machine learning results showed that the contribution of biomass characteristics to HMs remaining ratio was higher than that of liquefaction factor. The most prominent contribution to the chemical speciation changes of HMs was the characteristics of HMs themselves, followed by ash content in biomass, liquefaction time, and C content. The findings of this meta -analysis contribute to factor selection, modification, and application of liquefied biomass to reducing risks.

AB  - Host plant specialisation by herbivorous insects is ubiquitous, especially among the Lepidoptera. Many taxa have the ability to accumulate toxic compounds from their host plants that serve as chemical defences against natural enemies. Despite common knowledge of this pattern among insect ecologists, we still have much to learn about how dietary variation affects an insect's ability to acquire toxic plant chemicals.Longwing butterfly larvae (Heliconius) accumulate toxic cyanogenic glucosides from their host plants, passion vines (Passiflora), that make them toxic to most predators.Here, we present on zebra longwing (H. charithonia) caterpillar cohorts that were reared on native P. affinis, P. biflora, P. lutea, or P. suberosa to determine how host usage affected cyanide accumulation over larval developmental stages, and ultimately the toxicity of adult butterflies. Samples were collected at third, fourth and fifth instars, and teneral adults. Cyanogenic glucosides were extracted, the cyanide molecules were captured as sodium cyanide (CN), and CN content was quantified colorimetrically.The quantity of CN acquired increased linearly over larval ontogeny and was variable among host plants. CN concentration increased over larval development for two hosts but declined on the third. There was no clear relationship between host plant and adult CN concentrations, but adults that consumed certain hosts as larvae ended up accumulating significantly more CN, and thus expressed higher CN concentrations, than others.We demonstrated that some host plants provide specialist insects with more toxins than others and that larval secondary chemical accumulation may predict which life stages are more vulnerable to natural enemies. These conclusions support the hypothesis that host choice affects the survival of specialist insect herbivores.

AB  - Buffaloes play a crucial role in Asian agriculture, enhancing food security and rural development. Their distinct metabolic needs drive tissue-specific mitochondrial adaptations, regulated by both mitochondrial and nuclear genomes. This study explores how nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes involved in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism vary across tissues-an area with significant implications for buffalo health, productivity, and human health. We hypothesize that tissue-specific variations in metabolic pathways are reflected in the expression of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes, which are tailored to the metabolic needs of each tissue. We utilized high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data to assess the expression of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes related to lipid and carbohydrate metabolism across various tissues in healthy female buffaloes aged 3-5 years, including the kidney, heart, brain, and ovary. Differential expression analysis was performed using DESeq2, with significance set at p < 0.05 for Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses. A total of 164 genes exhibited tissue-specific regulation, with the heart and brain, which have higher energy demands, expressing more genes than the kidney and ovary. Notably, the comparison between the kidney and ovary showed the highest number of differentially expressed genes. Interestingly, the kidney up-regulates gluconeogenesis-related genes (e.g., PCK2, PCCA, LDHD), promoting glucose production, while these genes are down-regulated in the ovary. In contrast, the brain up-regulates pyruvate metabolism genes (e.g., PCCA, PDHA1, LDHD), underscoring its reliance on glucose as a primary energy source, while these genes are down-regulated in the ovary. The higher abundance of EHHADH in the brain compared to the ovary further emphasizes the critical role of fatty acid metabolism in brain function, aligned with the brain's high energy demands. Additionally, down-regulation of the StAR gene in both the kidney versus ovary and brain versus ovary comparisons suggests tissue-specific differences in steroid hormone regulation. These findings highlight tissue-specific variations in nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes related to lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, reflecting adaptations to each tissue's unique metabolic needs. This study lays a foundation for advancing mitochondrial metabolism research in livestock, with significant implications for human health. Insights could inform dietary or therapeutic strategies for metabolic disorders, such as cardiovascular diseases and metabolic syndrome, while also enhancing livestock productivity.

AB  - The photoperiod has been considered to be a key environmental factor in sheep reproduction, and some studies have shown that the thyroid gland plays an important role in mammalian reproduction, but the molecular mechanism is still unclear. In this study, we used the artificial-light-controlled, ovariectomized, and estradiol-treated model (OVX + E2 model); healthy and consistent 2-3-year-old Sunite multiparous ewes were collected; and thyroids were collected for testing, combined with RNA-seq technology and bioinformatics analysis, to analyze the effects of different photoperiods (long photoperiod treatment for 42 days, LP42; short photoperiod treatment for 42 days, SP42; SP42 transferred to LP42, SPLP42) on the variations in the miRNA profiles of the thyroid gland. A total of 105 miRNAs were differentially expressed in the thyroid gland, most of which were new miRNAs. Through GO and KEGG enrichment analysis, the results showed that the photoperiod response characteristics of Sunite ewes were affected by Olfactory transduction, Wnt signaling pathways, and Apelin signaling pathways. A different illumination time may have a certain influence on the downstream of these pathways, which leads to the change in animal estrus state. In addition, lncRNA-mRNA-miRNA network analysis revealed the target binding sites of identified miRNAs in DE-circRNA and DE-mRNA, such as Novel_369, Novel_370, Novel_461, and so on. The results of this study will provide some new insights into the function of miRNA and the changes in sheep thyroid glands under different photoperiods.

AB  - The Late Miocene Batallones-10 site (Madrid Basin, Spain) contains several authochthonous multitaxic assemblages. A total of 15 large-mammal species are documented, including hipparionine horses (Hipparion sp.), giraffes (Decennatherium rex) and moschids. Three discrete fossiliferous levels have been identified with the aid of artificial intelligence systems. Although there are some statistical differences in the faunal composition of each level, paleontological, geologic and taphonomic data from all three Batallones-10 levels point to similar taphonomic histories. Mortality data, with abundant young individuals and the presence of pregnant females, indicates a catastrophic process of bone accumulation mainly driven by prolonged drought. Relatively high proportions of partially preserved or fully-articulated skeletons, and absence of carnivore feeding marks on bones, suggest that carcasses were undisturbed by predation. Rapid desiccation of soft tissues kept many of the joints intact, resulting in a high proportion of articulated remains. During drought episodes, large mammalian herbivores congregated around a shrinking water-hole, depleting the local vegetation, such that weakened individuals died of starvation and miring rather than dehydration. When rainfall resumed, the lack of vegetation and presence of low-permeability surficial sepiolite-rich marls, resulted in rapid run-off. This buried most of the unweathered, unabraded remains, whilst slightly orienting or completely removing others. After burial, faulting and slickensides produced diagenetic fractures, which favoured the precipitation of manganese oxides on bone surfaces and the diagenetic corrosion of remains, which is more pronounced in the uppermost Level III. This work, which focuses on the taphonomy of a herbivore-dominated site, improves our overall knowledge of the formation of the Cerro de los Batallones palaeontological complex.

AB  - Aims Biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) research has been mostly focused on foliar emissions. In this experiment, the main focus was on rhizosphere BVOC emissions of Scots pine seedlings under changing growth conditions. Methods Soil-growing Scots pines were exposed to increased air (0.5 degrees C) and soil (4.0 degrees C) temperature and N addition (30 kg N ha(- 1) yr(- 1)) for three growing seasons in a field experiment. In addition to these factors, seedlings were exposed to bark herbivory by large pine weevils in two last seasons. Gas-chromatography and mass-spectrometry was used for analyzing the BVOC samples collected from pine rhizosphere. Results Almost 98 % of BVOCs were non-oxygenated monoterpenes (nMTs), 1 % oxygenated monoterpenes (oMTs), 0.5 % sesquiterpenes (SQTs), and 1 % other BVOCs. In both years, there was an interaction of warming, N addition and bark herbivory on rhizosphere BVOC emissions. In 2015, warming and N addition in single exposures decreased oMT emissions, while herbivory in single exposure increased oMT emissions. In 2016, the three-way interaction showed that the effects of warming, N addition and herbivory on BVOCs were mainly detected in single exposures. In 2016, warming decreased nMT, oMT, SQT and other BVOC emissions; N addition decreased oMT and SQT emissions; and herbivory decreased SQT and other BVOC emissions. Conclusions Warming and N addition in single exposures decreased the rhizosphere BVOC emissions. The effect of bark herbivory on BVOC emissions varied between the years from increase to decrease. It seems that under altered growth conditions Scots pine seedlings may reduce carbon investment to rhizosphere BVOCs.

AB  - We have previously shown that adult male mice exposure to low doses of di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) alters neural function and behaviour. Whether such exposure also affects the integrity and function of the bloodbrain barrier (BBB) remained to be explored. The impact of adult exposure to low doses of DEHP alone or in an environmental phthalate mixture on the BBB integrity and surrounding parenchyma was studied in male mice. Two-month-old C57BL/6J males were orally exposed for 6 weeks to DEHP alone (5, and 50 mu g/kg/day) or to DEHP (5 mu g/kg/day) in an environmental phthalate mixture. BBB permeability, glial activation and neuroinflammation were investigated in the hypothalamic medial preoptic area (mPOA) and hippocampus involved, respectively on the reproductive and cognitive functions. Exposure to DEHP alone or in a phthalate mixture increased BBB permeability and affected the endothelial accessory tight junction protein zona occludens-1 and caveolae protein Cav-1 in the mPOA and the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 areas. This was associated with an inflammatory profile including astrocyte activation accompanied by enhanced expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase in the mPOA, and a microglial activation in the mPOA and the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 areas. The protein levels of the inflammatory molecule cyclooxygenase-2 were increased in activated microglial cells of the exposed mPOA. None of the major effects induced by DEHP alone or in a mixture was detected in the hippocampal dendate gyrus. The data highlight that environmental exposure to endocrine disruptors such as phthalates, could represent a risk factor for the cerebrovascular function.

AB  - The Murciano-Granadina (MG) goat breed was introduced in 2016 in northern Italy and it has become the third most widespread breed after Saanen (SA) and Alpine (AL). The study aimed to compare milk yield and composition of MG with SA and AL reared under the same farming system. A total of 11,682 milk test-day records from 1947 goats reared in 7 single- and 7 multi-breeds herds were evaluated. All breeds included out off-season kiddings: MG is a permanent polyestric breed whereas specific strategies are commonly adopted to induce oestrus across the year in SA and AL. The mixed model included breed, parity, stage of lactation, kidding season and first-order interactions as fixed effects; goat, herd-test-date and residual were random effects. All the effects were significant in explaining the variability of the traits (p < 0.01). The MG yielded 0.93 and 0.50 kg/d less milk (p <= 0.05) than SA and AL, respectively, and showed the greatest fat, protein, casein and lactose content and the lowest SCS (p <= 0.05). Oppositely to SA, the fat-to-protein ratio (F/P) of MG was always >= 1.00 regardless of lactation stage, parity and kidding season. In conclusion, MG can yield high-quality milk despite being less productive than SA and AL. Moreover, this recently introduced breed, whose reproductive behaviour is less sensitive to season compared to SA and AL, performs efficiently under the Veneto region farming system and can be a genetic resource of interest for the current Italian context.

AB  - Body metabolism and colonic microbiota collectively controlled lipid metabolism in finishing pigs. Diminishing standardized ileal digestible lysine to net energy ratio in high-wheat diets may regulate lipid metabolism via AMP-activated protein kinase alpha 1/sirtuin 1/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1 alpha pathway and farnesol X receptor/small heterodimer partner pathway, ultimately increased the marbling score of longissimus dorsi muscle. The present study aimed to investigate the impacts of dietary standardized ileal digestible lysine to net energy (SID Lys:NE) ratio on lipid metabolism in pigs fed high-wheat diets. Thirty-six crossbred growing barrows (65.20 +/- 0.38 kg) were blocked into two treatment groups, fed high-wheat diets with either a high SID Lys:NE ratio (HR) or a low SID Lys:NE ratio (LR). Each treatment group consisted of three replicates, with six pigs per pen in each replicate. The diminishing dietary SID Lys:NE ratio exhibited no adverse impacts on the carcass trait (p > 0.05) but increased the marbling score of the longissimus dorsi muscle (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, LR diets tended to increase the serum triglyceride concentration (p < 0.1). LR diets upregulated fatty acid transport protein 4 and acetyl-coA carboxylase alpha expression levels and downregulated the expression level of adipose triglyceride lipase (p < 0.05). LR diets improved energy metabolism via decreasing the expression levels of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) alpha 1, sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1 alpha) (p < 0.05). Additionally, LR diets stimulated hepatic bile acid synthesis via upregulating the expression levels of cytochrome P450 family 7 subfamily A member 1 and cytochrome P450 family 27 subfamily A member 1, and downregulating farnesol X receptor (FXR) and small heterodimer partner (SHP) expression levels (p < 0.05). A lowered SID Lys:NE ratio affected the colonic microbial composition, characterized by increased relative abundances of YRC22, Parabacteroides, Sphaerochaeta, and Bacteroides, alongside a decreased in the proportion of Roseburia, f_Lachnospiraceae_g_Clostridium, Enterococcus, Shuttleworthia, Exiguobacterium, Corynebacterium, Subdoligranulum, Sulfurospirillum, and Marinobacter (p < 0.05). The alterations in microbial composition were accompanied by a decrease in colonic butyrate concentration (p < 0.1). The metabolomic analysis revealed that LR diets affected primary bile acid synthesis and AMPK signaling pathway (p < 0.05). And the mantel analysis indicated that Parabacteroides, Sphaerochaeta, f_Lachnospiraceae_g_Clostridium, Shuttleworthia, and Marinobacter contributed to the alterations in body metabolism. A reduced dietary SID Lys:NE ratio improves energy metabolism, stimulates lipogenesis, and inhibits lipolysis in finishing pigs by regulating the AMPK alpha/SIRT1/PGC-1 alpha pathway and the FXR/SHP pathway. Parabacteroides and Sphaerochaeta benefited bile acids synthesis, whereas f_Lachnospiraceae_g_Clostridium, Shuttleworthia, and Marinobacter may contribute to the activation of the AMPK signaling pathway. Overall, body metabolism and colonic microbiota collectively controlled the lipid metabolism in finishing pigs.

AB  - The mirid bug (Riptortus pedestris), a major soybean pest, migrates into soybean fields during the pod filling stage and causes staygreen syndrome, which leads to substantial yield losses. The mechanism by which R. pedestris elicits soybean (Glycine max) defenses and counter-defenses remains largely unexplored. In this study, we characterized a protein family from R. pedestris, designated R. pedestris HAMP 1 (RPH1), and its putative paralogs (RPH1L1, 2, 3, 4, and 5), whose members exhibit dual roles in triggering and inhibiting plant immunity. RPH1 and RPH1L1 function as herbivore-associated molecular patterns (HAMPs), activating pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) in tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) and G. max. Furthermore, RPH1 stimulates jasmonic acid and ethylene biosynthesis in G. max, thereby enhancing its resistance to R. pedestris feeding. Additionally, RPH1 homologs are universally conserved across various herbivorous species, with many homologs also acting as HAMPs that trigger plant immunity. Interestingly, the remaining RPH1 putative paralogs (RPH1L2-5) serve as effectors that counteract RPH1-induced PTI, likely by disrupting the extracellular perception of RPH1. This research uncovers a HAMP whose homologs are conserved in both chewing and piercing-sucking insects. Moreover, it unveils an extracellular evasion mechanism utilized by herbivores to circumvent plant immunity using functionally differentiated paralogs.
   Plant recognition of two conserved proteins from Riptortus pedestris activates pattern-triggered immunity, but the herbivore has evolved putative paralogs to evade the initial immune response.

AB  - We investigated the effects of Cissus verticillata leaf extract (CVE) on a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and memory deficits. Male mice (5 weeks of age) were fed vehicle (distilled water), or 30, 100, or 300 mg/kg of CVE once a day for 8 weeks with an HFD. Treatment with CVE resulted in lower body weight and glucose levels in a concentration- and feeding time-dependent manner. LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels were significantly lower in the CVE-treated HFD group than in the vehicle-treated HFD group. In contrast, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels did not show any significant changes. Lipid droplets and ballooning were reduced depending on the concentration of CVE treatment compared to the HFD group. Treatment with CVE ameliorated the increase in glucagon and immunoreactivities in the pancreas, and novel object recognition memory was improved by 300 mg/kg CVE treatment compared to the HFD group. More proliferating cells and differentiated neuroblasts were higher in mice treated with CVE than in vehicle-treated HFD-fed mice. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels were significantly decreased in the HFD group, which was facilitated by treatment with 300 mg/kg CVE in hippocampal homogenates. These results suggest that CVE ameliorates HFD-induced obesity and memory deficits in mice, associated with increased BDNF levels in the hippocampus.

AB  - The global concern regarding the ubiquitous presence of plastics in the environment has led to intensified research on the impact of these materials on wildlife. In the Australian context, marsupials represent a unique and diverse group of mammals, yet little is known about their exposures to plastics. This study aimed to assess the contamination levels of seven common plastics (i.e., polystyrene (PS), polycarbonate (PC), poly-(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), polypropylene (PP), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyethylene (PE), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC)) in both the diet and faeces of kangaroos, wallabies and koalas sampled from a sanctuary in Northeastern Australia. Quantitative analysis was performed by pressurized liquid extraction followed by double-shot microfurnace pyrolysis coupled to gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Interestingly, the analysis of the food and faeces samples revealed the absence of detectable plastic particles; with this preliminary finding suggesting a relatively limited exposure of captive Australian marsupials to plastics. This study contributes valuable insights into the current state of plastic contamination in Australian marsupials, shedding light on the limited exposures and potential risks, and highlighting the need for continued monitoring and conservation efforts. The results underscore the importance of proactive measures to mitigate plastic pollution and protect vulnerable wildlife populations in Australia's unique ecosystems.

AB  - BackgroundStroke is the major cause of adult neurocognitive disorders (NCDs), and presents a significant burden on both of the families and society. To improve the cerebral injury, we generated a blood-brain barrier penetrating peptide TAT-LBD-Ngn2, in which Ngn2 (Neurogenin2) is a classical preneural gene that enhances neurogenesis, and neural precursor cells survival and differentiation. We previously demonstrated that it has a short-term protective effect against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. However, it is uncertain if TAT-LBD-Ngn2 could promote neurogenesis to exhibit long-term therapeutic impact. Methods and resultsIn present study, TAT-LBD-Ngn2 was administered for 14 or 28 days following bilateral common carotid arteries occlusion (BCCAO). After confirming that TAT-LBD-Ngn2 could cross the brain blood barrier and aggregate in the hippocampus, we conducted open field test, Morris water maze and contextual fear conditioning to examine the long-term effect of TAT-LBD-Ngn2 on cognition. We discovered that TAT-LBD-Ngn2 significantly improved the spatial and contextual learning and memory on both days 14 and 28 after BCCAO, while TAT-LBD-Ngn2 exhibited anxiolytic effect only on day 14, but had no effect on locomotion. Using western blot and immunofluorescence, TAT-LBD-Ngn2 was also shown to promote neurogenesis, as evidenced by increased BrdU(+) and DCX+ neurons in dentate gyrus. Meanwhile, TAT-LBD-Ngn2 elevated the expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor rather than nerve growth factor compared to the control group. ConclusionsOur findings revealed that TAT-LBD-Ngn2 could dramatically promote learning and memory in long term by facilitating neurogenesis in the hippocampus after global cerebral ischemia, indicating that TAT-LBD-Ngn2 may be an appealing candidate for treating poststroke NCD.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the structural, productive, and qualitative characteristics of forage, as well as the performance of sheep grazing on Urochloa pastures. Santa In & ecirc;s sheep were used in a completely randomized design, with six experimental units per treatment. Treatments comprised four Urochloa cultivars (Marandu, Paiagu & aacute;s, Xara & eacute;s, and Ipypor & atilde;) managed under intermittent stocking. Grazing and rest periods did not differ among cultivars, averaging 9.9 and 43.5 days, respectively. Pre-grazing forage mass was higher in the Ipypor & atilde; cultivar than the others, which did not differ from one another (4670.3 kg DM/ha). The leaf blade-to-stem ratio at pre-grazing was lowest in Paiagu & aacute;s (1.09) and highest in Xara & eacute;s (1.61). Mineral matter, acid detergent fiber, and crude protein contents in leaves did not differ among cultivars. The longest grazing time was observed in Paiagu & aacute;s (370.8 min/day). Cultivar did not affect idling time (592.1 min/day), rumination time (466.9 min/day), or bite rate (19.95 bites/min). Average daily gain did not differ among cultivars, with an overall mean of 74.5 g/day. The stocking rate was higher in Ipypor & atilde; compared to the other cultivars (12.75 AU 30 kg/ha), resulting in greater animal gain per unit area (1319.5 g/ha). The Ipypor & atilde; cultivar was more productive and supported a higher carrying capacity. Nonetheless, all four cultivars yielded satisfactory results and are recommended for grazing-based sheep production systems.

AB  - Fluoride is widely present in the environment. Excessive fluoride exposure leads to fluorosis, which has become a global public health problem and will cause damage to various organs and tissues. Only a few studies focus on serum metabolomics, and there is still a lack of systematic metabolomics associated with fluorosis within the main organs. Therefore, in the current study, a non-targeted metabolomics method using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to research the effects of fluoride exposure on metabolites in different organs, to uncover potential biomarkers and study whether the affected metabolic pathways are related to the mechanism of fluorosis. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into two groups: a control group and a fluoride exposure group. GC-MS technology was used to identify metabolites. Multivariate statistical analysis identified 16, 24, 20, 20, 24, 13, 7, and 13 differential metabolites in the serum, liver, kidney, heart, hippocampus, cortex, kidney fat, and brown fat, respectively, in the two groups of rats. Fifteen metabolic pathways were affected, involving toxic mechanisms such as oxidative stress, mitochondrial damage, inflammation, and fatty acid, amino acid and energy metabolism disorders. This study provides a new perspective on the understanding of the mechanism of toxicity associated with sodium fluoride, contributing to the prevention and treatment of fluorosis.

AB  - Litter size and ovulation rate are important reproduction traits in sheep and have important impacts on the profitability of farm animals. To investigate the genetic architecture of litter size, we report the first meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using 522 ewes and 564,377 SNPs from six sheep breeds. We identified 29 significant associations for litter size which 27 of which have not been reported in individual GWAS for each population. However, we could confirm the role of BMPR1B in prolificacy. Our gene set analysis discovered biological pathways related to cell signaling, communication, and adhesion. Functional clustering and enrichment using protein databases identified epidermal growth factor-like domain affecting litter size. Through analyzing protein-protein interaction data, we could identify hub genes like CASK, PLCB4, RPTOR, GRIA2, and PLCB1 that were enriched in most of the significant pathways. These genes have a role in cell proliferation, cell adhesion, cell growth and survival, and autophagy. Notably, identified SNPs were scattered on several different chromosomes implying different genetic mechanisms underlying variation of prolificacy in each breed. Given the different layers that make up the follicles and the need for communication and transfer of hormones and nutrients through these layers to the oocyte, the significance of pathways related to cell signaling and communication seems logical. Our results provide genetic insights into the litter size variation in different sheep breeds.(c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - BackgroundThe Murrah buffalo, pivotal in Asian agriculture, faces challenges in maximizing milk production despite significant breeding efforts. Recognizing its economic importance, this study investigates mtDNA D-loop variations in Murrah buffalo as potential indicators of milk production variability, addressing challenges in maximizing yield despite significant breeding efforts.Methods and resultsAnalyzing mtDNA D-loop sequences from 50 buffaloes, we categorized them into Low (Group 1), Medium (Group 2), and High ECM (Group 3) groups based on milk yields, fat and protein percentage of a 30-day period data. Somatic cell mtDNA D-loop analysis revealed distinct genetic variations, with significant differences among ECM groups. Group 2 showed higher SNP prevalence, group 3 had more insertions/deletions, and Group 1 exhibited the highest transition frequency. Notably, a consistent "C" deletion at the 714th position occurred in Groups 1 and 3, prevalent in 68% of Group 2. A G-A variation at the 93rd position was specific to the medium ECM group. Negative Tajima D values indicated unique variations in each group, with Group 1 having the highest number, and a specific SNP linked to Group 2 was identified. These SNPs in the D-loop region could impact mtDNA replication, influencing mitochondrial content among animals. Our results provide valuable insights into the role of mtDNA D-loop polymorphisms in milk production traits in Murrah buffalo.ConclusionsOur research highlights the potential for valuable markers of cellular energy efficiency in Murrah buffalo. Exploring diverse cytoplasmic backgrounds opens avenues for mtDNA-based selection strategies, enhancing milk production and optimizing genetic traits for the dairy industry.

AB  - Acetaminophen (paracetamol) is one of the most popular analgesics for the management of fever and pain but few reports have investigated its antidepressant-like effect. Moreover, the role of the opioidergic pathway has been indicated in depression pathophysiology. This study aimed to examine the involvement of the opioid receptors in the antidepressant-like effect of acetaminophen after acute and sub-chronic administration using mice forced swimming test (FST). Our finding showed that administration of acetaminophen (50 and 100 mg/kg, i.p.) 30 min before the FST produced an antidepressant effect which was reduced by naloxone (1 mg/kg, i.p., a nonselective opioid receptor antagonist). Moreover, we observed that acetaminophen in higher doses (200 and 400 mg/kg) was ineffective. Also, the response of the non-effective dose of acetaminophen (25 mg/kg) was potentiated by the non-effective dose of morphine (0.1 mg/kg) in the FST that was antagonized by naloxone. Also, in contrast to morphine (10 mg/kg), acetaminophen (100 mg/kg, i.p.) induced neither tolerance to the antiimmobility behavior nor withdrawal syndrome after repeated administration. In addition, RT-PCR showed that hippocampal mu- and kappa-opioid receptor mRNA expression increased in mice after repeated administration of acetaminophen; however, morphine therapy for 6 days did not affect kappa-opioid receptor expression. Our findings demonstrated that acetaminophen in lower doses but not high doses revealed an antidepressant-like activity without inducing tolerance and withdrawal syndromes. Moreover, the observed effect of acetaminophen may be via altering the opioid system, particularly hippocampal mu- and kappa-receptors.

AB  - Human-wildlife conflicts (HWC) predominate in areas proximal to wildlife rich protected zones. Whereas herbivore driven HWC is easy to detect, the stealth, nocturnal and predacious nature of carnivores leads to human injury and fatality, livestock depredation and loss of livelihoods in communities proximal to Sengwa Wildlife Research Area (SWRA) in northwest Zimbabwe. This study aimed to: (1) determine the nature of human-hyaena conflicts (HHCs), (2) explore the drivers of HHCs and (3) investigate the spatial and temporal movement patterns of hyaenas in HHC hotspots in areas proximal to SWRA. The results indicated that prevalent HHC types include livestock depredation, property damage, harassment, nuisance and disruption of human movements around SWRA. Locals indicated removal of park fences, human settlement on wildlife migration corridors, increases in hyaena populations, easy stray livestock targets, increased poaching and removal of natural wildlife death carcasses by illegal hunters as key drivers of HHC. Hyaenas have a predetermined non-seasonal movement pattern following traditional wildlife migration corridors through SWRA into proximal communities. Human-hyaena conflict abatement strategies should be underpinned by indigenous local knowledge of hyaena movement and hunting patterns. Integrating citizen science data and remote sensing techniques aids to track and understand movement and hunting patterns of hyaenas inside and outside of protected areas.

AB  - Introduction: Lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 1 (LPCAT1) is important for saturated phosphatidylcholine (Sat-PC) production in the lung. Sat-PC is a critical component of pulmonary surfactant, which maintains low alveolar surface tension, facilitating respiration. Previous studies have reported an association between maternal and fetal LPCAT1 levels and neonatal lung function. Using a sheep model of pregnancy, we investigated a potential correlation between glucocorticoid-induced lung maturation and LPCAT1 mRNA and/or protein levels in the fetal lung, the placenta, the fetal plasma, and the maternal plasma. Methods: Eighty seven single pregnant ewes received maternal intramuscular injections of betamethasone. A subgroup of five animals had both maternal and fetal catheters installed to allow for sequential sampling from both plasma compartments. Lambs were surgically delivered under terminal anaesthesia between 2 and 8 days after initial ANS treatment, at a gestational age of 121-123 days. Lambs were ventilated for 30 min to determine functional lung maturation before being euthanized for necropsy and sample collection. Fetal lung, placenta, and fetal and maternal plasma samples were used to analyse LPCAT1 gene expression and protein levels. Results: The expression of LPCAT1 mRNA in the fetal lung was significantly corelated to Sat-PC levels at 8 days (R2 = 0.23, p < 0.001) and lung maturation status overall (gas exchange efficiency as determined by measurements of lamb PaCO2 during ventilation, R2 = 0.20, p < 0.001). Similarly, fetal lung LPCAT1 mRNA was also significantly correlated with the individual durability of ANS effects on fetal lung maturation (R2 = 0.20, p < 0.001). Although ANS therapy altered LPCAT1 mRNA expression in the placenta, observed changes were independent of fetal lung maturation outcomes. Neither maternal nor fetal plasma LPCAT1 levels were changed by ANS therapy over the period, including in analysis of serial maternal and fetal samples from chronically catheterised animals. Discussion: LPCAT1 expression in the fetal lung was associated with the durability of glucocorticoid effects on fetal lung maturation. However, LPCAT1 expression in the placenta, the fetal plasma, and the maternal plasma was neither associated with, nor predictive of fetal lung maturation after glucocorticoid treatment in a sheep model of pregnancy.

AB  - Inbreeding can lead to the accumulation of homozygous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genome, which can significantly affect gene expression and phenotype. In this study, we examined the impact of homozygous SNPs resulting from inbreeding on alternative polyadenylation (APA) site selection and the underlying genetic mechanisms using inbred Luchuan pigs. Genome resequencing revealed that inbreeding results in a high accumulation of homozygous SNPs within the pig genome. 3 ' mRNA-seq on leg muscle, submandibular lymph node, and liver tissues was performed to identify differences in APA events between inbred and outbred Luchuan pigs. We revealed different tissue-specific APA usage caused by inbreeding, which were associated with different biological processes. Furthermore, we explored the role of polyadenylation signal (PAS) SNPs in APA regulation under inbreeding and identified key genes such as PUM1, SCARF1, RIPOR2, C1D, and LRRK2 that are involved in biological processes regulation. This study provides resources and sheds light on the impact of genomic homozygosity on APA regulation, offering insights into genetic characteristics and biological processes associated with inbreeding.

AB  - The black-footed cat, a small felid endemic to southern Africa, is particularly vulnerable to killing by larger carnivores while also being prone to developing renal diseases. Here, we investigated the effect of predator control on black-footed cat populations by comparing adult annual survival between two sites, a nature reserve with little predator management and a sheep and game farm where jackals and caracals were lethally controlled. Although relatively low, survival rates were similar for both sites, suggesting that intraguild killing did not have an additive effect on black-footed cat mortality. Disease was however prevalent and weakened individuals might have a reduced ability to evade predators.

AB  - Leaves, the main by-product of lingonberry harvesting, can be effectively used as a functional feed additive due to their health-promoting properties. This study evaluated the effects of lingonberry leaf (LL) supplementation on rumen fermentation, protozoal populations, and gastrointestinal morphology in sheep. Eight one-year-old Polish Mountain Sheep ewes (mean body weight: 33 kg) were allocated to a control (basal diet; forage-to-concentrate ratio 60:40) or an experimental group (basal diet + 9.30 g/kg DM dried LLs) in a completely randomised design (n = 4 per group) over 34 days. Both diets were formulated to be isoenergetic and isonitrogenous. LL additive significantly reduced Isotrichidae protozoal counts (p < 0.001) and ruminal pectinolytic activity (p = 0.043), without altering short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) or methane concentrations (p > 0.1). Histological analyses showed increased ruminal papilla width and surface area (p < 0.001) and decreased duodenal villus height and muscular layer thickness (p < 0.01). Inflammatory lesions (reddish foci) were identified in the liver in both groups. These findings demonstrate that LL supplementation affected specific protozoal population, fibrolytic activity, and gastrointestinal morphology. Further study on a larger number of animals is recommended to validate the effects and assess the safety and efficacy of LLs as a dietary additive in ruminant nutrition.

AB  - During in vitro maturation (IVM) cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) are exposed to conditions that can trigger oxidative stress, thus, reducing oocyte maturation and viability. Aiming to mitigate these detrimental conditions, the effects of IVM medium supplementation with anethole have been tested. Anethole, also known as trans-anethole (1-methoxy-4 [1-propenyl]-benzene), is a naturally occurring phenylpropanoid with various pharmacological properties, including antioxidant effects. However, no study has examined anethole effect on goat COCs during IVM. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of different anethole concentrations on oocyte maturation, oxidative stress, and in vitro development of caprine embryos after parthenogenetic activation. Goat COCs were selected and randomly distributed into the following treatments: TCM-199(+) medium (control), or TCM-199(+) medium supplemented with 30 mu g/mL (AN30); 300 mu g/mL (AN300) or 2000 mu g/mL (AN2000) of anethole. After IVM, part of the COCs was chosen for oocyte viability and chromatin configuration, intracellular reactive oxygen species levels, and mitochondrial membrane potential assessment. Another part of COCs was parthenogenetically activated, and presumptive zygotes were cultured for 7 days. Results demonstrated that anethole at 30 mu g/mL increased oocyte maturation and cleavage rates when compared to the other treatments (P < 0.05), as well as oocyte viability and in vitro embryo production when compared to the control treatment (P < 0.05). Additionally, treatment with anethole at 2000 mu g/mL decreased oocyte nuclear maturation and cleavage rates when compared to other treatments (P < 0.05) and embryo production if compared to control and AN30 treatments (P < 0.05). Moreover, anethole at 2000 mu g/mL increased mitochondrial membrane potential when compared to the other treatments (P < 0.05). In conclusion, anethole exerts a concentration-dependent effect during goat COCs IVM. For a more desirable outcome of oocyte viability and maturation, and in vitro embryo production, the use of anethole at 30 mu g/mL is recommended.

AB  - Muscle development is a complex biological process involving an intricate network of multiple factor interactions. Through the analysis of transcriptome data and molecular biology confirmation, this study aims to reveal the molecular mechanism underlying sheep embryonic skeletal muscle development. The RNA sequencing of embryos was conducted, and microRNA (miRNA)-mediated competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks were constructed. qRT-PCR, siRNA knockdown, CCK-8 assay, scratch assay, and dual luciferase assay were used to carry out gene function identification. Through the analysis of the ceRNA networks, three miRNAs (miR-493-3p, miR-3959-3p, and miR-410-5p) and three genes (TEAD1, ZBTB34, and POGLUT1) were identified. The qRT-PCR of the DE-miRNAs and genes in the muscle tissues of sheep showed that the expression levels of the TEAD1 gene and miR-410-5p were correlated with the growth rate. The knockdown of the TEAD1 gene by siRNA could significantly inhibit the proliferation of sheep primary embryonic myoblasts, and the expression levels of SLC1A5, FoxO3, MyoD, and Pax7 were significantly downregulated. The targeting relationship between miR-410-5p and the TEAD1 gene was validated by a dual luciferase assay, and miR-410-5p can significantly downregulate the expression of TEAD1 in sheep primary embryonic myoblasts. We proved the regulatory relationship between miR-410-5p and the TEAD1 gene, which was related to the proliferation of sheep embryonic myoblasts. The results provide a reference and molecular basis for understanding the molecular mechanism of embryonic muscle development.

AB  - Simple Summary In intensive swine production systems, managing the regrouping of pigs is a common practice, but it often leads to aggressive behaviors, which can harm the welfare of the animals. This study explores an approach that involves composing and producing music based on acoustic parameters established by QUIRON Pathobiology research group. The aim is to reduce aggressive behaviors in pigs, thereby enhancing pig welfare during regrouping. Our findings indicate that this cost-effective and easy-to-implement strategy reduces aggressive behaviors in piglets during regrouping. This research offers valuable insights for producers, providing them with a practical way to enhance pig behavior and welfare while also contributing to the broader understanding of animal well-being in swine production systems.Abstract In intensive swine production systems,, the practice of regrouping unfamiliar pigs is common, often leading to aggressive behavior. Although the effect of different musical genres composed for humans has been evaluated in pigs to mitigate aggression, there have been few attempts to create music specifically for pigs. Here, we assess whether sensory stimulation through music, created by adapting the acoustic parameters in the sound mix, induces changes in the aggressive behaviors of pigs during regrouping. Six litters of 10-week-old piglets were randomly selected and assigned to different treatments. The control group (Group A) received no intervention, while Group B was exposed to music for two continuous hours in the morning and afternoon from the time of regrouping. Group C received musical stimulation for one continuous hour in the morning following regrouping. A significant reduction in the frequency and duration of aggressive behaviors was observed in the groups that received musical stimulation during regrouping. Additionally, social, and individual play behaviors showed a decrease in the musical stimulation groups. These findings provide evidence for the effectiveness of created music as a strategy in reducing aggressive behavior during pig regrouping, which can enhance the welfare of pigs and offer a practical solution for pig producers to minimize aggression and its associated negative impacts.

AB  - The lac insect (Kerria lacca Kerr) is a valuable source of natural lac resin, playing a significant role in supporting the livelihoods of farmers who rely on forest resources. Butea monosperma Lam. (Taub.), commonly known as Palas, serves as a primary host plant for rangeeni strain of Indian lac insect cultivation. As a phloem sap feeder, the lac insect imposes stress on the host plant, initiating various biochemical and physiological responses to adapt to this stress. This study aimed to investigate the key biochemical changes in the Palas tree during different stages of the summer crop of rangeeni strain of lac insect life cycle. The results showed that the lowest levels of total sugar, soluble protein, and free phenol occurred after the mating stage (post-fertilization) of the lac insect. The total chlorophyll and carotenoid content was highest at maturation stage as compared to the other stages. This suggests that the post-mating period is a critical phase for lac insect development, characterized by a sharp demand for phloem sap from the lac insect as well as host plant.

AB  - Objectives: This study investigated the effects of environmental enrichment (EE) on the behavior and histological alterations of rats with barrel cortex damage. Methods: Forty-eight adult male rats were divided into Control (Ctrl), Lesion, Lesion+EE.S (Lesion+Standard Enriched Environment, and Lesion+EE.T (Lesion+Tactile Enriched Environment) groups. The animals were first anesthetized, and then, a cold lesion model was performed on the parietal cortex. After surgery, the rats were exposed to a standard enriched environment or enriched environment with tactile for 30 days. Their cognitive behaviors were assessed using an open field, novel texture discrimination, and Morris water maze (MWM) tests. In addition, a histological investigation was conducted to determine the degree of degeneration of hippocampal and somatosensory cortex neurons. Results: The results demonstrated that rats with barrel cortex lesions revealed impairments in novel texture discrimination and MWM tests (P<0.001). Moreover, lesions increased neuronal degeneration in rats' barrel cortex and hippocampus (P< 0.001). Environmental enrichment improved behavioral deficits and decreased neuronal degeneration in the barrel cortex and hippocampus of rats with barrel cortex lesions (P<0.05). Conclusion: The current study suggests that barrel cortex lesions create cognitive and behavioral deficits and neural degeneration in the barrel cortex and hippocampus; however, environmental enrichment could reverse these impairments.

AB  - The presented paper deals with the testing of a possibility to reduce emissions of undesirable greenhouse gases (CH4, CO2; NOx) and their mixture (biogas) during the storage of digestate using applications of secondary plant metabolites (tannins). The experiment was conducted in laboratory conditions in which the digestate was placed in fermentation chambers. Prior to the fermentation process, preparations were applied to the digestate, which contained tannins: Tanenol Antibotrytis (TA), Tanenol Clar (TC) and Tanenol Rouge (TR) in three concentrations (0.5, 1.0 and 2.0% w/w). The application of these preparations demonstrably affected the production of biogas and the contents of CH4, CO2 and N therein. The application of TR preparation in the concentration of 1.0% and 2.0% significantly reduced the production of biogas as compared with all variants. The preparation further inhibited the process of CH4 development. In contrast, the other preparations with the content of different kinds of TA and TC increased the production of biogas (on average by 15%), CH4 (on average by 7%) and CO2 (on average by 12%) as compared with the control variant and TR variant. These two variants reduced the con-centration of N in biogas on average by 38%. Thus, the tested Tanenol tannin preparations can be used in different concentrations either to control emissions of greenhouse gases during the storage of digestate or, in case of increased production of CO2 for its reuse in order to increase methane yields in the process of anaerobic fermentation.

AB  - Loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.), shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata Mill.), and eastern white pine (Pinus strobus L.) seedlings were multi-cropped with standard and large-diameter white oak (Quercus alba L.) seedlings to test for neutral or positive effects of multi-cropping. The study was established in 2014 in three complete blocks within recent clearcuts in eastern Tennessee, USA. Each block consisted of six multi-cropped treatments and four monocultures randomly assigned to ten 14.63 ? 21.95 m plots. Within each block, monocultures of white oak and each pine species were planted in four control plots. Multi-cropped treatments included loblolly pine planted with white oak at a 0.31 m spacing, loblolly pine planted with white oak in alternating rows at a 1.74 m spacing, shortleaf pine planted with white oak at a 0.31 m spacing, shortleaf pine planted with white oak at a 1.74 m spacing, eastern white pine planted with white oak at a 0.31 m spacing, and eastern white pine planted with white oak at a 1.74 m spacing. Each plot with white oak received 20 standard (-0.127 cm in basal diameter) and 20 large-diameter (-0.632 cm in basal diameter) white oak seedlings that were randomly assigned to planting locations. Initial height, basal diameter, and early survival were recorded for each seedling just after planting. Height growth, basal diameter growth, survival, herbivory, and insect damage were recorded in early December 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019. In 2019, percent survival among treatments did not differ significantly for white oak (p = 0.152), loblolly pine (p = 0.396), shortleaf pine (p = 0.246), or eastern white pine (p = 0.065). In addition, mean height growth and mean basal diameter growth did not differ significantly among treatments for white oak (p = 0.698 and 0.437, respectively), loblolly pine (p = 0.630 and 0.762, respectively), shortleaf pine (p = 0.324 and 0.251, respectively), or eastern white pine (p = 0.623 and 0.823, respectively). Survival was greater for large-diameter white oak seedlings than standard seedlings (p < 0.001). Mean height and mean basal diameter growth in large-diameter white oak seedlings were significantly greater than in standard seedlings ((p < 0.001) and (p < 0.001), respectively). Although these plantings are in the early stages of development, the lack of significant differences in seedling performance among treatments suggests species compatibility and no net negative impact of multi-cropping white oak with the three pine species.

AB  - Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze, as an economical woody plant, had been cultivated for tea production for a long history. However, the seeds of tea tree were usually discarded after harvest because of low quality and yield of seed oil. In the present study, we found a new kind of tea tree 'Jincha1' cultivar had higher quality and yield of seed oil compared to 'Wuniuzao' cultivar which was a traditional cultivar in agricultural production. To explore the differential metabolic process between two cultivars, comparative physiological and metabolomics analyses of the tea leaf and fruit were conducted between 'Jincha1' and 'Wuniuzao'. We found the tea leaves and seed oil yield of 'Jincha1' were both higher than those of 'Wuniuzao'. Totally, 179 metabolites were identified in tea fruits, among them, 123 metabolites were identified as significantly differential metabolites between'Jincha1' and 'Wuniuzao'. In addition, the levels of indole 3-acetic acid (IAA) and fatty acids in 'Jincha1' fruit were higher than those in 'Wuniuzao'. These results indicate that as an important auxin, IAA may regulate the growth of tea fruit and fatty acid biosynthesis in 'Jincha1' might be more active than 'Wuniuzao'. The results have enhanced understanding of metabolic process, especially for fatty acid biosynthesis in 'Jincha1' fruit, which would be meaningful for improve tea tree breeding.

AB  - Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) commonly occurs in pigs and poses a significant challenge to the swine industry. This study investigated the effect of fermented milk on growth performance and intestinal health in IUGR-affected piglets. A total of 24 28-day-old weaned piglets with IUGR were randomly assigned to a corn-soybean basal diet (control) or a basal diet mixed with fermented milk (3:1 w/v, treatment). The results showed that fermented milk increased the average daily gain and decreased the feed-to-gain ratio (p < 0.05). Fermented milk increased the villus height in the duodenum and decreased the jejunal crypt depth (p < 0.05). Pigs in the treatment showed higher activities of lipase, alpha-amylase, and sucrase in the duodenum, along with an elevation in jejunal sucrase activity (p < 0.05). The ileal glutathione concentration was increased by the treatment (p < 0.05). Moreover, fermented milk upregulated the protein expression of occludin and claudin-3 while decreasing the gene expression of interleukin 1 beta, interleukin 6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha lpha in the jejunum (p < 0.05). Collectively, these results indicate that dietary supplementation with fermented milk significantly improved growth performance through the enhancement of intestinal functions in IUGR piglets, highlighting the potential of fermented milk as a nutritional strategy to improve postnatal growth in IUGR piglets.

AB  - In the pigging of long-distance gas-liquid pipelines, the sealing disks and the inner wall of the pipeline will inevitably wear out. This may cause the diameter of the pig seal disks to be smaller than the inner diameter of the pipe, resulting in a clearance. The presence of clearance has a significant influence on the liquid flow pattern. Aiming to explore liquid flow characteristics in the pipeline, the paper conducted a series of numeric simulations based on the CFD method to investigate the process. The calculated model and experimental data verified the accuracy of simulations. Our results show that both the front and back of the pig are gas-liquid two-phase flow, and the higher the clearance, the lower the volume fraction of the liquid slug at the front of the pig. The increase in the speed of the pig will increase the length of the liquid slug segment and the front-end speed of the liquid slug. And as the inlet gas velocity gradually increases, the liquid at the front of the pig gradually scatters and becomes chaotic. The time for the liquid to reach the terminal outlet is only related to the pig speed. When increasing the clearance, the residual liquid in the pipeline increases, and the pigging effect worsens. Our results can provide some reference in pigging of gas-liquid pipelines.

AB  - Previous evidence indicates a link between early life stress (ELS) in humans and a predisposition to psychopathologies that are characterized in part by maladaptive habitual behaviors. Stress and anxiety influence the relative use of mammalian memory systems implicated in these disorders. Specifically, cognitive memory functions of the hippocampus are typically impaired by stress/anxiety, whereas habit memory functions of the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) are enhanced. A stress/anxiety bias toward habit memory has largely been demonstrated in adult rodents and humans, and the effects of ELS on the later use of DLS-dependent habit memory in adult rodents have not been extensively examined. The present study addressed this question by chronically elevating corticosterone (CORT) during adolescence, and investigated the effects of this treatment on DLS-dependent habit learning in adulthood. In experiment 1, adolescent rats received a single daily injection of either CORT (5 mg/kg) or vehicle (cVEH) over 5 days and then matured undisturbed before training as adults in a DLS-dependent water plus-maze task. Rats administered CORT injections during adolescence displayed a strong trend toward enhanced learning during adulthood relative to vehicle-treated rats. Adolescent CORT administration also increased anxiety-like behavior in adulthood in an elevated plus-maze. In experiment 2, adolescent CORT administration enhanced task acquisition in adulthood, and this effect was blocked by concurrent administration of the glucocorticoid antagonist mifepristone (30 mg/kg). Taken together, these findings suggest that chronic elevation of glucocorticoids during adolescence are sufficient to facilitate habit learning in adulthood, and indicate that glucocorticoid function may be a potential underlying mechanism by which ELS influences subsequent habitual behaviors.

AB  - Porous carbon materials represent an ideal cathode material system for supercapacitors. To enable their scalable production, it is imperative to develop green synthesis methodologies as sustainable alternatives to conventional corrosive KOH activation processes. However, a significant challenge persists with most mild activating agents, which exhibit insufficient activation efficiency. This limitation detrimentally impacts the resulting materials, manifesting as reduced specific surface areas and compromised capacitive performance. Herein, we propose a chemical exfoliation method using KHCO3 as a mild activating agent and tea saponin from the waste of camellia oleifera seeds after oil extraction as an inexpensive precursor. Urea assists in increasing the decomposition temperature of KHCO3 and initiates an additional second step of gas stripping, transforming the material morphology from chunks to porous carbon sheets. This increases the specific surface area from 210 m2 g-1 to 1727 m2 g-1 and boosts the total pore volume from 0.182 cm3 g-1 to 1.3342 cm3 g-1. Additionally, the proper incorporation of N-and O-containing materials enhances the mass and charge transfer during the reaction process. The sample TSUK-700 exhibits higher specific capacitance and energy density, maintaining high stability (83 %) even after 10,000 cycles. Additionally, the TSUK-700 electrode shows a high electrosorption capacity for Cu+, reaching up to 404 mg g-1. Therefore, this study provides a feasible idea for the resource utilization of biomass waste and the application of low-cost preparation of high-performance carbon materials.

AB  - The effect of dietary inorganic and organic chromium (Cr) on body morphometry, carcass traits, and nutrient composition, including different minerals and fatty acids in meat and internal organs of Black Bengal goats, was studied. Thirty weaned Black Bengal kids of 3-5 months (5.40 & PLUSMN; 0.34 kg body weight) were assigned randomly into five groups and fed additional Cr for 150 days. The experimental diets comprised a basal diet supplemented with Cr at the rate of 0 (control; without Cr supplementation), 1.0 and 1.5 mg/kg of inorganic Cr (Cr(III)-chloride), and 1.0 and 1.5 mg/kg of organic Cr (Cr-yeast). The body morphometry such as body length, heart girth, paunch girth, loin width, leg circumference, and the carcass traits, namely, slaughter body weight, dressing percentage, hind quarter and forequarter weight, and rib eye area of goats, were not significantly (P < 0.05) changed due to inorganic and organic Cr supplementation. However, organic Cr supplementation (1.0 and 1.5 mg/kg) resulted in a reduction of breast and back fat thickness (P < 0.05) compared with the control group. The weights of internal organs including liver, lungs, spleen, kidney, testes, and heart and their weights as a percentage of slaughter weight were similar (P > 0.05) among different experimental groups. Dry matter, ether extract, and total ash concentrations of muscle and internal organs of Cr-supplemented groups were not affected (P > 0.05) by Cr supplementation. However, crude protein contents in the liver, muscle, kidney, and lungs were greater (P < 0.05) in the organic Cr groups than in the control and inorganic Cr groups. In meat (longissimus dorsi muscle), total saturated fatty acid concentration was lower (P < 0.05; 59.4% versus 55.7%) and the unsaturated fatty acid concentration was greater (P < 0.05; 40.6% versus 44.3%) including palmitoleic acid, heptadecenoic acid, elaidic acid, and arachidonic acid in the organic or inorganic Cr-supplemented groups than in the basal diet group. In conclusion, dietary supplementation of organic Cr in Black Bengal goats has no influence on the carcass traits, but may improve the meat quality with greater protein content, lean, and healthier fatty acids for human consumption.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent form of dementia, is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by different pathological symptomatology, including disrupted circadian rhythm. The regulation of circadian rhythm depends on the light information that is projected from the retina to the suprachiasmatic nucleus in the hypothalamus. Studies of AD patients and AD transgenic mice have revealed AD retinal pathology, including amyloid-beta (A beta) accumulation that can directly interfere with the regulation of the circadian cycle. Although the cause of AD pathology is poorly understood, one of the main risk factors for AD is female gender. Here, we found that female APP/PS1 mice at 6- and 12-months old display severe circadian rhythm disturbances and retinal pathological hallmarks, including A beta deposits in retinal layers. Since brain A beta transport is facilitated by aquaporin (AQP)4, the expression of AQPs were also explored in APP/PS1 retina to investigate a potential correlation between retinal A beta deposits and AQPs expression. Important reductions in AQP1, AQP4, and AQP5 were detected in the retinal tissue of these transgenic mice, mainly at 6-months of age. Taken together, our findings suggest that abnormal transport of A beta, mediated by impaired AQPs expression, contributes to the retinal degeneration in the early stages of AD.

AB  - Greater susceptibility to herbivory can arise as an effect of crop domestication. One proposed explanation is that defenses decreased intentionally or unintentionally during the domestication process, but evidence for this remains elusive. An alternative but nonexclusive explanation is presumed selection for higher nutritional quality.
   We used a metaanalytical approach to examine susceptibility to herbivores in fruit and seed crops and their wild relatives. Our analyses provide novel insights into the mechanisms of increased susceptibility by evaluating whether it can be attributed to either a reduction in herbivore defensive traits, including direct/indirect and constitutive/inducible defenses, or an increase in the nutritional content of crops.
   The results confirm higher herbivory and lower levels of all types of defenses in crops compared to wild relatives, although indirect defenses were more affected than direct ones. Contrary to expectations, nutritional quality was lower in crops than in wild relatives, which may enhance biomass loss to herbivores if they increase consumption to meet nutritional requirements.
   Our findings represent an important advance in our understanding of how changes in defensive and nutritional traits following domestication could influence, in combination or individually, crop susceptibility to herbivore attacks.

AB  - Simple Summary This project examined the interaction between soybean aphids and Ontario-grown soybean cultivars to determine which leaf metabolites were most associated with aphid resistance. Tolerance and resistance were determined by measuring the growth and reproduction of aphids and leaf feeding damage over 10-day and 4-week infestation periods. Chromatographic techniques were used for the analysis of legume-specific plant natural products and isoflavonoids, and high-resolution mass spectrometry was used for the identification of free amino acids in aphid-resistant, tolerant, and susceptible soybean cultivars. There was a low correlation between isoflavonoid leaf concentrations and aphid resistance in the soybean varieties studied; however, the aphid-resistant cultivars were determined to have lower free amino acid concentrations, indicating that lower nutrient quality could be responsible for the resistance observed. Identifying these cultivars is important for managing aphid populations and provides an additional tool for soybean integrated pest management. Soybean aphid (Aphis glycines) is a major soybean (Glycine max) herbivore pest in many soybean growing regions. High numbers of aphids on soybean can cause severe reductions in yield. The management of soybean aphids includes monitoring, insecticide applications when required, and the use of resistant cultivars. Soybean aphid-resistant soybean varieties are associated with genes that confer one or more categories of resistance to soybean aphids, including antibiosis (affects survival, growth, and fecundity), antixenosis (affects behaviour such as feeding), and tolerance (plant can withstand greater damage without economic loss). The genetic resistance of soybean to several herbivores has been associated with isoflavonoid phytoalexins; however, this correlation has not been observed in soybean varieties commonly grown in southern Ontario, Canada. Isoflavonoids in the leaves of 18 cultivars in the early growth stage were analyzed by HPLC and the concentration by fresh weight was used to rate the potential resistance to aphids. Greenhouse and growth cabinet trials determined that the cultivars with greater resistance to aphids were Harosoy 63 and OAC Avatar. The most susceptible cultivar was Maple Arrow, whereas Pagoda and Conrad were more tolerant to aphid feeding damage. Overall, there was a low correlation between the number of aphids per leaf, feeding damage, and leaf isoflavonoid levels. Metabolite profiling by high-resolution LC-MS determined that the most resistant cultivar had on average lower levels of certain free amino acids (Met, Tyr, and His) relative to the most susceptible cultivar. This suggests that within the tested cultivars, nutritional quality stimulates aphid feeding more than isoflavonoids negatively affect aphid feeding or growth. These findings provide a better understanding of soybean host plant resistance and suggest ways to improve soybean resistance to aphid feeding through the breeding or metabolic engineering of leaf metabolites.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the impact of dietary supplementation with RPT 5-HTP and MT on the meat quality and shelf life of Hu sheep. Thirty 4-month-old male Hu sheep with similar body weights (30.84 +/- 1.16 kg) were randomly allocated into three groups (one sheep per replicate): a control group (fed a basal diet), a RPT 5-HTP group (basal diet + 222 mg/kg BW RPT 5-HTP), and an MT group (basal diet + 4 mg/d MT). The experimental period lasted 37 days, including a 7-day adaptation phase and a 30-day formal trial. The results show that supplementation with RPT 5-HTP and MT significantly increased MT levels in the longissimus dorsi muscle of Hu sheep (p < 0.05). Compared to the control group, the malondialdehyde (MDA) content in the longissimus dorsi muscle was significantly reduced in the MT and RPT 5-HTP groups (p < 0.05), while catalase (CAT) activity was significantly increased in the MT group (p < 0.05). The drip loss of the longissimus dorsi muscle in Hu sheep was significantly reduced after supplementation with RPT 5-HTP and MT (p < 0.05). Essential amino acids, non-essential amino acids, sweet-tasting amino acids, and umami amino acids in the longissimus dorsi muscle of supplemented groups were significantly elevated (p < 0.05). Both 5-HTP and MT extended the shelf life of mutton; compared to the control, the shelf life was prolonged by 22.08 h in the RPT 5-HTP group and by 45.36 h in the MT group. In conclusion, it was found that 5-HTP and MT had a certain effect on improving the antioxidant capacity of Hu sheep, thereby enhancing the meat quality of mutton and extending its shelf life, with the amino acid content in mutton being increased to improve its umami and flavor.

AB  - Polyploids are common in Camellia sect. Paracamellia, which contain many important oil crop species. However, their complex evolutionary history is largely unclear. In this study, 22 transcriptomes and 19 plastomes of related species of Camellia were sequenced and assembled, providing the most completed taxa sampling of Camellia sect. Oleifera and C. sect. Paracamellia. Phylogenetic trees were reconstructed with predicted single-copy nuclear genes and plastomes. Phylogenetic trees with nuclear genes demonstrated that C. sect. Oleifera should be merged into C. sect. Paracamellia. Cytonuclear discordance and network analyses suggested hybridizations among polyploid species and relatives. The divergence of major clades in C. sect. Paracamellia was dated to be during the middle to late Miocene from the ancestral Lingnan region, and a rapid diversification during the Quaternary was found, probably through hybridization and polyploidization. The tetraploid Camellia meiocarpa Hu may have originated from hybridization between closely related diploid species. The hexaploid Camellia oleifera C. Abel probably originated from hybridization between closely related diploid and tetraploid (e.g., C. meiocarpa) species. The octoploid Camellia vietnamensis T. C. Huang ex Hu could have originated from hybridization between hexaploid C. oleifera and the closely related diploid species. Hybridization and polyploidization played an important role in generating the rich variation of important fruit traits, especially increased fruit size in polyploid species.

AB  - The BMPR1B gene is a major determinant of sheep reproductive capacity. Previous studies revealed that Q249R (FecB) is a profound variant of BMPR1B that influences the ovulation rate and litter size in sheep. However, unlike Q249R locus, the full spectrum of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within BMPR1B has not been extensively studied. A systematic screen of SNPs in BMPR1B would facilitate the discovery of novel variants that are associated with litter size. This study aimed to investigate SNPs in the BMPR1B gene via whole genome sequence (WGS) data from 2409 individuals of 75 sheep breeds worldwide. Herein, a total of 9688 variants were screened, among which 15 were coding variants and 8 were novel changes. Specifically, we presented the most comprehensive frequency distribution map of the well-known FecB mutation to date. Besides, among the abovementioned SNPs, one synonymous mutation (g.30050773C > T) was found to be likely under selection and is potentially associated with fecundity in Duolang sheep. Thus, our study greatly expands the variation repertoire of the ovine BMPR1B gene and provides a valuable resource for exploring causative mutations and genetic markers associated with litter size.

AB  - Ammonia (NH3) is a major gaseous pollutant in livestock production and has adverse effects on production, health and welfare of animals. The liver is one of the target organs of NH3, and excessive NH3 inhalation can induce liver damage. However, the toxicity assessment of NH3 on pig liver and its mechanism have not been reported yet. Recently, transcriptome analysis has become a major method to study the toxic mechanism of pollutants in environmental toxicology. Therefore, in the present study, we examined the effects of excessive NH3 inhalation on the liver of fattening pig through chemical analysis, ELISA, transcriptome analysis and real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR). Our results showed that the transcriptome analysis database of fattening pig liver under excessive NH3 exposure, and 449 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (including 181 up-regulated DEGs and 168 down-regulated DEGs) were found. Some genes associated with the 3 Gene Ontology (GO) terms (liver function, immune, antioxidant defense) were validated by quantitative real-time PCR. In addition, the activities of GPT and GOT in NH3 group were significantly increased by 63.5% and 37.4% (P < 0.05), respectively. Our results indicated that NH3 exposure could cause changes in transcriptional profiles and liver function, and induce liver damage in fattening pigs through oxidative stress and immune dysfunction. Our study results not only provide a new perspective for the toxicity assessment of NH3, but also enrich the toxicological mechanism of NH3.

AB  - Optimizing nitrogen (N) fertilization without sacrificing grain yield is a major concern of rice production system because most of the applied N has been depleted from the soil and creating environmental consequences. Hence, limited information is available about nutrient management (NM) performance at a specific site under alternate wetting and drying (AWD) irrigation compared to conventional permanent flooding (PF). We aimed to inquire about the performance of NM practices compared to the farmer's fertilizer practice (FFP) under PF and AWD on rhizospheric nitrifier and denitrifier abundance, rice yield, plant growth, and photosynthetic parameters. Two improved NM practices; nutrient management by pig manure (NMPM); 40% chemical N replaced by pig manure (organic N), and nutrient management by organic slow-release fertilizer (NMSR); 40% chemical N replaced by organic slow-release N were compared. The results showed an increased total grain yield (16.06%) during AWD compared to PF. Compared to conventional FFP, NMPM, and NMSR significantly increased the yields by 53.84 and 29.67%, respectively, during AWD. Meanwhile, PF prompted a yield increase of 45.07 and 28.75% for NMPM and NMSR, respectively, (p < 0.05) compared to FFP. Besides, a significant correlation was observed between grain yield and nitrogen content during AWD (R-2 = 0.58, p < 0.01), but no significant correlation was observed during PF. The NMPM contributed to photosynthetic attributes and the relative chlorophyll content under both watering events. Moreover, relatively higher abundances of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) were observed during AWD, and the highest value was found after the late panicle stage. Our results suggest that the AWD-NMPM model is the best option to stimulate nitrifier and denitrifier gene abundance and promote rice production.

AB  - Selection through pollinators plays a major role in the evolution of reproductive traits. However, herbivory can also induce changes in plant sexual expression and sexual systems, potentially influencing conditions governing transitions between sexual systems. Previous work has shown that herbivory has a strong effect on sex allocation in the wind-pollinated annual plant Mercurialis annua, likely via responses to resource loss. It is also known that many plants respond to herbivory by inducing signaling, and endogenous responses to it, via the plant hormone jasmonate. Here, we attempt to uncouple the effects of herbivory on sex allocation in M. annua through resource limitation (tissue loss) versus plant responses to jasmonate hormone signaling. We used a two-factorial experiment with four treatment combinations: control, herbivory (25% chronic tissue loss), jasmonate, and combined herbivory and jasmonate. We estimated the effects of tissue loss and defense-inducing hormones on reproductive allocation, male reproductive effort, and sex allocation. Tissue loss caused plants to reduce their male reproductive effort, resulting in changes in total sex allocation. However, application of jasmonate after herbivory reversed its effect on male investment. Our results show that herbivory has consequences on plant sex expression and sex allocation, and that defense-related hormones such as jasmonate can buffer the impacts. We discuss the physiological mechanisms that might underpin the effects of herbivory on sex allocation, and their potential implications for the evolution of plant sexual systems.

AB  - Simple Summary Murciano-Granadina has drifted towards better dairy-linked conformation traits without losing the grounds of the zoometric basis which confers it with an enhanced adaptability to the environment. Consequently, international Linear Appraisal Systems (LAS) may not fit the zoometric variability reality of autochthonous breeds, such as the Murciano-Granadina goat. LAS panels comprise large numbers of traits which makes selection for dairy conformation a complex and time costly task, hence selection practices focusing on major areas is often suggested. The evaluation of genetic, phenotypic and environmental parameters for each zoometric/LAS trait individually and of the pairwise relationships among traits may permit the design of a solid selection strategy towards the maximization of dairy potential while making selection tasks time- and resource-efficient. Results suggest that zoometrics and LAS-derived genetic and phenotypic parameters are translatable as long as the process of collection is performed objectively by trained operators. Selection of major areas is feasible but may be conditioned to the restructuration and modification of the scales that are currently used for dairy goats. The strategies that were designed help to evaluate the momentum of selection for dairy-linked zoometric traits of the Murciano-Granadina population and its future evolution to enhance the profitability and efficiency of breeding plans. Selection for zoometrics defines individuals' productive longevity, endurance, enhanced productive abilities and consequently, their long-term profitability. When zoometric analysis is aimed at large highly selected populations or in those at different levels of selection, linear appraisal systems (LAS) provide a timely response. This study estimates genetic and phenotypic parameters for zoometric/LAS traits in Murciano-Granadina goats, estimating genetic and phenotypic correlations among all traits, and determining whether major area selection would be appropriate or if adaptability strategies may need to be followed. Heritability estimates for the zoometric/LAS traits were low to high, ranging from 0.09 to 0.43, and the accuracy of estimation has improved after decades, rendering standard errors negligible. Scale inversion of specific traits may need to be performed before major areas selection strategies are implemented. Genetic and phenotypic correlations suggests that negative selection against thicker bones and higher rear insertion heights indirectly results in the optimization of selection practices in the rest of the traits, especially those in the structure, capacity and mammary system major areas. The integration and implementation of the strategies proposed within the Murciano-Granadina breeding program maximizes selection opportunities and the sustainable international competitiveness of the Murciano-Granadina goat in the dairy goat breed panorama.

AB  - BackgroundMicrografting technology has gained popularity in model plants, with the advantages of a wide grafting range and small space. However, this technique has not been fully explored in tea plants.ResultsIn our study, different rootstocks [radicle (obtained from the germination in seed), epicotyl without cotyledons, epicotyl with cotyledons, tea varieties] and scion (red branch, green branch) grafting combinations were used to estimate the survival rate, plant growth, the compatibility behavior, and cold tolerance of grafted seedlings. Our results showed that the higher survival rate and shooting rate were observed in radicle (obtained from the germinated seed diameter >= 15 mm, D3) as the rootstock. Also, the same growth indicators were found in the green branch as scion and radicle as rootstock (GB\R) were higher than that of other grafting combinations. In addition, the grafted seedlings of LJ43 as rootstock had the best growth rate, and the vascular bundle bridge was completely established in SCZ as scion and LJ43 as rootstock (SCZ/LJ43) graft combination, accompanied with a higher survival rate, shoot rate and leaf number of new shoots and cold tolerance in field experiments.ConclusionOur findings provide a viable tea micrografting method, which has the potential to substitute traditional tea cuttings for tea seedling propagation and thus meet the requirements of tea cultivation.

AB  - Emerging infectious diseases with zoonotic potential often have complex socioecological dynamics and limited ecological data, requiring integration of epidemiological modeling with surveillance. Although our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 has advanced considerably since its detection in late 2019, the factors influencing its introduction and transmission in wildlife hosts, particularly white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), remain poorly understood. We use a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible epidemiological model to investigate the spillover risk and transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in wild and captive white-tailed deer populations across various simulated scenarios. We found that captive scenarios pose a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 introduction from humans into deer herds and subsequent transmission among deer, compared to wild herds. However, even in wild herds, the transmission risk is often substantial enough to sustain infections. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the strength of introduction from humans influences outbreak characteristics only to a certain extent. Transmission among deer was frequently sufficient for widespread outbreaks in deer populations, regardless of the initial level of introduction. We also explore the potential for fence line interactions between captive and wild deer to elevate outbreak metrics in wild herds that have the lowest risk of introduction and sustained transmission. Our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 could be introduced and maintained in deer herds across a range of circumstances based on testing a range of introduction and transmission risks in various captive and wild scenarios. Our approach and findings will aid One Health strategies that mitigate persistent SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in white-tailed deer populations and potential spillback to humans.

AB  - Chronic pain and depression are intimately linked; the combination of the two leads to higher health care costs, lower quality of life, and worse treatment outcomes with both conditions exhibiting higher prevalence among women. In the current study, we examined the development of depressive-like behavior in male and female mice using the spared nerve injury (SNI) model of neuropathic pain. Males displayed increased immobility on the forced-swim test - a measure of depressive-like behavior - 2 weeks following injury, while females developed depressive-like behavior at 3-week. Since the pathogenesis of chronic pain and depression may involve overlapping mechanisms including the activation of microglial cells, we explored glial cell changes in brain regions associated with pain processing and affect. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that microglial cells were more numerous in female SNI mice in the contralateral ventral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a brain region important for pain processing and affect behavior, 2-week following surgery. Microglial cell activation was not different between any of the groups for the dorsal ACC or nucleus accumbens. Analysis of astrocyte density did not reveal any significant changes in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) staining in the ACC or nucleus accumbens. Overall, the current study characterized peripheral nerve injury induced depression-like behavior in male and female mice, which may be associated with different patterns of glial cell activation in regions important for pain processing and affect.

AB  - Heliotropism of flowers is thought to provide a reproductive advantage to individuals of many species; yet, there are few clear demonstrations of a fitness advantage provided by heliotropism, most of which are almost completely restricted to plants from the arctic or alpine regions where a heat gain provides an advantage to the plants. In this study, we report heliotropism in the white trillium, an early spring blooming species from the temperate forests of eastern North America. The white trillium shows horizontal seasonal heliotropism with flowers mainly facing south throughout the summer, but it also exhibits daily horizontal and vertical heliotropism with the orientation of the flower tracking the sun during the day. The study of 479 tethered plants indicated that seasonal heliotropism provides a reproductive advantage to the white trillium, with south-facing individuals showing a 12% increase in fertilized ovules compared to north-facing plants. The ecology of this long-lived perennial is, in many aspects, similar to that of alpine and arctic heliotropic species. Indeed, white trilliums are insect-pollinated and they flower when the weather is cold, before the trees leaf out. This suggests that there are potentially more species for which heliotropism is advantageous amongst early spring flowers from the temperate forest.

AB  - Background The assessment of sperm DNA integrity has been proposed as a complementary test to conventional mammalian semen analysis. In this sense, single-strand (SSB) and double-strand (DSB) DNA breaks, the two types of sperm DNA fragmentation (SDF), have been reported to have different aetiologies and to be associated to different fertility outcomes in bovine and humans. Considering that no studies in porcine have addressed how SDF may affect sperm quality and fertility outcomes, the present work aimed to determine the impact of global DNA damage, SSB and DSB on sperm quality and in vitro fertilising ability. To this end, 24 ejaculates (one per boar) were split into three aliquots: the first was used to assess sperm quality parameters through a computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA) system and flow cytometry; the second was used to perform in vitro fertilisation, and the third, to evaluate sperm DNA integrity using alkaline and neutral Comet assays. Results The results showed that global DNA damage negatively correlates (P < 0.05) with normal sperm morphology (R = - 0.460) and progressive motility (R = - 0.419), and positively with the percentage of non-viable sperm (R = 0.507). Multiple regression analyses showed that non-viable sperm were related to SSB (beta = - 0.754). In addition, while fertilisation did not seem to be affected by sperm DNA integrity, global DNA damage, DSB and SSB were found to be correlated to embryo development outcomes. Specifically, whereas global DNA damage and DSB negatively affected (P < 0.05) the later preimplantation embryo stages (percentage of early blastocyst/blastocyst D6: for global DNA damage, R = - 0.458, and for DSB, R = - 0.551; and percentage of hatching/hatched blastocyst D6: for global DNA damage, R = - 0.505, and for DSB, R = - 0.447), global DNA damage and SSB had a negative impact (P < 0.05) on the developmental competency of fertilised embryos (R = - 0.532 and R = - 0.515, respectively). Remarkably, multiple regression analyses supported the associations found in correlation analyses. Finally, the present work also found that the inclusion of Comet assays to the conventional sperm quality tests improves the prediction of blastocyst formation (AUC = 0.9021, P < 0.05), but not fertilisation rates (P > 0.05). Conclusion Considering all these findings, this work sets a useful model to study how SDF negatively influences fertility.

AB  - High temperatures significantly affect tea yield and quality. Arginine methylation is crucial for plant growth and environmental adaptation. However, its role in regulating plant responses to high temperatures remains unclear. In this study, we identified an important Type II arginine methyltransferase, PRMT5, in tea plants and confirmed its methyltransferase activity both in vivo and in vitro. Our findings revealed that CsPRMT5-mediated symmetric dimethylation of histone H4R3 (H4R3sme2) was markedly reduced under high-temperature conditions in tea plants. Both the inhibitor and gene-silencing approaches led to decreased levels of H4R3sme2 modification, resulting in alterations in theanine and catechins. We employed a genome-wide approach to analyze the RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of tea plants subjected to ambient high temperatures, PRMT5 inhibitors, and PRMT5 silencing, along with H4R3sme2 and CsPRMT5 chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq). Comparative analysis of these datasets indicated that genes regulated by H4R3sme2 were predominantly enriched within the reactive oxygen species (ROS), calcium ion, and hormone signalling pathways under elevated temperature conditions. Furthermore, we validated CsCDPK9 as a target gene regulated by H4R3sme2 and found that silencing CsCDPK9 resulted in increased theanine content and decreased catechin content at high temperatures. Our findings suggest that CsPRMT5-mediated H4R3sme2 plays a pivotal role in the growth of tea plants, as well as in their adaptability to fluctuations in ambient temperatures. This study provides new insights into breeding strategies aimed at developing crops that are better equipped to withstand environmental changes induced by climate change.

AB  - Scientific interest in pollution from veterinary antibiotics (VAs) on intensive animal farms has been increasing in recent years. However, limited information is available on the seasonal pollution characteristics and the associated ecological risks of VAs, especially about the different scale farms. Therefore, this study investigated the seasonal pollution status and ecological risks of 42 typical VAs (5 classes) on three different scale pig farms (breeding scales of about 30,000, 1200, and 300 heads, respectively) in Tianjin, China. The results showed that large-scale pig farms usually had the highest antibiotic pollution levels, followed by small-scale pig farms and medium-scale pig farms. Among different seasons, antibiotic contamination was more severe in winter and spring than that in the other seasons. Tetracyclines (TCs) usually had higher proportions (over 51.46%) and the residual concentration detected in manure, and wastewater samples ranged from not detected (ND)-1132.64 mg/kg and ND-1692.50 mu g/L, respectively, which all occurred for oxytetracycline (OTC) during winter. For the antibiotic ecological risks in the effluent, we found high-risk level of 12 selected VAs accounted for 58% in spring, and 7 kinds of VAs were selected in the amended soil, but nearly all the antibiotics had no obvious ecological risks except OTC (spring and summer). All these data provided an insight into the seasonal variability and the associated ecological risks of antibiotics on intensive pig farms, which can provide scientific guidance on decreasing antibiotic contamination to enhance environmental security in similar areas.

AB  - American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius) is a slow-growing medicinal root native to eastern North America. Though it is possible to farm, wild ginseng can sell for twenty (or more) times as much as cultivated ginseng. Declining wild ginseng populations due to habitat loss and overharvesting has led to harvest restrictions, but strong demand for wild ginseng remains. One potential solution is "wild-simulated" ginseng, where ginseng is grown under conditions crafted to mimic a wild forest with the goal of producing roots that look wild. I contend, however, that despite the fact that wild-simulated ginseng grows in a habitat actively tended and monitored by humans, is nevertheless wild. I explore wildness as "productive unruliness" and show how wild-simulated ginseng actively crafts wildness through management to maintain if not add complexity, to foster unpredictability, or to facilitate stress. Furthermore, the habitat that wild-simulated ginseng growers are attempting to emulate-"wild" Appalachian woodlands dominated by an assemblage of "native" plants that pre-date the arrival of Europeans in the Americas-are themselves the product of human manipulation. In Appalachia, the boundaries between the wild and the cultivated are blurred. Wild-simulated ginseng is an example of how conservation goals can be achieved by crafting "wild" environments that are not untouched, pristine wildernesses.

AB  - The aim of this study was to compare the effect of diets on the morphological parameters of different developmental stages of blowflies Chrysomya megacephala (Fabricius, 1794). Adult C. megacephala flies were collected from a goat cadaver and reared in the laboratory when the max and min temperature were 32 and 24 degrees C and the relative max and min humidity were ranged between 55 and 31% respectively. Blowflies at various feeding stages (first-, second-, and third-instar larvae) received different types of diets (meat, liver, fats, and mixed). The effects of the different diets on the life cycle duration and the morphological parameters of various stages were observed. The results revealed that the fat diet prolonged the post-mortem interval (PMI) up to 298.5 +/- 1.15 hrs, whereas the mixed food diet shortened PMI to the 243.67 +/- 0.12 hrs. Significant variation were observed at level (F = 740.71 df = 3P < 0.001). Furthermore, the mixed food diet significantly increased the morphological parameters (length, width, and weight) for almost all stages during the life cycle of blowflies. In contrast, the fat diet decreased these parameters to the lowest level. The present findings may provide a scientific basis for the determination of PMI.

AB  - The treatment of livestock manure caused by the expansion of the breeding industry in China has attracted wide attention. Heavy metals in pig manure can pollute soil and water and even transfer to crops, posing harm to humans through the food chain. In this study, corn straw was selected as the additive and introduced into the anaerobic digestion. Sepiolite (SE), ferric oxide (Fe2O3), attapulgite (AT) and ferric sulfate (FeSO4) were used as passivators to compare the effects of these inorganic passivators on gas production and passivation of heavy metals during the process of the anaerobic digestion. When the dry mass ratio of pig manure to straw is 8:2, the gas production efficiency is optimal. SE, AT and ferric sulfate have a much stronger ability to improve gas production performance than Fe2O3. The total gas production increased by 10.34%, 6.62% and 4.56%, and the average methane production concentration increased by 0.7%, 0.3% and 0.4%, respectively. The influence of SE, AT and ferric sulfate on the passivation of heavy metals is much better than Fe2O3, and the fractions in biological effective forms of Cu and Zn reduced by 41.87 and 19.32%, respectively. The anaerobic digestion of mixed materials is conducive to the gas production and the passivation of heavy metals. Therefore, SE, AT and ferric sulfate are selected as composite passivators, and the optimal ratio of inorganic composite passivators i: AT 7.5 g/L, ferric sulfate 5 g/L and SE 7.5 g/L, according to the results of orthogonal experiments. This study can provide a theoretical basis for the safe application of biogas fertilizers.

AB  - The main objective of this study was to analyze the efficiency of CWs for purifying swine wastewater in order to reduce its pollutant load. The system included a pretreatment module (raw swine wastewater tank, phase separator, and settlement tank), and three constructed wetlands connected in series and planted with Phragmites australis and Suaeda vera. Three treatment cycles were carried out with a total hydraulic retention time in the wetland of 21 days for each cycle. Pig slurry samples were collected in triplicate after each treatment module, and physical-chemical analyses were performed. The results showed that the phase separator decreased the suspended solids, turbidity, and the chemical oxygen demand in the treated swine wastewater. The system enabled considerable nitrogen reductions (Kjeldahl nitrogen, NH4+, and organic nitrogen), and the highest removal was reported in the wetlands. However, the cations and anions showed different efficiencies. In some cases (Ca, Mg, and Na), the final concentrations were increased, which could be explained by their release from the substrate; however, there were no statistical differences among the CW effluents and the raw pig slurry. Therefore, the integral pig slurry treatment system with constructed wetlands increased the quality of the treated swine wastewater and thus can be used for its sustainable agronomic valorization. This thereby enables savings in inorganic fertilizers and irrigation water.

AB  - Simple Summary This paper looks at past relationships between humans and certain wild animal species, that is, raptors, bears, beavers, and elks. As we have observed, it was the behaviour of animals that caught the attention of humans, such as spectacular flights and hunting by raptors, the similarities in bear and human behaviour, the fascinating impressiveness and charisma of elks, and the landscape-shaping by enigmatic beavers. All these animals have special meanings to humans far beyond their economic significance. Wild goshawks, falcons, and other raptor species have acted as trained hunting companions, but they were never domesticated and had to be treated with care. As for bear, beaver, and elk, there were often complex rituals before, during, and after the killing, because there was no clear separation between humans and animals. The animals were not just prey but equal beings and other-than-human persons. However, there were also changes over time in the human-animal relationship, such as the advent of the farming way of life with a preference for domesticated animals, as well as the arrival of Christianity, by which animals became second to human.Abstract Humans have developed a special relationship with some animal species throughout history, even though these animals were never domesticated. Based on raptors, bears, beavers, and elks, the question of whether there are similarities between the perception of these animals that triggered a special kind of fascination in humans and how the relationship between humans and these animals changed between Mesolithic age and medieval times is addressed. As we demonstrate, the categorical antagonism between 'animal' and 'human' is a concept that saw different kinds of influence, from the advent of sedentarism and husbandry to Christianity and from philosophical thinking in Classical Antiquity and the Period of Enlightenment. In prehistory and early history, we find different, opposing world views across time, cultures, and periods. Differences between animals and humans have been considered as fluid, and humans have had to engage with animals and their needs. The well-known and famous 'bear ceremonies' attested to different peoples and times were not unique, but were a part of belief systems that also included other animal species. Among the considered animals, certain raptor species attracted the attention of humans who tried to establish contact with them, as companions, whereas bears were almost 'disguised humans' due to all their similarities with humans, but they were also tabooed beings whose real names had to be avoided.

AB  - 1. Insect herbivores simultaneously experience bottom-up effects of plant defensive chemistry and the top-down effects of natural enemies. At the intersection of these effects are herbivore immune systems, herbivore traits that have largely been overlooked in studies of plant-insect interactions. Most previous studies have demonstrated compromised immunity of herbivores that feed on plants with higher defensive chemistry. Many studies have used embedded microfilaments or silica beads as proxies for parasitoid eggs. Yet, parasitoids may evade or suppress host immune responses by injecting venom and calyx fluid, or through modifications of their egg surface structure, necessitating studies that include all three trophic levels to obtain a complete picture of how plant traits may modulate herbivore immunity.
   2. Here, we examined the effect of host plant species that differ in glucosinolate (anti-herbivore compounds produced by plants in the Brassicaceae) concentrations on the immune status of an herbivore and its consequences for two species of parasitoids with different life history traits.
   3. We found that larvae of the butterfly Pieris rapae that fed on field mustard Brassica rapa, which contain 52-fold higher glucosinolate concentrations than collards B. oleracea, attained lower body weights and experienced prolonged development to adulthood.
   4. Yet, caterpillars that fed on B. rapa had enhanced cellular immunity, as measured by total and differential haemocyte counts as well as melanization capacity, compared to larvae that fed on B. oleracea.
   5. In turn, the likelihood that at least some eggs in clutches of the gregarious endoparasitoid Cotesia glomerata would be encapsulated, leading to a reduction in brood size, were three times greater when their host caterpillars fed on B. rapa compared to B. oleracea.
   6. Interestingly, eggs of the solitary endoparasitoid Cotesia rubecula were rarely encapsulated irrespective of the host plant on which their host caterpillar fed. Therefore, our results suggest that plant defence metabolites can influence the expression of herbivore immunity, but the effectiveness of this response strongly depends on the identity of the parasitoid and its ability to evade the caterpillar immune response, and possibly the evolution of these trophic interactions in non-native systems.

It binds to long-chain fatty acids and facilitates their transport within cells. FABP4 is involved in lipid metabolism, insulin sensitivity, inflammation, and energy homeostasis. This study was conducted to assess the association between the FABP4 gene and growth traits in Karakul and Awassi sheep. A PCR-single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) protocol was utilized to assess the polymorphism of FABP4 PCR products with growth traits measured at birth, three, six, nine, and twelve-month intervals. One non-synonymous SNP was identified in the second exon, in which threonine was converted to aspartate in the 61st position in FABP4 (p.61Thr > Asp). This novel SNP showed significant associations with all growth traits measured at all age intervals. The results showed that lambs with the TT genotype exhibited higher growth traits than those with the GT and GG genotypes, respectively. The conducted prediction showed a clearly deleterious effect of p.61Thr > Asp on FABP4 structure, which was accompanied by reduced fatty acid binding efficiency. Owing to the predicted damaging effects caused by p.61Thr > Asp on FABP, lower levels of lipid transport and its consequent increased weight gain and other growth trait indices are expected. Therefore, a putative mechanism through which lambs with these genotypes exhibit higher growth traits is proposed. The FABP4 gene is suggested as a promising marker to improve growth traits in Karakul and Awassi sheep. However, more research is required to validate this mechanism.

AB  - Saponins cause mortality in insects by reducing food absorption and movement in the gut, which may be used to exploit the control of insect pests. In the current study, tea seed saponin (TSS) was extracted and then added to the artificial diets of Helicoverpa armigera. Pre-ovipositional period of the TSS-treated individuals increased while longevity and fecundity decreased compared to control. There was a significant reduction of the treated individuals in the life table parameters of TSS-treated Individuals including net reproduction rate (R-0), intrinsic rate of population increase (r), finite rate of increase (lambda), and gross reproduction rate (GRR). Also, we found that saponin suppressed the immune system by reducing the total hemocyte count, immune-related gene expression, and phenoloxidase activity. Our results demonstrated a lower expression of cecropin gene in the treated larvae with TSS while no significant differences were observed in attacin gene. Our results clearly showed that feeding of H. armigera larvae in the diet containing TSS significantly reduced demographic parameters, forced insects to obtain more time to complete one generation, and caused vulnerabilities against pathogens. These discrepancies alleviated nutrient uptake of the larvae and disrupted their feeding and growth. Hence, a proper formulation with a desirable concentration would be prepared and applied in the fields suffering H. armigera damage to monitor insecticidal efficiency of TSS.

AB  - While the partial shading operation is observed in the photovoltaic (PV) panel, the solar radiation strikes the PV modules placed in a non-homogeneous PV array. Most of the array reconfiguration approaches for PV arrays use puzzle-based mathematical techniques to relocate the PV modules. While taking size as the parameter, the existing array reconfiguration approach is not a reliable option for efficient shaded dispersion in large-scale sized PV arrays. The main intent of this paper is to implement a novel array reconfiguration model in PV systems using improved an hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm. In the proposed model, the optimal array reconfiguration is attained by a hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm called Red Deer-Moth-Flame Optimization (RD-MFO), which can prove its excellence in providing the optimal PV array. The proposed objective model with best array reconfiguration is focused on a multi-objective function that covers the constraints like maximizing the power, minimizing efficiency, and minimizing shading loss, and other constraints like fill factor, income generation, and mismatch losses. To validate the reconfiguration model, the proposed approach has experimented on a 9 x 9 PV array with four shade patterns. Furthermore, the comparative analysis of attaining the multi-objective function by the proposed RD-MFO over the conventional meta-heuristic algorithm proves the efficiency of the proposed arrangement. While considering the efficiency of the designed RD-MFO-based PV array for case 4 is 16.923% improved than IPM and 19.230% improved than SGDA. Thus, all the computations have been verified with all the methods, and the suggested model gets superior performance in PV array reconfiguration.

AB  - Simple Summary In meat sheep and sheep bred for other purposes, meat quality is one of the factors evaluated in a breeding programme. In this study, we included 25 sheep breeds from Germany with a sufficient amount of performance and pedigree data. The heritability, genetic and residual correlations were estimated for daily weight gain, meatiness score and ultrasound measurements for the muscle and fat thickness of the sheep breeds. We employed animal models to analyse inbreeding depression by estimating linear slopes of inbreeding coefficients on meat performance traits. For daily weight gain, inbreeding depression was significant for all sheep breeds. When considering single breeds, significant inbreeding depression was only found in two breeds. The meatiness scores did not show significant inbreeding depression across breeds, nor in single breeds, but only in one breed. The ultrasound measurements for muscle and fat thickness were not significant for inbreeding depression either across or within breeds. Purging effects did not prove to be significant either across or within breeds. Our data show that inbreeding depression and purging can be present in traits under strong selection.Abstract This study provides estimates on genetic parameters, inbreeding depression and purging for meat performance measures from 25 German sheep breeds. All German meat, merino sheep breeds and breeds of other breeding directions with a sufficient number of pedigree and performance data were included in this study. Phenotypic traits retrieved from the national database OviCap were evaluated: daily weight gain, meatiness score and ultrasound measurements for muscle and fat thickness. We employed animal models to estimate heritability, variance and covariance components for these meat performance traits as well as inbreeding depression and purging. The heritabilities, on average, reached estimates of 0.55, 0.34, 0.53 and 0.61 for daily weight gain, meatiness score and ultrasound measurements for muscle and fat thickness, respectively. We estimated the linear regression slopes for the individual rate of inbreeding, new and ancestral inbreeding, as well as the inbreeding coefficient and its interaction with the inbreeding coefficient of Ballou, employing animal models with non-genetic effects and the additive genetic effect of the animal. Across all breeds, inbreeding was only significant for daily weight gain, whereas for all other traits, estimates were not significant. Within sheep breeds, we found significant inbreeding depression for daily weight gain in German Mutton Merino and German Blackheaded Mutton as well as for the meatiness score in German Whiteheaded Mutton. Significant effects for purging, based on ancestral inbreeding and the interaction effect of the classical inbreeding coefficient with the inbreeding coefficient of Ballou, were not obvious either across or within any sheep breed. A 1% increase in inbreeding significantly decreased the phenotypic trait median of daily weight gain across all sheep breeds by 0.50% and 0.70% of phenotypic and genetic standard deviation, respectively. Purging effects due to ancestral inbreeding were not significant in any breed or across breeds. The results of this study may indicate that inbreeding depression may be more harmful in traits under stronger selection than in traits that exert low selection pressure. The results of this study demonstrate the different effects that result in meat performance traits due to inbreeding.
   With increasing rates of inbreeding and critical effective population sizes, selection intensity for breeding objectives has to be critically reviewed for each sheep breed. Inbreeding depression and purging should be evaluated in order to prevent a decrease in trait means due to inbreeding and to determine whether detrimental alleles are eliminated.

AB  - At-sea habitat use of breeding seabirds is strongly influenced by marine environmental features that vary over space and time. The use of bio-loggers allows researchers to track fine-scale movements of seabirds and provides opportunities to identify the primary factors affecting their area use for foraging. Using GPS loggers, we tracked chick-rearing rhinoceros auklets (Cerorhinca monocerata), which are wing-propelled divers, at Daikoku Island, eastern Hokkaido, Japan. The central phase for foraging activity on birds' trips was determined using a multiple change points model. To examine environmental factors explaining the distribution of the foraging phase, a generalized additive model was used where sea surface temperature, chlorophyll a concentration, bathymetry, and distance from the colony were explanatory variables. To obtain information supporting the behavioral tracking, prey items in the bill-loads of adult auklets were collected. We found that auklets foraged over the continental shelf shallower than the 200-m isobath and that distance from the colony was related to the area use. Adult auklets predominately brought back age-0 chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta), which was abundant in coastal waters along southeast Hokkaido during the study period. Our findings indicate that rhinoceros auklets rearing chicks, hence visiting nests frequently, on Daikoku Island can find suitable feeding grounds nearby.

AB  - Simple Summary The protective effects of colostrum in relation to the incidence and severity of newborn ruminant diseases are well established. Neonatal calf depends on the timely supply of high-quality colostrum to prevent the failure of passive transfer of immunoglobulins (Ig), which has been linked to increased risk of different diseases and mortality in early stages of life. Despite the relevance of Buffaloes (Bubalus Bubalis) in world dairy production, the available knowledge regarding colostrum quality management remains scarce for this species. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the utility of a simple and rapid tool such as a digital Brix refractometer to estimate colostrum quality and for predicting the success of passive transfer of immunoglobulin G (IgG) in Buffalo calves. For this aim, correlation analysis was performed between Brix results and ELISA-IgG determination from colostrum and serum samples. A strong correlation was found between Brix measurements and IgG content in colostrum and serum samples. Moreover, cut point values for Brix measurements for colostrum and serum samples were determined. Brix refractometry was found to be an acceptable tool for on-farm estimations of colostrum quality and passive immunity transfer (PIT) in Buffalo calves. Brix refractometry has been widely demonstrated to be a useful tool for monitoring colostrum management program and passive immunity transfer (PIT) in Bovines, but its suitability has never been verified in Buffalo. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the utility of a simple and rapid tool such as a digital Brix refractometer to estimate colostrum quality and for evaluating the success of passive transfer of immunoglobulin G (IgG) in Buffalo calves. The optimal cut points levels for Brix Refractometry for distinguishing good- and poor-quality colostrum and for assessing the adequacy of passive immunity transfer in calves were determined. For this aim, 26 first-milking maternal colostrum (MC) were collected from first-calf heifers. Blood samples were obtained from their calves at birth (T0) and 72 hours after (T3). Colostrum and Serum IgG content were determined by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), whereas total protein (TP, g/dL) and percentage Brix (%Brix) by means of a digital Brix refractometer. The mean colostrum IgG was 64.9 +/- 29.3 mg/mL. The mean serum %Brix at T3 was 9.6 +/- 0.9 %. The mean serum IgG content at T3 was 11.1 +/- 2.0 mg/mL. Pearson's correlation coefficient (r(p)) was determined between Brix and ELISA measurements: colostrum %Brix showed a significant correlation with serum %Brix (r(p) = 0.82, p < 0.001); serum %Brix was highly correlated with serum TP (STP, g/dL) (r(p) = 0.98, p < 0.001) and serum IgG (mg/mL) (r(p) = 0.85, p < 0.001). A cut point of 18% Brix to estimate samples of MC >= 50 mg/mL from first-calf heifers was more appropriate for the buffalo. A cut point of 8.4% Brix resulted in the greatest percentage of calf serum samples being correctly classified. Based on our findings, a digital Brix refractometer could be a useful tool to monitor colostrum quality and to estimate PIT in Buffalo calves.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of WO3-based photocatalytic bactericide on the piggery environment, microorganisms in pig manure, and weaned piglets. After spraying WO3-based photocatalytic bactericide, the NH3 concentration in the piggery decreased by 31.25% within 1 h and then returned to pre-spraying concentration after 24 h. The airborne aerobic bacteria level in the piggery before spraying was 3.99 x 105 colony-forming unit (CFU)/m3, which dropped to 2.45 x 10(5) CFU/m(3) 1 h after spraying, with a bactericidal rate of 38.58%. The airborne aerobic bacteria level was 3.3 x 10(5) CFU/m(3) 24 h after spraying, with a bactericidal rate of 17.32%, and was 3.61 x 10(5) CFU/m(3) 48 h after spraying, with a bactericidal rate of 9.44%. After 1 h of spraying, concentrations of the total suspended particulate (TSP), particulate matter (PM) 10, and PM 2.5 decreased by 31.1%, 43.0%, and 32.5%, respectively. The abundance of some potentially pathogenic bacteria in TSP and PM 2.5, such as Staphylococcus, Enterococcus, Streptococcus, and Staphylococcus, was significantly reduced by 16sDNA sequencing for some time after spraying the bactericide (p < 0.05). At certain times following the application of the bactericide, the levels of pathogenic bacteria, such as Pseudomonas, Flavobacterium, and Stenotrophomonas on piggery walls were significantly reduced (p < 0.05). Overall, this study provided a research direction for improving the environmental quality of piggery and promoting the healthy growth of weaned piglets as well as the future development and application of new photocatalytic products.

AB  - The growth of endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) at implantation sites may be a potential factor affecting the success rate of embryo implantation. Incremental proofs demonstrated that ncRNAs (e.g. miRNAs, lncRNAs and circRNAs) were involved in various biological procedures, including proliferation and apoptosis. In this study, the role of miR-100-5p on proliferation and apoptosis of goat ESCs in vitro and embryo implantation in vivo was determined. The mRNA expression of miR-100-5p was significantly inhibited in the receptive phase (RE) rather than in the pre-receptive phase (PE). Overexpression of miR-100-5p suppressed ESCs proliferation and induced apoptosis. The molecular target of MiR-100-5p, HOXA1, was confirmed by 3 '-UTR assays. Meanwhile, the product of HOXA1 mRNA RT-PCR increased in the RE more than that in the PE. The HOXA1-siRNA exerted significant negative effects on growth arrest. Instead, incubation of ESCs with miR-100-5p inhibitor or overexpressed HOXA1 promoted the cell proliferation. In addition, Circ-9110 which acted as a sponge for miR-100-5p reversed the relevant biological effects of miR-100-5p. The intrinsic apoptosis pathway was suppressed in ESCs, revealing a crosstalk between Circ-9110/miR-100-5p/HOXA1 axis, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, and ERK1/2 pathways. To further evaluate the progress in study on embryo implantation regulating mechanism of miR-100-5p in vivo, the pinopodes of two phases were observed and analysed, suggesting that, as similar as in situ, miR-100-5p was involved in significantly regulating embryo implantation in vivo. Mechanistically, miR-100-5p performed its embryo implantation function through regulation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR and ERK1/2 pathways by targeting Circ-9110/miR-100-5p/HOXA1 axis in vivo.

AB  - Factors that mediate insect herbivore sabotaging behaviour of host plant latex defences remain under debate. The most prominent hypothesis suggests that the anatomy of the host plant's laticifers determines trenching or vein-cutting behaviour, but there are inconsistencies in the literature. In addition to latex, other plant defences have been shown to affect plant natural enemies, but experimental studies comparing the effects of multiple defences on herbivore performance and behaviour are scarce. In this study, we investigated the anatomy of the laticifers of Calotropis procera (Aiton) W.T. Aiton (Apocynaceae), an exotic milkweed of southeastern Brazil, as well as the sabotaging behaviour of larvae of southern monarch, Danaus erippus (Cramer), and queen butterfly, Danaus gilippus (Cramer) (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) on this host plant. We also reviewed the sabotaging behaviour of larvae reared on the native milkweed Asclepias curassavica L. (Apocynaceae) from previous studies, as well as the description of the anatomy of its laticifers. As we found no correspondence between sabotaging behaviour of southern monarchs and queens and the anatomy of the host plants' laticifers, we tested whether structural defences of C. procera leaves (latex, waxes and trichomes) affected sabotaging behaviour and larval performance of southern monarch larvae. The structural barriers of this well-defended host affected larvae in different ways: Southern monarchs developed more slowly on control leaves than on leaves from which wax had been removed, and only latex removal reduced the frequency of sabotaging behaviour. Regardless of the defence removal treatment, frequencies of trenching behaviour decreased and vein-cutting behaviour increased as larvae developed. Overall, our results show that several factors in addition to the anatomy of laticifers affect sabotaging behaviour of southern monarchs and queens, including larval ontogeny, danaine species and latex outflow. This evidence suggests a behavioural plasticity in the sabotaging behaviour of larvae of both southern monarchs and queens.
   Southern monarch, Danaus erippus, and queen butterflies, Danaus gilippus (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae), were examined with respect to sabotaging behaviour and larval performance on an exotic (Calotropis procera) and a native (Asclepias curassavica) host plant (Apocynaceae), both with anastomosed articulated laticifers. Larvae performed sabotaging behaviour more intensely on the exotic, well-defended host. Attenuation of plant structural defences resulted in faster larval development and a decreased frequency in sabotaging behaviour. Multiple defences and behavioural plasticity play a pivotal role in Danaus-Apocynaceae interactions.image

AB  - Simple Summary 25-hydroxyvitamin D-3 [25(OH)VD3] plays an important role in regulating calcium and phosphorus metabolism via upregulating the expression of calcium ion channel proteins, resulting in improved bone quality. Many publications have reported that dietary supplementation of 25(OH)VD3 could improve the antioxidase activity and immune function of weaned pigs. However, evidence has proven that the biological response of 25(OH)VD3 on pig nutrition depends on the inclusion doses in the diets. This study was conducted to explore the roles of 25(OH)VD3 with different inclusion doses in growing-finishing pigs. The study was conducted to evaluate the effects of 25(OH)VD3 with different inclusion levels of 0, 25, 50 and 75 mu g/kg in the diet on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, bone properties and pork quality in growing-finishing pigs. The results showed that the average daily gain (p < 0.05) and body weight (p < 0.10) of pigs showed a trend of increasing quadratically as inclusion levels of 25(OH)VD3 increased. Dietary supplementation of 50 mu g/kg 25(OH)VD3 increased calcium digestibility compared with the 0 mu g/kg group (p < 0.05), and calcium and phosphorus digestibility increased quadratically as inclusion levels of 25(OH)VD3 increased (p < 0.05). Dietary supplementation of 50 mu g/kg 25(OH)VD3 increased concentrations of polyunsaturated fatty acids, and decreased contents of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids in the longissimus dorsi of pigs (p < 0.05). The addition of 25, 50 and 75 mu g/kg 25(OH)VD3 to the diet increased breaking strength and bone stiffness in the tibia compared with the 0 mu g/kg group (p < 0.05). Dietary supplementation of 50 mu g/kg 25(OH)VD3 improved the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), and increased the messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of Cu/Zn SOD in the longissimus dorsi compared with the 0 mu g/kg group (p < 0.05). Supplementing 50 mu g/kg 25(OH)VD3 improved the mRNA expression of calcium-binding protein D9k (CaBP-D9k) and D28k (CaBP-D28K) in the liver compared with the 0 mu g/kg 25(OH)D-3 group (p < 0.05). In conclusion, a diet with an added dose of 50 mu g/kg 25(OH)VD3 showed a greatest growth performance of growing-finishing pigs, and 25(OH)VD3 enhanced calcium deposition and antioxidant capacity in the longissimus dorsi, which may be associated with improved expression of calcium ion channel proteins.

AB  - Noradrenergic control is very significant for the contractility of healthy and inflamed uteri. The receptor mechanisms of noradrenaline (NA) influencing the contractile activity of an inflamed uterus are poorly recognized. This study was undertaken to determine the participation of alpha 2-adrenergic receptors (ARs) isoforms (A, B, C) in NA-evoked contractility of the pig uterus with severe acute endometritis. Saline (SAL group) or E.coli suspension (E.coli group) were injected into uterine horns, while only laparotomy was performed in the CON group. In relation to the period before NA application, NA decreased the tension, amplitude and frequency in the uterine strips of the CON and SAL groups, and the amplitude and frequency in the E.coli group. In the E.coli group, the amplitude and frequency were lower than in other groups. Compared to NA effect alone, a greater reduction or appearance of a decrease in the amplitude and frequency were noted in all groups following the use of selective alpha 2A- and alpha 2C-ARs antagonists together with NA as well as in the tension in the CON and SAL groups in response to an alpha 2C-ARs antagonist and NA. Such effects were also exerted by an alpha 2B-ARs antagonist with NA on the frequency in all groups and on the amplitude in the CON and SAL groups. To sum up, in an inflammatory-changed porcine uterus, three alpha 2-AR isoforms mediate the effect of NA on contractile frequency, while alpha 2A- and alpha 2C-AR are involved in the control of contractile amplitude. These results could offer new targets for drugs against decreased uterine contractility in inflammation. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Pig production is the main source of odor emissions. Owing to the complex composition of odors and the timeconsuming and laborious process of measuring odor concentration (OC), identifying odorous substances, and quantifying odor concentration are technical bottlenecks in odor reduction. This study innovatively constructed a machine learning (ML) model to predict OC based on key odorous components. Over 400 gas samples were collected from the whole pig manure management chain in different regions, and 128 odor components were determined. The prediction results showed that extreme random tree regression ML had superior predictive performance for OC, with a better determination coefficient (R-2 > 0.8) and fewer features. 20 key odor substances out of over 100 components were the important features contributing to OC based on the Shapley additive explanation. Dimethyl sulfide, ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, ethyl sulfide, acetylene, and hexaldehyde were found to have the most significant impact on OC. This method can be easily extended to other types of farms, such as cattle and chicken, and provides a scientific basis for the research and development of qualitative and quantitative odorous substances and equipment for the rapid determination of odor concentration.

AB  - Wildlife predation on livestock remains a global challenge for both smallholders and biodiversity conservation. Using in-person semi-structured interviews, we investigated the mammal predators of livestock and domestic animals at smallholder properties in the eastern Brazilian Amazonia. Smallholders raised between zero and four livestock species and the type of livestock raised at these properties was the most important determinant of mammal predation. Across all properties, six domestic species (cattle, chicken, dog, duck, horse and pig) were reported to be predated by 11 terrestrial mammal species. Chicken was the most frequently reported domestic animal and prey, with 87% of smallholders raising chicken, which were reported to be predated by nearly all (n = 9) of the mammal predator species. Terrestrial mammals were reported as problematic in two-thirds of properties. The most frequently cited problematic predator species was the small-bodied opossum (Didelphis sp.), whereas most predators including large-bodied species such as jaguar (Panthera onca) and puma (Puma concolor) were cited as problematic in less than 15% of interviews. Capacity building and environmental education are likely to be key to ensuring smallholders can adapt and implement effective management solutions to reduce possible negative human-wildlife interactions.

AB  - The wide diversity of species and the remarkable variation in morphological features that allow plants to adapt to a wide range of terrestrial environments is a fact that highlights the fundamental and crucial role of plants in the field of biodiversity studies. Currently, research on leaf classification is limited and in its early stages. A novel classification system based on laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) technology was proposed in this paper, integrated with machine learning for real-time, in situ detection and analysis of leaves. Four representative leaf samples-Ilex chinensis, Camellia japonica, Cinnamomum camphora, and Osmanthus fragrans-were subjected to spectral analysis and machine learning techniques. Spectral analysis revealed distinct spectral lines corresponding to elements such as Ca, Al, Mg, Na, and Fe, alongside common elements including C, N, and O. Principal component analysis (PCA) was employed to reduce the dimensionality of the spectral data, and the first 13 principal components used in this study captured 98.76% of the total variance. Following this, support vector machine (SVM), backpropagation artificial neural network and convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms were applied for machine learning on the principal components to develop leaf recognition classification models. Through comparison, the CNN algorithm, boasting a classification accuracy of up to 94.44%, was ultimately selected. The models established by SVM and back propagation artificial neural network achieved accuracy of only 83.33% and 90.00%, respectively. The results suggest that integrating LIBS with machine learning is an effective and precise approach for leaf classification, offering promising applications in biodiversity research.

AB  - As atmospheric CO2 concentration continues to increase, plants using CO2 as raw materials for photosynthesis will inevitably be affected, which in turn affects the life history and behavior of herbivorous insects. Our previous research has shown increased food intake and aggravated damage of western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis to kidney bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) caused by elevated CO2 (eCO(2)), however the molecular mechanism of this phenomenon is unclear. In this study, the comparative transcriptome analysis combined with corresponding phenotypic changes were studied to reveal the molecular mechanism of interaction between F. occidentalis and P. vulgaris under eCO(2). Inferred from the results, eCO(2) had different degrees of inhibition to the defense responses caused by thrips infestation in P. vulgaris leaf sap based on nutrients, plant hormones and secondary metabolites, making P. vulgaris leaves less resistant to thrips under eCO(2) compared to ambient CO2 (aCO(2)). Besides, the contents of glucose, trehalose, triglycerides and free fatty acids in F. occidentalis adults increased significantly after feeding on the P. vulgaris leaf sap with significantly increased soluble sugars content under eCO(2), which might lead to glucolipid metabolic disorders and increased food intake of F. occidentalis adults. The results indicated that decreased plant defense of P. vulgaris and increased food intake of F. occidentalis adults were combined to aggravate the thrips damage under eCO(2), providing a theoretical basis for future occurrence trend of thrips under eCO(2).

AB  - Camellia fascicularis is a Camellia specie with extremely small populations and unique to Yunnan Province. This study aimed to analyze the genetic diversity of C. fascicularis populations using polymorphic SSR markers. Eighty four samples of eight natural populations were tested for genetic diversity using fourteen SSR markers. The numbers of alleles detected at single polymorphic loci using 14 SSR markers were 2-8, and a total of 68 alleles were identified in this study, with an average allele number of 4.8571 per locus. The average Shannon's information index I was 1.0925, indicating that C. fascicularis has a high diversity. The percentages of polymorphic loci (PPB) of the eight populations of C. fascicularis were 42.86 %-100 %. There were significant differences in genetic parameters among different populations, and the polymorphisms were all high. The gene flow (Nm) values ranged from 0.0503 to 0.9820, with an average value of 0.5440 < 1. Genetic structure analysis showed that the eight C. fascicularis populations were roughly divided into three groups. Genetic variation occurred mainly within populations, with intra-populations genetic variation accounting for 49.95 % of the total variation. It was found that C. fascicularis has a high genetic diversity, and its rich genetic diversity may be due to the diverse habitat diversity of its distribution area and the long evolutionary history of the species. There was almost no gene exchange among natural populations, and the level of population differentiation was low.

AB  - The study of animal behaviour is important for the development of husbandry and management practices for zoo-housed species. Yet, data are typically only collected during daylight hours, aligning with human work schedules rather than animal activity patterns. To remedy this, 24 h data collection is needed. This study investigated the behaviour of a captive flock of lesser flamingos to understand temporal changes in their time-activity patterns. Two remote camera traps were placed around the birds' outdoor enclosure and one within the indoor house. Counts of birds visible within specific enclosure zones were recorded from photographic data. Behaviour was defined as active or inactive, and modified Spread of Participation Index (SPI) was used to calculate enclosure zone occupancy. Results indicated that lesser flamingos are active overnight, and to a similar amount as in the daytime. Proportions of birds observed as active were significantly higher at later times of the day (i.e., dusk) when compared to the number of active birds in the morning. Enclosure usage was diverse and indoor and outdoor zones could be used by different numbers of birds at different times of the day. Variation in enclosure usage may indicate the changing needs of the flamingos when housed indoors overnight and when they have night-time access to an outdoor enclosure. This research has identified the need for further research into the nocturnal behaviour and space use of lesser flamingos and suggests the need for 24 h research in captive birds, and other zoo-held species, especially when species are locked indoors or face behavioural restriction overnight due to biosecurity measures surrounding zoonoses outbreaks, e.g., Avian Influenza.

AB  - Understanding the evolution of plant defenses against herbivores requires identifying the benefits and costs of defense. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the benefits and costs of hydrogen cyanide (HCN) defense against herbivory on white clover (Trifolium repens) are temperature dependent. We first tested how temperature affected HCN production in vitro, and then examined how temperature influenced the efficacy of HCN defense of T. repens against a generalist slug (Deroceras reticulatum) herbivore using no-choice and choice feeding trial assays. To understand how temperature affected the costs of defense, plants were exposed to freezing, and HCN production, photosynthetic activity, and ATP concentration were quantified. HCN production increased linearly from 5 degrees C to 50 degrees C, and cyanogenic plants experienced reduced herbivory compared to acyanogenic plants only at warmer temperatures when fed upon by young slugs. Freezing temperatures induced cyanogenesis in T. repens and decreased chlorophyll fluorescence. Cyanogenic plants experienced lower ATP levels than acyanogenic plants due to freezing. Our study provides evidence that the benefits of HCN defense against herbivores are temperature dependent, and freezing may inhibit ATP production in cyanogenic plants, but the physiological performance of all plants recovered quickly following short-term freezing. These results contribute to understanding how varying environments alter the benefits and costs of defense in a model system for the study of plant chemical defenses against herbivores.

AB  - The mechanism by which p32 protein increases during capacitation in boar spermatozoa is unknown. This manuscript shows a new mechanism of induction of p32 in boar spermatozoa: the proteolysis of the phosphorylated and glycosylated form of SPACA1.Protein tyrosine phosphorylation (PY) induction is associated with sperm capacitation. We previously showed that calcium-sensing receptor (CASR) inhibition by NPS2143 induces the 32 kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein (p32) in boar spermatozoa. We showed that NPS2143 induced an increase in p32 and loss of acrosomal integrity in live and dead spermatozoa in capacitating conditions (Tyrode's complete medium); the p32 rise occurred in dead spermatozoa, as shown by flow cytometry sorting. EGTA addition blunted the increase in p32, the loss of acrosomal integrity, and the increase in dead spermatozoa induced by NPS2143, indicating that the effects of NPS2143 are calcium-dependent. Mass spectrometry was used to identify which tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were induced by NPS2143, but only serine/threonine-phosphorylated proteins were found; among these, SPACA1 was identified with different molecular weights (18, 32, and 35-45 kDa). We confirmed tyrosine phosphorylation of SPACA1 at 32 and 35-45 kDa by immunoprecipitation and co-localization of PY and SPACA1 in the presence of NPS2143 by immunofluorescence. The molecular weight of SPACA1 (35-45 kDa) decreased after treatment with peptide-N-glycosidase F, indicating that this protein is N-glycosylated. The soybean trypsin inhibitor (STI), a serine protease inhibitor, suppressed the appearance of p32 and SPACA1 (30 and 32 kDa) induced by NPS2143. Also, 8-Br-cAMP and A23187 treatments induced an increase in p32 and SPACA1 (30-32 kDa) and a parallel induction of the acrosome reaction. These findings suggest that CASR inhibition induces loss of acrosomal integrity and proteolysis of the glycosylated and phosphorylated SPACA1 (35-45 kDa) resulting in a SPACA1 rise at 32 kDa (p32).

AB  - Skeletal muscle is the main edible part of meat products, and its development directly affects the yield and palatability of meat. Sea buckthorn oil (SBO) contains plenty of bioactive substances and has been recognized as a potential functional food product. The study aimed to explore the effects and possible mechanisms of SBO on sheep primary myoblast proliferation and myogenic differentiation. The results implied that SBO exhibited a pro-proliferative effect on primary myoblasts, along with up-regulated proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and Cyclin D1/cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) abundances. And, SBO promoted myotube formation by increasing the expression of myogenin. Meanwhile, we found that SBO inhibited the expression of miRNA-292a. Moreover, the regulatory effect of SBO on myogenic differentiation of myoblasts was attenuated by miRNA-292a mimics. Of note, SBO activated protein kinase B (Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway and augmented glucose uptake and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) content, which might be attributed to AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation. Additionally, the results were shown that SBO increased the abundance of antioxidative enzymes, including glutathione peroxidase 4 (Gpx4) and catalase. In summary, these data suggested that SBO regulated the proliferation and myogenic differentiation of sheep primary myoblasts in vitro, which might potentiate the application of SBO in muscle growth.

AB  - Simple Summary The animals that held the greatest importance in the economy of a medieval and early modern city were domesticated species, such as cattle, pigs, goats and sheep. These animals were used as sources of meat, bone, horn and leather in crafting items for daily use; however, skeletal remains belonging to wild animals are also encountered during archaeological research. The purpose of this article was to determine the role of wild animals in the economy of a historical city on the basis of research conducted in Wroclaw. The base material consists of bone remains belonging to various species, as well as items manufactured from the leather, horn and bones of wild animals. The collected information was compared with the current state of historical research. It turned out that the analysis confirmed the fact that wild animals played a small but constant role in the economy of medieval and early modern Wroclaw from the 11th to the 17th century. The rare use of such materials might indicate occasional breaching of hunting laws and limitations functioning until the 15th c., the characteristics of the local environment with its low amount of wild game and the elite characteristics of wild animal meat and products. The purpose of this article was to determine the role of wild animals in the economy of a historical city on the basis of archaeological and cultural layers of medieval and early modern Wroclaw from the 11th to the 17th century. Archaeozoological analyses were applied, mainly encompassing the percentage share of particular animal species and the research of material culture, i.e., items manufactured from bones, antlers and hides of wild animals. The collected data were compared with written sources. As a result of the following analysis, a low but stable frequency of bone remains in urban layers and is evidence for occasional breaching of the medieval hunting laws by burghers, possibly driven by the opportunity to sell meat and other wild animal products on the markets. Moreover, the relatively low amounts of items made from bones, antlers and wild animal leather may indicate low availability or seasonality (shed antler) of the materials, which might have indirectly raised the product price. Additionally, the area around Wroclaw did not feature large forest complexes, which are habitats of wild game, thus explaining the low frequency of wild animal remains in the archaeozoological material.

AB  - Hsp90 is an important molecular chaperone that facilitates the maturation of client proteins. It is a homodimer, and its function depends on a conformational cycle controlled by ATP hydrolysis and co-chaperones binding. We explored the binding of co-chaperone Sbal to yeast Hsp90 (yHsp90) and the associated conformational change of yHsp90 in the pre- and post-ATP hydrolysis states by double electron-electron resonance (DEER) distance measurements. We substituted the Mg(II) cofactor at the ATPase site with paramagnetic Mn(II) and established the binding of Sba1 by measuring the distance between Mn(II) and a nitroxide (NO) spin-label on Sba1. Then, Mn(II)-NO DEER measurements on yHsp90 labeled with NO at the N-terminal domain detected the shift toward the closed conformation for both hydrolysis states. Finally, Mn(II)-Mn(II) DEER showed that Sba1 induced a closed conformation different from those with just bound Mn(II)center dot nucleotides. Our results provide structural experimental evidence for the binding of Sba1 tuning the closed conformation of yHsp90.

AB  - HIV-1 Tat continues to play an important role in the development of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), which persist in 15-55% of people living with HIV even with virological control. In the brain, Tat is present on neurons, where Tat exerts direct neuronal damaging effects by, at least in part, disrupting endolysosome functions, a pathological feature present in HAND. In this study, we determined the protective effects of 17 alpha-estradiol (17 alpha E2), the predominant form of estrogen in the brain, against Tat-induced endolysosome dysfunction and dendritic impairment in primary cultured hippocampal neurons. We demonstrated that pre-treatment with 17 alpha E2 protected against Tat-induced endolysosome dysfunction and reduction in dendritic spine density. Estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha) knockdown impairs the ability of 17 alpha E2 to protect against Tat-induced endolysosome dysfunction and reduction in dendritic spine density. Furthermore, over-expressing an ER alpha mutant that fails to localize on endolysosomes impairs 17 alpha E2's protective effects against Tat-induced endolysosome dysfunction and reduction in dendritic spine density. Our findings demonstrate that 17 alpha E2 protects against Tat-induced neuronal injury via a novel ER alpha-mediated and endolysosome-dependent pathway, and such a finding might lead to the development of novel adjunct therapeutics against HAND.

AB  - Simple Summary Isoorientin is an excellent antioxidant and regulator of lipid metabolism. We added this drug to the in vitro medium of porcine embryos and found a significant increase in the developmental rate and quality of the embryos.Abstract Isoorientin (ISO) is a natural lignan glycoside flavonoid found in various plants, including Charcot and Stonecrop. ISO exhibits diverse physiological and pharmacological effects, such as antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective, antiviral, antianxiety, and anti-myocardial ischaemic properties, as well as lipid metabolism regulation. This study investigated the impact of ISO supplementation on oxidative stress and lipid accumulation in porcine early embryos, along with its underlying mechanisms. Porcine embryos were cultured in vitro under different concentrations of ISO (0, 1, 10, and 100 nM). The results revealed that 10 nM ISO significantly enhanced the blastocyst rate and total embryonic cell count in vitro. ISO-treated embryos exhibited reduced reactive oxygen species levels and elevated glutathione levels compared to the untreated group. In addition, ISO treatment significantly increased the expression of the key antioxidant regulator Nrf2, improved mitochondrial function, and reduced lipid droplet accumulation. Concurrently, early embryo autophagy and apoptosis levels decreased. Furthermore, ISO treatment upregulated antioxidant-related genes (SOD1, SOD2, and CAT) and mitochondrial biogenesis related genes (NRF1, NRF2, and SIRT1), while downregulating lipid synthesis-related genes (SREBP1 and FASN). Additionally, lipid hydrolysis-related genes (ACADS) were elevated. These findings collectively suggest that ISO may facilitate early embryonic development in pigs by ameliorating oxidative stress and lipid metabolism.

AB  - A recommender system is a tool designed to suggest relevant items to users based on their preferences and behaviors. Collaborative filtering, a popular technique within recommender systems, predicts user interests by analyzing patterns in interactions and similarities between users, leveraging past behavior data to make personalized recommendations. Despite its popularity, collaborative filtering faces notable challenges, and one of them is the issue of grey-sheep users who have unusual tastes in the system. Surprisingly, existing research has not extensively explored outlier detection techniques to address the grey-sheep problem. To fill this research gap, this study conducts a comprehensive comparison of 12 outlier detection methods (such as LOF, ABOD, HBOS, etc.) and introduces innovative user representations aimed at improving the identification of outliers within recommender systems. More specifically, we proposed and examined three types of user representations: 1) the distribution statistics of user-user similarities, where similarities were calculated based on users' rating vectors; 2) the distribution statistics of user-user similarities, but with similarities derived from users represented by latent factors; and 3) latent-factor vector representations. Our experiments on the MovieLens and Yahoo!Movie datasets demonstrate that user representations based on latent-factor vectors consistently facilitate the identification of more grey-sheep users when applying outlier detection methods.

AB  - Plants have evolved direct and indirect defences against herbivores, which may come at a cost to other plant functions. Many plants can uptake and deposit large amounts of silicon within plant tissue, creating structures which can reduce herbivore performance. Silicon uptake can increase plant defenses against herbivores, but it has also been shown to trade-off with defensive phenolic compounds due to interference with jasmonic acid (JA) signaling. Additionally, plants can recruit predacious insects with extrafloral nectar (EFN), a sugar secretion not involved in pollination. It is currently unclear whether silicon uptake reduces other putative defences associated with the JA pathway, like EFN production. We used faba bean (Vicia faba) to identify potential trade-offs between silicon accumulation, phenolic content, and EFN production. We grew four genotypes of faba bean that varied in tannin content in control soil, or soil supplemented with silicon. After five weeks of growth, we exposed plants to either a buffer or methyl jasmonate (MeJA) solution to simulate an herbivory response. We measured EFN production at 24 and 48 hours after treatment, and harvested leaves to quantify silicon and phenolic content. We found silicon supplementation, but not MeJA treatment, increased foliar silicon concentration. Silicon supplementation did not affect foliar phenolic content or EFN sugar content. Silicon concentration (ppm) and MeJA treatment did not decrease foliar phenolic content or EFN sugar content. However, we found an interaction between silicon concentration (ppm) and MeJA treatment with EFN sugar content: across MeJA-treated plants, we detected a positive association between foliar silicon concentration and the amount of sugar (mg) in EFN. This study is the first to show MeJA can interact with leaf silicon concentration to alter EFN response, with the potential for cascading effects on other trophic levels.

AB  - Simple Summary:& nbsp;The health of piglets, especially the health of the gastrointestinal tract, is subject to severe stress during weaning. The use of antibiotics can help piglets to counteract the negative effects of this period. However, the use of antibiotics as growth promoters can increase the risk of antibiotic resistance. For this reason, antibiotic replacement products are sought to promote gut health. We tested the commercial product GreenFIS(R) (New Feed Team Ltd., Lodi, Italy), a blend of natural substances acknowledged as beneficial for gut health, at two levels of inclusion, compared to a control diet, on 60 piglets. No differences were recorded between diets regarding the growth performance. The gut histological analysis performed on some animals did not reveal any difference between diets. Microbiological analyses were also performed on the feces and the piglets fed GreenFIS(R) showed a higher number of a group of bacteria positively associated with starch utilization. After the post-weaning trial, a digestibility study was conducted on six pigs randomly chosen for each treatment. The addition of GreenFIS(R) to the diet led to higher digestibility compared to the control, although it did not reveal, in the excellent hygienic conditions of the experimental farm, a positive effect on the gut heath.& nbsp;The weaning period is a stressful period for the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of piglets. This work aims to evaluate the effects of the commercial polyphenol-based product GreenFIS(R) on: (1) GIT health and performance of 60 weaned piglets; (2) digestibility in 18 growing pigs. Three diets were tested: a control diet (C), C plus 2.5 g of GreenFIS(R)/kg C (T1), and C plus 5 g of GreenFIS(R)/kg C (T2). After the post-weaning trial three piglets per treatment were sacrificed for the GIT histological analysis. No differences between diets were recorded in terms of growing performance or clinical and biochemical blood parameters. The GIT histological analysis did not show any indicators of inflammation for any of the groups. The feces of the two extreme treatments (C and T2) were analyzed for microbiota, revealing a greater presence of the Ruminococcus bromii group, positively associated with starch degradation, in T2. In the second experiment six pigs per treatment were randomly chosen for the digestibility study. The inclusion of GreenFIS(R) at both levels led to a higher fecal digestibility of gross energy (86.2%, 89.1%, and 89.5%, for C, T1, and T2, respectively) and crude protein (87.0%, 90.2%, and 90.0%). In conclusion, the additive did not improve, in the excellent experimental hygienic conditions, the gut health, but it did increase nutrient digestibility.

AB  - Phthalates are a class of compounds that have found widespread use in industrial applications, in particular in the polymer, cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries. While ingestion, and to a lesser degree inhalation, have been considered as the major exposure routes, especially for higher molecular weight phthalates, dermal exposure is an important route for lower weight phthalates such as diethyl phthalate (DEP). Assessing the dermal permeability of such compounds is of great importance for evaluating the impact and toxicity of such compounds in humans. While human skin is still the best model for studying dermal permeation, availability, cost and ethical concerns may preclude or restrict its use. A range of alternative models has been developed over time to sub-stitute for human skin, especially in the early phases of research. These include ex vivo animal skin, human reconstructed skin and artificial skin models. While the results obtained using such alternative models correlate to a lesser or greater degree with those from in vivo human studies, the use of such models is nevertheless vital in dermal permeation research. This review discusses the alternative skin models that are available, their use in phthalate permeation studies and possible new avenues of phthalate research using skin models that have not been used so far.

AB  - The body temperature of pigs is closely related to pig diseases. People have tried various methods to use infrared thermography technology for extracting pig body temperature. However, infrared images may vary with changes in pig body temperature. When the body temperature of pigs is abnormal, these body temperature extraction methods using only infrared images may not be able to locate the target area, thereby failing to complete the body temperature extraction operation. Taking the eye area as the target area, this study proposes a pig eye area temperature extraction algorithm based on registered images. This algorithm first aligns the infrared image with the visible image using registration techniques, then uses an object detection model to locate the pig's eye area on the visible light image, and finally completes the temperature extraction by combining the infrared temperature matrix. This algorithm uses visible images to locate the pig's eye area, fully utilizing the fact that visible images do not change with temperature, which can effectively avoid the problem that the pig's eye area may not be located by using only infrared images when the pig's body temperature is abnormal. To apply the pig eye detection model to pig farms and facilitate deployment on edge devices, this study conducts lightweight modification to the model by introducing the Ghost module to modify the neck and head structures of YOLOv7tiny. The improved algorithm effectively reduces the number of parameters and computational cost. Compared with the original YOLOv7-tiny model, the mean average precision decreased by 0.8%, while the number of parameters and computational cost decreased by 42.3% and 31.5%, respectively. The detection speed of the improved algorithm on the Jetson Nano (an edge device) increased by 12.8%. The improved algorithm achieves a balance between detection accuracy and detection speed, making it more suitable for deployment on edge devices.

AB  - The foliar glands of Passiflora are generally known as extrafloral nectaries, which, unlike floral nectaries, are not related to pollination. The present study describes and analyzes the foliar glands found in Passiflora ceratocarpa and Passiflora quadrangularis, in order to confirm their identity as extrafloral nectaries and discuss the taxonomic and ecological implications of these structures. The study material was collected in the metropolitan region of Belem (Brazil) and submitted to standard protocols for the analysis of plant anatomy by light and scanning microscopy, as well as histochemical testing. The extrafloral nectaries of the two species are anatomically very similar, including a multiseriate palisade epidermis, a nectariferous parenchyma consisting of voluminous, thin-walled cells, and predominantly phloematic vascularization. Their chemical composition is also highly similar, and includes sugars, and lipids. Five ant genera were found visiting the two Passiflora species, of which Camponotus was the most abundant, being found on both the study species. (c) 2021 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Colostrum, the first secretion of mammalian breasts after giving birth, contains a wealth of components believed to have a beneficial effect on human skin, including lactoferrin, immunoglobulin (Ig)A, beta-carotene, fat-soluble vitamins, and zinc. The present study examines the effect of a cosmetic preparation containing 15% lyophilisate of sheep colostrum on acne skin. A group of 27 volunteers with mild or moderate acne applied the cream twice a day for eight weeks. Before and after using the cream, the level of skin hydration, sebum level, and TEWL were measured using a standardized Courage-Khazaka Multi Probe Adapter. The participants also completed a survey rating the effects of using the cosmetic preparation. Regular application of the cream with sheep colostrum resulted in an objective improvement in hydration and TEWL and a reduction in sebum; this is extremely desirable for acne-prone skin. Three-quarters of the participants reported that the tested cream reduced acne lesions (blackheads, papules, pustules, and erythema) by around 40%. Moreover, the cosmetic preparation improved hydration by 40% and reduced seborrhea by 29% in 82% of subjects and kept the skin in good condition in 90%. As the cream improves the hydrobarrier and overall condition of the skin, it could serve as an addition to local acne treatment, e.g., with retinoids.

AB  - The production and use of traditional building materials contribute to environmental pollution and natural resource depletion. Besides, disposal of agricultural, industrial, and construction waste and other solid wastes is a significant contemporary for both developing and developed countries. Consequently, this study comprehensively examines sustainable construction materials (SCMs) sourced from waste materials. It analyzes 190 peerreviewed papers, evaluating their properties, engineering suitability, and their impacts on the environment, economy, and society. Findings reveal that most SCMs have good engineering performance, yet improvements are needed in demonstrating their environmental (33.3%), economic (40%), and social sustainability (73.3%). Also, most SCMs are in experimental stages, requiring further research on human toxicity, long-term savings, maintenance costs, and other vital indicators. This review highlights some of the current challenges facing SCMs to promote their further studies, reduce non-renewable energy consumption and solid waste recycling, and facilitate their application in green buildings.

AB  - Simple Summary This meta-analysis examines the impact of neutering on sheep production and quality, focusing on performance, carcass characteristics, and meat quality. It is observed that castrated sheep (wethers) exhibit enhanced daily weight gain and meat tenderness compared to intact rams. Furthermore, wethers display characteristics of a slenderer carcass with potentially elevated muscle content. By utilizing gene expression analysis, the research sheds light on genes associated with metabolic pathways and fat metabolism, indicating their involvement in fat formation. These results advocate for the practice of castration in sheep farming to enhance growth and meat quality. Additionally, the identified alterations in gene expression offer valuable insights for further exploration of castration's influence on muscle development in sheep.Abstract Objective: The study aimed to investigate the effects of castration on performance, carcass characteristics, and meat quality in sheep, as well as explore the expression of key genes related to metabolic pathways and muscle growth following castration. Methods: A meta-analysis approach was utilized to analyze data from multiple studies to compare the performance, carcass characteristics, and meat quality of castrated sheep (wethers) with intact rams. Additionally, protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, differential gene expression (DEG) interactions, Gene Ontology (GO) terms, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways were examined to identify molecular mechanisms associated with fat metabolism and muscle development in sheep tails. Results: The analysis revealed that castrated sheep (wethers) exhibited improved average daily gain, increased tenderness, lower backfat thickness, and a tendency for greater loin muscle area compared to intact rams. This suggests that castration promotes faster growth and results in leaner carcasses with potentially higher muscle content. Furthermore, the identification of downregulated DEGs like ACLY, SLC27A2, and COL1A1 and upregulated DEGs such as HOXA9, PGM2L1, and ABAT provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying fat deposition and muscle development in sheep. Conclusions: The findings support the practice of castration in sheep production as it enhances growth performance, leads to leaner carcasses with higher muscle content, and improves meat tenderness. The identified changes in gene expression offer valuable insights for further research into understanding the impact of castration on muscle development and fat metabolism in sheep. This meta-analysis contributes to the knowledge of molecular mechanisms involved in fat deposition in sheep, opening avenues for future investigations in livestock fat metabolism research.

AB  - Negative interactions between humans and elephants are known to have serious consequences, resulting in loss of life and deterioration in the quality of life for both species. Reducing human-elephant conflicts (HEC) is essential for elephant conservation as well as social justice. Non-lethal electric fences placed around villages or communities are a widely used intervention to mitigate HEC. Such barriers act as non-excludable and non-subtractable resources-i.e., public goods-that must be maintained collectively by beneficiaries or the State. Despite being fairly effective when well maintained, most such fences in northeast India are poorly maintained. This leads to our central question: why are some fences well maintained and others poorly maintained? We studied 19 such fences using qualitative comparative analysis, Ostrom's social-ecological systems framework, and a grounded theory approach, incorporating qualitative social science tools. We found that, contrary to our hypothesis, the functionality of fences cannot be predicted based on the design of the fence, whether or not the community made cash payments, or ethnic homogeneity or leadership in the village. Instead, we found there are three potential pathways of maintenance: (1) a community maintainer, (2) the community self-organizes, and (3) the Forest Department. Maintenance occurs when there is a congruence between perceived costs and benefits for the entity responsible for fence maintenance. These costs and benefits are diverse, including not just material benefits but intangibles like goodwill, sense of safety, social standing, and a feeling of fairness. We highlight these factors and provide recommendations for practitioners and policy.

AB  - Goat milk is rich in a variety of nutrients that are important for intestinal health and disease prevention. However, the role of exosomes in goat milk remains to be elucidated. This study investigated for the first time the therapeutic efficacy and molecular underlying mechanisms of mature milk exosomes (M-exo) and goat colostrum exosomes (C-exo) on dextran sodium sulfate-induced ulcerative colitis (UC) in mice. The findings demonstrate that M-exo and C-exo significantly improved physiological indices, suppressed the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, and diminished oxidative stress and apoptosis in UC mice. Moreover, C-exo and M-exo restored the intestinal barrier function, remodeled the gut microbiota, and improved metabolite composition in the feces of colitis mice. In conclusion, goat milk exosomes ameliorate UC in mice, which provides a basis for the development of functional food applications for the prevention and treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.

AB  - Goat milk contains a rich source of nutrients, especially unsaturated fatty acids. However, the regulatory mechanismof milk fat and fatty acid synthesis remains unclear. Stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) is the key enzyme catalyzingmonounsaturated fatty acid synthesis and is essential for milk lipid metabolism. To explore milk lipid synthesis mechanismin vivo,SCD1-knockout goats were generated through CRISPR/Cas9 technology for thefirst time.SCD1deficiency did not influence goatgrowth or serum biochemistry. Plasma phosphatidylcholines increased by lipidomics afterSCD1knockout in goats. Whole-bloodRNA-seq indicated alterations in biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acid synthesis, cAMP, ATPase activity, and Wnt signalingpathways. InSCD1-knockout goats, milk fat percentage and unsaturated fatty acid levels were reduced but other milk componentswere unchanged. Milk lipidomics revealed decreased triacylglycerols and diacylglycerols levels, and the differential abundance oflipids were enriched in glycerolipid, glycerophospholipids, and thermogenesis metabolism pathways. In milk fat globules, theexpression levels of genes related to fatty acid and TAG synthesis including SREBP1 were reduced. ATP content and AMPK activitywere promoted, and p-p70S6K protein level was suppressed inSCD1-knockout goat mammary epithelial cells, suggesting that SCD1affected milk lipid metabolism by influencing AMPK-mTORC1/p70S6K-SREBP1 pathway. The integrative analysis of geneexpression levels and lipidomics of milk revealed a crucial role of SCD1 in glycerolipids and glycerophospholipids metabolismpathways. Our observations indicated that SCD1 regulated the synthesis of milk fat and unsaturated fatty acid in goat by affectinglipid metabolism gene expression and lipid metabolic pathways. Thesefindings would be essential for improving goat milknutritional value which is beneficial to human health.

AB  - Introduction: Pythons are a well-studied model of postprandial physiological plasticity. Consuming a meal evokes a suite of physiological changes in pythons including one of the largest documented increases in post-feeding metabolic rates relative to resting values. However, little is known about how this plasticity manifests in the brain. Previous work has shown that cell proliferation in the python brain increases 6 days following meal consumption. This study aimed to confirm these findings and build on them in the long term by tracking the survival and maturation of these newly created cells across a 2-month period. Methods: We investigated differences in neural cell proliferation in ball pythons 6 days after a meal with immunofluorescence using the cell-birth marker 5-bromo-12 '-deoxyuridine (BrdU). We investigated differences in neural cell maturation in ball pythons 2 months after a meal using double immunofluorescence for BrdU and a reptilian ortholog of the neuronal marker Fox3. Results: We did not find significantly greater rates of cell proliferation in snakes 6 days after feeding, but we did observe more new cells in neurogenic regions in fed snakes 2 months after the meal. Feeding was not associated with higher rates of neurogenesis, but snakes that received a meal had higher numbers of newly created nonneuronal cells than fasted controls. We documented particularly high cell survival rates in the olfactory bulbs and lateral cortex. Conclusion: Consuming a meal stimulates cell proliferation in the brains of ball pythons after digestion is complete, although this effect emerged at a later time point in this study than expected. Higher rates of proliferation partially account for greater numbers of newly created non-neuronal cells in the brains of fed snakes 2 months after the meal, but our results also suggest that feeding may have a mild neuroprotective effect. We captured a slight trend toward higher cell survival rates in fed snakes, and survival rates were particularly high in brain regions associated with olfactory perception and processing. These findings shed light on the relationship between energy balance and the creation of new neural cells in the brains of ball pythons.

AB  - Simple Summary Breeding programs in pigs have been very successful in recent decades, although the different selection directions have resulted in highly variable growth rates between the genotypes. Simultaneously, the absorption of nutrients may also show differences subject to the genotype of the animals. As far as the development of the feeding strategies is concerned, the main objective is to maximize profitability; therefore, future methods in swine nutrition must also support the different growth rates of the animals through the improved absorption of nutrients. One of the most common tools used to reduce feed costs is the optimization of the dietary lysine-to-energy ratio, because lysine is the first limiting amino acid for swine, and energy content is one of the most defining parameters of their diet. Pigs of different genetic potential can be classified with a high accuracy in respect of their crude protein and amino acid digestive capacity. Consequently, the ileal digestibility of crude protein and amino acids in growing pigs of different genotypes should serve as a basis for the development of genotype-specific feeding strategies. Further studies are needed to identify the differences in the crude protein and amino acid digestibility of cross-bred pigs with different genetic potentials. The first aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of different dietary lysine (LYS) to energy (DE) ratios on the apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of crude protein (CP) and selected amino acids (AA) in growing pigs (40-60 kg) of different genotypes. The second aim was to classify genotypes into groups based on the AID of CP and AAs. The trials were conducted on a total of 90 cross-bred barrows (30 animals/genotype) in two replicates. Before the trial series, the experimental animals (average initial body weight (BW) = 40.9 & PLUSMN; 8.5 kg) were surgically fitted with post valve T-cannula (PVTC). The diets were formulated with six different total LYS/DE ratios. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) was added to the diets (5 g/kg) as an indigestible marker. Based on our results, it can be concluded that the LYS/DE ratio of the diets affected the AID of the CP and AA in different ways by each genotype (p < 0.05). It can also be concluded that pigs of different genetic potential can be classified with a high accuracy (91.7%) in respect of their CP and AA digestive capacity. Our results indicate the development of genetic-profile-based swine nutrition technologies as a future direction.

AB  - Simple Summary Goat sperm membrane is vulnerable to damage through ice crystal formation during cryopreservation. Recently, carboxylated epsilon-poly-l-lysine (CPLL) has been regarded as one of the novel cryoprotectants. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of CPLL on the post-thaw quality of goat cryopreserved sperm. It was observed that supplementation of CPLL to the cryopreservation medium enhances the motility, acrosome and membrane integrity, mitochondrial function, ATP production, and anti-oxidant defense mechanisms of post-thaw sperm while decreasing MDA level, total ROS production, and apoptosis. Therefore, CPLL can be supplemented during cryopreservation of goat sperm to maintain post-thaw quality and antioxidant activity. Carboxylated epsilon-poly-l-lysine (CPLL), a novel cryoprotectant, can protect the sperm membranes by inhibiting ice crystal formation during the cryopreservation process. The present study was conducted to investigate the consequence of CPLL supplementation on the post-thaw quality of cryopreserved goat sperm. For this, different doses (0, 0.5%, 1%, 1.5%, and 2%; v/v) of CPLL were added to the cryopreservation medium, and the motility, membrane and acrosome integrity, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), ATP level, ROS production, anti-oxidant defense system, malondialdehyde (MDA) level, and apoptosis in post-thaw sperm were evaluated. It was observed that the addition of 1% CPLL significantly (p < 0.05) increased the total motility, membrane integrity, acrosome integrity, and catalase (CAT) activity of post-thaw sperm compared to those of control and other CPLL doses. The ATP content was observed significantly (p < 0.05) higher in 0.5% and 1% CPLL, however, the SOD activity and progressive motility were significantly (p < 0.05) increased by adding CPLL at 1% and 1.5% level. Moreover, the addition of CPLL at 1% dose not only showed a lower percentage of apoptosis, but also significantly (p < 0.05) increased the MMP while reducing ROS production and MDA levels compared to those of other CPLL doses and/or control. Therefore, it is clear that the supplementation of 1% CPLL can remarkably improve the post-thaw goat sperm motility, membrane and acrosome integrity, antioxidant abundance, mitochondrial potentials, and ATP supply by protecting the sperm from cryodamage and undergoing apoptosis. These findings will provide novel insights into sperm cryobiology.

AB  - A large variety of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been discovered through high-throughput sequencing technology and some have been demonstrated to play important roles in lipid metabolism regulation. In our study, we found a highly expressed lncRNA (lnc-LLMA, liver lipid metabolism-associated lncRNA) in the liver of Duroc pigs, which was enriched in the nucleus. It displays potent tissue specificity among different pig breeds. Overexpression of lnc-LLMA can cause a decline in intracellular triglyceride (TG) levels and increases in ATP and mitochondrial DNA levels in pig primary hepatocytes and HepG2 cells. In addition, the expression levels of MTTP, APOB, CPT1 alpha, and other genes were increased by overexpression of lnc-LLMA. It downregulated expression of G6Pase and SREBP1 genes. Chromatin isolation by RNA purification (ChRIP) experiments demonstrated that microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP) and glycogen synthase 2 (GYS2) were the potential interacting proteins of lnc-LLMA. The overexpression of the GYS2 gene rescued the decreasing intracellular TG levels caused by the increase of lnc-LLMA. Similarly, overexpression of MTTP was also able to save the lnc-LLMA-induced decrease in intracellular TG. Our study demonstrated that this novel lncRNA was closely related to lipid metabolism and affected lipid transport and mitochondrial function through MTTP and GYS2. Our results provided a new direction for further studying the effect of lncRNA on lipid metabolism regulation.

AB  - Simple Summary Gastrointestinal nematode (GIN) infections are serious parasitosis that cause disease in grazing livestock. The impact of these parasites is associated with important economic losses related to decreased production and the cost of anthelmintic treatments. Previous studies have reported that GIN infections, mainly those caused by Teladorsagia circumcincta, are associated with specific IgA levels. The goal of this study was to characterize IgA levels in naturally infected sheep belonging to Assaf, Castellana, and Churra breeds in different samples (blood, nasal secretions, and saliva). The association between IgA and fecal egg count, breed, and age was also studied. The infection risk according to age and/or breed was measured by a multilevel random intercept model. As a result, the model predicted that breed was not a factor influencing the risk of infection, while age was determinant. On the other hand, this study concludes that nasal secretions could be a useful sample to detect natural infections in young animals from any of the breeds included in this study. Further studies in sheep belonging to other breeds would be interesting in the future to verify this test. Specific IgA antibody has been shown to play an important role in resistance to gastrointestinal nematode (GIN) infections in sheep, particularly in Teladorsagia circumcincta parasitosis. In some breeds, negative associations have been shown between IgA levels and worm burden in experimentally infected sheep. In the present study, we have studied the relationship between IgA levels in naturally infected sheep (582 ewes in total; 193 younger than one year old and 389 older than one year old) and fecal egg count (FEC) in the Assaf, Castellana, and Churra breeds. ELISA assays were performed to measure IgA levels against the somatic antigen of T. circumcincta third larval stage (L-3) and a 203-amino-acid fragment of the protein disulfide isomerase from the same GIN species. A multilevel random intercept model was developed to predict the infection risk according to age or breed. Spearman's correlation rank was used for statistical analysis. The prediction model showed that breed was not an influential factor in this study, although the Assaf breed could be considered slightly more susceptible than the others. In addition, age affected the infection risk, with the young ewes more susceptible to infection than the adult groups, except for the Castellana breed, whose risk of infection was similar at all ages. The most significant positive association was found between FEC and IgA measured in the nasal secretions of young ewes using both antigens (Rho = 0.5; p = 0.00); the correlation of FEC with IgA in serum was moderately significant (Rho = 0.306; p = 0.00). Comparing both antigens, the protein disulfide isomerase antigen was less reactive than the somatic antigen from L-3. In conclusion, under natural conditions, specific IgA against GIN was positively associated with FEC in sheep, with nasal secretions from young animals being the sample where this association is stronger, which, therefore, could be used as a marker of infection in further studies.

AB  - Simple Summary Agonic aspiration of blood should be seen as a critical welfare problem in the slaughter of pigs, as it reflects a moment of pain, distress, and fear for the animal during its time of death. Our survey focused on assessing whether lesions of agonic blood aspiration could be used as a valuable indicator to guide the official veterinarian to immediately apply the necessary measures to ensure good practices of animal welfare at slaughter. Ineffective electrical stunning of pigs has been associated with the incidence of lung lesions suggestive of agonic blood aspiration at postmortem inspection. However, for the first time, the findings from this study indicate that aspiration of blood may be related to factors other than agonic status during slaughter process. One of them being that horizontal bleeding may favour slaughter technopathies. This process should not be neglected, as it may result in lesions resembling those resulting from the agonic lung aspiration of blood-which is not related to an agonic status. Agonic aspiration of blood (AAB) may result from an inadequate exsanguination with accidental trachea severing, that can be favoured by ineffective stunning of pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus). This study aimed to evaluate AAB as an animal-based indicator of electrical stunning ineffectiveness, which could be used by official veterinarians during the post-mortem inspection of pigs. Information on 3584 finishing pigs was collected at a Portuguese abattoir that performs head-to-body electrical stunning with horizontal bleeding. Of them, 15.5% of the pigs presented signs of ineffective stunning. AAB lung lesions were found in 27.8% of lungs. Despite what was predicted, a strong correlation was found between well stunned animals and the presence of blood lesions in lungs (p = 0.006). Statistical significances were found between pigs' lateral recumbency at the conveyor and the presence of blood affecting one lung. Under the conditions of this study, the authors cannot point to AAB lung lesions as an animal-based indicator of electrical stunning ineffectiveness. Further studies should be conducted to establish a better understanding of the causes of aspiration of blood, in particular how horizontal bleeding may affect the occurrence of similar lesions.

AB  - Anxiety and obesity are prevalent health concerns that are affected by diet in rodents and humans. How diet influences the development and maintenance of anxiety and obesity has been challenging to characterize, in part, due to methodological differences in chosen experimental and control diets. Within the same experiment, anx- iety-and obesity-related effects were characterized in rats fed a Western diet (WD) relative to two control diets. Sixty Long-Evans rats split equally by sex were given standard diet (SD), control (i.e., high-carbohydrate) diet (HCD), or WD from weaning until sacrifice in early adulthood. Anxiety-related behavior was characterized in a modified open field test (mOFT) that allowed for the measurement of defensive behaviors (e.g., hiding within a refuge area), in addition to traditional OF measures (e.g., time in center). Both anxiety-related behaviors and hippocampal CA3 BDNF revealed specific sex differences. Neither adolescent weight gain of male and female rats, nor total body weight in early adulthood, were dependent on administration of HCD or WD, although the WD group consumed the most calories. In males only, administration of either WD or HCD resulted in elevated leptin levels relative to administration of the SD. Results indicate that SDs and HCDs are two distinct types of control diets that can affect comparability of studies and that using an SD might reveal more subtle metabolic changes. Control diet choice should be strongly considered during study design and interpretation, depending on specific research goals. Such studies should include both males and females as these effects are sex-specific.

AB  - Soil potassium (K) spatial heterogeneity was general in tea gardens. Yet, rhizosphere processes of tea plants under soil K spatial heterogeneity is unclear. K heterogeneity was simulated by multi-layer split-root system as follows: both sides had K fertilizer (K+/K+), both sides had no K fertilizer (K0/K0), one side had K fertilizer (K+/K0-K+) and the other side had no K fertilizer (K+/K0-K0). Under K spatial heterogeneity, the differences in rhizosphere processes between the two tea plants (low-K tolerant genotype "1511" and low-K sensitive genotype "1601") were compared. "1511" could maintain relatively stable fine root proportions under different treatments. For "1511" and "1601", the strongest soil K activation abilities of root exudates appeared in K+/K0-K0 and K+/K0-K+, respectively. The available K and slowly available K of the rhizosphere soils in K+/K0-K+ was 14% and 8% less than those in K+/K+ for "1511", but the above form K of the rhizosphere soils in K+/K0-K+ was 8% and 10% higher than those in K+/K+ for "1601". In conclusion, under the spatial K heterogeneity, low-K tolerant tea plant could achieve high K efficiency mainly through the following ways: (1) maintaining good fine root developments; (2) improving the soil K activation in K+/K0-K0 through the secretion of organic acids; (3) promoting the utilization of soil K in K+/K0-K+. Our findings may contribute to the improvement of tea planting patterns and quality in low K tea gardens, and that to understand the interactions between roots and soil of the low K-tolerant genotype tea plants under the condition of K spatial heterogeneity.

AB  - In previous studies, NOX4, PDE11A and GHR genes have been screened as important candidate genes for litter size in sheep by using the GWAS method; however, neither their effects on litter size nor the loci associated with litter size have been identified. In this study, three candidate loci (c.1057-4C > T in NOX4, c.1983C > T in PDE11A and c.1618C > T in GHR) were first screened based on our previous resequencing data of 10 sheep breeds. After the three loci were genotyped using Sequenom MassARRAY technology, we carried out population genetics analysis on the three loci and performed association analysis between the polymorphism of the three loci and the litter size of sheep. The results of population genetics analysis suggested that c.1057-4C > T in NOX4 and c.1983C > T in PDE11A may be subject to natural or artificial selection. The results of association analysis indicated that litter size was significantly associated with c.1057-4C > T in NOX4 and c.1983C > T in PDE11A (p < 0.05) in Small Tail Han sheep, and there was no significant interaction effect between the two loci on the litter size. In summary, c.1057-4C > T in NOX4 and c.1983 C > T in PDE11A can be considered candidate molecular markers for improving litter size in sheep.

AB  - Wildlife detection dog (WDD) programs are increasingly being developed to combat illegal wildlife trafficking. However, there is little scientific research available on how sniffer dogs perform when wildlife parts are hidden during the smuggling process, which hampers the effectiveness of WDD programs. Here, we investigate the ability of WDDs to detect wildlife parts that are hidden in legally traded goods. We employed a smell test using the two most smuggled wildlife parts worldwide: elephant ivory and pangolin scales, in combination with two obfuscation items of plant and animal origin commonly employed by smugglers. We then established the sensitivity of the dogs to the target substances. Our results showed that there was a large variation between the two dogs in their sensitivity to ivory and pangolin scales. However, both dogs were generally less sensitive to ivory compared to pangolin scales, and stronger-smelling obfuscation items could potentially lower the sensitivity of the dogs to the wildlife parts. Our study highlights the potential of dogs to detect hidden wildlife parts, but their effectiveness may depend on other aspects such as training, personality, the health of the dog, the type of wildlife substance, and the obfuscation item used. Given the variability of our findings, WDD programs need to invest in research to optimize the number and type of dogs with the right balance of traits to successfully detect wildlife parts that could potentially be obfuscated during smuggling.

AB  - Although social media is growing rapidly as a news source, including for disseminating conservation information, studies comparing attention given to differing threats to species on social media are almost non-existent. As the amount of attention given to differing threats can influence what people perceive to be important and impact the formation of environmental policies, it is vital that conservationists understand which issues are being discussed online. Using elephants (Loxodonta Africana, Loxodonta cyclotis, and Elephas maximus) as test species, we conducted a content analysis of tweets about elephants posted to Twitter during 2019. According to the global conservation authority, the International Union for Conservation of Nature, the most pressing threats to the conservation of wild elephant populations are habitat loss, human-elephant conflict, and poaching, with the magnitude of each threat differing between the three species of elephants. Our Twitter analysis revealed that these major threats were infrequently discussed, with habitat loss being the most infrequently discussed (<1% of all tweets). Instead, elephant welfare issues, such as tourist elephant rides, were the most frequently discussed topic (23%). Users from non-elephant range countries were the dominant voice on Twitter (72% of tweets with an identifiable location), with these tweets likely to discuss elephant welfare concerns and trophy hunting, which is not a threat to elephant conservation. Conversely, tweets from users from African elephant range countries (14%) were more likely to discuss human-elephant conflict, poaching, and promote elephant tourism. Similarly, users from Asian elephant range countries (13%) were likely to discuss human-elephant conflict and elephant tourism but unlikely to tweet about poaching. Given the relatively low representation of local stakeholders and the limited coverage of key conservation threats, there is a need to ensure that social media discussions do not overly influence decision-makers.

AB  - Intracellular Ca2+ is a key regulator of cell signaling and sperm are not the exception. Cells often use cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+](i)) oscillations as a means to decodify external and internal information. [Ca2+](i) oscillations faster than those usually found in other cells and correlated with flagellar beat were the first to be described in sperm in 1993 by Susan Suarez, in the boar. More than 20 years passed before similar [Ca2+](i) oscillations were documented in human sperm, simultaneously examining their flagellar beat in three dimensions by Corkidi et al. 2017. On the other hand, 10 years after the discovery of the fast boar [Ca2+](i) oscillations, slower ones triggered by compounds from the egg external envelope were found to regulate cell motility and chemotaxis in sperm from marine organisms. Today it is known that sperm display fast and slow spontaneous and agonist triggered [Ca2+](i) oscillations. In mammalian sperm these Ca2+ transients may act like a multifaceted tool that regulates fundamental functions such as motility and acrosome reaction. This review covers the main sperm species and experimental conditions where [Ca2+](i) oscillations have been described and discusses what is known about the transporters involved, their regulation and the physiological purpose of these oscillations. There is a lot to be learned regarding the origin, regulation and physiological relevance of these Ca2+ oscillations.

AB  - Environmental enrichment can provide captive animals with stimuli that increase physical and mental activity. We investigated the extent to which a novel enrichment item, defined as enrichment that individuals have never experienced prior to the study, engages captive cownose stingrays (Rhinoptera bonasus). We hypothesized that stingray interactions with the enrichment item are associated with the novelty of the enrichment item (i.e., time since presentation of the enrichment item, number of weeks exposed to the enrichment), the presence of food, and the number of human visitors at the stingray exhibit. The novelty of the enrichment item and the presence of food were most strongly associated with stingray interactions with the enrichment item. Although stingrays engaged with the enrichment throughout a 5-week period, interactions decreased as the amount of time the enrichment item remained in the water increased during a 60 min period and interactions decreased as the weeks progressed. Furthermore, stingrays had increased interactions when food was present inside the enrichment item. The number of human visitors had a weaker association with stingray interactions with the enrichment item, but during the food-based trials, there were increased interactions with the enrichment when more visitors were present. Our findings suggest that variation in enrichment routines (to maintain novelty) and variation in an enrichment item's use of food may help continue engagement with enrichment items.

AB  - Rhino poaching continues to threaten species survival despite decades-long trade bans, with rhino horn use in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) contributing to global demand. Conservationists have debated over policy alternatives like trade legalization, and insight into TCM stakeholders is needed to support policymaking. The need for more research became made more urgent with China's 2018 decision to initiate the process of legalizing domestic trade. In this study, we conducted a large-scale online survey of TCM consumers in Guangdong province, China. We found that while stigmatization of rhino horn use is limited at present, it is likely to drop further with trade legalization. Prescription usage will be the most likely source of increased rhino horn demand if trade is legalized. Given the terms established in China's 2018 policy document, we stress the importance of engaging constructively with policymakers and TCM stakeholders to influence the process of establishing medical standards and regulatory mechanisms such that clinical access in a future legal trade is stringently controlled.

AB  - With the confrontation of ever increasing complicated working objects and unstructured environments, it is necessary for soft robots to be equipped with diverse intelligent mechanical structures, for example, anisotropically motorial bulk and timely proprio/exteroceptive sensing with programmable morphologies. Owing to abundant pores inside, porous media are promising to host various intelligent functions as interfaces/structures of robots yet challenging because of a limited anisotropic response inherited from a random hierarchical pore distribution. Here, an electron competition between Ga, N, and Pt is found and used to tune the polymerization of a gradient liquid alloy and NH4HCO3-suspended silicone precursor mixture and, thus, decompose gas movements in gradient pore formation under high-temperature heating (120 degrees C). By such a competition-collaboration effect, we present here an interconnected gradient porous structure (GPS) that can serve as an anisotropically robotic motorial bulk. Moreover, the mechanical stiffness and piezoresistive/capacitive property of GPS can be further tuned and reconfigured via so-called self-sucked coating, following solvent erasing. Such new structures provide a dynamic tactile recognition with an ultrabroad sensing range (from 135 Pa to 2.3 MPa) and a reconfigurable biomimetic elephant trunk with monolithic proprioceptive sensing-integrated bulks.

AB  - Pedigree analysis is an important tool for assessing genetic variability and detecting heritage patterns in domestic animals. This study aimed to (1) assess genetic variability, (2) estimate genetic parameters for daily milk yield (DMY), fat content (FC), and protein content (PC), and (3) estimate the impact of inbreeding on the aforementioned dairy traits in Istrian sheep breed. The generation interval was 3.8 years. The average family size per sire and dam was 13.5 and 1.6, respectively. There were 923 female and 282 male founders (f), 105 male and 137 female effective founders (f(e) ), and 72 male and 95 female effective ancestors (f(a) ). A total of 28 sires and 34 dams explained 50% of the genetic variability. The effective number of male and female founder genomes (f(ne) ) was 33 and 53, respectively. Low f(e)/f (0.37 and 0.15), high f(e)/f(a) (1.45 and 1.44), and low f(ne) /f(e) (0.45 and 0.39) for males and females indicated overuse of a small number of animals in reproduction and substantial loss of founder alleles. The heritabilities of MY, FC, and PC were 0.09, 0.03, and 0.06, respectively. Genetic correlations between DMY and FC, DMY and PC, and FC and PC were -0.22, -0.27, and 0.70, respectively. Regression of phenotypes on inbreeding coefficient ( F ) within the animal genetic model revealed negligible inbreeding depression for all traits (p F decreased DMY, FC, and PC by 0.002 kg/day, 0.01%, and 0.002%, respectively).

AB  - Ovarian hormone deprivation is associated with mood disorders, such as depression, and estradiol therapy is significantly more effective than placebos in treating major depression associated with menopause onset. However, the effect of estradiol on neuronal plasticity and its mechanisms remain to be further elucidated. In this study, behavioral assessments were used to examine the antidepressant effect of estradiol in ovariectomized (OVX) B6.Cg-TgN (Thy-YFP-H)-2Jrs transgenic mice on chronic restraint stress (CRS)-induced dendrite and dendritic spine loss; Yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) is characteristically expressed in excitatory neurons in transgenic mice, and its three-dimensional images were used to evaluate the effect of estradiol on the density of different types of dendritic spines. Quantification and distribution of cofilin1 and p-cofilin1 were determined by qPCR, Western blots, and immunohistochemistry, respectively. The results revealed that treatment with estradiol or clomipramine significantly improved depression-like behaviors. Estradiol treatment also significantly upregulated the dendritic density in all areas examined and increased the density of filopodia-type, thin-type and mushroom-type spines in the hippocampal CA1 and elevated the thin-type and mushroom-type spine density in the PFC. Consistent with these changes, estradiol treatment significantly increased the density of p-cofilin1 immunopositive dendritic spines. Thus, these data reveal a possible estradiol antidepressant mechanism, in that estradiol promoted the phosphorylation of cofilin1 and reduced the loss of dendrites and dendritic spines, which of these dendritic spines include not only immature spines such as filopodia-type, but also mature spines such as mushroom-type, and attenuated the depression-like behavior.

AB  - Anaerobic digestion (AD) is a versatile manure management approach that can combine waste treatment, energy generation and nutrient recovery, thus playing a central role in circular economy. The AD process is highly influenced by manure composition which, depending on the source, may contain high loads recalcitrant materials (e.g., lignocellulosic and fibers) or lead to the formation of toxic compounds (e.g., NH3), decreasing the energetic potential of the waste and requiring specific pretreatments to increase its degradability and biogas production. Although there are distinctions in the chemical composition of manure according to animal diets, different manure sources are usually grouped together, leading to a suboptimal performance of both the pretreatment and the AD process. Here, we performed a meta-analysis of 54 studies to evaluate the effects of different pretreatments on different manure types and their effect on methane (CH4) yield and we estimated the energy potential if the appropriate pretreatment is applied to largest manure producing countries. The results showed that chemical and/or biological pretreatments were more effective for omnivore manure (e.g., swine, chicken), while physical and a combination of chemical and physical pretreatments negatively affected CH(4 )production. Physical and/or chemical pretreatments had a positive effect on CH4 yield from herbivore manure (e. g., cattle, horses), while biological pretreatments had a negative effect. The application of the adequate pretreatment can more than double the energy recovered from manure, allowing for an important substitution of fossil fuels, while decreasing operational costs and environmental risks and ultimately improving profitability. The development of pretreatment technologies and their application are strongly related to public policies for sustainable manure management and biogas use and production.

AB  - The production of goat meat is determined by the growth speed of muscle fibers, and the autophagy and apoptosis of myoblast cells is a crucial process in the growth of muscle fibers. The rapid growth of muscle fibers occurs from one month old to nine months old in goats; however, the mechanisms of myoblast cells' autophagy and apoptosis in this process are still unknown. To identify candidate genes and signaling pathway mechanisms involved in myoblast apoptosis and autophagy, we compared the expression characteristics of longissimus dorsi tissues from Wu'an goats-a native goat breed of China-at 1 month old (mon1 group) and 9 months old (mon9 group). Herein, a total of 182 differentially expressed mRNAs (DEGs) in the mon1 vs. mon9 comparison, along with the KEGG enrichments, showed that the PI3K-Akt pathway associated with autophagy and apoptosis was significantly enriched. Among these DEGs, expression of vacuole membrane protein 1 (VMP1)-a key gene for the PI3K-Akt pathway-was significantly upregulated in the older goats relative to the 1-month-old goats. We demonstrated that VMP1 promotes the proliferation and autophagy of myoblasts, and inhibits their apoptosis. The integration analysis of miRNA-mRNA showed that miR-124a was a regulator of VMP1 in muscle tissue, and overexpression and inhibition of miR-124a suppressed the proliferation and autophagy of myoblasts. The PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway was an important pathway for cell autophagy. Additionally, the activator of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, the expression of VMP1, and ULK1 were higher than the negative control, and the expression of mTOR was depressed. The expression of VMP1, ULK1, and mTOR was the opposite when the inhibitor was added to the myoblasts. These results show that the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway promoted the expression of VMP1 and ULK1. By using adenovirus-mediated apoptosis and proliferation assays, we found that that miR-124a inhibits myoblast proliferation and autophagy, and promotes their apoptosis by targeting VMP1. In conclusion, our results indicated that VMP1 was highly expressed in the LD muscle tissues of nine-month-old goats, and that it was regulated by miR-124a to inhibit myoblast cells' apoptosis through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, and to promote proliferation and autophagy. These findings contribute to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in myoblast proliferation, autophagy, and apoptosis.

AB  - This study aimed to compile an inventory of the main diseases affecting these species in Mayo-Kebbi Ouest Province in Chad. A survey was conducted between 6 May and 7 August 2024 using a cascade data collection method identifying 310 farmers and 19 veterinarians with an average of 10 to 12 years of experience in advising and supporting livestock practices The data collected included socio-professional characteristics of participants, livestock practices, and geospatial information. These data were managed in Excel and analysed with R. The analysis involved descriptive and inferential statistical techniques including binary logistic regression resulting in maps illustrating disease hotspots and livestock systems. Thematic maps, tables and charts with a 5% significance threshold visualised risk areas and associated livestock practices. The results show a predominance of male farmers (91.9%) from 20 different ethnic groups. The livestock systems identified include data on farming divided into extensive (14.8%), mixed (0.3%) and semi-intensive farming (84.8%). On average, farms have 41 cattle and 25 goats. Animal diseases were found to cause 29.5% reduction in herd productivity. Transhumance (p=0.000356) and animal disease incidence (p=0.03) were observed as significant risk factors associated with the abandonment of livestock farming. The main diseases recorded in cattle include contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (11.3%), bovine tuberculosis (2.5%), foot-and-mouth disease (45.0%), bluetongue (1.7%) and disease with symptoms reminiscent of rinderpest (2.5%). For goats, notable diseases include brucellosis (3.8%), lumpy skin disease (19.2%), goat plague (7.9%) and Rift Valley fever (6.3%). These findings confirm the importance of a geospatial epidemiological surveillance tool for monitoring animal diseases in this region.

AB  - Boron improves bone growth and maintenance by stimulating osteoblast and osteoclast activity. However, excess boron ions inhibit cellular activity. Therefore, the use of boron in biomaterials requires to control the ion-releasing behavior. Calcium phosphate invert glasses (PIGs) exhibit excellent chemical durability, and their ion-releasing behavior can be controlled by its structure. In this work, B2O3 was substituted for TiO2 in CaO-P2O5-TiO2 invert glasses (PIG-Bs), and the structures and dissolution behaviors were evaluated. B2O3 in PIG-Bs takes the form of BO4 tetrahedra and preferentially bonds with the terminal pyrophosphate to form P-O-B-bonds. The degree of glassification and chemical durability of PIG-Bs decreased as the B2O3 content increased because the P-O-B bonds were weaker than the P-O-Ti bonds. Borate ions release amount of PIG-Bs were indicated lower than threshold concentration for negative effect on cells, so PIG-Bs are expected to improve cellular activity without an inhibitory effect.

AB  - BACKGROUNDPears, as an important cash crop, are currently facing great issues due to unsustainable management practices. Cover cropping is a sustainable management strategy that can improve soil fertility and increase fruit yield, while it may also stimulate greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, synergizing multiple indicators to achieve sustainable development is critical. This study introduces a new management system, namely the planting and mowing of ryegrass as a livestock feed system (PRSS), and analyzes its impact on soil quality, economic benefits, and environmental burdens. RESULTSOur results indicated that PRSS could increase soil pH from 5.08 to 5.48 and decrease the content of soil alkali-hydrolyzable nitrogen, total phosphate, and available phosphate (26.96-59.89%) while also enhancing yield (+38.51%) compared with the traditional natural grass management system (TMS). The average soil methane fluxes in PRSS were 72.67 & mu;g m(-2) day(-1), higher than those of TMS (61.28 & mu;g m(-2) day(-1)). However, the gross primary production was lower than TMS (-37.24%), and no significant difference was observed in soil nitrous oxide fluxes. In different scenarios, the total profit of PRSS mode 1 (mowing ryegrass and selling to a livestock company) and PRSS mode 2 (mowing ryegrass and feeding own sheep) were 10 706.21 $ ha(-1) and 26 592.87 $ ha(-1) respectively. These values are respectively2.36 times and 5.85 times higher than that of TMS. The total global warming potential of TMS (18.19 t CO2-eq ha(-1)) was 1.29 t CO2-eq ha(-1) higher and 2.89 t CO2-eq ha(-1) lower than that of PRSS mode 1 and mode 2 respectively. CONCLUSIONCompared with traditional natural grass, planting and mowing ryegrass in pear orchards can optimize soil properties, increase fruit yield, and reduce global warming potential. Different modes can greatly increase revenue but have varying impacts on environmental burdens. These findings can help rebuild the links between farmland and specialized livestock production, contributing to sustainable development in the pear industries. & COPY; 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Superior-quality brush hair, also called Type III hair, can be obtained only from the cervical spine region of skin tissues of Yangtze River Delta white goats. The formation of superior-quality brush hair is controlled by a series of critical genes and related signaling pathways. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are ubiquitous endogenous noncoding RNAs that regulate many biological and physiological processes in mammals. However, little is known about the potential regulatory role of circRNAs in superior-quality brush hair formation. Here, we analyzed circRNA sequencing data from cervical spine region skin tissues of normal-quality brush hair goats and superior-quality brush hair goats and then selected and identified the differentially expressed circRNA circCOL1A1. To investigate the regulatory role and mechanism of action of circCOL1A1, goat hair follicle stem cells (gHFSCs) were cultured and treated with a circCOL1A1 overexpression plasmid and small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Functional assays showed that circCOL1A1 knockdown promoted the proliferation and differentiation of gHFSCs cultured in vitro but inhibited stem cell apoptosis, whereas overexpression of circCOL1A1 suppressed stem cell proliferation and differentiation and induced apoptosis. Bioinformatics analysis combined with dual-luciferase reporter assays and RNA binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP) verified that, mechanistically, circCOL1A1 could bind miR-149-5p directly and then relieve its inhibitory effect on CMTM3 to further control the CMTM3/AR axis. Collectively, our results reveal a novel regulatory pathway for the formation of superior-quality brush hair and indicate that circCOL1A1 plays a role in gHFSC growth and superior-quality brush hair formation by targeting the miR-149-5p/CMTM3/AR axis.

AB  - The demand for economic benefits has led to an increase in the proportion of high-concentrate (HC) feed in the ruminant diet, resulting in an increased incidence of subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA). During SARA, a high concentration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) translocated in the rumen induces a systemic inflammatory response. Inflammatory diseases, such as endometritis and mastitis, are often associated with SARA; however, in sheep, the mechanism of the effect of SARA on the endometrium has rarely been reported. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate, for the first time, the influence of LPS translocation on endometrial tight junctions (TJs) during SARA in sheep. The results showed that LPS and TNF alpha levels in the ruminal fluid, serum, and endometrial tissue supernatant during SARA increased, transcription levels of TLR4, NF kappa B, and TNF alpha in the endometrium increased, the protein expression level of claudin-1 in the endometrium increased, and the protein expression level of occludin decreased. 17 beta-estradiol (E-2) inhibits claudin-1 protein expression and promotes occludin expression, and progesterone (P-4) promotes claudin-1 protein expression and inhibits occludin protein expression. E-2 and P-4 regulate claudin-1 and occludin protein expression through their receptor pathways. Here, we found that LPS hindered the regulatory effect of E-2 and P-4 on endometrial TJs by inhibiting their receptor expression. The results of this study indicate that HC feeding can cause SARA-induced LPS translocation in sheep, increase susceptibility to systemic inflammation, induce the endometrial inflammatory response, and cause endometrial epithelial TJ damage directly and/or by obstructing E-2 and P-4 function. LPS translocation caused by SARA has also been suggested to induce an endometrial inflammatory response, resulting in endometrial epithelial barrier damage and physiological dysfunction, which seriously affects ruminant production. Therefore, this study provides new evidence that SARA is a potential factor that induces systemic inflammation in ruminants. It provides theoretical support for research on the prevention of endometritis in ruminants.

AB  - Simple Summary The pepper weevil is an economically important pest that causes major damage to fruits of chili pepper varieties selected for consumption. However, the impact of this pest on wild and ornamental peppers remains unknown. Therefore, we studied the effect of chili domestication on the feeding and oviposition behavior of pepper weevil when exposed to wild chili, ornamental varieties, and varieties used for consumption. More specifically, we examined how changes in fruit and flower size, fruit thickness, spiciness level, and fruit position as a result of the domestication of chili peppers affected their susceptibility to this specialist pepper pest. In addition, we recorded that fruits and flowers from wild and ornamental plants were less susceptible to pepper weevil attacks than those from chili varieties selected for consumption. Our results have important implications for chili pepper breeders and could guide the selection of new resistant varieties against this pest. The pepper weevil, Anthonomus eugenii, Cano (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), is one of the most destructive pests of chili pepper. It causes extensive damage on varieties selected for consumption. However, the occurrence of this pest on wild and ornamental peppers remains unknown. We investigated the consequences of chili domestication on the feeding and oviposition of A. eugenii on fruits and flowers. We used plants of one wild accession, Bird Eye Pepper, five ornamental varieties (Pops Yellow, Black Pearl, Sedona Sun, Chilli Chilli, and Salsa Deep), and two domesticated varieties selected for consumption (Scotch Bonnet and Jalapeno). First, we characterized the plants according to their fruit and flower sizes, pericarp thickness, capsaicin level, fruit position, and flower color. Then, we evaluated the susceptibility of fruits and flowers to A. eugenii. Overall, domestication increased fruit and flower sizes and pericarp thickness, altered capsaicin levels, and altered fruit position and flower color. Weevils laid more eggs and caused more feeding damage on varieties selected for consumption than on wild and ornamental plants. Our results add to the growing literature on the consequences of crop domestication on herbivores. This knowledge could be integrated into breeding programs to select varieties resistant against the pepper weevil.

AB  - Background and aims - Campanula vardariana (Campanulaceae) is a critically endangered endemic chasmophyte with a single population situated in the west of Turkey. Very little is known about the reproductive biology of C. vardariana and more information is needed to develop a sound conservation strategy for this endemic species.
   Material and methods - Floral traits such as flower morphology, nectar, and sugar concentration, as well as pollen viability and stigma receptivity were measured in different floral phases. We observed insect visitations to the flowers and identified pollinators. Additionally, we investigated the effect of cross and self-pollination on fruit and seed production.
   Key results - The flowers of C. vardariana are protandrous. The length of the styles, which were 8.74 mm during the pollen loading phase, reached 11.35 mm during the pollen presentation phase. The visitor observations made on the C. vardariana flowers revealed 11 visitor species from 5 families: 5 Halictidae, 3 Apidae, and one species each from Megachilidae, Colletidae, and Bombyliidae. Lasioglossum spp. touched the anthers and stigma using several parts of their bodies and were significant pollinators of C. vardariana. Under natural conditions, the mean number of seeds per fruit was around 60 after cross pollination, while no fruits were formed when pollinators were excluded.
   Conclusion - Campanula vardariana is entirely dependent on pollinators for its reproductive success, and bees, especially Halictidae and to a lesser extent Apidae, play an important role. Campanula vardariana is restricted to cracks in calcareous rocks and its population is threatened by goat overgrazing and mining activities (quarry formation). Since seed production is abundant in this population, anthropogenic activities currently form the biggest threat to its existence.

AB  - The ability to automatically recognize sheep breeds holds significant value for the sheep industry. Sheep farmers often require breed identification to assess the commercial worth of their flocks. However, many farmers specifically the novice one encounter difficulties in accurately identifying sheep breeds without experts in the field. Therefore, there is a need for autonomous approaches that can effectively and precisely replicate the breed identification skills of a sheep breed expert while functioning within a farm environment, thus providing considerable benefits the industry-specific to the novice farmers in the industry. To achieve this objective, we suggest utilizing a model based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) which can rapidly and efficiently identify the type of sheep based on their facial features. This approach offers a cost-effective solution. To conduct our experiment, we utilized a dataset consisting of 1680 facial images which represented four distinct sheep breeds. This paper proposes an ensemble method that combines Xception, VGG16, InceptionV3, InceptionResNetV2, and DenseNet121 models. During the transfer learning using this pre-trained model, we applied several optimizers and loss functions and chose the best combinations out of them. This classification model has the potential to aid sheep farmers in precisely and efficiently distinguishing between various breeds, enabling more precise assessments of sector-specific classification for different businesses.

AB  - In goat farming, buck fertility is important because most farms typically retain one buck for every few dams. Follicle stimulating hormone is essential for regulating fertility and varies in its beta subunit (FSH beta), which provides specificity. To explore the possibilities of using FSH11 gene as candidate marker, this study was aimed to investigate polymorphism at FSH11 gene by PCR-RFLP assay and association of polymorphic variants of FSH11 with body weights, scrotal and seminal attributes in indigenous goats. The amplicons of 313 bp was obtained for FSH11 gene from the DNA of 35 Barbari, 26 Black Bengal, and 31 Sirohi bucks, respectively. FSH11 was found to be monomorphic in all three breeds using PCR-RFLP analysis. Using PstI and HinfI restriction enzymes, respectively, it revealed a single type of uncut banding pattern of 313 bp and single fragment of 157 bp. Sequence analysis also confirmed absence of PstI recognition site, revealing an A>G substitution at nucleotide position 4531. Frequency of AA genotype and A allele was found to be maximum. All traits, with the exception of mass motility, showed a significant breed effect. Based on the findings, it was concluded that targeted region of FSH11 gene was fixed goat population under investigation.

AB  - The presented study is aimed at establishing the physicochemical composition, the fatty acid profile of ewe's milk from 3 breeds grown in the Rhodopes. The qualitative assessment of the fat fraction was made based on the following indicators: lipid preventive score, atherogenic and thrombogenic index and the ratio between hyper-and hypocholesterolemic fatty acids.Biologically active fatty acids were synthesized to a different degree by ewe in milk and this was determined by their breed differences - the cis isomers of oleic acid have the highest concentration in MRB, omega-3 fatty acids - RTB, CLA in Karakachan breed, trans vaccenic acid - RTB and oleic acid in MRB. The evaluation of the parameter's lipid preventive score, atherogenic and thrombogenic index in the sheep's milk give us an idea of its usefulness, with the lowest values obtained for the lipid preventive score in the milk of the RTB from 14.40 to 15.86 g/ 100g product, the atherogenic index in the milk of the MRB from 1.47 to 1.81, the thrombogenic index in the milk of the Karakachan breed from 1.80 to 1.99, the ratio between hyper-and hypocholesterolemic fatty acids has the highest content in the milk of the MRB from 0.70 to 0.85.The presented multidisciplinary research offers new knowledge in the field of healthy nutrition in humans, in particular the consumption of essential fatty acids.The purpose of the research is to study and evaluate the content of biologically active and trans fatty acids in sheep milk from three breeds - Karakachan, Rhodope Tsigai and Middle Rhodope and to establish their daily consumption in humans through milk.

AB  - Conserving landscape connections among favorable habitats is a widely used strategy to maintain populations in an increasingly fragmented world. A species can then exist as a metapopulation consisting of several subpopulations connected by dispersal. Our study focuses on the importance of human-wildlife coexistence areas in maintaining connectivity among primary habitats of small ungulates within and outside protected areas in a large landscape in central India. We used geospatial information and species presence data to model the suitable habitats, core habitats, and connectivity corridors for four antelope species in an similar to 89,000 km(2) landscape. We found that about 63% of the core habitats, integrated across the four species, lie outside the protected areas. We then measured connectivity in two scenarios: the present setting, and a hypothetical future setting-where habitats outside protected areas are lost. We also modelled the areas with a high risk of human-influenced antelope mortality using eco-geographical variables and wildlife mortality records. Overall, we found that the habitats in multiple-use forests play a central role in maintaining the connectivity network for antelopes. Sizable expanses of privately held farmlands and plantations also contribute to the essential movement corridors. Some perilous patches with greater mortality risk for species require mitigation measures such as underpasses, overpasses, and fences. Greater conservation efforts are needed in the spaces of human-wildlife coexistence to conserve the habitat network of small ungulates.

AB  - Zoo animal husbandry is a skill that should be developing constantly. In theory, this should lead to an improvement of zoo animal survivorship over time. Additionally, it has been suggested that species that are at a comparatively higher risk of extinction in their natural habitats (in situ) might also be more difficult to keep under zoo conditions (ex situ). Here, we assessed these questions for three zoo-managed rhinoceros species with different extinction risk status allocated by the IUCN: the "critically endangered" black rhino (Diceros bicornis), the "vulnerable" greater one-horned (GOH) rhino (Rhinoceros unicornis), and the "near threatened" white rhino (Ceratotherium simum). Comparing zoo animals & GE;1 year of age, the black rhino had the lowest and the white rhino the highest survivorship, in congruence with their extinction risk status. Historically, the survivorship of both black and white rhino in zoos improved significantly over time, whereas that of GOH rhino stagnated. Juvenile mortality was generally low and decreased even further in black and white rhinos over time. Together with the development of population pyramids, this shows increasing competence of the global zoo community to sustain all three species. Compared to the continuously expanding zoo population of GOH and white rhinos, the zoo-managed black rhino population has stagnated in numbers in recent years. Zoos do not only contribute to conservation by propagating ex situ populations, but also by increasing species-specific husbandry skills. We recommend detailed research to understand specific factors responsible for the stagnation but also the general improvement of survivorship of zoo-managed rhinos.

AB  - Camellias cultivars collections, comprising an exquisite array of meticulously bred and curated camellia varieties, emerged as indispensable elements within the resplendent 19th century gardens that adorned landscapes across the globe. The heart of Terra Nostra Garden, nestled within the captivating surroundings of the Furnas volcano on S. Miguel Island (Azores, Portugal), started in the year 1782 as an enchanting fishpond garden, strategically positioned in front of the summer house belonging to the esteemed Thomas Hickling, the American vice-consul. Soon this garden was enlarged and embellished withspecies from several continents. This tradition continued during all the 19 century with the th Viscount Duarte Borges da Camara Medeiros (1848-1872) and his son the Marquis Antonio Borges Medeiros Dias da Camara e Sousa (1872-1913). In 1933, the 12 hectares property was acquired by the Terra Nostra Society, led by Vasco Bensaude and increased to 12.5 hectares. In 1935, the current Terra Nostra Garden Hotel was inaugurated and, two years later, the Terra Nostra Society reopened the botanical garden attached to the hotel, now called Terra Nostra Garden. Beginning in 1982, the Head Gardener embarked on a transformative journey, dedicating his expertise to the meticulous renovation and expansion of numerous botanical collections nestled within the garden's enchanting landscapes. Amongst the remarkable transformations, the revered camellias collection received special attention, as it underwent a comprehensive rejuvenation process under his skilful guidance. The recent publication of a global digital dataset of Camellia names provides the opportunity to publish the dataset of Camellia species, hybrids and its cultivars currently cultivated at Terra Nostra Garden with their validated names.

AB  - Recent field surveys revealed a new population of the Menglian Paddy Frog (Micryletta menglienica) from Son La Province, northwestern Vietnam based on molecular and morphological analyses. The species has been listed as "Data Deficient" in the IUCN Red List. To date, knowledge about the natural history of this species is scarce, including data on its dietary ecology. Using the stomach-flushing method, we analyzed stomach contents of 45 individuals (21 males and 24 females) from a total of 52 captured frogs because stomachs of six males and one female (13.5%) were empty. The food spectrum of M. menglienica comprises 12 types of 691 prey items (687 invertebrate items and four unidentified items), belonging to six insect orders, larvae and Araneae. Similar to other species of the family Microhylidae, M. menglienica is also identified as an ant (Formicidae)-termite (Rhinotermitidae) eating specialist with distinctly higher percentages of occurrence frequency (F = 65 %), number of prey items (N = 80 %), and importance (Ix = 75 %) than those of remaining types. The Simpson diversity index of 0.939 shows a high abundance of food prey in the wild, and the Evenness index of 0.536 suggests biased consumption of feeding selection for M. menglienica.

AB  - Oxytocin receptor (OXTR) activity in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is critical for pair bonding in prairie voles. Oxtr knockdown or pharmacological blockade in this region prevents mating-induced partner preferences, while overexpression facilitates bonding. However, no prior work has selectively interrogated or manipulated Oxtrexpressing neurons during dynamic bonding behaviors. We have developed an Oxtr-P2A-Cre prairie vole line that enables direct access to specific Oxtr neural populations. We utilized Oxtr-P2A-Cre prairie voles to express inhibitory DREADDs selectively in OXTR-expressing NAc neurons. Inhibiting NAc OXTR cells during initial cohabitation did not affect subsequent partner preference formation; however, inhibition during partner preference testing increased partner-directed huddling behavior, revealing a complex role for these neurons in social interactions. Using a viral tracing approach, we found that NAc OXTR-expressing neurons receive prominent inputs from the medial prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, and hypothalamus, while projecting strongly to the ventral pallidum, ventral tegmental area, and lateral hypothalamus. Our cell-type-specific manipulation reveals how oxytocin receptor signaling in the NAc may modulate emotional state and facilitate the complex social behaviors underlying monogamous pair bonding. This Cre-recombinase approach demonstrates the utility of cell-type-specific targeting for elucidating oxytocin neural circuit mechanisms regulating emotional and social behavior in prairie voles.

AB  - The trophectoderm cells of pigs metabolize glucose through glycolytic biosynthetic pathways and utilize glutamine via glutaminolysis as an alternate carbon source to maintain TCA cycle flux during the peri-implantation period.
   During the peri-implantation period of pregnancy, the trophectoderm of pig conceptuses utilize glucose via multiple biosynthetic pathways to support elongation and implantation, resulting in limited availability of pyruvate for metabolism via the TCA cycle. Therefore, we hypothesized that porcine trophectoderm cells replenish tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates via a process known as anaplerosis and that trophectoderm cells convert glutamine to alpha-ketoglutarate, a TCA cycle intermediate, through glutaminolysis. Results demonstrate: (1) that expression of glutaminase (GLS) increases in trophectoderm and glutamine synthetase (GLUL) increases in extra-embryonic endoderm of conceptuses, suggesting that extra-embryonic endoderm synthesizes glutamine, and trophectoderm converts glutamine into glutamate; and (2) that expression of glutamate dehydrogenase 1 (GLUD1) decreases and expression of aminotransferases including PSAT1 increase in trophectoderm, suggesting that glutaminolysis occurs in the trophectoderm through the GLS-aminotransferase pathway during the peri-implantation period. We then incubated porcine conceptuses with C-13-glutamine in the presence or absence of glucose in the culture media and then monitored the movement of glutamine-derived carbons through metabolic intermediates within glutaminolysis and the TCA cycle. The C-13-labeled carbons were accumulated in glutamate, alpha-ketoglutarate, succinate, malate, citrate, and aspartate in both the presence and absence of glucose in the media, and the accumulation of C-13-labeled carbons significantly increased in the absence of glucose in the media. Collectively, our results indicate that during the peri-implantation period of pregnancy, the proliferating and migrating trophectoderm cells of elongating porcine conceptuses utilize glutamine via glutaminolysis as an alternate carbon source to maintain TCA cycle flux.

AB  - BACKGROUNDHeat stress (HS) is known to exert negative effects on the poultry and breeding industry, resulting in severe economic losses. Bile acids (BAs), an important component of bile, play a crucial role in improving the production performance of livestock and poultry, alleviating stress injury, and ensuring the health of livestock and poultry. At present, porcine BAs are widely used because of their therapeutic effects on HS; however, it remains unclear whether the same effects are exerted by sheep BAs, which are different from porcine BAs and have different compositions. In this study, we compared the anti-HS effects of porcine BAs and sheep BAs in the diet by establishing an HS model of chicks and investigating the chicken performance, HS-related genes' expression, oxidative stress markers, jejunal histoarchitecture, inflammatory cytokines' expression, jejunal secreted immunoglobulin A concentration, and cecal bacterial flora. RESULTSThe results showed that the addition of sheep BAs to the diet increased the average daily weight gain and the feed conversion ratio of chicks. Under HS, sheep BAs were more effective than porcine BAs in improving the activities of lactate dehydrogenase and glutamic pyruvic transaminase in serum and the content/activity of malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase, and reduced glutathione in serum and tissue, in reducing the messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of heat shock proteins (HSP60, HSP70, and HSP90) in the liver and jejunum, and in improving the histological structure and the expression of tight junction proteins (occludin and zonula occludens-1) and enriching intestinal bacterial flora. However, porcine BAs were significantly inferior to sheep BAs in reducing the mRNA expression of inflammatory factors (interleukin-6, interleukin-1 beta, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha). CONCLUSIONThe effect of sheep BAs was more significant than porcine BAs was in alleviating HS injury in chicks, suggesting that sheep BAs have great potential as new feed nutrition and health additive to improve poultry production performance and prevent HS.

AB  - The Argidae comprise a monophyletic taxon of primarily herbivorous Hymenoptera that exhibits a broad variety of behaviors and morphologies, along with an intimate relationship with host plants. Due to the limited knowledge of general patterns and gaps in understanding various aspects of this family, we investigated the global scientific literature on this topic. Our main objective was to conduct a scientometric analysis and a systematic review of this family to: (i) characterize and quantify research spatially and temporally; (ii) identify the principal authors of the published papers; (iii) categorize the types of studies; (iv) evaluate the interaction networks between sawflies and their host plants; (v) advise on future directions for studies on Argidae. Our results support previous studies indicating that Argidae larvae feed exclusively on eudicots, with a diversified number of host plants. We found an increase in the number of publications about the family over the last two decades. However, the scientific literature is geographically and taxonomically unbalanced, with the most diverse biogeographic Neotropical and Palearctic regions still being neglected. Our results highlight that the number of specialist authors on this topic is low, but substantial collaboration webs and the emergence of new researchers in recent years were detected. Considering these findings, future research should focus on regions with gaps in knowledge of fauna and encourage the training of new specialists in this group. As herbivores, sawfly larvae play an important role in ecosystem balance; therefore, investigations into the most diverse research trends are encouraged.

AB  - The ultimate fate of Graafian follicles is ovulation or atresia which relies on the highly coordinated processes of apoptosis and autophagy in ovarian cells. Long non-coding RNA maternally expressed gene 3 (LncRNA MEG3), miR-23a, and apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) are factors associated with autophagy. However, whether these factors can regulate autophagy in cumulus cells (CCs) of yak is unclear. Here, miR-23a over-expression upregulated the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio and Beclin1 abundance while reducing p62 accumulation (p < 0.05). The monodansylcadaverine assay exhibited a marked increase in punctate green fluorescence, and the GFP-LC3B displayed increased yellow fluorescence (p < 0.05). The opposite effect was observed for miR-23a inhibitors. Furthermore, miR-23a overexpression downregulated the abundance of ASK1 mRNA and total ASK1 protein (t-ASK1), whereas miR-23a inhibitors up-regulated them (p < 0.05). The effects of miR-23a overexpression on ASK1 phosphorylated protein at serine 845 (P-845), total JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) (t-JNK) and the JNK phosphorylated protein (p-JNK) were similar to those of t-ASK1 but elicited the opposite effect on ASK1 phosphorylated protein at serine 967 (P-967) (p < 0.05). We further demonstrated that ASK1 expression can be silenced by small-interfering RNA (siRNA), which had no significant effect on t-JNK abundance (p > 0.05) but significantly suppressed the p-JNK expression (p < 0.05). Silencing ASK1 significantly improved Beclin1 abundance and the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio, but decreased p62 abundance (p < 0.05). An increase in yellow GFP-LC3B puncta and green MDC staining puncta were observed (p < 0.05). Overexpression of LncRNA MEG3 significantly increased the expression of t-ASK1, P-845, and JNK and decreased the abundance of P-967 and miR-23a (p < 0.05). In addition, miR-23a upregulation reduced the number of the TUNEL-positive cells, and the addition of 8 mM 3-methyladenine (3-MA) reversed this downregulation (p < 0.05). Similar trends were observed for the Bax/ Bcl2 ratio and cleaved-caspase3 abundance. In summary, miR-23a promotes autophagy by inhibiting ASK1 abundance, which reduces apoptosis of yak CCs. This effect can be inhibited by LncRNA MEG3, which has implications for decreasing abnormal Graafian follicular atresia and maintaining development.

AB  - Hippophae rhamnoides subsp. sinensis is extensively found in China, where the annual precipitation ranges from 400 to 800 mm. It is the most dominant species in natural sea buckthorn forests and the primary cultivar for artificial ecological plantations. Additionally, it exhibits significant nutritional and medicinal value, making it a renowned eco-economic tree species. Despite extensive research into its ecological functions and health benefits, the mitochondrial genome of this widespread species has not yet been published, and knowledge of the mitochondrial genome is crucial for understanding plant environmental adaptation, evolution, and maternal inheritance. Therefore, the complete mitochondrial genome was successfully assembled by aligning third-generation sequencing data to the reference genome sequence using the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform and Nanopore Prometh ION technologies. Additionally, the gene structure, composition, repeat sequences, codon usage bias, homologous fragments, and phylogeny-related indicators were also analyzed. The results showed that the length of the mitochondrial genome is 454,489 bp, containing 30 tRNA genes, three rRNA genes, 40 PCGs, and two pseudogenes. A total of 411 C-to-U RNA editing sites were identified in 33 protein-coding genes (PCGs), with higher frequencies observed in ccmFn, ccmB, nad5, ccmC, nad2, and nad7 genes. Moreover, 31 chloroplast-derived fragments were detected, accounting for 11.86% of the mitochondrial genome length. The ccmB, nad4L, and nad7 genes related to energy metabolism exhibited positive selection pressure. The mitochondrial genome sequence similarity between H. rhamnoides subsp. sinensis and H. tibetana or H. salicifolia was 99.34% and 99.40%, respectively. Fifteen shared gene clusters were identified between H. rhamnoides subsp. sinensis and H. tibetana. Phylogenetically, the Rosales order showed close relationships with Fagales, Fabales, Malpighiales, and Celastrales. These findings provide fundamental data for exploring the widespread distribution of H. rhamnoides subsp. sinensis and offer theoretical support for understanding the evolutionary mechanisms within the Hippophae genus and the selection of molecular breeding targets.

AB  - Chemical synapses of shared cellular origins have remarkably heterogeneous structures, but how this diversity is generated is unclear. Here, we use three-dimensional (3D) electron microscopy and artificial intelligence algorithms for image processing to reconstruct functional excitatory microcircuits in the mouse hippocampus and microcircuits in which neurotransmitter signaling is permanently suppressed with genetic tools throughout the lifespan. These nanoscale analyses reveal that experience is dispensable for morphogenesis of synapses with different geometric shapes and contents ofmembrane organelles and that arrangement of morphologically distinct connections in local networks is stochastic. Moreover, loss of activity increases the variability in sizes of opposed pre- and postsynaptic structures without disrupting their alignments, suggesting that inherently variable weights of naive connections become progressively matched with repetitive use. These results demonstrate that mechanisms for the structural diversity of neuronal synapses are intrinsic and provide insights into how circuits essential for memory storage assemble and integrate information.

AB  - Simple Summary In temperate regions, sheep demonstrate seasonal reproduction regulated by changes in photoperiod. This regulation is mediated by nocturnal melatonin secretion. However, in equatorial regions, with no photoperiodic changes, sheep tend to breed in all seasons of the year. Despite this, changes in seminal composition or sperm quality have been reported throughout the year. We demonstrated that melatonin concentration in seminal plasma varies between rainy and dry seasons in three Colombian breeds (Colombian Creole, Romney Marsh, and Hampshire). As melatonin can exert direct effects on ram spermatozoa, in this study we hypothesized that melatonin could modulate sperm capacitation in equatorial-located breeds as we had previously reported in seasonal breeds from temperate regions. First, we assayed two media for in vitro capacitation and found that the increment in capacitated and acrosome-reacted sperm was higher in the so-called "cocktail medium" for the three breeds and in rainy and dry seasons. The addition of melatonin to the cocktail medium partially prevented the increase in capacitated spermatozoa from all breeds and during all seasons. This study could help in understanding how melatonin affects ram reproduction in the equatorial photoperiod. In this study, we demonstrated that, in seasonal Mediterranean ovine breeds, supplementing the TALP medium with cAMP-elevating agents (the cocktail medium) is effective for achieving ram sperm capacitation, and that melatonin is able to regulate this phenomenon. We investigated the behavior under capacitating conditions using the TALP and cocktail mediums, and the response to melatonin, of spermatozoa from three sheep breeds (Colombian Creole, Romney Marsh, and Hampshire) subject to the equatorial photoperiod, during the dry and the rainy seasons. The cocktail medium was able to induce sperm capacitation, assayed by chlortetracycline staining and phosphotyrosine levels, to a greater extent than TALP, without a higher loss of viability (membrane integrity and viable spermatozoa without phosphatidylserine (PS) translocation). The addition of melatonin at 100 pM or 1 mu M in the cocktail medium partially prevented the decrease in viability without PS translocation and the increase in capacitated spermatozoa from all breeds, with no significant effect on phosphotyrosine levels. Differences between breeds and seasons were evidenced. This study shows that melatonin is able to exert direct effects on spermatozoa in ovine breeds under equatorial photoperiod conditions, as it does in seasonal breeds located in temperate regions.

AB  - Simple Summary This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between the expression levels of the CAST gene and the fatty acid (FA) composition in the longissimus thoracis (LL) muscle and to identify novel variants of CAST and perform association analysis with the FA composition in grazing Sonid sheep. The correlation results showed that high expression levels of CAST are correlated with better FA compositions and classes in LL. Four c.646G>C (G216R), c.1210C>T (R404C), c.1437G>A (479T), and c.2097C>T (699G) mutations were identified in the CAST gene of Sonid sheep. The association studies showed that c.1210C>T is associated with C14:0, C18:0, C18:1n9c, C18:3n3, n3, C12:0, n6, and n6/n3; c.646G>C and c.1437G>A in linkage disequilibrium-Mongolia (r(2) = 0.964) were associated with C14:0, C18:0, SFA, C18:1n9c, n3, C10:0, C18:1n9t, and n6/n3; and c.2097C>T was associated with C18:3n3, n3, C10:0, and n6/n3 in the LL of Sonid sheep. Thus, the correlation results and associated mutations were expected to be genetic selection markers for the FA composition and meat quality of Sonid sheep muscle and provide new insight into sheep meat quality traits influenced by the ovine CAST gene. Fatty acid (FA) composition has an important impact on the nutrition and flavor of meat, and on consumer health, and is receiving more attention in the sheep industry. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between the expression levels of the CAST gene and the FA composition in the longissimus thoracis (LL) muscle, to identify novel variants of CAST, and to perform association analysis with the FA composition in grazing Sonid lambs. The correlation results showed that high expression levels of CAST are correlated with better FA compositions and classes in LL. For association studies, the results showed that c.1210C>T and c.1437G>A in LD-M, and c.2097C>T mutations are associated with some compositions and classes of FA in the LL of grazing Sonid sheep. Two missense c.646G>C (G216R) and c.1210C>T (R404C) mutations were predicted to influence the Calpain_inhib domains of CAST. Thus, the correlation results and associated mutations are expected to be genetic selection markers for the FA composition and meat quality of grazing Sonid lamb muscle and provide new insights into sheep meat quality traits influenced by the ovine CAST gene.

AB  - Metabolites are major contributors to the quality of tea that are regulated by various abiotic stresses. Light intensity and phosphorus (P) supply affect the metabolism of tea plants. However, how these two factors interact and mediate the metabolite levels in tea plants are not fully understood. The present study investigated the consequences of different light intensity and P regimes on the metabolism of carbohydrates, amino acids, and flavonoids in the Fengqing tea cultivar. The leaves and young shoots were subjected to untargeted metabolomics analysis by two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GCxGC-TOF/MS), ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-TOF/MS (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS), and targeted analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) along with quantification of gene expression by quantitative real time-PCR (qRT-PCR). The results from young shoots showed that amino acids, pentose phosphate, and flavonol glycosides pathways were enhanced in response to decreasing light intensities and P deficiency. The expression of the genes hexokinase 1, ribose 5-phosphate isomerase A (RPIA), glutamate synthetase 1 (GS1), prolyl 4-hydroxylase (P4H), and arginase was induced by P limitation, thereafter affecting carbohydrates and amino acids metabolism, where shading modulated the responses of transcripts and corresponding metabolites caused by P deficiency. P deprivation repressed the expression of Pi transport, stress, sensing, and signaling (SPX2) and induced bidirectional sugar transporter (SWEET3) and amino acid permeases (AAP) which ultimately caused an increase in the amino acids: glutamate (Glu), proline (Pro), and arginine (Arg) under shading but decreased catechins [epicatechingallate (ECG) and Gallic acid, GA] content in young shoots.

AB  - Insect spermathecae play a crucial role in sperm storage and maintenance prior to egg fertilization. Within eusocial insects, this structure is well studied in the Hymenoptera, whose queens copulate during a short period early in life and store sperm for up to decades. Within Isoptera, sperm storage and maintenance inside the spermatheca are poorly understood, especially due to the presence of a sperm-providing king. Here, we compared the morphometric and morphophysiological features of the spermathecae of virgin and mated queens of the invasive termite Coptotermes gestroi (Wasmann) (Isoptera: Rhinotermitidae). The spermatheca comprises a finger-shaped reservoir divided into two regions and a duct limited by a narrow transition. The superficial spermatheca area, as well as the luminal area, increase significantly after insemination, even among queens whose reproductive activity was reduced, suggesting that sperm storage continues during such conditions. The secretion of proteins and polysaccharides into the spermathecal lumen was a remarkable feature for both virgin and 4-year-old queens, although the concentration of the secreted content increased in the latter group. It suggests that spermatheca activation occurs before pairing, but its secretory activity intensifies to nourish and provide energy for the stored spermatozoa. Ultrastructure of the spermathecal epithelium showed a bicellular unit, composed of a secretory cell and associated canal cells. Secretory vesicles of various electron densities were observed next to the receiving canal of the secretory cells in both virgin and 2-year-old queens. Nevertheless, strongly electron-dense vesicles were only recorded for mated queens, which were associated with the increasing synthesis of proteins. The occurrence of rough endoplasmic reticulum and richness of mitochondria reinforces the protein synthesis and transport of contents towards the spermathecal lumen. In conclusion, the spermatheca of C. gestroi undergoes morphometric and physiological changes after mating, and further analysis may provide insights into the chemical nature of the spermathecal secretion prior to and after this event.

AB  - At present, indoor feeding is the primary method for fattening mutton sheep in China, where high-concentrate feeding is the common way to achieve high growth performance in the short term, and dietary cost accounts for most of the feeding expenditure. However, increasing feed costs and metabolic diseases, like rumen acidosis and urinary calculi, are likely to compromise the production benefits of such a fattening mode. Exploring low-cost alternative feeds and optimized dietary concentrate levels would contribute to better production benefits. In this study, an in situ method and in vitro three-step method were used to investigate the optimum dietary concentrate-toforage ratio, NFC/NDF (Nonfiber Carbohydrates/Neutral Detergent Fiber) ratio, and raw materials combination, ultimately providing a reference for the efficient and high-quality fattening of mutton sheep. It is concluded that a dietary concentrate-to-forage ratio in the range of 70:30 similar to 80:20 and NFC/NDF of 1.5 similar to 2.0 are recommended for fattening mutton sheep, and it is feasible to partly substitute soybean meal with unconventional protein feedstuff like cottonseed meal and rapeseed meal. In addition, the nutritional values of sunflower seed hulls and rice hulls are lower than that of peanut vine for mutton sheep. Such a study is of great significance to the high-quality development of the mutton sheep industry.
   This study was conducted to investigate the rumen degradability and intestinal digestibility of mutton sheep diets different in concentrate-to-forage ratio, NFC/NDF, and ingredient combination, providing a guideline for the selection of a fattening diet for mutton sheep. Twenty-eight diets composed of four raw material combinations and seven concentrate-to-forage ratios and four three-year-old mutton sheep with permanent rumen fistulas were used in the experiments. The nutrient composition of the diets was first analyzed, and then an in situ method and in vitro three-step method were separately used to measure the rumen degradability and intestinal digestibility, mainly focusing on the effects of dietary concentrate-to-forage ratio and NFC/NDF as well as the effects of soybean meal and soybean meal replacement and peanut vine and peanut vine replacement. The results showed that a dietary concentrate-to-forage ratio of 70:30 similar to 80:20 and an NFC/NDF ratio of 1.5 similar to 2.0 are recommended for fattening mutton sheep, and low-cost cottonseed meal and rapeseed meal can be feasible alternative protein sources to soybean meal. In addition, the nutritional values of sunflower seed hulls and rice hulls for mutton sheep are lower than that of peanut vine. Such a study can provide practical guidelines for enterprises and farmers, being of important significance for the high-quality development of the mutton sheep industry.

AB  - Due to the need to diversify energy sources and transform the energy system and its decarbonization, new paths for obtaining raw materials are being sought. One of the potential options is to increase the use of grasses' share in bioenergy production, which has a significant area potential. However, the diversified chemical composition of grasses and their anatomical heterogeneity mean that, between the various cultivars and species, the parameters determining their energetic usefulness may differ significantly, hence the key is to know the appropriate parameters at the variety level of a given species in order to effectively carry out the combustion process. In this experiment, a total of 23 varieties of seven grass species (Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.), Red Fescue (Festuca rubra L.), Perennial Ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.), Meadow Fescue (Festuca pratensis Huds.), Timothy (Phleum pratense L.), Common Bent (Agrostis capillaris L.), Sheep Fescue (Festuca ovina L.), which had not yet been evaluated in terms of energy utilization, were tested. Proximate analysis showed the average ash content was in the range of 5.73-8.31%, the content of volatile matter in the range of 70.99-82.29% and the content of fixed carbon in the range of 5.96-17.19%. Higher heating value and lower heating value of grasses ranged from 16,548-18,616 kJ center dot kg(-1), 15,428-17,453 kJ center dot kg(-1), respectively. The Sheep Fescue turned out to be the most useful species for combustion. It has been shown that there may be statistically significant differences in the parameters determining their combustion suitability between the various varieties of a given species of grass. Therefore the major finding of this work shows that it is necessary to need to know theparameters of a given variety is necessary to optimize the combustion process and maintain the full energy efficiency of the system (especially lower heating value).

AB  - The rebirth of global tourism with a massive rebound is anticipated due to an emerging touristic behavior coined as vaxication (i.e., post-vaccination travel). Despite the ongoing fatigue triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, travelers' fear of missing out (FOMO), and destination crisis marketing (DCM) can further accelerate travelers' momentum towards vaxication. To address this critical knowledge gap in COVID-19 tourism, the present study aimed to examine the effect of pandemic fatigue on vaxication intention for the greatest of all trips (GOAT) under the moderating influence of travel FOMO and destination crisis marketing. Drawing on data of international expatriates in the United Arab Emirates (N = 356) and using covariance-based structural equation modeling with Mplus, the findings provide new evidence supporting a positive impact of international expat's pandemic fatigue on vaxication intention for GOAT. Interestingly, this relationship is significantly reinforced by the international expat's travel FOMO as well as tourism destinations switching gears from 'managing crisis' to 'marketing crisis'. Based on prominent theories (i.e., theory of planned behavior, cognitive load theory, and protection motivation theory) and newly developed scales (i.e., travel FOMO and destination crisis marketing), the study implications are directed towards an outpacing trajectory of global tourism return prompted by pandemic fatigue, travel FOMO, destination crisis marketing, and vaxication intention for the greatest of all trips.

AB  - The treatment of animal slurry is used to improve management on a farm scale. The aim of this laboratory study was to assess the effects of the addition of the additives biochar, alum and clinoptilolite before the mechanical separation of whole pig slurry (WS) on the characteristics and emission of NH3, N2O, CO2 and CH4 from solid (SF) and liquid fractions (LF). The additives were mixed with WS (5% w/w), followed by separation, in a total of 12 treatments with 3 replicates, including the controls and WS with additives. Gaseous emissions were measured for 30 d by a photoacoustic multigas monitor, and initial characteristics of the slurries were assessed. The results indicated that the separation of the WS modified the initial physicochemical characteristics and increased the GWP emissions of the SF and LF, but not the NH3 losses. However, the addition of additives before separation increased the nutrient value and reduced the GWP emissions from the SF and LF. Additionally, just the additive alum was effective in the reduction of E. coli. The additives led to significant reductions in NH3 and N2O emissions, with higher reductions in NH3 losses for alum (51% for NH3) and similar N2O losses for all additives (70% for N2O) observed, whereas the CO2 and CH4 emissions were reduced by biochar (25% for CO2 and 50% for CH4) and alum (33% for CO2 and 30% for CH4) but not by clinoptilolite. Although the additives had a positive effect on slurry management, it can be concluded that the addition of alum before mechanical separation has the potential to be the best mitigation measure because it improves the nutrient content and sanitation and decreases gaseous losses from slurry management.

AB  - Simple Summary Findings from the analysis of the pig transcriptome may help to better understand the biological mechanisms that can be modulated by the diet. Thus, the aim of this study was to identify the differentially expressed genes from the skeletal muscle and liver samples of pigs fed diets with two different levels of soybean oil (1.5 or 3%). The FA profile in the tissues was modified by the diet mainly related to monounsaturated (MUFA) and polyunsaturated (PUFA). This nutrigenomics study verified the effect of different levels of soybean oil in the pig diet on the transcriptome profile of skeletal muscle and liver, where the higher level of soybean oil added to the diet led to a higher expression of genes targeting biological processes related to lipid oxidation and consequently to metabolic diseases and inflammation. The aim of this study was to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEG) from the skeletal muscle and liver samples of animal models for metabolic diseases in humans. To perform the study, the fatty acid (FA) profile and RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data of 35 samples of liver tissue (SOY1.5, n = 17 and SOY3.0, n = 18) and 36 samples of skeletal muscle (SOY1.5, n = 18 and SOY3.0, n = 18) of Large White pigs were analyzed. The FA profile of the tissues was modified by the diet, mainly those related to monounsaturated (MUFA) and polyunsaturated (PUFA) FA. The skeletal muscle transcriptome analysis revealed 45 DEG (FDR 10%), and the functional enrichment analysis identified network maps related to inflammation, immune processes, and pathways associated with oxidative stress, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic dysfunction. For the liver tissue, the transcriptome profile analysis revealed 281 DEG, which participate in network maps related to neurodegenerative diseases. With this nutrigenomics study, we verified that different levels of soybean oil in the pig diet, an animal model for metabolic diseases in humans, affected the transcriptome profile of skeletal muscle and liver tissue. These findings may help to better understand the biological mechanisms that can be modulated by the diet.

AB  - The commensal microbiota plays a fundamental role in maintaining host gut homeostasis by controlling several metabolic, neuronal and immune functions. Conversely, changes in the gut microenvironment may alter the saprophytic microbial community and function, hampering the positive relationship with the host. In this bidirectional interplay between the gut microbiota and the host, hyaluronan (HA), an unbranched glycosaminoglycan component of the extracellular matrix, has a multifaceted role. HA is fundamental for bacterial metabolism and influences bacterial adhesiveness to the mucosal layer and diffusion across the epithelial barrier. In the host, HA may be produced and distributed in different cellular components within the gut microenvironment, playing a role in the modulation of immune and neuronal responses. This review covers the more recent studies highlighting the relevance of HA as a putative modulator of the communication between luminal bacteria and the host gut neuro-immune axis both in health and disease conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease and ischemia/reperfusion injury.

AB  - With the rise of smart agriculture and the expansion of pig farming, pig aggressive behavior recognition is crucial for maintaining herd health and improving farming efficiency. The differences in background and light variation in different barns can lead to the missed detection and false detection of pig aggressive behaviors. Therefore, we propose a deep learning-based pig aggressive behavior recognition model, in order to improve the adaptability of the model in complex pig environments. This model, combined with MobileNetV2 and Autoformer, can effectively extract local detail features of pig aggression and temporal correlation information of video frame sequences. Both Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) and Advanced Filtering Feature Fusion Pyramid Network (HS-FPN) are integrated into the lightweight convolutional network MobileNetV2, which can more accurately capture key visual features of pig aggression and enhance the ability to detect small targets. We extract temporal correlation information between consecutive frames by the improved Autoformer. The Gate Attention Unit (GAU) is embedded into the Autoformer encoder in order to focus on important features of pig aggression while reducing computational latency. Experimental validation was implemented on public datasets, and the results showed that the classification recall, precision, accuracy, and F1-score of the model proposed in this paper reach 98.08%, 94.44%, 96.23%, and 96.23%, and the parameter quantity is optimized to 10.41 M. Compared with MobileNetV2-LSTM and MobileNetV2-GRU, the accuracy has been improved by 3.5% and 3.0%, respectively. Therefore, this model achieves a balance between recognition accuracy and computational complexity and is more suitable for automatic pig aggression recognition in practical farming scenarios, providing data support for scientific feeding and management strategies in pig farming.

AB  - Plant dispersal syndromes are allocated based on diaspore morphology and used to predict the dominant mechanisms of dispersal. Many authors assume that only angiosperms with endozoochory, epizoochory or anemochory syndromes have a long-distance dispersal (LDD) mechanism. Too much faith is often placed in classical syndromes to explain historical dispersal events and to predict future ones. What is usually recorded as the 'endozoochory syndrome' is in reality a 'frugivory syndrome' and this has often diverted attention from endozoochory by non-frugivores (e.g. waterbirds and large herbivores) that disperse a broad range of angiosperms, for which they likely provide the maximum dispersal distances. Neither the endozoochory nor the epizoochory syndromes provide helpful predictions of which plants non-frugivores disperse, or by which mechanism. We combined data from previous studies to show that only 4% of European plant species dispersed by ungulate endozoochory belong to the corresponding syndrome, compared to 36% for ungulate epizoochory and 8% for endozoochory by migratory ducks. In contrast, the proportions of these species that are assigned to an 'unassisted syndrome' are 37, 31 and 28%, respectively. Since allocated syndromes do not adequately account for zoochory, empirical studies often fail to find the expected relationship between syndromes and LDD events such as those underlying the colonization of islands or latitudinal migration rates. We need full incorporation of existing zoochory data into dispersal databases, and more empirical research into the relationship between plant traits and the frequency and effectiveness of different dispersal mechanisms (paying attention to unexpected vectors). Acknowledging the broad role of non-frugivores in facilitating LDD is crucial to improve predictions of the consequences of global change, such as how plant distributions respond to climate change, and how alien plants spread. Networks of dispersal interactions between these vertebrates and plants are a vital but understudied part of the Web of Life.

AB  - As the largest mucosal surface, the gut has built a physical, chemical, microbial, and immune barrier to protect the body against pathogen invasion. The disturbance of gut microbiota aggravates pathogenic bacteria invasion and gut barrier injury. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a promising treatment for microbiome-related disorders, where beneficial strain engraftment is a significant factor influencing FMT outcomes. The aim of this research was to explore the effect of FMT on antibiotic-induced microbiome-disordered (AIMD) models infected with enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC). We used piglet, mouse, and intestinal organoid models to explore the protective effects and mechanisms of FMT on ETEC infection. The results showed that FMT regulated gut microbiota and enhanced the protection of AIMD piglets against ETEC K88 challenge, as demonstrated by reduced intestinal pathogen colonization and alleviated gut barrier injury. Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila) and Bacteroides fragilis (B. fragilis) were identified as two strains that may play key roles in FMT. We further investigated the alleviatory effects of these two strains on ETEC infection in the AIMD mice model, which revealed that A. muciniphila and B. fragilis relieved ETEC-induced intestinal inflammation by maintaining the proportion of Treg/Th17 cells and epithelial damage by moderately activating the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway, while the effect of A. muciniphila was better than B. fragilis. We, therefore, identified whether A. muciniphila protected against ETEC infection using basal-out and apical-out intestinal organoid models. A. muciniphila did protect the intestinal stem cells and stimulate the proliferation and differentiation of intestinal epithelium, and the protective effects of A. muciniphila were reversed by Wnt inhibitor. FMT alleviated ETEC-induced gut barrier injury and intestinal inflammation in the AIMD model. A. muciniphila was identified as a key strain in FMT to promote the proliferation and differentiation of intestinal stem cells by mediating the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway.

AB  - In grassland systems of the semi-arid mining area, the migration, accumulation, and bioavailability of potentially toxic elements (PTEs) are important ecological and health risk issues. Thirty-eight pairs of topsoil (0-20 cm) and plant samples were collected around Baiyin City and in Dongdagou stream valley to investigate the migration of PTEs in soils, transfer of PTEs in soil-plant (shrub and herbage) systems, and assess the risk in soils and plants. The total concentrations of PTE (Hg, As, Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb) were analyzed following digestion in mixture acid solution, and bioavailable PTE was extracted with a strong chelating agent (DTPA-TEA-CaCl2). The transfer factor (TF) and bioaccumulation factor (BCF) were calculated to examine the migration of PTEs in soil-plant. Hazard quotient (HQ) and total hazard index (THI) were calculated to assess the risk and migration of PTEs in soils. The results showed that PTEs in soils and plants of study area exceeded the soil background value and Hygienic Standard for Feeds. Correlation among the total Hg, As, Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb in soils of Dongdagou stream valley was significant at p < 0.01. A good correlation was exhibited between PTEs in root/aboveground parts of plants and DTPA-soil extractable. Difference of TF and BCF was existed between Dongdagou stream valley and around Baiyin City. Hg, Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb were mainly accumulated in soils near the mining area. The calculated THI exceeded 1, and As and Pb were the major risk factors. The ability to absorb and transfer Hg, As, Cu, and Pb of plants was lower in more serious polluted area. As had a stronger migration capacity in study area. PTEs in soils had an adverse health effect for residents, and PTEs in plants may cause toxicity to cattle and sheep.

AB  - Dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in aquatic environments is a concern due to human and animal health. Application of liquid manure on agricultural land is an important source of ARGs, where pathogens, antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and selective agents are released. To improve our understanding of ARGs spreading through soils, our main objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of the soil as a barrier protecting water resources. Over the course of a year, profiles and abundances of ARGs and mobile genetic elements in soil and drainage from an agricultural tile-drained clay till field were investigated upon liquid pig manure application by applying high-throughput quantitative polymerase chain reaction targeting 143 genes. The findings were as follows: (a) 97 genes were detected, where only the transposon gene tnpA-03/ IS6 was shared between the genes detected in drainage and those in acidified liquid manure or fertilized soils, indicating that liquid manure application had a limited impact on the drainage resistance profile; (b) intI1 gene was present in similar to 60% of drainage samples in concentrations up to 1,634 intI1 ml(-1); and (c) evapotranspiration from barley (Hordeum vulgare L., 'KWS Irina') and a low groundwater table appeared to reduce preferential transport to drainage during the first 3 mo of liquid manure application. Interestingly, the first preferential transport to drainage was observed immediately after the harvest of spring barley. Overall, during the monitoring year we found the soil to be an effective barrier against the spread of fecal ARGs even though the occurrence of the intI1 gene questions the barrier effect from previous years.

AB  - Simple Summary: Tibetan sheep are the characteristic sheep breed on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, characterized by good adaptability to the hypoxic conditions, delayed maturation, and low fecundity. The epididymis is a male reproductive organ well known to be responsible for sperm transport, storage, and maturation, which is crucial for male fertility. To clarify the dynamic gene expression patterns and their potential contribution during sperm maturation of Tibetan sheep, in this study we characterized the comprehensive transcriptional profiles in the three epididymal areas (caput, corpus, and cauda) of Tibetan sheep using RNA sequencing. The results revealed that numerous genes are present in Tibetan sheep epididymis in a stage-region-dependent manner, showing more dramatic changes in gene expression in various epididymal areas of post-pubertal Tibetan sheep. These genes perform some sort of function in reproduction, development and morphogenesis, and immune privilege to facilitate the maturation of spermatozoa and to provide the microenvironment required for sperm development and maturation. This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms by which genes are regulated during post-testicular sperm development.
   While traveling through the epididymis, immature sheep spermatozoa undergo a sequence of processes that ultimately give them the capacity to swim and fertilize an egg. Different gene expression patterns may be found in the epididymal caput, corpus, and cauda, conferring variant or unique biological roles during epididymis development and sperm maturation. To search for candidate genes associated with ovine sperm maturation and assess their possible modulating mechanisms, we characterized gene expression in each epididymal segment derived from pre-and post-pubertal Tibetan sheep by RNA sequencing. Compared with pre-puberty, 7730 (3724 upregulated and 4006 downregulated), 7516 (3909 upregulated and 3607 downregulated), and 7586 (4115 elevated and 3471 downregulated) genes were found to be differentially expressed in the post-pubertal caput, corpus, and cauda epididymis, respectively, and real-time quantitative PCR verified the validity of the gathered expression patterns. Based on their functional annotations, most differential genes were assigned to the biological processes and pathways associated with cellular proliferation, differentiation, immune response, or metabolic activities. As for the postpubertal epididymis, 2801, 197, and 186 genes were specifically expressed in the caput, corpus, and cauda, respectively. Functional annotation revealed that they were mainly enriched to various distinct biological processes associated with reproduction (including the caput binding of sperm to the zona pellucida; fertilization in the caput and corpus; and meiosis in the caput and cauda) and development (such as cell differentiation and developmental maturation in the caput; cell proliferation and metabolism in the corpus; and regulation of tube size and cell division/cell cycle in the cauda). Additionally, we focused on the identification of genes implicated in immunity and sperm maturation, and subsequent functional enrichment analysis revealed that immune-related genes mainly participated in the biological processes or pathways associated with the immune barrier (such as JAM3 and ITGA4/6/9) and immunosuppression (such as TGFB2, TGFBR1, TGFBR2, and SMAD3), thus protecting auto-immunogenic spermatozoa. Additionally, sperm maturation was mostly controlled by genes linked with cellular processes, including cell growth, proliferation, division, migration, morphogenesis, and junction. Altogether, these results suggest that most genes were differentially expressed in developmental epididymal regions to contribute to microenvironment development and sperm maturation. These findings help us better understand the epididymal biology, including sperm maturation pathways and functional differences between the epididymal regions in Tibetan sheep and other sheep breeds.

AB  - This experiment was to study the therapeutic effect of modified Yujin powder on E. coli in the P. przewalskii. Twenty the Procapra przewalskii with the E. coli were selected from the Wildlife Rescue Center of the Qinghai Lake National Nature Reserve and randomly divided into low-dose group, high -dose group, gentamicin sulfate group and control group with 5 Procapra przewalskii in each group. The P. przewalskii in modified Yujin powder group were given Yujing powder once every morning and evening, 3, 4 mL/ (kg??BW) for the low-dose group and high-dose group, respectively. The P. przewalskii were injected with gentamicin sulfate intramuscularly,once every morning and evening. The P. przewalskii in control group were fed normally and no medicine was given. After 7 d, the clinical symptoms of the P. przewalskii were observed, and the blood routine, serum biochemical parameter, serum immune and antioxidant indices were measured. The results showed that the P. przewalskii were sensitive reaction, increased appetite, and no diarrhea in the modified Yujin powder group. The healing rates were 75%, 85%, and 60% in low-dose group, high-dose group, gentamicin sulfate group, respectively. The effects of modified Yujin powder was better than gentamicin sulfate. The contents of blood urea nitrogen (BUN), malondialdehyde (MDA), and the number of white blood cell (WBC) in 3 drug delivery groups were extremely significantly lower (P<0.01) than the control group, and the contents of potassium (K), total protein (TP), albumin (ALB), globulin (GLB), and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) in the 3 drug delivery groups were extremely significantly higher (P<0.01) than that of control group, but there were no remarkable differences between the 3 drug delivery groups. The serum catalase (CAT) activity in the high-dose group was extremely significantly higher (P<0.01) than that in the low-dose group, gentamicin sulfate group, and control group. Consequently, modified Yujin powder had a good therapeutic effect on the E. coli in P. przewalskii, and the effect of the high-dose group was better.

AB  - The intrinsic ability of plants to face environmental diel changes is paramount for flowering and interactions with pollinators and herbivores. Surprisingly, despite the commendable research efforts on the ecology and evolution of fruit-frugivore interactions, very little is known about how fruit ripening and dropping vary throughout 24-h cycle. Even less is known about the potential consequences of circadian fruit phenology on plant interactions with mutualistic and antagonistic frugivores. We illustrate for the first time how the circadian pattern of fleshy fruit dropping and its matching/mismatching with the diel activity of functionally diverse frugivores (fruit/seed predators, seed dispersers, pulp feeders) can drive the outcome of complex multispecies plant-frugivore interactions. To that end, we used camera trapping to quantify the circadian fruit dropping of a mammal-dispersed tree, Pyrus bourgaeana, and the diel activity patterns of its functionally diverse vertebrate frugivores during two fruiting seasons in two tree populations of Mediterranean Spain. Using a large data set (20,878 frugivore visits and 701 fruit-dropping records), we evaluate the adaptive hypothesis that the circadian pattern of fruit dropping will match the diel activity of seed dispersers rather than that of fruit/seed predators. Fruit dropping during daytime doubled that at night-time, being considerably consistent across and within seasons, study sites and individual trees. Specifically, overlaps between circadian patterns of fruit dropping across and within seasons (0.83 and 0.84 +/- 0.02, respectively), study sites (0.95) and individual trees (0.68 +/- 0.01) were always high. Whereas seed dispersers (mammalian carnivores) were mostly nocturnal, the most frequent fruit/seed predators (cervids) were mostly diurnal. Consequently, and contrary to our expectations, circadian fruit dropping was more aligned with the diel activity of overabundant fruit/seed predators than with that of carnivore seed dispersers. Our study illustrates how quantifying the circadian patterns of fruit dropping, the diel activity of functionally diverse frugivores, and the matching/mismatching between both patterns can contribute to a better understanding of multispecies plant-frugivore interactions. Circadian fruiting phenology is an overlooked key attribute for most tropical and temperate fruiting plants, which patterns, mechanisms and outcomes must be fully investigated.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

Para resolver esta cuesti & oacute;n, usamos t & eacute;cnicas de fototrampeo para cuantificar la ca & iacute;da circadiana de los frutos de un & aacute;rbol dispersado por mam & iacute;feros, Pyrus bourgaeana, y los patrones de actividad diaria de sus frug & iacute;voros funcionalmente diversos durante dos temporadas de fructificaci & oacute;n en dos poblaciones de la Espa & ntilde;a mediterr & aacute;nea. Usando una amplia base de datos (20.878 visitas de frug & iacute;voros y 701 eventos de ca & iacute;da de frutos), evaluamos la hip & oacute;tesis adaptativa en la que el patr & oacute;n circadiano de ca & iacute;da de frutos se solapar & aacute; con la actividad diaria de los dispersantes de semillas m & aacute;s que con la de los depredadores de frutos y semillas. La ca & iacute;da de frutos durante el d & iacute;a fue el doble que, durante la noche, siendo considerablemente consistente entre y durante temporadas, sitios de estudio y & aacute;rboles. En concreto, el solapamiento entre los patrones circadianos de ca & iacute;da de frutos entre y durante temporadas (0.83 y 0.84 +/- 0.02, respectivamente), sitios de estudio (0.95) y & aacute;rboles (0.68 +/- 0.01) fue siempre alto. Mientras que los dispersantes de semillas (mam & iacute;feros carn & iacute;voros) fueron principalmente nocturnos, los depredadores de frutos y semillas (c & eacute;rvidos) fueron los visitantes m & aacute;s frecuentes y mayoritariamente diurnos. Por tanto, y al contrario de lo que esper & aacute;bamos, la ca & iacute;da circadiana de frutos se solap & oacute; m & aacute;s con la actividad diaria de los sobreabundantes c & eacute;rvidos (depredadores de frutos y semillas) que con la de los carn & iacute;voros (dispersantes de semillas). Nuestro estudio ilustra c & oacute;mo, cuantificar los patrones circadianos de ca & iacute;da de frutos y de la actividad diaria de frug & iacute;voros funcionalmente diversos, as & iacute; como el solapamiento/desajuste entre ambos patrones puede contribuir a una mejor comprensi & oacute;n de las interacciones multiespec & iacute;ficas planta-frug & iacute;voro. La fenolog & iacute;a circadiana de los frutos es un atributo clave pasado por alto para la mayor & iacute;a de plantas con frutos de climas tropicales y templados, cuyos patrones, mecanismos e implicaciones tienen que ser

AB  - Background: Ambient air pollution has become a challenging global health issue since industrialization, especially affecting respiratory diseases. However, the causal link between air pollution and allergic respiratory diseases (ARDs) remains unclear due to confounding factors in conventional epidemiological studies across different populations. Thus, we aimed to clarify the causal associations between air pollution and ARDs in European and East Asian populations using Mendelian randomization (MR). Methods: MR utilizes genetic variants and provides a satisfactory level of causal evidence. Genetic data for exposures (PM2.5, PM2.5 absorbance, PM10, PMcoarse, NO2 and NOx) and outcomes (allergic rhinitis, chronic rhinosinusitis, asthma, and obesity related asthma) were obtained from genome-wide association studies. Instrumental variables were strictly filtered based on core assumptions. Two-sample MR and sensitivity analyses were conducted separately for European and East Asian populations. Results: PMcoarse was causally associated with an increased risk of chronic rhinosinusitis (OR = 1.588 [1.002-2.518]; p = 0.049) and obesity related asthma (OR = 1.956 [1.012-3.780]; p = 0.046) in European population, and PM10 was associated with a decreased risk of allergic rhinitis in East Asian population (OR = 0.882 [0.798-0.974]; p = 0.013). No heterogeneity or pleiotropy was detected in any significant causal association. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that ambient air pollution has opposite impacts on the etiology of ARDs in European and East Asian populations, which provides evidence for decisions on public policies and suggests that different responses to environmental factors such as air pollution may contribute to racial heterogeneity of ARDs.

AB  - The relationship between endemic sheep fluorosis and coal mining and combustion in Helan Mountain, Ningxia, China, is lacking clear research and understanding. A total of 137 samples of topsoil and grass were collected in this area and fluorine, sulfate, and pH levels were determined. The mean fluorine content in topsoil is 707 +/- 126 mu g g-1 (n = 77), which is significantly higher than that of standard Chinese topsoil. The mean fluorine content of pasture is 218 +/- 42 mu g g-1 (n = 28), which suggests that sheep fluorosis may be associated with high fluorine levels in topsoil and pasture. Sulfate content in topsoil is 1771 +/- 130 mu g g-1 (n = 77) and pH is 5.92 +/- 0.82. The pH and sulfate content of acidic topsoil are positively correlated (r = 0.72), which implies that the acidity may be due to the presence of acidic sulfates, such as NaHSO4 or KHSO4. High fluorine, sulfate, and acidity may be connected with the long history of coal mining, coal use, and coal combustion, where deposition of fluoride results in coexistence with acidic sulfate.

AB  - Camelina ( Camelina sativa), an allohexaploid species, is an emerging aviation biofuel crop that has been the focus of resurgent interest in recent decades. To guide future breeding and crop improvement efforts, the community requires a deeper comprehension of subgenome dominance, often noted in allopolyploid species, "alongside an understanding of the genetic diversity" and population structure of material present within breeding programs. We conducted population genetic analyses of a C. sativa diversity panel, leveraging a new genome, to estimate nucleotide diversity and population structure, and analyzed for patterns of subgenome expression dominance among different organs. Our analyses confirm that C. sativa has relatively low genetic diversity and show that the SG3 subgenome has substantially lower genetic diversity compared to the other two subgenomes. Despite the low genetic diversity, our analyses identified 13 distinct subpopulations including two distinct wild populations and others putatively representing founders in existing breeding populations. When analyzing for subgenome composition of long non-coding RNAs, which are known to play important roles in (a)biotic stress tolerance, we found that the SG3 subgenome contained significantly more lincRNAs compared to other subgenomes. Similarly, transcriptome analyses revealed that expression dominance of SG3 is not as strong as previously reported and may not be universal across all organ types. From a global analysis, SG3 "was only significant higher expressed" in flower, flower bud, and fruit organs, which is an important discovery given that the crop yield is associated with these organs. Collectively, these results will be valuable for guiding future breeding efforts in camelina.

AB  - Background: Mitochondrial dysfunction and brain insulin resistance have been related to Alzheimer's disease (AD) development. Streptozotocin (STZ) is commonly employed to disrupt glucose and insulin metabolism, even causing cognitive impairment in animal models. We aimed at studying the protective effect of JM-20 on STZinduced memory impairment and brain mitochondrial dysfunction. Methods: Male C57Bl6 mice received 3 mg/kg STZ intracerebroventricularly and JM-20 (0.25 mg/kg or 4 mg/kg) was administered daily by gastric gavage. Episodic memory was evaluated through Y-maze, novel object recognition, and Morris water maze. Endogenous antioxidant systems (catalase and superoxide dismutase activities), total sulfhydryl groups, malondialdehyde levels were also studied and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity were assessed in the prefrontal cortex (PC) and hippocampus (HO). Results: demonstrated that STZ injection impaired recognition and spatial learning and memory and oxygen flow in all mitochondrial respiration states. Additionally, STZ increased AChE, superoxide dismutase, and catalase activity in the PC but not in HO tissue. A neuroprotective effect of JM-20 on STZ-induced memory decline, and mitochondrial dysfunction was observed, suggesting an important causal interaction. In addition, JM-20 was able to decreased AChE enzyme hyperactivity, rescued endogenous antioxidant systems, and prevented histologically observed neuronal damage Conclusion: Our results indicate that JM-20 protects against STZ-induced impairment in brain bioenergetic metabolism and memory, confirming its potential as a candidate for treating neurodegenerative disorders associated with mitochondrial dysfunction like AD.

AB  - We report the discovery of the invasive aphid Aphis lugentis for the first time in Australia. This aphid specialises on Compositae, particularly on Senecio species. Aphids were tended by several ant species at a site on Kangaroo Island, South Australia, which is unlikely to be the location of the original introduction. We recommend the investigation of the distribution of A. lugentis in Australia and its impacts on plant hosts including threatened species and associated native ant and aphid community structures.

AB  - Ethylene oxide (E.O) is an epoxide compound, and it has been utilized as a sterilizer or production of ether compounds in several industries. Although the toxic effects of E.O on bacteria and mammals have been reported, its effects on male reproductive toxicity during sperm capacitation are not fully understood. Therefore, this study was designed to evaluate the effects of E.O exposure during sperm capacitation. Boar spermatozoa were treated with various E.O concentrations (0, 0.1, 1, 10, and 100 mu & Mcy;). After exposure, sperm motility, motion kinematics, capacitation status, intracellular ATP levels, cell viability, expression levels of protein kinase A (PKA) activation, and tyrosine phosphorylation were evaluated. Results revealed that E.O exposure significantly decreased sperm motility, motion kinematics, and intracellular ATP levels but significantly increased the capacitated spermatozoa. In addition, the PKA activation and tyrosine phosphorylation were abnormally changed. According to our results, E.O may cause toxic effects on sperm function during capacitation, which induces male reproductive toxicity. Consequently, we suggest that male reproductive toxicity should be considered when using E.O.

AB  - Simple Summary In recent decades, wildlife populations in Italy have continued to expand, and some species are now present in large numbers with a wide geographical distribution. Viral and parasitic agents are an integral part of any wildlife population. The major changes in human land use, the tendency of some wild animals to get closer to urban areas in search of food, the increased interest in visiting protected natural areas, and the hunting of game as a food source increase the possibility of sharing natural areas between wild animals, livestock, pets, and humans. From an epidemiological point of view, these factors also increase the possibility of the exchange of pathogens between these groups. Therefore, wild animals can act as a source of infection for domestic animals and humans. This study represents a retrospective analysis including viral agents and parasites affecting a cohort of wild animals in Italy, providing a comprehensive overview of their health status. Overall, a large number of animals tested positive for at least one pathogen, and many were infected with more than two agents, showing a wide range of pathogens responsible for intra- and interspecific transmission in wild populations living in the study areas. This study aimed to provide information on the presence and frequency of viral and parasitic agents in wildlife presented to a Veterinary Teaching Hospital in 2020-2021. Serum and faecal samples were collected from 50 rescued animals (roe deer, fallow deer, foxes, badgers, pine martens, and porcupines) and examined by serological, molecular, and parasitological techniques. Transtracheal wash (TTW) was also collected post-mortem from roe deer. Overall, the results of the different techniques showed infections with the following viral and parasitic agents: Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus, Small Ruminant Lentiviruses, Kobuvirus, Astrovirus, Canine Adenovirus 1, Bopivirus, gastrointestinal strongyles, Capillaria, Ancylostomatidae, Toxocara canis, Trichuris vulpis, Hymenolepis, Strongyloides, Eimeria, Isospora, Dictyocaulus, Angiostrongylus vasorum, Crenosoma, Dirofilaria immitis, Neospora caninum, Giardia duodenalis, and Cryptosporidium. Sequencing (Tpi locus) identified G. duodenalis sub-assemblages AI and BIV in one roe deer and one porcupine, respectively. Adult lungworms collected from the TTW were identified as Dictyocaulus capreolus (COX1 gene). This is the first molecular identification of G. duodenalis sub-assemblage AI and D. capreolus in roe deer in Italy. These results show a wide presence of pathogens in wild populations and provide an overview of environmental health surveillance.

AB  - With the increasing demand for pork, improving pig health and welfare management productivity has become a priority. However, it is impractical for humans to manually monitor all pigsties in commercial-scale pig farms, highlighting the need for automated health monitoring systems. In such systems, object detection is essential. However, challenges such as insufficient training data, low computational performance, and generalization issues in diverse environments make achieving high accuracy in unseen environments difficult. Conventional RGB-based object detection models face performance limitations due to brightness similarity between objects and backgrounds, new facility installations, and varying lighting conditions. To address these challenges, this study proposes a DOG (Depth-Oriented Gray) image generation method using various foundation models (SAM, LaMa, Depth Anything). Without additional sensors or retraining, the proposed method utilizes depth information from the testing environment to distinguish between foreground and background, generating depth background images and establishing an approach to define the Region of Interest (RoI) and Region of Uninterest (RoU). By converting RGB input images into the HSV color space and combining HSV-Value, inverted HSV-Saturation, and the generated depth background images, DOG images are created to enhance foreground object features while effectively suppressing background information. Experimental results using low-cost CPU and GPU systems demonstrated that DOG images improved detection accuracy (AP50) by up to 6.4% compared to conventional gray images. Moreover, DOG image generation achieved real-time processing speeds, taking 3.6 ms on a CPU, approximately 53.8 times faster than the GPU-based depth image generation time of Depth Anything, which requires 193.7 ms.

AB  - Nonbreeding white rhino bulls are traditionally housed individually in zoos, but space limitations require the exploration of alternative techniques. There are no studies of group-housed bulls, and the feasibility of managing a bachelor group is unknown. Six bulls (two bulls each of 3-, 5-, and 8-yr-olds) in a 3.1 ha enclosure were observed for 30 min each 2x/wk for 20-31 wks. The 3-yr-olds were relocated after the first 20 weeks. Rhino location, nearest neighbor, aggressive behaviors, and dominance interactions were recorded. There was no evidence of habitat spatial segregation. The 3- and 5-yr-olds grouped together by age; 8-yr-olds did not associate as much as younger rhinos. Aggressive vocalizations and physical aggression were infrequent (range 0-1.5/h/bull and 0-1/h/bull, respectively). Eight-year-olds displayed and received aggressive vocalizations the most; three-year-olds displayed and received physical aggression the most. After the 3-yr-olds were removed, the habitat usage and social proximity of the remaining bulls did not change. Aggressive behaviors increased, but vocalizations (range 0.18-3.1/h/bull) remained more frequent than physical aggression (range 0.18-0.73/h/bull). The highest-ranking 8-yr-old engaged in physical altercations the least. The bulls shared space, and the use of vocalizations more than physical aggression deterred injury. These findings indicate that bachelor group management is feasible in a large enclosure with young bulls.

AB  - The mitogenome of Curculio chinensis (Chevrolat, 1878) was sequenced and annotated to better identify C. chinensis and related species. The mitogenome is 18,680 bp in length, includes the 37 typical mitochondrial genes (13 protein-coding genes, two ribosomal RNA genes and 22 transfer RNA genes) and two control regions (total length: 3,879 bp). Mitogenome organisation, nucleotide composition and codon usage are similar to the previously sequenced Curculio mitogenomes. All 13 protein-coding genes use ATN or TTG as start codon and end with TAA/G or incomplete stop codons (single T-). Twenty-one transfer RNA genes have the typical clover-leaf structure, while the dihydrouridine (DHU) arm of trnS1 is missing. In Curculio mitogenomes, the size of the control region is highly variable. Both ML and BI analyses, based on the 13 PCGs and two rRNAs from six species of Curculioninae, strongly supported the monophyly of Curculio. In Curculio, the relationships amongst included species were inferred as ((C. chinensis + Curculio. sp.) + (Curculio davidi + Curculio elephas)), with C. chinensis and C. sp. forming a clade (BS = 100; PP = 1).

AB  - Social media ad stories are widely used to grow engagement in wildlife conservation. Yet the benefits of different types of story character and content are unclear. In four video stories, we explored the impact of varying the type of protagonist species (Elephant and WildDog) and content about the role of humans in causing wildlife loss (Elephant + HumanAction and WildDog + HumanAction) using Facebook A/B split tests. Counter to prior perceptions that traditional charismatic flagships are more appealing, stories featuring wild dogs-with and without human-caused harm-elicited higher traffic to a conservation organization's donation website. Only the Elephant video elicited one donation. These results show that storytelling in social media ads, by choosing character and content, can help raise engagement. Yet the failure to raise funds and limitations arising from Facebook's opaque algorithms, underscores the need for greater experimentation to build knowledge about how to convert engagement into donations.

AB  - Ruminant species differ in digestive physiology. The species-specific ratio of mean retention time of particles and fluid (MRTparticle/MRTfluid) in the reticulorumen has been interpreted as controlling ruminal fermentation: a higher ratio indicates of a more distinct 'washing' of particulate digesta by liquid. This should increase the harvest of microbes from the reticulorumen, and keep the microbiome in a state of more intense growth; at the same time, this should increase the metabolic losses of faecal nitrogen of microbial origin, leading to lower values for the apparent digestibility of crude protein (aD CP). A systematic difference has been hypothesized between cattle (higher ratio) and sheep (lower ratio), with a lower MRTfluid in cattle due to a higher saliva production. Here, we test these hypotheses in a meta-analysis, using only studies that investigated cattle and sheep simul-taneously. The datasets included 12 studies on MRT (of which 11 contained information on feed intake), yielding 102 (or 89) individual data; and 26 studies on protein digestibility (of which 18 contained information on intake), yielding 349 individual data. Cattle had a higher MRTparticle/MRTfluid (2.1) than sheep (1.7), mainly due to longer MRTparticle; only if body mass was included in the model, MRTfluid was significantly shorter in cattle in the larger MRT dataset (and tended to be shorter in the slightly smaller dataset). Cattle had a significantly lower aD CP than sheep, while there was no such difference in overall (dry or organic matter) digestibility. The dataset confirms a shift in fermentation strategy towards microbial production in cattle. While this has been suggested for ruminants in general, cattle appear particularly far on an evolutionary trajectory of maximizing microbial yield from the forestomach. The application of more specific digestive physiology data (like endogenous losses) gained from sheep to cattle should be done bearing these differences in mind.

AB  - Improving human capital through quality education remains a global and national priority, particularly for developing countries. Academic performance is the standard indicator of a successful acquisition of the knowledge, skills, and attitudes for improving human capital. However, recent data, particularly in wildlife areas shows that pupils often perform poorly on academic tests in low-income countries. This study aims to determine the impact of elephants on academic performance in Trans Mara District, Kenya. We use data from 137 schools and 749 pupils who wrote the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education between 2010 and 2014, and 15 key informants. We used descriptive statistics to analyze and interpret our data. Results show that locating a school outside the elephant range positively contributed to higher mean scores compared to ethnicity, pupil-teacher ratio and gender. Whereas day facilities only strongly contributed to lower scores compared to examination entry, age of the pupil, and ethnicity. The study places elephants on both ends of the villain-scapegoat continuum since their presence alone does not make a major contribution to poor academic performance in the Trans Mara District. We recommend providing cheaper and accessible transport to pupils, expanding both day and boarding facilities, establishing additional schools closer to pupils within elephant range to reduce the distances to school. These initiatives must be linked to the conservation of elephants as a suit of direct incentives for coexisting with elephants.

AB  - Simultaneous recovery of phosphorus (P), potassium (K), and magnesium (Mg) as precipitated phosphate salt (PPS) was assessed (K-struvite and hazenite included) in a pig farm downstream a nitrification-denitrification unit. The precipitation process was addressed using denitrified effluent (DE) and waste sludge (WS) purged from the bioreactor. For DE, the inherent unbalanced Mg:K:P molar ratio (1.4:9.5:1.0; 1.6 g K/L) led to poor K recovery (<= 15%) if considering P as the limiting element. By considering K as limiting, the supply of external sources of Mg and P (final Mg:K:P as 1.0:0.5:1.0) allowed the recovery of most of the K available. For WS, a selective pretreatment with oxalic acid resulted in an available Mg:K:P ratio of 0.8:1.2:1.0. Risk of interference by free calcium will exist if the operational parameters are not optimized, thus constraining the recovery of K (<= 51%). A fertilization field trial demonstrated the fertilizing value of the recovered PPS with respect to a mineral fertilizer, and the increased risk of soil salinization under a reiterative application of processed DE. Scenarios without extra addition of nutrients will introduce an enhanced handling in the current nutrient management planning of the pig farm. On the contrary, the trade of the PPS formed becomes essential when external sources of Mg and P were added.
   Precipitation of P, K and Mg downstream an N-removal plant was assessed in a farm.The precipitation process was addressed using denitrified effluent and waste sludge.The precipitated phosphate salt (PPS) was evaluated as a fertilizer in a field test.Nutrient export out of the farm's productive system is needed when dosing MgO-H3PO4.The trading of the recovered PPS is essential to recover the expense in reagents.

AB  - Teat number is an important economic trait in the pig breeding industry and is directly related to the livability and growth status of piglets. By applying genetic technology, it may be possible to increase the number of teats and thus enhance production. Previous research has shown that teat number exhibits moderate levels of heritability that could be accelerated by the use of a genetic marker, such as microsatellites. Based on our preliminary sequencing data, the present study describes the use of time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF-MS) to identify the locations of four new microsatellites in Qinghai Bamei pig (n=256), an indigenous breed of Chinese pig. TOF-MS demonstrated that the L1-(GT)(n) locus had three alleles: 152 bp, 164 bp, and 166 bp. The three other loci, L2-(AC)(n), L3-(TC)(n), and L4-(TGA)(n), all had two alleles. Alignment of our sequencing data with the Sus scrofa reference genome (Sscrofa11.1) revealed that the L1-(GT)(n) microsatellite, which features a GT repeat motif, was located in the retinoic acid induced 2 gene (RAI2) on chromosome X in Sus scrofa (SSCX). Analysis further revealed that the L2-(AC)(n) locus, featuring AC repeats, and the L3-(TC)(n) locus, featuring TC repeats, were located in intergenic regions on SSC14 and SSC5, respectively. TGA repeats within the L4-(TGA)(n) locus were located in the inner mitochondrial membrane peptidase subunit 2 gene (IMMPL2) on SSC18. Further association analysis revealed that the L1-(GT)(n) locus was significantly associated with teat number (p < 0.05) and that the 152-bp allele exhibited the most positive association. Our data indicate that the L1-(GT)(n) microsatellite could represent a potential DNA marker with which to increase the number of teats. Thus could help to improve production in the pig breeding industry.

AB  - Purpose This study aimed to reveal the effect of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from organic amendments on the mobilization and transport of Cd, both in dissolved form and colloid-associated form, in arable soil in the vicinity of a metallic mining area. Materials and methods Leaching experiments were conducted in an intact soil column in the absence and presence of pig manure-derived DOM under saturated conditions with a rate of 45.9 mm/h to explore the transport dynamic and potential of total Cd (Cd-Total), colloid-associated Cd (Cd-Colloid) and dissolved Cd (Cd-Dissolved). Pearson correlation, multi-linear regression and redundancy analysis were used in combination to reveal the mechanism of the dynamic variation of physicochemical factors in response to soil leaching on Cd transport. Results and discussion Soil colloid was found to be the major carrier for Cd transport during leaching in the absence of manure DOM and it dominated the transport dynamics of Cd-Total and Cd-Colloid. The presence of manure DOM largely improved the transport potential of Cd in soil, with an increase by mean factors of 1.76 and 2.24 for the leached mass of Cd-Total and Cd-Colloid, respectively. Solution pH became the dominant factor determining the transport dynamics of Cd-Total and Cd-Colloid in the presence of manure DOM. The increase of solution pH following the injection of manure DOM induced the mobilization of soil colloid, which further led to the increased leached mass of Cd-Colloid. Additionally, the resultant modification of surface negative potential especially of fine colloids by manure DOM improved the enrichment factor of Cd on soil colloid (EFCd/colloid) from 32.6 mg/kg to 43.4 mg/kg, which was the major mechanism for the intensified dominant role of soil colloid in the transport of Cd in soil in the presence of manure DOM. Conclusions These findings highlighted the critical role of manure DOM in the intensified mobilization of soil colloids as well as the transport of Cd in soil upon leaching mainly through the elevation of solution pH and EFCd/colloid, providing new insights in shallow groundwater protection in the vicinity of mining areas and/or site remediation scenarios elsewhere.

AB  - In most male mammals, testis undergoes increased proliferation activity and the onset of spermato-genesis during pubertal development. However, their gene expression patterns and roles in sheep remain unclear. Therefore, we used Illumina Hiseq 2000 sequencing to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from 0, 30, 60, 90,120,150 and 180 postnatal days and characterize the transcriptional level of sheep testicular development. Among them, the DEGs changed the most in 90-150 stages. a total of 2546 (1454 up and 1092 down) and 6867 (4683 up and 2184 down) DEGs were identified in D120 vs. D90 and D150 vs. D120, respectively. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that in earlier pubertal development, testis showed higher gene expression in organ morphogenesis, vasculogenesis, neuro-genesis and hormone secretion, while in later pubertal development, genes with higher expression mainly concentrated in regulating spermatogenesis process. These results indicated that testis devel-opment undergoes the transition from organ growth to spermatogenesis and the genes related to hor-mone secretion were expressed highly earlier than spermatogenesis during pubertal process. In addition, we found several genes such as ZFP36, TNF, HSD3B1, HSD11B2 played key roles in androgen secretion and SPAG family, SYCP family, SPATA family, SPO11, CABYR, TNP1, TNP2 and CFAP43 performed functions during spermatogenesis process. Taken together, multi-genes cooperation prompt testis development in pu-bertal process. Our transcriptional atlas of sheep testis provides a comprehensive insight about testicular development and pubertal process. (c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Understanding species' reproductive biology is important for animal propagation, and the non-invasive technique of measuring fecal progesterone is a useful method for assessing reproductive health in wildlife. In this study, ovarian cycles of the captive bantengs and reproductive health of the reintroduced individuals were evaluated by assessing fecal hormone metabolites. A year-round examination of the ovarian cycles of four female bantengs (Bos javanicus birmanicus) housed ex situ was conducted by fecal progesterone metabolites detection. Furthermore, the means of fecal progesterone level were compared between females housed under human care and reintroduced individuals. Results revealed year-round estrous cycles in ex-situ females, unless interrupted by pregnancy. Average fecal progesterone metabolites (mean +/- standard error of mean [SEM]) during the luteal phase of the four females (F1, F3, F4 and F8) were 1227.42 +/- 167.45, 385.80 +/- 46.55, 632.59 +/- 44.19, and 872.4 +/- 136.8 ng/g of dry feces, with average estrous cycle intervals of 21.14 +/- 1.17 days. Mean baseline concentrations of fecal progesterone metabolites were 594.35 +/- 422.59, 93.12 +/- 51.71, 216.90 +/- 64.92 and 166.17 +/- 113.45 ng/g of dry feces, respectively. Mean fecal progesterone levels were approximately 4-fold greater (P < 0.001) during pregnancy than the non-pregnant period (pregnancy: 2399.35 +/- 317.27 ng/g; non-pregnancy: 675.31 +/- 107.8 ng/g). Mean progesterone concentration was higher (P = 0.028) in reintroduced females than in ex-situ individuals. This study advances the understanding about banteng reproductive biology, information that is critical for assessing reproductive health of both captive and reintroduced populations.

AB  - Blame attribution, the process of assigning responsibility for a negative event, has critical implications for managing human-wildlife conflict (HWC). This study advances understandings of blame attribution in human-elephant conflict (HEC) on the island of Borneo. Specifically, we advance theory on how internal (villager-related), and external (societal) attributions influence HEC and villagers' willingness to participate in its mitigation efforts. We conducted surveys with villagers living in and near elephant habitats who have experienced HEC firsthand. We collected data on participants' attributions of blame for HEC, dividing them into internal and external factors, as well as their willingness to engage in HEC mitigation actions. Findings reveal that villagers attribute blame to both external factors, such as global demand for products cultivated in elephant habitat, and internal factors, including local misunderstandings of elephant behavior. Additionally, villagers who blamed external factors expressed a greater willingness to engage in HEC mitigation efforts. These findings underscore the importance of blame attribution in shaping attitudes toward HEC mitigation. Villagers' propensity to engage in mitigation actions varies based on whether they attributed blame for HEC to external or internal factors. The study highlights the need to address socio-political and environmental drivers of HEC in Sabah, Borneo, Malaysia. Acknowledging external attributions may foster local participation in conflict mitigation efforts by leveraging underlying motives that gave rise to the source of blame in our study.

AB  - Conflicts between people and wildlife, often termed human-wildlife conflicts, are a global issue that can require complex solutions. However, another significant, frequently overlooked cause for concern within this context is the conflicts that can arise between stakeholders with varying interests, perspectives or goals regarding wildlife management and conservation. Such human-human conflicts can hamper the success of wildlife conservation initiatives outside protected areas. These conflicts frequently serve as proxies for the underlying socioeconomic and political tensions between stakeholders with divergent wildlife management goals. Using a social constructionist approach and a qualitative case study, this study investigates how diverse stakeholders-namely, agriculturalists, conservationists, foragers and safari operators-in Chapoto Ward, northern Zimbabwe, construct images of each other during conflicts over wildlife management. The findings reveal that stakeholder groups socially constructed one another as powerful outsiders, ignorant and inconsiderate, habitat destroyers and poachers, and uncaring, greedy and selfish. These social constructions were driven by differing agendas, beliefs, priorities and values regarding wildlife management, competing land-use activities, and socioeconomic and political interests. This study recommends that wildlife managers develop an objective understanding of the competing constructions of each stakeholder group and incorporate these insights into wildlife management policy and conflict resolution processes.

AB  - Radio collars have been used to examine the spatial ecology of all North American ungulates, but are rarely used on feral horses due to concerns that they may cause injury. Due to public concerns for animal welfare, an alternative to radio collars for tracking feral horses, particularly stallions, over the short term would be useful. We developed a method of attaching a global positioning system (GPS) transmitter to feral horse tails, and provide step by step instructions so that others may apply this method. We braided the tail and affixed a transmitter tag to the braid with epoxy, cable ties, and an attachment cord run through the braid. Between 2016 and 2017 we fitted 114 VHF or VHF-GPS tags in the tails of free-roaming feral horses in western Utah. From when tags were fitted to September 2020 tag retention time ranged from <1 to 36 months (n = 111, mean = 8.50 +/- SD 6.39 months). We found that our braided, tail-mounted transmitter tags can provide a viable alternative to radio collars for meeting shorter-term data collection needs once data transmission difficulties are overcome.

AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are known as plants' mutualists to enhance plant growth, but their impact on the quality-related metabolites in Camellia sinensis still needs to be studied. In this study, the 2-year-old potted C. sinensis cv. 'Longjing 43 ' was inoculated with AMF Rhizophagus irregularis to examine the effect of AMF colonization for 3 months on plant growth, photosynthesis, and changes in metabolomics and associated gene expression in the shoots and roots of tea plants. The results showed that AMF not only promoted the growth of tea plants but also significantly up-regulated the total contents of flavonoids and free amino acids, especially the anthocyanins, flavanols, GABA, and arginine. Consistently, the expression of genes such as F3H, DFR, LAR, ANR, UFGT, GDH, and GS in tea shoots was induced by AMF. Further studies found that transcription factors MYBs and HY5, as well as phytohormone strigolactones, were induced by AMF, which may participate in the regulatory mechanism controlling the metabolism of tea-quality compounds. These findings revealed regulatory mechanisms through which AMF affected tea quality and provided a theoretical basis for the application of AMF in tea gardens to improve the economic value and health benefits of tea.

AB  - To study the role of orexin A in the reproductive regulation of Mongolian sheep, ovine ovarian granulosa cells were cultured in vitro. The cells were divided into groups after luteinization, the experimental group was given orexin A and the transcriptome was sequenced together with that of the control group. The different genes related to reproduction were screened out. qRT-PCR, western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to verify the selected genes and detect the effect on progesterone secretion. In total, 123 differentially expressed genes were obtained by sequencing. Six genes with high expression related to reproduction (PRRT2, ABCG1, SOX4, TBX3, ID1 and ATP8) were screened. The results of qRT-PCR were consistent with those of sequencing; western blot and ELISA were used to verify the protein levels of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) and its related PRRT2 and ABCG1, and to detect their effect on progesterone secretion. Validation results were consistent with those of qRT-PCR and sequencing. The experimental group was given orexin A and compared with the control group. Expression of PRRT2 protein was significantly increased (P < 0.05), ABCG1 protein expression was significantly decreased (P < 0.05), StAR expression was significantly increased (P < 0.05), and progesterone secretion was significantly increased (P < 0.05). The results showed that orexin A promoted the expression of StAR by upregulating PRRT2 and downregulating ABCG1, therefore affecting secretion of progesterone. Gene expression characteristics of orexin A affecting progesterone secretion were preliminarily explored; this study provides a theoretical basis for further study on signalling pathways and reproductive regulation in Mongolian sheep.

AB  - Eastern Beaufort Sea belugas face threats from increasing vessel traffic and decreasing availability of Arctic cod driven by climate change. This necessitates an improved understanding of the environmental drivers of their foraging habitat suitability to make predictions on the consequences of climate change and to inform management decisions. We incorporated animal behaviour into habitat suitability models through comparing the locations of dives associated with foraging with randomly selected locations to quantify summer habitat preferences. We tested whether environmental drivers associated with foraging dives varied between months (July/August) and years (2018/2019). Seafloor depth (350-750 m) was the most important variable determining foraging habitat suitability and was consistent between years. Studies on beluga diet alongside these results suggest that foraging habitat suitability is primarily driven by the presence of Arctic cod. Belugas consistently targeted bathymetric regimes irrespective of ice conditions, suggesting that sites in the Beaufort Sea and Arctic Archipelago may maintain suitable foraging habitat under near-future changes in sea ice. As vessel traffic is predicted to increase in these regions as seasonal sea ice declines, these results can be incorporated into management decisions to identify areas of conservation interest to mitigate possible acoustic threats to beluga whales.

AB  - Simple Summary The Daglic breed of sheep is fat-tailed, dual-purpose, and resistant to harsh environmental conditions in Turkiye. This research aimed to estimate (co) variance components and genetic parameters for pre- and post-weaning growth traits in Daglic sheep, considering the direct additive genetic, maternal genetic, and maternal permanent environmental effects with different statistical models. This study revealed moderate heritabilities for pre- and post-weaning growth variables of Daglic sheep. The genetic variation identified in this study suggests that selective breeding could yield favorable outcomes in the early growth of Daglic sheep in Turkiye.Abstract The goal of this study was to estimate (co) variance components and genetic parameters for pre- and post-weaning growth traits in Daglic sheep, considering the direct additive genetic, maternal genetic, and maternal permanent environmental effects, with different statistical models. The information of 21,735 native Daglic lambs born between 2011 and 2021 was used to estimate (co) variance components by the Average Information-Restricted Maximum Likelihood algorithm. The results showed that the most suitable model was Model 3 for birth weight (BW), average daily gain (ADG), and weaning weight (WW). Model 4 was the most appropriate for weight at three (W3), weight at six (W6), and weight at twelve months of age (W12). The direct heritabilities for BW, W3, ADG, WW, W6, and W12 were 0.35 +/- 0.02, 0.36 +/- 0.03, 0.27 +/- 0.02, 0.22 +/- 0.02, 0.47 +/- 0.05, and 0.47 +/- 0.05, respectively. Genetic and phenotypic correlations amongst the traits were in the range of 0.103 +/- 0.008 to 0.995 +/- 0.002. These results can be used for the improvement of growth traits in the Daglic breed of sheep through selection.

AB  - The bottlenose wedgefish Rhynchobatus australiae has experienced substantial population declines throughout its range. However, there is a lack of life history information (age, growth, and maturity) available for this species to inform conservation and management efforts. A total of 48 R. australiae samples were purchased from 2 fishing ports in Singapore between July 2018-July 2019. Species identification was confirmed by mtDNA barcoding using the NADH2 region. Length of specimens ranged from 506-1645 mm total length (TL), and ages ranged from 0-11 yr. Multi-model analysis was used to estimate growth parameters using a Bayesian approach with informative priors. The von Bertalanffy model was the best fitting growth model for the combined sexes (L infinity = 2814 mm TL; L0 = 517 mm TL; k = 0.07 yr-1), for females only (L infinity = 3053 mm TL; L0 = 504 mm TL; k = 0.06 yr-1), and for males only (L infinity = 2741 mm TL; L0 = 497 mm TL; k = 0.07 yr-1). Preliminary results indicate that females and males may mature at different ages and lengths, with females (A50 = 3.25 yr; L50 = 1014 mm TL) matured younger and at smaller sizes, than males (A50 = 5.03 yr; L50 = 1197 mm TL). R. australiae has an estimated theoretical longevity of 40 and 47 yr for males and females, respectively. This study provides the first preliminary species-specific life history information for R. australiae, suggesting that this species in Southeast Asian waters is slow-growing. This information will further the biological knowledge available for this species and can be used to help design effective management and conservation measures.

AB  - The Botanic Garden of Pisa was established in 1543 as a teaching tool and research facility. As with the vast majority of its sister institutions, it focuses on plant collections. However, for a short time in the first half of the XIX century, the Botanic Garden exhibited a living giraffe, a cow, and a calf. Due to the transient nature of the exhibition, it could have easily gone unnoticed but for the fortuitous representation of the animals in a drawing of the same period and for sparse notes archived in the libraries of Pisa University. Furthermore, a XIX-century publication on the morphological and behavioural traits of three antelopes indirectly suggests that those animals had been kept in the Botanic Garden for research purposes. This paper presents the evidence of the living animal display in the Botanic Garden of Pisa and the context in which it was collected.

AB  - China has the most abundant tea resources in the world. In oder to scrutinize superior accessions suitable for popularization and planting, the quality characteristics of distinctive tea resources were analyzed by examining their key evaluation indexes and comprehensive evaluation methods. In this study, 29 indexes of 47 tea germplasms were detected, including agronomic characters, chemical compositions, quality of green tea and stress resistance. The key evaluation indexes were selected by factor analysis and cluster analysis, whereas the weight value of the indexes was determined by analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and entropy weight method. Furthermore, the comprehensive evaluation of tea varieties was carried out by grey correlation degree and entropy weight method. Our results showed that drastic differences of character indexes existed among tea varieties, and the 29 character indexes demonstrated complex information overlapping with each other. After simplification, 12 key evaluation indexes, namely score of green tea quality, total free amino acids, growth potential, water extract, yield, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), epigallocatechin (EGC), one bud one leaf stage, insect resistance, germination density, bud leaf color, and gallic acid (GA) were chosen. The weight value of each index was also determined. Since the rank of some varieties in these two evaluation methods was different, based on the comprehensive evaluation results of grey correlation degree method and entropy weight method, it was more rational to combine these two evaluation methods in selecting superior varieties. Consequently, nine excellent tea varieties were selected. This study not only provides an innovative method for comprehensive evaluation of tea resources, but also an approach to promote genetic improvement of the selected excellent tea varieties.

AB  - The exotic southern cattle fever tick, Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus (Canestrini) (Ixodida: Ixodidae), since its eradication from the United States in 1943, made a strong incursion into Texas, beginning 2016. The pest is arguably the most economically detrimental ectoparasite of cattle, Bos taurus L., worldwide. Current R. (B.) microplus control mostly relies on conventional synthetic acaricides to which the ixodid has been developing resistance. Our study demonstrates that commercially available desiccant dust products, with and without bioactive botanical additives, are strongly lethal, when applied dry, against larval R. (B.) microplus in the laboratory, and after being released on dust-treated cattle. Deadzone (renamed Celite 610, a diatomaceous earth product), Drione (silica gel + pyrethrins + piperonyl butoxide synergist), and EcoVia (silica gel + thyme oil), each prophylactically prevented larval R. (B.) microplus from attaching to and feeding on stanchioned calves. Desiccant dust-based products are less likely than conventional synthetic acaricides to decline in terms of efficacy as a result of ixodid resistance, and other desiccant dust advantages, including extended residual, flexibility in terms of application methods, environmental, animal, and human safety, and possible compatibility with organic, or 'green', production systems, are discussed. We anticipate that the desiccant dusts we evaluated, and others not included in this study (e.g., kaolin, perlite, and silica gel) will be effective when used with other control tactics in integrated pest management approaches for controlling R. (B.) microplus (and other ixodid species).

AB  - Simple Summary
   Upon insect herbivory plants release herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) to elicit either direct antiherbivore defenses by intoxicating the herbivore or indirect defenses by attracting natural enemies. Insect herbivores use sophisticated detoxification systems, including cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s), to cope with plant defensive chemicals and insecticides. Many behaviors of insects are manipulated to a large extent by olfaction. However, few studies concern the role of olfaction in insect adaptation to xenobiotics. In this study we show that olfactory exposure of Helicoverpa armigera, a devastating pest of many important crop plants that has developed high levels of resistance to various insecticides, to four plant volatile compounds limonene, nerolidol, 2-heptanone and cis-3-hexenyl acetate dramatically increases larval tolerance to carbamate insecticide methomyl. Inhibition of P450s by piperonyl butoxide (PBO), a well-known P450 inhibitor, compromises the effects of volatile exposure. Exposure to the four volatiles upregulates multiple detoxification systems, including cytochrome P450s. Our findings indicate that induction of insecticide-detoxifying P450s by plant volatiles prior to actually inflicting plant damage may confer insect larvae more time to pre-activate insect detoxification systems prior to the ingestion or contact of insecticides, leading to increased larval tolerance to insecticides.
   Plants release an array of volatile chemicals into the air to communicate with other organisms in the environment. Insect attack triggers emission of herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs). How insect herbivores use these odors to plan their detoxification systems is vital for insect adaptation to environmental xenobiotics. Here we show that the larvae of Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner), a broadly polyphagous lepidopteran herbivore, have the capacity to use plant volatiles as cues to upregulate multiple detoxification systems, including cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s), for detoxification of insecticides. Olfactory exposure of the fifth instars to two terpene volatiles limonene and nerolidol, and two green-leaf volatiles 2-heptanone and cis-3-hexenyl acetate significantly reduced larval susceptibility to the insecticide methomyl. However, larval pretreatment with piperonyl butoxide (PBO), a known P450 inhibitor, neutralized the effects of volatile exposure. Furthermore, larval exposure to the four plant volatiles enhanced activities of P450 enzymes in midguts and fatbodies, and upregulated expression of CYP6B2, CYP6B6 and CYP6B7, P450s involved in detoxification of the insecticide. Larval exposure to 2-heptanone and limonene volatiles also enhanced activities of glutathione-s-transferase and carboxylesterase. Our findings suggest that olfactory exposure to HIPVs enhances larval insecticide tolerance via induction of detoxification P450s.

AB  - As one of the representative fruits of China, apple plays an important role in the overall agricultural production system. However, the large amount of chemical inputs in apple production has potential detrimental impacts on the environment and human health, and thus threatens the achievement of sustainable development goals. Therefore, a comprehensive evaluation of the environmental burden (EB) and human capital (refer to human lives) loss (HCL) caused by apple production system (APS) is urgently needed to suggest directions for improvement. A method widely used to measure impacts from both the use of resources and the emissions generated in the agriculture sector is the life cycle assessment (LCA). In this study, the EB and HCL caused by the APS have been determined from two phases using the LCA methodology in China. The results show that the leading cause of EB in the agricultural materials' production phase is nitrogen fertilizer (N) production, and in the farming phase is chemical fertilizer use. The top 5 major pollutants that cause potential damage to human health in APS are carbon dioxide (CO2), ammonia (NH3), nitrogen dioxide (N2O), nitrate (NO3), and sulfur oxides (SOx). The human health risk (HHR) is 5.84 x 10(-2) disability-adjusted life year to cultivate 1 ha of the apple orchard 1 year, and the corresponding HCL is about 4230 Chinese yuan (CNY). Under the scenario analysis of a 15% reduction in chemical fertilizer use and a 20% increase in organic fertilizer (mainly dried sheep dung) use, most of the environmental impact categories have a decreasing trend, and the HCL decreased by 438 CNY of 10.36%. Therefore, chemical fertilizer (especially N) is the most critical environmental hotspot in APS, and our results suggest that the replacement of chemical fertilizers by organic fertilizers is an effective solution to reduce the potential EB and HCL and improve the sustainability of the APS.

AB  - Since the introduction of DNA-based architectures, in the past decade, DNA tetrahedrons have aroused great interest. Applications of such nanostructures require structural control, especially in the perspective of their possible functionalities. In this work, an integrated approach for structural characterization of a tetrahedron structure is proposed with a focus on the fundamental biophysical aspects driving the assembly process. To address such an issue, spin-labeled DNA sequences are chemically synthesized, self-assembled, and then analyzed by Continuous-Wave (CW) and pulsed Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. Interspin distance measurements based on PELDOR/DEER techniques combined with molecular dynamics (MD) thus revealed unexpected dynamic heterogeneity and flexibility of the assembled structures. The observation of flexibility in these ordered 3D structures demonstrates the sensitivity of this approach and its effectiveness in accessing the main dynamic and structural features with unprecedented resolution.

AB  - Biological control using plant-beneficial fungi has gained considerable interest as a sustainable method for pest management, by priming the plant for enhanced defense against pathogens and insect herbivores. However, despite promising outcomes, little is known about how different fungal strains mediate these beneficial effects. In this study, we evaluated whether inoculation of tomato seeds with the plant-beneficial fungi Beauveria bassiana ARSEF 3097, Metarhizium brunneum ARSEF 1095 and Trichoderma harzianum T22 affected the plant's volatile organic compound (VOC) profile and the host-choice behavior of Nesidiocoris tenuis, an emerging pest species in NW-European tomato cultivation, and the related zoophytophagous biocontrol agent Macrolophus pygmaeus. Results indicated that fungal inoculation did not significantly alter the VOC composition of tomato plants. However, in a two-choice cage assay where female insects were given the option to select between control plants and fungus-inoculated plants, N. tenuis preferred control plants over M. brunneum-inoculated plants. Nearly 72% of all N. tenuis individuals tested chose the control treatment. In all other combinations tested, no significant differences were found for none of the insects. We conclude that inoculation of tomato with plant-beneficial fungi had limited effects on plant volatile composition and host-choice behavior of insects. However, the observation that N. tenuis was deterred from the crop when inoculated with M. brunneum and attracted to non-inoculated plants may provide new opportunities for future biocontrol based on a push-pull strategy.

AB  - Microplastic particles are ubiquitous in our environment, having entered the air, the water, the soil, and ultimately our food chain. Owing to their small size, these particles can potentially enter the bloodstream and accumulate in the organs. To detect microplastics using existing methods, they must first be isolated. The aim of this study was to develop a non-destructive method for efficiently and affordably isolating plastic particles. We investigated the digestion of kidney, lung, liver, and brain samples from pigs. Kidney samples were analyzed using light microscopy after incubation with proteinase K, pepsin/pancreatin, and 10% potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution. Various KOH:tissue ratios were employed for the digestion of lung, liver, and brain samples. Additionally, we examined the effect of 10% KOH solution on added polystyrene microplastics using scanning electron microscopy. Our findings revealed that a 10% KOH solution is the most suitable for dissolving diverse organ samples, while enzymatic methods require further refinement. Moreover, we demonstrated that commonly used 1 mu m polystyrene particles remain unaffected by 10% KOH solution even after 76 h of incubation. Digestion by KOH offers a simple and cost-effective approach for processing organ samples and holds potential for isolating plastic particles from meat products.

AB  - The present study sought to intensify oestrus symptoms in heat-stressed pre-pubertal Murrah buffalo heifers. The first experiment aimed at lowering the blood cortisol level. Twenty pre-pubertal buffalo heifers approximately 36-40 months of age were randomly allocated to four groups of five buffaloes. Group Gly received 100 ml glycerol orally for 8 days (day 0 is the start of treatments), group Gly-E received intra-muscular injections of 500 mg tocopherol (vitamin E activity) and 150 mg sodium selenite on alternate days (four treatments) in addition to treatments received by group Gly, group Gly-E + B-Ch received intra-muscular injections of vitamin B-complex and choline daily for 8 days in addition to the treatments received by group Gly-E. The control group Co-1 did not received any treatments. Blood cortisol and glucose level was measured on day 7 post-treatment. The second experiment sought to test the effect of lowering the blood cortisol level and progesterone priming on the intensity of oestrus symptoms in heat-stressed pre-pubertal buffalo heifers. Eighty buffaloes were allocated into four groups of twenty buffaloes. P4 group received intra-vaginal progesterone CIDR for 5 days (day 0 is the day of start of treatment). Gly-E group received the same treatment as in the first experiment for 7 days (day 0-6) and P4 + Gly-E received the combination of P4 and Gly-E groups. The control group Co-2 did not receive any treatments; however, on day 6, all groups received intra-muscular injection of 2 mg estradiol benzoate. The buffaloes were graded for oestrus symptoms on the basis of mucus discharge (A-scanty and B-copious), vulvar redness (slightly pink and moist-A and deep red and moist-B), ferning (nil or poor-A and good with arborization-B) and cellularity of cervical mucus (Type A goblet cells with round nucleus and abundant cytoplasm and Type B goblet cells with cylindrical nucleus and scanty cytoplasm). The blood glucose level (mean +/- SEM) of Gly group on day 7 of treatment in experiment 1 was 58.3 +/- 0.4 mg/dl that was significantly greater than Co-1 (52.4 +/- 0.4 mg/dl), Gly-E (53.5 +/- 0.8 mg/dl) and Gly-E + B-Ch (52.7 +/- 0.6 mg/dl) groups; however, the difference was found to be non-significant among Co-1, Gly-E and Gly-E + B-Ch groups. The cortisol level (mean +/- SEM) on day 7 in groups Gly (11.4 +/- 0.6 ng/ml), Gly-E (8.1 +/- 0.5 ng/ml) and Gly-E + B-Ch (7.5 +/- 0.4 ng/ml) was significantly lower than groups Co-1 (15.5 +/- 0.3 ng/ml), though the difference between groups Gly-E and Gly-E + B-Ch was non-significant and the level in group Gly-E significantly lower than Gly. Thus, the combination of vitamin E and selenium along with glycerol had the best effect in the reduction of blood cortisol level in heat-stressed buffaloes. In the second experiment the blood estradiol level on day 7 in all groups was around 40 pg/ml. Cortisol reduction (group Gly-E) improved oestrus symptoms (mucus discharge and ferning) compared to control, but when compared to group P4 showed non-significant difference with respect to mucus discharge, vulvar redness and ferning of cervical mucus.
   However, when cortisol reduction treatments were combined with progesterone priming (group P4 + Gly-E) oestrus symptoms were improved with respect to mucus discharge and ferning thus, combination treatment had synergistic effect. This effect was also observed with cellularity of cervical mucus, where combination treatment group P4 + Gly-E produced cervical mucus with significantly lower percentage of Type B cells compared to group P4 and group Gly-E. Thus, administration glycerol and vitamin E selenium combination reduces blood cortisol level and along with progesterone priming can be effective to improve the oestrus symptoms of buffaloes during the hot summer months.

AB  - We report biosecurity interceptions of Oryctes rhinoceros in Australia, New Zealand, Guam, United States, and other jurisdictions to provide the first such published assessment for this highly invasive species. Between 2003 and July 2023 New Zealand found O. rhinoceros 13 times. Between 2002 and July 2023 Australia found Oryctes rhinoceros 14 times. Since 2017 inspections in Guam detected individuals twice. Between 2003 and 2014, beetles were found eight times at ports in the United States. No credible interceptions were made in the European Union. Four other intercepts were reported from two other jurisdictions. There were very little commonalities among the intercept data. All but one detection were of adults, and of the 14 adults that were sexed, eight were female and six were male. From the Australian data, which included month of detection, there was no seasonality associated with detections. Detections were associated with a broad array of commodities or situations. Oryctes rhinoceros appears to be a generalist passenger, being accidentally transported by a wide variety of means at any time. This finding indicates that there is little possibility of focusing on any specific commodity, packaging, vessel, or season to detect accidental transport of this species. Instead, biosecurity vigilance is required on all goods and vessels arriving at, or leaving, destinations.

AB  - Simple Summary The quality of mutton is closely related to the development of the entire animal husbandry and sheep industry. The present work quantified the difference in meat quality between Chaka (CK) sheep and (Tibetan) TB sheep through the technology of transcriptomics, combined with metabolomics, to identify genes and metabolites, which are related to meat quality. Our study found that TB sheep have better nutritional value, while CK sheep have better flavor. The GPAT2, PLPP2, AGPAT1, PNPLA2, and GPAT4 genes were identified as key genes that regulate glycerophospholipid metabolism and correlate with meat color, texture, and flavor. Our study comprehensively compared the longissimus thoracis et lumborum (LTL) muscle of CK sheep and TB sheep and explored the difference in meat quality at the molecular level, which may provide a strategy for improving meat quality from a molecular perspective. This study aimed to comprehensively evaluate the characteristics in the longissimus thoracis et lumborum (LTL) muscle of Chaka (CK) sheep and Tibetan (TB) sheep, and transcriptomics-metabolomics association analysis was used to find the possible genes, differential metabolites, and significant differential metabolic pathways that lead to meat quality differences. Based on the researched results, the nutritional quality of meat, including the contents of ether extract (11.95% vs. 10.56%), unsaturated fatty acid (51.20% vs. 47.69%), and polyunsaturated fatty acid (5.71% vs. 3.97%), were better in TB sheep than in CK sheep, while the CK sheep has better muscle fiber characteristics, such as the total number (62 vs. 45) and muscle fiber density (1426.54 mm(2) vs. 1158.77 mm(2)) and flavor. Omics research has shown that the key differential metabolites and metabolic pathways were dominated by amino acid metabolism, particularly the glutathione metabolism, taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, and lipid metabolism-related pathways, such as glycerophospholipid metabolism and the sphingolipid signaling pathway. The intermediate metabolite sn-Glycerol 3-phosphoethanolamine played a key role in determining sheep meat quality, which was regulated by GPAT2, PLPP2, AGPAT1, PNPLA2, and GPAT4 and correlated with meat color, texture, and flavor. Overall, these results will provide effective information and more evidence to support further exploration of valuable biomarkers of meat quality.

AB  - For many plant-pathogenic or endophytic fungi, production of mycotoxins, which are toxic to humans, may present a fitness gain. However, associations between mycotoxin production and plant pathogenicity or virulence is inconsistent and difficult due to the complexity of these host-pathogen interactions and the influences of environmental and insect factors. Aflatoxin receives a lot of attention due to its potent toxicity and carcinogenicity but the connection between aflatoxin production and pathogenicity is complicated by the pathogenic ability and prevalence of nonaflatoxigenic isolates in crops. Other toxins directly aid fungi in planta, trichothecenes are important virulence factors, and ergot alkaloids limit herbivory and fungal consumption due to insect toxicity. We review a panel discussion at the American Phytopathological Society's Plant Health 2021 conference, which gathered diverse experts representing different research sectors, career stages, ethnicities, and genders to discuss the diverse roles of mycotoxins in the lifestyles of filamentous fungi of the families Clavicipitaceae, Trichocomaceae (Eurotiales), and Nectriaceae (Hypocreales).

AB  - Conflicts between biodiversity conservation and other human activities are multifaceted. Understanding farmer preferences for various conflict mitigation strategies is therefore critical. We developed a novel interactive game around farmer land management decisions across 18 villages in Gabon to examine responses to three elephant conflict mitigation options: use of elephant deterrent methods, flat-rate subsidy, and agglomeration payments rewarding coordinated action for setting land aside for elephants. We found that all three policies significantly reduced participants' inclinations to engage in lethal control. Use of deterrents and agglomeration payments were also more likely to reduce decisions to kill elephants in situations where levels of social equity were higher. Only the two monetary incentives increased farmers' predisposition to provide habitats for elephants, suggesting that incentive-based instruments were conducive to pro-conservation behavior; different subsidy levels did not affect responses. Likewise, neither participants' socioeconomic characteristics nor their real-life experiences of crop damage by elephants affected game decisions. Killing behavior in the games was 64% lower in villages influenced by protected areas than in villages surrounded by logging concessions, highlighting the need to address conservation conflicts beyond protected areas. Our study shows the importance of addressing underlying social conflicts, specifically equity attitudes, prior to, or alongside addressing material losses.

AB  - Proper disposal of animal mortalities is essential in preventing disease transmission and protecting air and water quality. Composting is often used to manage both routine and diseased poultry mortalities. The objectives of this pilot-scale study were to test if adding wood-based biochar to poultry mortality compost could 1) increase compost temperatures, 2) reduce ammonia emissions, 3) decrease leachate?s organic content, and 4) enhance the nutrient content of the final compost. Biochar ratios at 0, 1, 5, 10, and 15% (fresh weight) were co-composted with chicken mortalities and woodchips for 11 weeks (three heating cycles). Results indicated that the biochar amendment significantly increased (3.4?7 ?C) the maximum temperatures reached during the composting compared to those of control test units without biochar. Biochar amendments at 5, 10, and 15% resulted in the prolonged periods of temperature over 67 ?C to inactivate the highly pathogenic Avian influenza (H7N1), and a reduced cumulative chemical oxygen demand of the leachate by 80.4 ? 3.07%, on average. Biochar amendment at 10 and 15% significantly reduced the cumulative ammonia emissions by 40.4% and 56.8%, respectively. Biochar amendment at 15% increased (34.7%) the total nitrogen content of the final compost. It was concluded that adding biochar, at a minimum of a 5% ratio, is recommended to improve the poultry mortality composting process.

AB  - The shark-like rays (Rhinopristiformes) are among the most threatened species of cartilaginous fishes. The guitarfishes (Rhinobatidae) are one of 5 families in the order, with 62% of species assessed as Vulnerable or higher by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Species-specific fisheries and conservation efforts have been limited, however, due to unresolved taxonomic issues and poor species descriptions. Presently, there are 3 described species of Rhinobatos from the southwestern Indian Ocean (SWIO): R. austini, R. holcorhynchus, and R. nudidorsalis. These 3 species have been mistaken for one another and are assessed as Data Deficient by the IUCN. Since the descriptions of R. austini and R. nudidorsalis, additional specimens have become available and a rediagnosis of these 3 species is required to clarify their taxonomic status. In the present study, morphometrics from 4 additional congener Indian Ocean species of Rhinobatos assessed by the IUCN were analyzed and serve as comparative material. In addition to a traditional morphological analysis, morphometrics from all 7 species were analyzed using a principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Results show distinct clusters for the SWIO Rhinobatos and indicate the nasal region is effective in differentiating species. R. austini, R. holcorhynchus, and R. nudidorsalis are confirmed as distinct species and are rediagnosed based on new material. These rediagnoses provide taxonomic clarity for SWIO Rhinobatos and will aid in species-specific identification, leading to improvements in conservation and fisheries monitoring and management.

AB  - Louse flies from the family Hippoboscidae parasitise birds and mammals. Both males and females feed on the blood and carry many dangerous diseases. Representatives of the genus Ornithoctona are full-winged, widely specialised parasites of birds. Before this study it was considered, that the genus Ornithoctona includes 12 species. Among them, only two species were recorded in the Palaearctic (from Kazakhstan, Russian Far East, and Kuril Islands). Other ones inhabit Africa, tropical Asia, the Pacific Islands, and the New World. During the annual bird ringing in the Baikal State Nature Reserve (Russia), a new species of the genus Ornithoctona (Diptera: Hippoboscidae) (Ornithoctona zootherae sp. nov.) was collected and described. Ornithoctona zootherae sp. nov. was found on Zoothera dauma, a common species, that breeds in Eastern Siberia and winters in China. Ornithoctona zootherae sp. nov. differs from all known Palearctic and Asian Ornithoctona species in larger body size (length of the head + thorax is 5.5-6.0 mm). Additionally, the new species differs from O. plicata in the wingsetulae, while O. plicata has no wing-setulae. It differs from O. soror and O. australaisiae in the ventral and dorsal view of the abdominal apices. A single key for all World species of the genus Ornithoctona is composed.

AB  - Background: Metabolic syndrome (MS) refers to a cluster of metabolic disorders characterized by systemic chronic inflammation. Er Miao San (EMS) is a classic traditional Chinese medicine compound containing Phellodendron amurense and Atractylodis rhizome at a ratio of 1:1, proven to be effective against inflammatory diseases in clinical practice. Nevertheless, the precise functions of EMS in treating MS and its underlying mechanism have yet to be elucidated. Purpose: This study focuses on the intervention effects of EMS on high humidity exposure and high sugar-fat diet (H-HSF)-induced MS in pigs. Study Design: Blood biochemical indices and metabolome analysis were employed to confirm the successful establishment of the MS model, and the preliminary evaluation of the intervention effect of EMS was conducted. Subsequently, a parallel microbiota analysis of the tongue and cecum was combined with metabolomic analysis, histopathologic examination, and other molecular biological detection to further assess the administration mechanism of EMS. Results: The results demonstrated that EMS significantly reduced the excessive weight gain rate, fat accumulation, hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, and systemic inflammation while improving serum metabolic disorder in MS pigs. Moreover, microbiota analysis indicates that EMS restored the diversity and composition of oral-gut microbiota by increasing the proportions of Lactobacillus (gut), Roseburia (gut), Faecalibacterium (gut), CF231 (gut), Streptococcus (gut), Prevotella (gut), while decreasing those of Chryseobacterium (oral), Corynebacterium (oral), Clostridium (oral), Oscillospira (gut), and Turicibacter (oral, gut). Subsequently, EMS up-regulated the concentrations of acetic acid, butyric acid, propionic acid, while down-regulated isobutyric acid and isovaleric acid. This resulted in a suppression of HDAC3 expression and an increase of SCL16A1 expression in the colon. Notably, the changes in acetic acid and butyric acid showed a strong correlation with gut microbiota. Additionally, EMS reduced the serum level of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and enhanced epithelial barrier integrity by inhibiting the LPS-TLR4/MyD88/NF-kappa B pathways. Conclusions: EMS was found to ameliorate MS by alleviating the dysbiosis of the oral-gut microbiota and serum metabolome, thereby improving gut barrier and reducing systemic inflammation. These findings suggest that EMS holds promise as a therapeutic agent for MS.

AB  - Background Pigs are crucial sources of meat and protein, valuable animal models, and potential donors for xenotransplantation. However, the existing reference genome for pigs is incomplete, with thousands of segments and centromeres and telomeres missing, which limits our understanding of the important traits in these genomic regions.Findings We present a near-complete genome assembly for the Jinhua pig (JH-T2T) and provide a set of diploid Jinhua reference genomes, constructed using PacBio HiFi, ONT long reads, and Hi-C reads. This assembly includes all 18 autosomes and the X and Y sex chromosomes, with only 6 gaps. It features annotations of 46.90% repetitive sequences, 33 telomeres, 17 centromeres, and 23,924 high-confident genes. Compared to the Sscrofa11.1, JH-T2T closes nearly all gaps, extends sequences by 177 Mb, predicts more intact telomeres and centromeres, and gains 799 more genes and loses 114 genes. Moreover, it enhances the mapping rate for both Western and Chinese local pigs, outperforming Sscrofa11.1 as a reference genome. Additionally, this comprehensive genome assembly will facilitate large-scale variant detection.Conclusions This study produced a near-gapless assembly of the pig genome and provides a set of haploid Jinhua reference genomes.

AB  - The red spider mite, Tetranychus macfarlanei, is a significant pest of various crops, and silicon (Si), a beneficial micronutrient, serves as a physical defense against herbivores when accumulated in plant tissues. This study examined the effects of silicon on the biology of T. macfarlanei on Lablab purpureus plants treated with 0 ppm (control), 28, and 56 ppm silicon concentrations. The results showed that silicon treatments notably affected mite development. At the highest concentration of 56 ppm Si, females exhibited the longest immature period, shortest lifespan, and shortest oviposition period. Egg production per female was highest at the 0 ppm Si level (94.62) and lowest at the 56 ppm Si concentration (42.29). Life table parameters, including the intrinsic rate of increase (r), net reproductive rate (R0), finite rate of increase (lambda), and gross reproductive rate (GRR), declined progressively with increasing silicon concentrations. Compared to the control (0 ppm Si), the highest silicon level resulted in reductions of approximately 24% in r, 55% in R0, 4% in lambda, and 27% in GRR, indicating a substantial negative impact of silicon on the reproductive potential of T. macfarlanei. These findings suggest that higher silicon levels effectively suppress T. macfarlanei populations and may be useful in integrated mite management strategies.

AB  - Vitrification is mainly used to cryopreserve female gametes. This technique allows maintaining cell viability, functionality, and developmental potential at low temperatures into liquid nitrogen at -196 degrees C. For this, the addition of cryoprotectant agents, which are substances that provide cell protection during cooling and warming, is required. However, they have been reported to be toxic, reducing oocyte viability, maturation, fertilization, and embryo development, possibly by altering cell cytoskeleton structure and chromatin. Previous studies have evaluated the effects of vitrification in the germinal vesicle, metaphase II oocytes, zygotes, and blastocysts, but the knowledge of its impact on their further embryo development is limited. Other studies have evaluated the role of actin microfilaments and chromatin, based on the fertilization and embryo development rates obtained, but not the direct evaluation of these structures in embryos produced from vitrified immature oocytes. Therefore, this study was designed to evaluate how the vitrification of porcine immature oocytes affects early embryo development by the evaluation of actin microfilament distribution and chromatin integrity. Results demonstrate that the damage generated by the vitrification of immature oocytes affects viability, maturation, and the distribution of actin microfilaments and chromatin integrity, observed in early embryos. Therefore, it is suggested that vitrification could affect oocyte repair mechanisms in those structures, being one of the mechanisms that explain the low embryo development rates after vitrification.

AB  - Background Genomic imprinting refers to expressing parent-specific genes in mammalian diploid cells. The NDN gene is maternally imprinted in humans and mice and correlates with the timing of puberty. This study aimed to investigate its imprinting status and its relationship with the onset of puberty in Dolang sheep.Methods and results In this study, cloning and sequencing obtained the NDN gene cDNA sequence of 1082 bp of Dolang sheep, coding for 325 amino acids. Similarity analysis and phylogenetic tree showed that the NDN gene conformed to the law of speciation and was highly conserved among mammals. RT-qPCR results showed the highest expression of NDN mRNA was found in the hypothalamus at puberty, and the expression was significantly increased and then significantly decreased from prepuberty to postpuberty in the hypothalamus, pituitary, and ovary and oviduct. Based on expressed single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), the NDN gene was expressed monoallelically in the tissues of adult and neonatal umbilical cords, and the expressed allele was paternally inherited. The NDN promoter region of 3400 bp was obtained by cloning and identified in monoallelic-expressing tissues (hypothalamus, ovary, spleen) as a differentially methylated region (DMR).Conclusion These findings will enrich the number of imprinted genes in sheep and suggest that the NDN gene could be a candidate gene for studying puberty initiation in Dolang sheep.

AB  - Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nanometric spherical structures, enclosed in a lipid bilayer membrane and secreted by multiple cell types under specific physiologic and pathologic conditions. Their complex cargo modulates immune cells within an inflammatory microenvironment. Milk is one of the most promising sources of EVs in terms of massive recovery, and milk extracellular vesicles (mEVs) have immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects. The aim of this study was to characterize goat mEVs' immunomodulating activities on Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and related immune genes, including cytokines, using a porcine intestinal epithelial cell line (IPEC-J2) after the establishment of a pro-inflammatory environment. IPEC-J2 was exposed for 2 h to pro-inflammatory stimuli as a model of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), namely LPS for Crohn's disease (CD) and H2O2 for ulcerative colitis (UC); then, cells were treated with goat mEVs for 48 h. RT-qPCR and ELISA data showed that cell exposure to LPS or H2O2 caused a pro-inflammatory response, with increased gene expression of CXCL8, TNFA, NOS2 and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In the LPS model, the treatment with mEVs after LPS determined the down-regulation of NOS2, MMP9, TLR5, TGFB1, IFNB, IL18 and IL12A gene expressions, as well as lower release of IL-18 in culture supernatants. At the same time, we observed the increased expression of TLR1, TLR2, TLR8 and EBI3. On the contrary, the treatment with mEVs after H2O2 exposure, the model of UC, determined the increased expression of MMP9 alongside the decrease in TGFB1, TLR8 and DEFB1, with a lower release of IL-1Ra in culture supernatants. Overall, our data showed that a 48 h treatment with mEVs after a pro-inflammatory stimulus significantly modulated the expression of several TLRs and cytokines in swine intestinal cells, in association with a decreased inflammation. These results further highlight the immunomodulatory potential of these nanosized structures and suggest their potential application in vivo.

AB  - Monitoring multiple behavioral patterns and grazing trajectories of individual sheep can provide valuable information for various aspects of livestock production. The emergence of low-cost miniature sensors, coupled with the continuous advancement of deep learning technologies, has ushered in a new generation of intelligent solutions for precision livestock farming. This study aims to explore the deployment methods of motion sensors, selection of data collection frequencies, and choice of deep learning algorithms to provide accurate classification of multiple behaviors in grazing sheep. Based on this, in conjunction with the acquired location information, the goal is to comprehend the spatiotemporal distribution of grazing sheep behaviors. Devices capable of collecting Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and location data were attached to the jaw, neck, and hind leg of sheep. Four datasets were created using IMU data with a frequency of 20 Hz and a 5 s time window from different positions (neck, neck & leg, jaw, jaw & leg). Two deep learning models, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) - Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN)-Transformer, were employed to classify six grazing sheep behaviors: walking, standing, grazing, lying, standing-ruminating, and lying-ruminating. The results indicate that by fusing data from the neck- and leg-mounted devices and utilizing the CNN-LSTM model, the accuracy reached the highest at 99.3 %. Furthermore, a comparison was made regarding the behavior classification accuracy of this fused data at different IMU data frequencies (20, 10, 5, and 1 Hz). It was found that even when the data frequency was reduced to 1 Hz, the classification accuracy for the six sheep behaviors still exceeded 96 %. Additionally, the trained model with the highest accuracy was applied to monitoring grazing sheep behavior under two different management procedures. Further analysis of the time budgets of sheep behavior revealed differences in the durations of behaviors under different management procedures. For extensively grazing sheep, location information was also monitored and combined with behavior classification results to generate the spatiotemporal distribution of sheep behavior. The technologies presented are important for gaining further insights into the health status of grazing livestock and grassland, thereby enhancing grazing management practices by informing grazing choices and optimizing grassland utilization.

AB  - Pig hair (PH), a keratinous waste, was modified by ammonium thioglycolate in a ball milling to promote its performance of Hg(II) sequestration. The ball milling broke the hydrophobic cuticle sheath and enhanced the reduction of disulfide bond, which increased the sulfydryl content of the modified PH (BTPH) from 0.07 to 11.05 mu mol/g. BTPH exhibited a significantly higher capture capacity of Hg(II) (415.4 mg/g) than PH (3.1 mg/g), as well as the commercial activated carbon (219.7 mg/g), and persisted its performance over a wide range of solution pH. Meanwhile, BTPH with a distribution coefficient of 5.703 x 105 mL/g could selectively capture Hg(II) from the water with the coexisting metal ions such as Mg(II), Cd(II) and Pb(II). Moreover, the low-cost BTPH could reduce the Hg(II) from 1.0 mg/L to well below the limit of drinkable water (2 mu g/L) in real-world samples. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and state-of-the-art characterizations illustrated that the binding of Hg(II) to sulfydryl groups was the main adsorption mechanism. Notably, BTPH decreased the mercury content of water spinaches from 24.1 to 0.50 mg/kg and thereby significantly reduced the phytotoxicity of Hg(II). This work therefore provides a sustainable way to utilize keratinous wastes for the remediation of aqueous Hg(II).

AB  - This study aims to record mites associated with the respiratory system of Columba livia Gmelin, 1789, including data of parasitological indices and of coinfections in southern Brazil. Two hundred and two specimens of C. livia were collected in the urban area in Pelotas, Rio Grande do Sul (RS) state, Brazil. Fifty-six (27.7%) birds were parasitized by Rhinonyssidae and Ereynetidae mites. Tinaminyssus columbae (Crossley, 1950) and Tinaminyssus melloi (Castro, 1948) (Rhinonyssidae) were found in nasal cavities and tracheae of the birds. Trispeleognathus striatus (Crossley, 1952) (Ereynetidae) was found in hosts' nasal cavities. The prevalence of Rhinonyssidae mites (25.2%) was significantly higher than obtained for Ereynetidae (5.9%). Coinfections only occurred in nasal cavities of 8 (3.96%) birds. This study records for the first time T. columbae and Trispeleognathus striatus parasitizing C. livia in Brazil. In addition, mite infection indices and coinfections of Rhinonyssidae and Ereynetidae mites in this Columbidae species are recorded.

AB  - Selenium (Se) is a micronutrient responsible for regulating immune, antioxidant, and reproductive processes in the body. Selenitetriglycerides are a novel, organic form of Se; to date, the effects of selenitetriglyceride supplementation have been studied only in ruminants. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of selenitetriglycerides administered to sows before parturition on the Se concentration and selected hematological and biochemical parameters, and to evaluate the efficacy of selenitetriglyceride supplementation in preventing Se deficiency in sows and piglets. The study was conducted on 12 pregnant sows and their offspring. The control group consisted of sows that did not receive the selenitetriglyceride supplement, and their offspring. The experimental group consisted of sows that were orally administered a selenitetriglyceride supplement at 0.5 mg Se kg -1 BW, 15, 10, 5, and 3 days before the parturition date, and their offspring. Blood samples for analyses of the Se concentration, morphological parameters, selected biochemical parameters (AST, ALT, TP, ALB, UREA, CREA), and GSH-Px activity were collected from sows 15, 10, 5, and 3 days before parturition and 2 days postpartum. Blood samples for analyses of the Se concentration were collected from 3-, 5-, 10-, and 15 -day -old piglets. No significant differences in hematological or biochemical parameters were observed between the groups of sows. Beginning on the fifth day of the experiment, the Se concentration and GSH-Px activity were significantly higher in the experimental than in the control group sows. During the entire experiment, Se levels were significantly higher in the experimental than in the control group piglets. The results of the study indicate that selenitetriglycerides are a safe and effective source of Se for pigs. Selenitetriglycerides are effectively transferred to offspring with the mother's milk and colostrum, and they can be administered to prevent Se deficiency in pigs.

AB  - This study investigates the effect of Licochalcone A (Lico-A), a flavonoid from licorice roots known for its anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and antioxidant properties, on NMDA-induced neurotoxicity in primary cultured rat hippocampal neurons. The study measured cell survival following NMDA and Lico-A exposure, revealing that Lico-A at a 2.5 mu g/ml significantly improved cell viability, countering the detrimental effects of NMDA. The study also analyzed synaptic changes by examining both postsynaptic density 95 (PSD95) and synaptophysin-targeted imaging, showing that Lico-A treatment resulted in a significant increase in synaptic puncta, contrasting with the reduction observed under NMDA exposure. Furthermore, levels of phosphorylated mixed lineage kinase domain-like pseudokinase (P-MLKL) and phosphorylated receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 3 (P-RIP3), key necroptosis regulators, were measured using Western blotting. The results showed an increase in P-MLKL and P-RIP3 in neurons exposed to NMDA, which was reduced following Lico-A treatment. The response of astrocyte and microglia was also evaluated by immunostaining for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (IBA-1) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). These markers exhibited heightened expression in the NMDA group, which was substantially reduced by Lico-A treatment. These findings suggest that Lico-A has neuroprotective effects against NMDA-induced neurotoxicity, potentially contributing to synaptic preservation, inhibition of neuronal necroptosis, and modulation of glial activation. Therefore, Lico-A shows promise as a neuroprotective agent for conditions associated with NMDA-related neurotoxicity.

AB  - Sea turtle egg relocation and hatchery incubation (hereafter termed ex situ incubation) is an effective strategy to protect clutches when in situ egg incubation is not viable. Nevertheless, it negatively affects the ontogenesis of male gonads and brain areas homologous to the mammalian hippocampus, as well as body size and fitness. Thus, it is imperative to analyze the effects of ex situ incubation on other developmental aspects and extend these observations to females. This work evaluated the effect of ex situ management on neurogenesis (cell proliferation in the dorsal and medial ventricular zones, neuronal integration in the dorsomedial and medial cortices), ovary cell proliferation, body size (mass and length) and self-righting ability. Additionally, this study examined if the incubation microenvironment is different between in situ and ex situ nests and whether it could contribute to explain the biological traits. An analysis of principal components showed differences in biological variables of hatchlings between in situ and ex situ clutches, driven by contrasting temperatures and silt composition. Each biological variable was also analyzed with linear mixed models using in situ vs. ex situ clutches, abiotic variables and their interaction. Turtles from ex situ clutches showed: (1) fewer proliferating cells in the dorsal and medial ventricular zones; (2) less mature neurons in the dorsomedial and medial cortices; (3) ovaries with a lesser number of proliferating cells; (4) lower body mass and length at emergence; and (5) slower self-righting time. Together, the results suggest that ex situ incubation in hatcheries is related to a slowing down of neurogenesis, ovariogenesis, body size and self-righting ability in hatchlings. Future studies should evaluate the effect of ex situ incubation on cognitive and reproductive performance to understand the long-term consequences of altered organogenesis. These studies should also disentangle the differential contribution of egg movement, reburial, nesting environment and parental origin to development. This information would likely result in better conservation strategies for sea turtles.

TI  - Goat and cow milk differ in altering microbiota composition and fermentation products in rats with gut dysbiosis induced by amoxicillin
T2  - FOOD & FUNCTION
LA  - English
AB  - Antibiotics are effective treatments for bacterial infections, however, their oral administration can have unintended consequences and may alter the gut microbiota composition. In this study, we examined the influence of antibiotics on the induction of gut dysbiosis and then evaluated the potential of cow and goat milk to restore the microbiota composition and metabolism in newly weaned rats. In the first study (gut dysbiosis model), rats were treated with amoxicillin, a mixture of antibiotics (ampicillin, gentamicin and metronidazole) or no antibiotics (control). Antibiotics reduced the rat body weights, food intakes and faecal outputs compared to the control group. Gut length was significantly decreased after the antibiotic intake. The bacterial populations (Bifidobacterium spp., Lactobacillus spp. and total bacteria) and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs; acetic, butyric and propionic) concentrations in rat caecum, colon and faeces were significantly altered by the antibiotic treatments. In the second study, we examined the effects of cow and goat milk in restoring bacterial populations and metabolism in rats with gut dysbiosis induced by amoxicillin. Goat milk significantly increased the numbers of Bifidobacterium spp. and Lactobacillus spp. and decreased the numbers of Clostridium perfringens in the caecum and colon of rats treated with amoxicillin. Whereas, rats fed cow milk had higher Lactobacillus spp. and lower C. perfringens in the gut. Caecal and colonic SCFAs (acetic, butyric and propionic) concentrations differed significantly between rats fed cow and goat milk diets. Overall, goat and cow milk varied in their effects on the immature gut following antibiotic-induced dysbiosis in a rat model.

AB  - Pig experiments often require anaesthesia, and a rapid stress-free induction is desired. Induction drugs may alter the subsequent anaesthesia. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to compare, in pigs, the effects of two different injectable anaesthetic techniques on the induction and on the physiological variables in a subsequent eight hours of total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA). Twelve domestic castrates (Swedish Landrace/Yorkshire) 27-31 kg were used. The pigs were randomly assigned to different induction drug combinations of zolazepam-tiletamine and medetomidine intramuscularly (ZTMe) or midazolam, ketamine intramuscularly and fentanyl intravenously (MiKF). Time from injection to unconsciousness was recorded and the ease of endotracheal intubation assessed. The TIVA infusion rate was adjusted according to the response exhibited from the nociceptive stimulus delivered by mechanically clamping the dewclaw. The time from injection to unconsciousness was briefer and intubation was easier in the ZTMe group. Results from the recorded heart rate, cardiac index and arterial blood pressure variables were satisfactorily preserved and cardiovascular function was maintained in both groups. Shivering was not observed in the ZTMe group, but was observed in four of the pigs in the MiKF group. The requirement of TIVA was lower in the ZTMe group. In conclusion, ZTMe had better results than MiKF in areas such as shorter induction time, better intubation scoring results and less adjustment and amount of TIVA required up to six hours of anaesthesia. The results may have been due to a greater depth of anaesthesia achieved with the ZTMe combination at the dose used.

AB  - The transition from hunter-gatherer communities to farming societies is a pivotal shift in human history, hinging on the emergence, selection and diffusion of domestic plants and animals. However, the sequence and order of these steps remain only partially understood. In this study, we used a possibilistic formalism to model the emergence and development of farming. This first attempt, based on an intentionally limited number of qualitative and discrete rules, represents the interactions between domestic and wild plants and animals, and human societies. This initial case study focuses on the emergence of farming in Southwest Asia. We constructed a theoretical model including a minimum number of five components and 18 processes. We explored three models representing increasing exploitation of resources from no overexploitation, to overexploitation of both wild and domestic resources. Our findings revealed possible scenarios for the emergence and development of farming, where animal domestication possibly emerged before plant domestication, contradicting the most accepted temporality. We also generated alternative hypotheses concerning the initiation of plant and animal domestications. The possible ecosystem development with resource overexploitation underscores the importance of wild resources for sustainable societies. This initial attempt at possibilistic modelling can be further developed and expanded to address a broad range of archaeological questions.This article is part of the theme issue 'Unravelling domestication: multi-disciplinary perspectives on human and non-human relationships in the past, present and future'.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Double-low rapeseed cake could be a cost-effective feed resource for swine, providing amino acids and energy. Accurate evaluation of the energy values of different double-low rapeseed cakes is of great significance to economically and effectively formulate diets when double-low rapeseed cakes are used as an alternative ingredient in diets fed to pigs. Therefore, two experiments were conducted to develop and validate an equation to predict the metabolizable energy of double-low rapeseed cake for growing pigs based on chemical compositions. Results indicated that the best-fit prediction equation for metabolizable energy (MJ/kg) was 9.33 - 0.09 x neutral detergent fiber -0.25 x crude fiber + 0.59 x gross energy (R-2 = 0.93). Increasing levels of double-low rapeseed cake linearly reduced apparent total tract digestibility of nutrients, but did not affect growing performance and caloric efficiency of metabolizable energy of growing pigs fed diets balanced for standardized ileal digestibility Lys/metabolizable energy ratio. The best-fit prediction equation in this experiment can be used to accurately estimate the metabolizable energy value of double-low rapeseed cake fed to growing pigs under practical conditions.
   The study was conducted to develop and validate an equation to predict the metabolizable energy (ME) of double-low rapeseed cakes (DLRSC) for growing pigs based on their chemical compositions. In Experiment 1, 66 growing pigs (initial body weight 36.6 +/- 4.1 kg) were allotted randomly to a completely randomized design with 11 diets. The diets included a corn-soybean meal basal diet and 10 test diets containing 19.22% DLRSC supplemented at the expense of corn, soybean meal, and lysine. Neutral detergent fiber (NDF), crude fiber (CF), and gross energy (GE) were the best predictors to determine ME. The best-fit prediction equation of ME (MJ/kg) was ME = 9.33 - 0.09 x NDF - 0.25 x CF + 0.59 x GE (R-2 = 0.93). In Experiment 2, a total of 144 growing pigs (initial body weight 29.7 +/- 2.7 kg), with six pigs per pen and six pens per treatment, were assigned randomly to four treatments in a completely randomized block design for a 28-day feeding trial. A corn-soybean meal basal diet was prepared, and three additional diets were formulated by adding 7%, 14%, and 21% DLRSC to the basal diet at the expense of soybean meal. All diets were formulated to provide equal standardized ileal digestibility (SID) Lys/ME ratio and SID essential amino acids/SID Lys ratio. Increasing dietary levels of DLRSC had no effect on average daily feed intake, average daily gain, and feed-to-gain ratio. The caloric efficiency of ME (31.83, 32.44, 31.95, and 32.69 MJ/kg, respectively) was not changed by increasing the dietary concentration of DLRSC. Increasing dietary levels of DLRSC linearly reduced (p < 0.05) the concentrations of triiodothyronine and tetraiodothyronine in serum, as well as apparent total tract digestibility of DM, GE, crude protein, acid detergent fiber, and organic matter of the diet. In conclusion, the ME prediction equation obtained in Experiment 1 accurately estimates the ME value of DLRSC fed to growing pigs.

AB  - Odour imagery, the ability to experience smell when an appropriate stimulus is absent, has widely been documented as being particularly difficult. However, previous studies have shown the beneficial effect of visual cues (e.g., pictures or words) to facilitate performance in numerous tasks of olfactory nature. Therefore, the use of visual cues to evoke odours seems relevant. In this study, our interest is directed towards non-figurative coloured arrangements, which result from a patented technology and aim at chromatically representing any smell from its chemical composition and sensory description. The aim of this study was to characterise the neural mechanisms of odour imagery facilitated by these non-figurative coloured arrangements. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we recorded and compared hemodynamic responses during odour imagery facilitated by nonfigurative coloured arrangements and pictures. Our findings reveal that the use of non-figurative coloured arrangements during odour imagery solicits olfactory and non-olfactory brain regions (orbitofrontal cortex, insula, hippocampus, thalamus, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and supplementary motor area), which are mainly involved in olfactory processing and multimodal integration. Moreover, very similar cortical activity was found between the use of non-figurative coloured arrangements and pictures during odour imagery, with increased activity in the supplementary motor area during the use of coloured arrangements only. Overall, non-figurative coloured arrangements could become a robust tool to visually evoke odours without requiring prior familiarity with the depicted odour. Future studies should use psychometric measures to determine the relationships between brain activation, odour imagery ability and vividness of the generated odour images.

AB  - (1) Background: To explore the anti-obesity effects and mechanisms of sika deer velvet antler peptides (sVAP) on 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice. (2) Methods: sVAP fractions of different molecular weights were obtained via enzymatic hydrolysis and ultrafiltration. Their anti-lipid effects on 3T3-L1 cells were assessed with Oil Red O staining. The optimal fraction was tested in HFD-induced obese C57BL/6 mice to explore anti-obesity mechanisms. Peptide purification used LC-MS/MS, followed by sequence analysis and molecular docking for activity prediction. (3) Results: The peptide with the best anti-obesity activity was identified as sVAP-3K (<= 3 kDa). sVAP-3K reduced lipid content and proliferation in 3T3-L1 cells, improved lipid profiles and ameliorated adipocyte degeneration in HFD mice, promoted the growth of beneficial gut microbiota, and maintained lipid metabolism. Additionally, sVAP-3K activated the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway, regulating adipogenic transcription factors. sVAP-3K exhibited ten major components (peak area >= 1.03 x 108), with four of the most active components being newly discovered natural oligopeptides: RVDPVNFKL (m/z 363.21371), GGEFTPVLQ (m/z 474.24643), VDPENFRL (m/z 495.25735), and VDPVNFK (m/z 818.44043). (4) Conclusion: This study identifies four novel oligopeptides in sVAP-3K as key components for anti-obesity effects, offering new evidence for developing natural weight-loss drugs from sika deer velvet.

AB  - Prolificacy is an important trait of livestock, especially for species with multiple births, such as sheep. The leptin receptor (LEPR) is considered as a major candidate gene that affects the reproductive traits of sheep. The known R62H mutation in the LEPR gene is associated with the hyperprolific phenotype of Davisdale sheep. However, studies identifying novel variations and seeking breed-specific markers associated with litter size in other sheep breeds are rare. In this study, we sequenced all coding regions of the LEPR gene of Mongolia sheep, and nine novel variants of the LEPR gene were detected by direct sequencing. Among them, the synonymous c.240C > T and c.279C > T mutations were significantly associated with the litter sizes of Mongolia ewes (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively) and Ujimqin ewes (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively). The silent c.240C > T and c.279C > T mutations are predicted to change the stability of the mRNA secondary structure by reducing the minimum free energy and are predicted to change the mRNA secondary structure of LEPR. Our findings may provide potentially useful genetic markers for increasing litter size in sheep. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Pig production is based on routine deworming and very rarely includes endoparasitological diagnosis. Monitoring pig production through a consideration of endoparasites in the herd should be part of the pig health program, which will directly translate into the amount of production costs and improve the condition of animals. The aim of this study was the diagnosis of endoparasitic infection in sows and piglets as an element of sustainable pig production. Parasitological examination was performed using coproscopic methods. The experimental material were faeces collected from the same sows from gestation to lactation and their piglets. The total number of coproscopic samples was 840. In the collected material Oesophagostomum spp., Ascaris suum and Eimeria spp. in sows were diagnosed, while in piglets, Eimeria spp. and Oesophagostomum spp were diagnosed. A relationship between the intensity of coccidian infections of lactating sows and the intensity of the infection of piglets was also demonstrated (r(s) = 0.57; p = 0.035). Sows are the primary source of infections in piglets. The assessment of infection intensity using diagnostic methods in sows should be the basis of an endoparasite control, because deworming without a prior diagnostic gives a short term effect and excludes the principles of the sustainable development of pig production.

AB  - There is a tendency that the quality and safety of mutton sheep are paid more and more attention and environmental comfort directly affects it in the farming stage. However, the traditional environmental comfort evaluation is mainly based on the subjective experience of people or environmental factors, which is inaccurate, inefficient, untimely and costly. Therefore, environmental comfort decision supports system based on monitoring data from wearable sensors and ambient multi-sensors is considered an alternative and promising strategy. This paper aims to develop an wearable multi-sensor enabled decision support system (WMSE-DSS) for mutton sheep farming that integrates wireless monitoring of environmental factors and psychological factors, evaluation and prediction of environmental comfort to ensure the quality and safety of mutton sheep. In this research, mechanism of environmental comfort formation is analyzed to obtain key impacts, and the overall structure and function of the system are analyzed and designed according to the actual needs, environmental comfort evaluation model and environmental comfort level prediction model designed for grasping environmental comfort situation. To demonstrate the automatic monitoring and evaluation in this platform, experiments have been evaluated and analyzed. The results illustrate this system can reduce the potential risks, control environmental comfort accurately and provide farmers with automatic decision-making.

AB  - Subsurface injection of liquid manure is a no-till compatible application method that may fundamentally change nutrient cycling dynamics. This study investigated subsurface injection and surface broadcast application methods on soil nitrate-nitrogen (NO3--N) at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 14, 18, and 22 weeks after first-year applications of liquid dairy slurry in 0 to 15 cm and 15 to 30 cm sampling depths. The effect on corn (Zea mays L.) grain yield and quality parameters was considered. Soil health was assessed by proxy on weeks 0, 2, 8, 14, and 22 by two microbial indicators sensitive to change: carbon (C) mineralization and microbial biomass C. Soil NO3--N and the microbial indicators were also measured at distances from an injected band of manure: In-band, 10 cm, 20 cm, and 36 cm. The injection application resulted in significantly (p < 0.05) higher soil NO3--N levels relative to the surface application and no-manure control from week 2 to week 10 after manure application. Soil NO3--N concentrations in the 15 to 30 cm sampling depth suggested NO3--N leaching was exacerbated by the injection application method in 1 of 2 years. Soil NO3--N decreased with increasing sampling distance from an injected manure band following quadradic plateau models at weeks 1, 2, and 4 each year. Crop yield was similar to 14.5% higher under injection application relative to surface application; however, grain quality parameters were not significantly (p > 0.05) different between treatments. Carbon mineralization was significantly (p < 0.05) increased under only the injection application relative to the control. The increase in C mineralization was entirely dependent on the In-band sampling distance as the 10, 20, and 36 cm sampling distances were not significantly (p > 0.05) different from the no-manure control. Microbial biomass C was significantly (p < 0.05) higher in the In-band samples in either the 15 to 30 or 0 to 15 cm sampling depths each year relative to the control, but was not appreciably affected by surface application. Findings from this study refine the understanding of nutrient concentrations around an injection band and accentuate the potential for manure N retention under surface and injected manure applications. However, as treatments were not reliably differentiated by C mineralization nor microbial biomass C, the capability of these tests to identify first-year management changes is disputable.

AB  - Neurological diseases are increasingly recognized as a health burden worldwide, mainly affecting the elderly population. Sanguinoderma rugosum (=Amaumdertna rugosum) is a wild medicinal mushroom traditionally used to alleviate inflammation and prevent seizures. The present study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective and neurorescue effects as well as the possible mechanisms of S. rugosum extracts on glutamate-induced HT-22 mouse hippocampal neuronal cells. The mycelia of S. rugosum were subjected to submerged liquid fermentation followed by solvent extraction and fractionation. The neurotoxicity, neuroprotective, and neurorescue activities of S. rugosum extracts were assessed via the MTT viability assay at 24 and 48 h. The effects of S. rugosum extracts on glutamate-induced oxidative stress and cell death were investigated through flow cytometry. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/ MS) analysis was conducted to identify the bioactive compounds in the S. rugosum hexane fraction (SR-HF). All extracts were noncytotoxic toward HT-22 cells. Pretreatment with S. rugosum ethanolic extract (SR-EE; 12.5 mu g/mL) or SR-HF (100 mu g/mL) markedly (P < 0.05) improved the loss of cell viability and attenuated the accumulation of reactive oxygen species production. Pretreatment with SR-HF was also demonstrated to inhibit glutamate-induced cell death. The MTT assay showed that all extracts generally rescued glutamate-induced HT-22 cells at 24 and 48 h. The GC/MS analysis revealed the existence of 11 bioactive components in SR-HF, with linoleic acid, ergosterol, and ethyl linoleate being the main chemical constituents. The current findings suggest that SR-HF could be used as a potential therapeutic intervention to ameliorate oxidative stress and neuroinflammation.

TI  - Wheat bran fermented by mixed fungal strains improves the digestibility of crude fiber and may benefit the gut health without impacting the growth performance in weaned pigs
T2  - FOOD & FUNCTION
LA  - English
AB  - This study was conducted to compare the effect of raw (WB) or mixed fungi-fermented wheat bran (FWB) on the growth, nutrient digestibility and intestinal health in weaned piglets. After the preparation of FWB, twenty-one cross-bred weaned piglets (7.20 +/- 0.5 kg) were separated into three groups for a 40-day trial. The pigs in the control group were fed a basal corn-soybean meal diet. For the other two groups, 8% of expanded corn in the basal diet was replaced by equivalent WB or FWB. Results showed that the content of main nutrients and the composition of dietary fiber in FWB improved compared to that for WB. The digestibility of fiber in pigs fed FWB improved (P < 0.05) compared to the control and/or WB without affecting their growth performance. Both WB and FWB decreased the conditional pathogen (Streptococcus) or/and E. coli virulence factor (STb) in the colon compared to control (P < 0.05), and the ratio of villus height to crypt depth (VCR) in jejunum increased (P < 0.05). The number of goblet cells, the expression of MUC-1 and pBD1 in jejunal mucosa, and the proportion of blood CD4(+) T lymphocyte subset improved (P < 0.05) by FWB rather than WB. Furthermore, although only WB elevated (P < 0.05) the concentration of butyrate in the colon, both WB and FWB increased the number of butyrate-producing bacteria (P < 0.05) compared to the control. Thus, the main advantage of FWB over WB in weaned pigs is its improvement in fiber digestibility.

AB  - Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), a highly prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, causes motor and cognitive deficits. The main pathophysiologies of DLB are glutamate excitotoxicity and accumulation of Lewy bodies comprising alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) and O-amyloid (AO). Amitriptyline (AMI) promotes expression of glutamate transporter-1 and glutamate reuptake. In this study, we measured the effects of AMI on behavioral and neuronal function in a DLB rat model. We used rivastigmine (RIVA) as a positive control. To establish the DLB rat model, male Wistar rats were stereotaxically injected with recombinant adenoassociated viral vector with the SNCA gene (10 mu g/10 mu L) and AO (5 mu g/2.5 mu L) into the left ventricle and prefrontal cortex, respectively. AMI (10 mg/kg/ day, i.p.), RIVA (2 mg/kg/day, i.p.), or saline was injected intraperitoneally after surgery. From the 29th day, behavioral tests were performed to evaluate the motor and cognitive functions of the rats. Immunohistochemical staining was used to assess neuronal changes. We measured the alpha-syn level, number of newborn cells, and neuronal density in the hippocampus and in the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system. The DLB group exhibited deficit in object recognition. Both the AMI and RIVA treatments reversed these deficits. Histologically, the DLB rats exhibited cell loss in the substantia nigra pars compacta and in the hippocampal CA1 area. AMI reduced this cell loss, but RIVA did not. In addition, the DLB rats exhibited a lower number of newborn cells and higher alpha-syn levels in the dentate gyrus (DG). AMI did not affect alpha-syn accumulation but recovered neurogenesis in the DG of the rats, whereas RIVA reversed the alpha-syn accumulation but did not affect neurogenesis in the rats. We suggest that AMI may have potential for use in the treatment of DLB.

AB  - Vertebrates exhibit diversity in the presence and number of aquaporin (Aqp)-10 genes. In Rodentia, mice possess an Aqp10 pseudogene, whereas guinea pigs possess an intact Aqp10. However, Aqp10 retention and pseudogenization history in various rodent lineages remains unclear. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate the molecular evolution of Aqp10 using the recent increasingly decoded rodent genome sequences. We analyzed Aqp10 in the genomes of 43 rodent species belonging to 14 families and found that Aqp10 was pseudogenized in 13 species of three families in the Myomorpha suborder. In contrast, a single intact Aqp10 was retained in the other 30 rodent species, with no Aqp10 pseudogene found in the Castorimorpha, Hystricomorpha, and Sciuromorpha suborders. Additionally, we investigated the tissue expression levels of aquaglyceroporin genes in guinea pigs and rats via reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and detected Aqp10 expression in the guinea pig intestines. Notably, none of the examined rat organs expressed Aqp10; however, Aqp7 was expressed in the rat intestines. In situ hybridization showed that guinea pig Aqp10 was expressed in the intestinal epithelial cells. Moreover, AQP10 was permeable to water, glycerol, urea, and boric acid in Xenopus oocytes. Overall, these results clarify the Aqp10 pseudogenization history in Rodentia and suggest guinea pigs as excellent small animal models to analyze the intestinal AQP10 functions.

AB  - Administration of pivalate has been demonstrated to be suitable for the induction of secondary carnitine deficiency (CD) in pigs, as model objects for humans. In order to comprehensively characterize the metabolic effects of secondary CD in the liver of pigs, the present study aimed to carry out comparative analysis of the hepatic transcriptome and hepatic and plasma metabolome of a total of 12 male 5-week-old pigs administered either pivalate (group PIV, n = 6) or vehicle (group CON, n = 6) for 28 days. Pigs of group PIV had approximately 40-60% lower concentrations of free carnitine and acetylcarnitine in plasma, liver and different skeletal muscles than pigs of group CON (p < 0.05). Transcript profiling of the liver revealed 140 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between group PIV and group CON (fold change > 1.2 or <-1.2, p-value < 0.05). Biological process terms dealing with the innate immune response were found to be enriched with the DEGs (p < 0.05). Using a targeted metabolomics approach for the simultaneous quantification of 630 metabolites, 9 liver metabolites and 18 plasma metabolites were identified to be different between group PIV and group CON (p < 0.05). Considering the limited alterations of the hepatic transcriptome and of the liver and plasma metabolome, it can be concluded that pivalate-induced secondary CD is not associated with significant hepatic metabolism changes in pigs.

AB  - We investigated effects of regulated hunting on a puma (Puma concolor) population on the Uncompahgre Plateau (UPSA) in southwestern Colorado, USA. We examined the hypothesis that an annual harvest rate averaging 15% of the estimated number of independent individuals using the study area would result in a stable or increasing abundance of independent pumas. We predicted hunting mortality would be compensated by 1) a reduction in other causes of mortality, thus overall survival would stay the same or increase; 2) increased reproduction rates; or 3) increased recruitment of young animals. The study occurred over 10 years (2004-2014) and was designed with a reference period (years 1-5; i.e., RY1-RY5) without puma hunting and a treatment period (years 6-10; i.e., TY1-TY5) with hunting. We captured and marked pumas on the UPSA and monitored them year-round to examine their demographics, reproduction, and movements. We estimated abundance of independent animals using the UPSA each winter during the Colorado hunting season from reference year 2 (RY2) to treatment year 5 (TY5) using the Lincoln-Petersen method. In addition, we surveyed hunters to investigate how their behavior influenced harvest and the population. We captured and marked 110 and 116 unique pumas in the reference and treatment periods, respectively, during 440 total capture events. Those animals produced known-fate data for 75 adults, 75 subadults, and 118 cubs, which we used to estimate sex- and life stage-specific survival rates. In the reference period, independent pumas more than doubled in abundance and exhibited high survival. Natural mortality was the major cause of death to independent individuals, followed by other human causes (e.g., vehicle strikes, depredation control). In the treatment period, hunters killed 35 independent pumas and captured and released 30 others on the UPSA. Abundance of independent pumas using the UPSA declined 35% after 4 years of hunting with harvest rates averaging 15% annually. Harvest rates at the population scale, including marked independent pumas with home ranges exclusively on the UPSA, overlapping the UPSA, and on adjacent management units were higher, averaging 22% annually in the same 4 years leading to the population decline. Adult females comprised 21% of the total harvest. The top-ranked model explaining variation in adult survival (S) indicated a period effect interacting with sex. Annual adult male survival was higher in the reference period (S = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.75-0.99) than in the treatment period (S = 0.40, 95% CI = 0.22-0.57). Annual adult female survival was 0.86 (95% CI = 0.72-0.94) in the reference period and 0.74 (95% CI = 0.63-0.82) in the treatment period. The top subadult model showed that female subadult survival was constant across the reference and treatment periods (S = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.43-0.84), whereas survival of subadult males exhibited the same trend as that of adult males: higher in the reference period (S = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.57-0.99) and lower in the treatment period (S = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.25-0.60). Cub survival was best explained by fates of mothers when cubs were dependent (S-mother alive = 0.51, 95% CI = 0.35-0.66; S-mother died = 0.14, 95% CI = 0.03-0.34). The age distribution for independent pumas skewed younger in the treatment period.
   Adult males were most affected by harvest; their abundance declined by 59% after 3 hunting seasons and we did not detect any males >6 years old after 2 hunting seasons. Pumas born on the UPSA that survived to subadult stage exhibited both philopatry and dispersal. Local recruitment and immigration contributed to positive growth in the reference period, but recruitment did not compensate for the losses of adult males and partially compensated for losses of adult females in the treatment period. Average birth intervals were similar in the reference and treatment periods (reference period = 18.3 months, 95% CI = 15.5-21.1; treatment period = 19.4 months, 95% CI = 16.2-22.6), but litter sizes (reference period = 2.8, 95% CI = 2.4-3.1; treatment period = 2.4, 95% CI = 2.0-2.8) and parturition rates (reference period = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.49-0.75; treatment period = 0.48, 95% CI = 0.37-0.59) declined slightly in the treatment period. Successful hunters used dogs, selected primarily males, and harvested pumas in 1-2 days (median). We found that an annual harvest rate at the population scale averaging 22% of the independent pumas over 4 years and with >20% adult females in the total harvest greatly reduced abundance. At this scale, annual mortality rates of independent animals from hunting averaged 6.3 times greater than from all other human causes and 4.6 times greater than from all natural causes during the population decline. Hunting deaths were largely additive and reproduction and recruitment did not compensate for this mortality source. Hunters generally selected male pumas, resulting in a decline in their survival and abundance, and the age structure of the population. We recommend that regulated hunting in a source-sink structure be used to conserve puma populations, provide sustainable hunting opportunities, and address puma-human conflicts.

AB  - Duyun Maojian tea is a famous tea in China. In this study, the specific-locus amplified fragment (SLAF) sequencing method was used to analyze the population structure and conduct a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 2 leaf traits of 123 tea plants in Qiannan, China. A total of 462,019 SLAF tags and 11,362,041 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci were obtained. The results of phylogenetic tree analysis, cluster analysis, and principal component analysis showed that 123 tea germplasms were clustered into three groups, and the heterozygosity rates for Groups I, II, and II were 0.206, 0.224, and 0.34, respectively. Generally, tea germplasms in a production area are clustered in a group, indicating that tea germplasms in different production areas have certain genetic diversity. The traditional Duyun Maojian tea core production areas, TS and DC-SJ, are clustered into Group I and Group II respectively, while the ZY production area is relatively independent in Group III. Furthermore, based on GWAS analysis, 11 candidate genes related to leaf apex and 7 candidate genes related to leaf shape were obtained. This study clarified the genetic relationship among eight Duyun Maojian tea production areas and obtained candidate genes related to leaf apex and leaf shape development. The results showed that population structure and candidate genes are an effective basis for the breeding of Duyun Maojian tea germplasm.

AB  - The problem of zoonoses remains relevant in the context of reliable prevention of human disease and effective ways to achieve this result, in particular through the impact on susceptible animals by the efforts of veterinary medicine. Anthrax is an acute, particularly dangerous infectious disease of all species of farm, domestic and wild animals, as well as humans, which is caused by Bacillus anthracis microbes. The causative agent of anthrax belongs to the group of aerobic spore-forming bacteria and exists in two main forms: vegetative and spore. The vegetative form in the body of an infected animal can form a "cap-sule". In Ukraine, according to the provisions of the current "Instruction for the prevention and control of animal anthrax" (2000), the main method of preventing anthrax among animals is regular vaccination of animals susceptible to this disease. The authors conducted a retrospective analysis of the epizootic and epidemiological situation of anthrax in Ukraine for the period 1994-2021 and made a critical assessment of the performance of mandatory measures for specific prevention of sus-ceptible animals. In order to find out the ecological and geographical features of the spread of anthrax, data on outbreaks of the disease in cattle, swine, small ruminants and humans on the territory of Ukraine were analyzed by regions for the time period under investigation. Over the past 28 years in Ukraine, animal anthrax was registered in in all areas except Zhytomyr region. In total, during the analyzed period, 177 affected points and 637 infected animals (cattle, small ruminants, pigs, horses, wild and fur-bearing animals, dogs) were registered (estimated at 3.59 animals per outbreak). Cattle were most often involved in the epizootic process, followed by pigs and small ruminants, while horses and other animal species were least infected. Eco-logical and geographical analysis showed that the largest number of affected points among animals during the analyzed period was found in Kyiv, Volyn, Kharkiv, Luhansk, Khmelnytskyi, Cherkasy, Odesa, and Vinnytsia regions. A small number of affected points during the analyzed period were found in Zakarpattia, Ternopil, Kherson, Autonomous Republic of Crimea, Poltava, Dnipropetrovsk and Ivano-Frankivsk regions. During the analyzed period, 68 people in 11 regions of Ukraine were infected with anthrax, 15 outbreaks were registered (4.46 people per outbreak). Most cases were reported in Donetsk, Kyiv and Odesa regions. The association between outbreaks of anthrax in animals and cases of anthrax among humans has been established, this dependency was 86.6% (the index of contiguity, which takes into account the number of years with simulta-neous registration of animal and human cases, was 0.5). The authors thoroughly proved that it is vaccination among suscepti-ble animals that will finally prevent the incidence of anthrax among people.

   Part of the success of assisted reproductive techniques lies in gamete manipulation before the in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedure. Current chemically defined handling media lack crucial components for embryo development that exist under in vivo conditions. Recent studies of pigs have shown that the addition of reproductive fluids during in vitro fertilization and embryo culture improves embryo quality and their epigenetic profile in vitro. Porcine oviductal fluid (pOF) has been used to supplement the handling media used for sperm selection by centrifugation. However, its effect during sperm selection by the swim-up procedure is still unknown, as is the likely beneficial effect of replacing bovine serum albumin (BSA) by pOF as a protein source in sperm preparation media. In this study, four protein combinations in the swim-up medium were tested: 1 mg/mL BSA (the regular supplementation), 1% preovulatory pOF (1% pOF), 1 mg/mL BSA plus 1% pOF; and 5 mg/mL BSA. After sperm selection, various sperm parameters were assessed, and oocytes were inseminated in vitro. Results showed that the replacement of BSA by pOF improves some sperm motion parameters and increases in vitro oocyte penetration ability, whereas the combination of BSA + pOF did not show relevant effects. High concentrations of BSA had a detrimental effect, resulting in a decrease of sperm penetration.
   More suitable and efficient methods to protect gametes from external harmful effects during in vitro handling can be achieved by adding preovulatory porcine oviductal fluid (pOF) to in vitro culture media. The objective of this study was to assess the swim-up procedure's suitability as a sperm selection method using a medium supplemented with 1mg/mL BSA, 1% preovulatory pOF (v/v), 1% v/v pOF plus 1mg/mL BSA, and 5mg/mL BSA. After selection, various sperm parameters were studied, such as sperm recovery rate, sperm morphology, motility (by CASA), vitality, acrosome status and intracellular calcium (by flow cytometry) and ability to penetrate oocytes in vitro. Around 2% of sperm were recovered after swim-up, and the replacement of BSA by pOF showed a beneficial reduction of motility parameters calcium concentration, resulting in an increased penetration rate. The combination of albumin and oviductal fluid in the medium did not improve the sperm parameters results, whereas a high concentration of BSA increased sperm morphological abnormalities, motility, and acrosome damage, with a reduction of calcium concentration and penetration rate. In conclusion, the replacement of albumin by preovulatory oviductal fluid in the swim-up sperm preparation method modifies boar sperm parameters and improves the in vitro penetration of oocytes.

AB  - Large herbivores typically have consistently high prime-aged adult survival and lower, more variable, juvenile, and senescent survival. Many kangaroo populations undergo greater fluctuations in density compared with other large herbivores, but age-and sex-specific survival of kangaroos and their response to environmental variation remain poorly estimated. We used long-term capture-mark-recapture data on 920 individuals to investigate the survival component of eastern grey kangaroo (Macropus giganteus) population dynamics. Forage availability and population density were monitored quar-terly and included as predictors of survival in Bayesian Cormack-Jolly-Seber models. Annual survival probabilities were estimated for five age classes: 0 years (juveniles), 1-2 years (subadults), 3-6 years (prime-aged adults), 7-9 years (presenescent adults), and >= 10 years (senescent adults). Survival of juveniles varied widely during our 12-year study, ranging from 0.07 to 0.90 for females and 0.05-0.92 for males. Subadult survival was 0.80-0.93 for females and 0.75-0.85 for males, while that of prime-aged adults was >= 0.94 for females and >= 0.83 for males, despite large fluctuations in forage and density. The survival of presenescent adults spanned 0.86-0.93 for females and 0.60-0.86 for males. Senescent survival was variable, at 0.49-0.90 for females and 0.49-0.80 for males. Male survival was significantly lower than female survival in prime-aged and presenescent adults, but not in other age classes. Although most of the models supported by Watanabe-Akaike Information Criterion selection included at least one environmental covariate, none of these covariates individually had a discernible effect on survival. Temporal variability in overall survival appeared mostly due to changes in the survival of juvenile and senescent kangaroos. Kangaroo survival patterns are similar to those of ungulates, suggesting a strong role of sex-age structure on population dynamics.

AB  - The ultimate strength of the ship hull girder under combined loads is closer to the load-carrying capacity during the actual sailing for considering the negative effect of the secondary load in some cases. Scaled models are designed to represent the prototype in ultimate strength experiments. To study the effect of the bottom lateral pressure on the scaled hull girder under combined loads thoroughly, a series of hull girders of a 10,000TEU container ship under different scale combinations of geometric length and plate thickness are analyzed. The relevant changes in the characteristics of ultimate strength and collapse behaviors caused by bottom lateral pressure are investigated. Results show that the ultimate hogging moment predicted by the traditional or the empirical scaling law proposed in the reference is significantly different from that obtained by numerical analysis when the scale ratio of the plate thickness is much smaller than the geometric scale ratio for ignoring the significant effect of the bottom lateral pressure. Correspondingly, an empirical scaling criterion is proposed to improve the accuracy of the converting process of the ultimate strength between scaled models and the full-scale prototype. Finally, the applicability of the proposed scaling criterion is verified by numerical results of a series of simplified hull girder models.

AB  - Tree shrews are more closely related to primate animals than rodents in many aspects. In addition, they also possess several advantageous characteristics including small body size, high brain-tobody mass ratio, low cost of feeding and maintenance, short reproductive cycle and life span, which make them promising novel laboratory animals to replace more precious larger primate animals. Testis-specific serine/ threonine kinase (Tssk) plays important roles in spermatogenesis and/or the regulation of sperm function. However, studies on Tssk in tree shrews have not been reported yet. In the present study, the full-length sequences of five members of the Tssk family in tree shrews were cloned and their CDS region sequences were analyzed by basic bioinformatics. The phylogenetic tree and prokaryotic protein expression system of Tssk gene of tree shrews were constructed. The mRNA expressions of Tssk genes in 11 tissues/organs from tree shrews were studied. The results showed that: 1. the length of the CDS region of tree shrew Tssk gene for Tssk1B, Tssk2, Tssk3 (variant X1 / X2), Tssk4 (variant X1 / X2) and Tssk6 is 1080bp, 1077bp, 867 / 807bp, 1014 / 984bp, 822bp, respectively, encoding 359, 358, 288/268, 337/327 and 273 amino acids, respectively; the cloned sequences of Tssk genes have been submitted to GenBank with the following accession numbers: KX091161(Tssk1B), KX091162(Tssk2), KX091163(Tssk3 variant X1)/KX091164(Tssk3 variant X2), KX091165(Tssk4variant X1)/ KX091166(Tssk4variant X2), KX091160(Tssk6). 2. All tree shrew Tssk proteins distribute in cytoplasm, indicating that they are hydrophilic and non-secretory proteins, with multiple phosphorylation sites of serine and/or threonine. In addition, they are all mixed proteins with similar tertiary structures sharing a highly conserved functional domain of S_TKc (Serine/Threonine protein kinases, catalytic domain). 3.The molecular phylogenetic tree of five Tssk genes in tree shrews indicates that they are neither rodent nor primate animal, but are closely related to primate animals. 4. Five members of the Tssk recombinant proteins in tree shrews were successfully obtained using the constructed prokaryotic protein expression system. 5. Five Tssk genes are specifically expressed in the testis and/or sperm of tree shrews. Additionally, small amount of Tssk1B was expressed in several tissues other than testis and sperm. Limited mRNA levels of Tssk2 and Tssk4 were expressed in the brain, while mRNA of Tssk3 or Tssk6 could only be detected in the testis and sperm. This study will provide fundamental data on reproductive biology of tree shrews, which paves a way for further studying Tssk's biological function in this novel model animal.

AB  - Simple SummaryThe increased global population and improved socioeconomic conditions have led to a dramatic surge in the demand for animal-derived products. Cheese and yoghurt originating from ewe's milk are two of the most desirable dairy products around the world due to their exceptional nutritional and organoleptic properties. Artificial lamb rearing is a common practice in Mediterranean dairy sheep production systems to increase the quantity of marketable ovine milk. The results of the present study suggest that artificial rearing is a feasible strategy for lamb meat production in Greece since it has mild effects on endocrine and behavioral parameters, does not influence carcass traits and meat quality characteristics, and positively impacts meat oxidative stability. Artificial rearing (AR) of lambs is nowadays a common practice in Mediterranean dairy sheep production systems to enhance the milk available for cheese or yoghurt manufacturing. The sufficient growth of lambs in an AR system is vital for the economic success of dairy sheep farms. However, AR is often associated with negative impacts on the performance and physiology of lambs. Greece is one of the major producers of ovine milk; nevertheless, data concerning the effects of artificial rearing in lambs of Greek autochthonous breeds are not available. Therefore, the present study aimed to examine the influence of artificial rearing on growth performance, thyroid hormone levels, locomotor activity, carcass traits and meat quality characteristics in lambs of the Chios breed, which is one of the most well-known Greek dairy sheep breeds. Twenty-one singleton male lambs were assigned into two feeding regimes; natural rearing NR (n = 11) and AR (n = 10). The lambs' behavior was continuously videotaped until weaning, and their standing percentage was recorded as an activity index. Blood samples were collected from the jugular vein of lambs on days 3, 10, 17 and 40 after birth to assess thyroid hormone levels. The body weight of lambs was also recorded weekly. At the age of 45 days, lambs were fasted for 12 h, weighed and slaughtered. The weights of the carcass and internal organs were measured, while samples of the longissimus dorsi muscle were used for the determination of meat pH, color, water holding capacity, shear force and oxidative stability values. As indicated, body weight (kg) at birth was greater in NR vs. AR group and this difference was maintained till day 35 (p < 0.05), although body gain (kg) was generally not significantly different between NR and AR lambs, with the exception of the first week, when NR showed a greater value compared with the AR lambs (p < 0.001). On day 42, no significant differences between lamb groups for body weight were observed. Levels for triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4) and the free form of T3 (FT3) were greater, whereas the standing percentage was lower in NR compared with AR lambs (p < 0.05). The feeding regime of lambs did not affect carcass traits, internal organ and fat tissue weights, except for cold carcass yield which was greater in AR vs. NR lambs. No significant differences were observed between the two lamb groups in meat quality characteristics, such as pH, color, water holding capacity and shear force values, although MDA content was decreased in AR lambs indicating an improved oxidative stability.
   In conclusion, artificial rearing appears to be a feasible strategy for Chios lamb meat production, since it does not negatively influence carcass traits and meat quality characteristics, while a positive effect in meat oxidative stability is observed.

AB  - Simple Summary This study addresses a major challenge in small- to medium-scale pig farming by tackling the issue of limited reference population data in breeding programs. To enhance the accuracy of genomic estimated breeding values, this research explores the benefits of combining reference populations of varying sizes. Specifically, focusing on Yorkshire pigs, this study examined the impact of different population combinations on the accuracy of genomic selection for key traits related to the growth and lean meat percentage. The findings reveal that predicting a population using data from two other populations significantly improves accuracy, offering a promising strategy for small- and medium-sized pig herds. This innovative approach has the potential to enhance genomic selection accuracy, providing valuable insights for pig farmers facing resource constraints. Ultimately, this study underscores the importance of incorporating population combinations in genetic models for predicting breeding values, contributing to more efficient and effective pig farming practices.Abstract The need for sufficient reference population data poses a significant challenge in breeding programs aimed at improving pig farming on a small to medium scale. To overcome this hurdle, investigating the advantages of combing reference populations of varying sizes is crucial for enhancing the accuracy of the genomic estimated breeding value (GEBV). Genomic selection (GS) in populations with limited reference data can be optimized by combining populations of the same breed or related breeds. This study focused on understanding the effect of combing different reference group sizes on the accuracy of GS for determining the growth effectiveness and percentage of lean meat in Yorkshire pigs. Specifically, our study investigated two important traits: the age at 100 kg live weight (AGE100) and the backfat thickness at 100 kg live weight (BF100). This research assessed the efficiency of genomic prediction (GP) using different GEBV models across three Yorkshire populations with varying genetic backgrounds. The GeneSeek 50K GGP porcine high-density array was used for genotyping. A total of 2295 Yorkshire pigs were included, representing three Yorkshire pig populations with different genetic backgrounds-295 from Danish (small) lines from Huaibei City, Anhui Province, 500 from Canadian (medium) lines from Lixin County, Anhui Province, and 1500 from American (large) lines from Shanghai. To evaluate the impact of different population combination scenarios on the GS accuracy, three approaches were explored: (1) combining all three populations for prediction, (2) combining two populations to predict the third, and (3) predicting each population independently. Five GEBV models, including three Bayesian models (BayesA, BayesB, and BayesC), the genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) model, and single-step GBLUP (ssGBLUP) were implemented through 20 repetitions of five-fold cross-validation (CV). The results indicate that predicting one target population using the other two populations yielded the highest accuracy, providing a novel approach for improving the genomic selection accuracy in Yorkshire pigs. In this study, it was found that using different populations of the same breed to predict small- and medium-sized herds might be effective in improving the GEBV. This investigation highlights the significance of incorporating population combinations in genetic models for predicting the breeding value, particularly for pig farmers confronted with resource limitations.

AB  - The search for alternatives to traditional soybean meal, a significant share of the protein components of pig feed, is particularly relevant. Using insect-based protein products is one of the most promising solutions in this area. The research was carried out on hybrid young pigs for 70 days. The young pigs of the control group were fed a nutrient-balanced diet, while the second group was fed a black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens) larvae-based protein powder supplement in 20 kg per tonne of feed. Using the protein supplement in the piglet diet increased piglet survival and live weight gain, proving the supplement's effectiveness in improving pig production. An increase in average daily live weight gain of 23.3% with an improved feed conversion of 11.7% indicates improved nutrient absorption and increased efficiency of protein metabolism. Biochemical tests showed a higher level of total protein, an increase in globulin concentration, and a decrease in albumin, indicating a more active metabolism and a stronger immune response. A slight increase in the De Ritis ratio is still within the physiological norm. A 24.8% improvement in calcium-phosphorus metabolism caused by an increase in calcium concentration and a decrease in phosphorus shows the supplement's impact on the formation of the musculoskeletal system. Higher glucose levels indicate improved energy metabolism. The morphological composition of the blood shows changes in the hemopoiesis and immune system: an increase in mean corpuscular hemoglobin and an increase in segmented neutrophils with a decrease in the level of lymphocytes and monocytes indicate the adaptation of the body to the conditions of feeding from insect protein powder.

AB  - Decisions in the natural world are rarely made in isolation. Each action that an organism selects will affect the future situations in which it finds itself, and those situations will in turn affect the future actions that are available. Achieving real-world goals often requires successfully navigating a sequence of many actions. An efficient and flexible way to achieve such goals is to construct an internal model of the environment, and use it to plan behavior multiple steps into the future. This process is known as multi-step planning, and its neural mechanisms are only beginning to be understood. Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of these mechanisms, many of which take advantage of multi-step decision tasks for humans and animals.

AB  - Black coat color in pigs is determined by the dominant E allele at the MC1R locus. Through comparing MC1R gene sequences between recessive e and dominant E-D1 alleles, we identified four missense mutations that could affect MC1R protein function for eumelanin synthesis. With the aim of devising a genetic modification method for pig coat color manipulation, we mutated the e allele in the Duroc breed to the dominant E-D1 allele using CRISPR-mediated homologous recombination for the four mutation substitutions at the MC1R locus. The MC1R-modified Duroc pigs generated using the allele replacement strategy displayed uniform black coat color across the body. A genotyping assay showed that the MC1R-modified Duroc pigs had a heterozygous E-D1/e allele at the MC1R locus; in addition, the pigs remained in the Duroc genetic background. Our work offers a gene editing method for pig coat color manipulation, which could value the culture of new pig varieties meeting the needs of diversified market.

AB  - Porcine kobuvirus (PKV) is an enteric virus commonly detected in both diarrheic and healthy pigs. Little is known about the role of PKV in enteric diseases. In this study, an epidemiological investigation based on 324 intestinal samples collected from six provinces of China during the period of 2018 to 2022 was performed, and showed that PKV has an overall 65.43% (212/324) positive rate. Noticeably, 89.47% (17/19) of PKV and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) double-positive pigs were clinically diseased, while 91.71% (177/193) of PKV-positive but PEDV-negative pigs were clinically healthy, suggesting that PKV infection in itself is unlikely to cause enteric diseases. In addition, three PKV genomes were obtained from both diseased and healthy pigs. Phylogenetic analysis showed that Chinese PKV strains could be divided into three groups (SH-W-CHN-like, S-1-HUN-like and JXAT2015-like strains). All three obtained PKV genomes belong to SH-W-CHN-like strains and JSYZ1806-158 was detected as a recombinant virus. Furthermore, multiple comparisons showed that nucleotide similarities are clearly lower than amino acid similarities for PKV polyproteins. Selective pressure analysis indicated that Chinese PKV polyproteins are predominantly under negative selection. Overall, this study provided new insights into the prevalence and evolution of PKV in both diarrheic and healthy pigs in China.

AB  - South Africa is one of the most diverse countries in the world but the increase in agricultural, industrial and technological development to meet the needs of the growing human population has led to increased amounts of potentially toxic elements (PTEs) and other chemicals in the environment. As regional and global environmental processes influence local conditions to differing degrees, all organisms within a specific environment are exposed to highly complex, ill-defined PTE and chemical mixtures. Differences in feeding strategies within and between vertebrate trophic levels are likely to influence the degree to which individuals may be exposed to and affected by PTE presence. Using vertebrate faeces as a biological matrix, we investigate and compare quantitative differences in PTE concentrations in herbivorous, omnivorous and carnivorous terrestrial vertebrates from two protected areas in South African savannah. Of the eleven PTEs assessed [aluminium (Al), arsenic (As), barium (Ba), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), mercury (Hg), lead (Pb), antimony (Sb), tin (Sn), strontium (Sr), and vanadium (V)], the highest concentrations of Al, As, Cr, Pb, Sn, and V were found in carnivores. General patterns were evident between groups at each site for specific elements, but absolute values for the same elements were site-specific. This is the first study to non-invasively examine and compare PTE concentrations in a variety of free-ranging mammalian wildlife occupying different trophic levels within South African protected areas. Our results confirm that all individuals across trophic levels within these sites are exposed to multiple and varied PTE mixtures on a continuous basis. Whether PTEs at these concentrations cause synergistic or antagonistic disruption of physiological and biological systems alone or in combination in free-ranging African wildlife species is still unclear and requires further investigation.

AB  - Below-ground herbivory impacts plant development and often induces systemic responses in plants that affect the performance and feeding behavior of above-ground herbivores. Meanwhile, pest-damaged root tissue can enhance a plant's susceptibility to abiotic stress such as salinity. Yet, the extent to which herbivore-induced plant defenses are modulated by such abiotic stress has rarely been studied. In this study, we examine whether root feeding by larvae of the turnip moth, Agrotis segetum (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) affects the performance of the above-ground, sap-feeding aphid Aphis gossypii (Hemiptera: Aphididae) on cotton, and assess whether those interactions are modulated by salinity stress. In the absence of salinity stress, A. segetum root feeding does not affect A. gossypii development. On the other hand, under intense salinity stress (i.e., 600 mM NaCl), A. segetum root feeding decreases aphid development time by 16.1 % and enhances fecundity by 72.0 %. Transcriptome, metabolome and bioassay trials showed that root feeding and salinity stress jointly trigger the biosynthesis of amino acids in cotton leaves. Specifically, increased titers of valine in leaf tissue relate to an enhanced performance of A. gossypii . Taken together, salinity stress alters the interaction between above- and below -ground feeders by changing amino acid accumulation. Our findings advance our understanding of how plants cope with concurrent biotic and abiotic stressors, and may help tailor plant protection strategies to varying production contexts.

AB  - Circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (CLOCK) is a critical component of the mammalian circadian clock system and regulates ovarian physiology. However, the functions and mechanisms of CLOCK in porcine granulosa cells (GCs) are poorly understood. The present study focused on CLOCK's effects on estradiol synthesis. Similarity analysis showed that CLOCK is highly conserved between pigs and other species. The phylogenetic tree analysis indicated that porcine CLOCK was most closely related to that in Arabian camels. CLOCK significantly reduced E2 synthesis in GCs. CLOCK reduced the expression of steroidogenesis-related genes at the mRNA and protein levels, including CYP19A1, CYP11A1, and StAR. CYP17A1 levels were significantly downregulated. We demonstrated that CLOCK dramatically decreased ATP content, mitochondrial copy number, and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and increased reactive oxygen species levels in GCs. We observed that mitochondria were severely damaged with fuzzy and fractured cristae and swollen matrix. These findings suggest that mitochondrial function and E2 synthesis are impaired following the alteration of CLOCK gene expression in porcine ovarian GCs. (c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Simple Summary The cashmere industry is a crucial resource and pillar of animal husbandry in the desert and semidesert regions of the central and western Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The development of embryonic hair follicles is vital in determining the quality and quantity of cashmere; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying embryonic hair follicle development remain unknown. This study employed proteomic and metabolomic techniques to analyse embryonic skin samples from cashmere goats. The results revealed that the oxytocin signalling pathway is crucial in embryonic hair follicle development by activating the MAPK and Ca2+ signalling pathways. The findings of this study expand our theoretical understanding of embryonic hair follicle development in cashmere goats and serve as a premise for future research.Abstract The hair follicle (HF) is the fundamental unit for fleece and cashmere production in cashmere goats and is crucial in determining cashmere yield and quality. The mechanisms regulating HF development in cashmere goats during the embryonic period remain unclear. Growing evidence suggests that HF development involves complex developmental stages and critical events, and identifying the underlying factors can improve our understanding of HF development. In this study, samples were collected from embryonic day 75 (E75) to E125, the major HF developmental stages. The embryonic HFs of cashmere goats were subjected to proteomic and metabolomic analyses, which revealed dynamic changes in the key factors and signalling pathways controlling HF development at the protein and metabolic levels. Gene ontology and the Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes were used to functionally annotate 1784 significantly differentially expressed proteins and 454 significantly differentially expressed metabolites enriched in different HF developmental stages. A joint analysis revealed that the oxytocin signalling pathway plays a sustained role in embryonic HF development by activating the MAPK and Ca2+ signalling pathways, and a related regulatory network map was constructed. This study provides a global perspective on the mechanism of HF development in cashmere goats and enriches our understanding of embryonic HF development.

AB  - The aim of the current study was to investigate the effects of dietary curcumin nano-micelles (C-NM) on the growth performance, blood metabolites, antioxidant status, and immune and physiological responses of fattening lambs under heat stress conditions. Thirty-two crossbred male lambs [Ile-de-France x (Dalagh x Romanov)] with an average weight of 31.2 +/- 1.55 kg and age of 4-5 months were assigned to experimental treatments in a completely randomized design including four treatments and eight replications. The treatments were T0, T20, T40, and T80, representing dietary supplementation of C-NM at 0, 20, 40, and 80 mg per head per day, respectively. The study lasted for 37 days including 7 days of adaptation period. Lambs were weighed on days 0 and 30 of the experiment before morning feeding to determine the average daily gain (ADG) and feed con-version ratio (FCR). Blood samples were collected from the jugular vein on day 30 of the experiment and physiological parameters, including rectal temperature (RT), skin temperature (ST), respiration rate (RR), and pulse rate (PR), were measured once a week on a certain day during the study. Lambs in the T40 group showed higher final live weight (FLW) and ADG, while exhibiting lower FCR (P < 0.01). Regression analysis predicted the optimum levels of dietary inclusion of C-NM to be 44.7, 38.3, and 42.0 mg/day for FLW, ADG, and FCR, respectively. Dietary supplementation of C-NM decreased RT, ST, and RR, while increasing PR (P < 0.01). The levels of immunoglobulins G (IgG) and A (IgA) increased linearly with the dietary inclusion of C-NM (P < 0.01), while levels of immunoglobulin M (IgM) remained unaffected (P > 0.05). Dietary inclusion of C-NM had a quadratic reducing effect on the serum concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA) and a cubic increasing effect on the serum activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) (P < 0.05). Superoxide dismutase (SOD) was linearly increased in T80, while total antioxidant capacity (TAC) showed a linear increase in T40 and T80 groups (P < 0.01). Based on the results of this study, we recommend the administration of C-NM in the diet of fattening lambs during hot months in tropical and subtropical areas. However, further studies are needed to assess the long-term effects of C-NM during various physiological and production statuses.

AB  - Traditional urban schemes that incorporate extended impervious areas can increase surface run-off. Therefore, urban growth that considers eco-hydrological principles can foster sustainability in cities. This work projected three possible urban development patterns for San Luis Potosi's micro-watershed, characterized by flood design estimations and different urban densities considerations. The selected micro-watershed is located in the western periphery of the city, which is in the process of being urbanized. As the study site is in a semi-arid region where data are scarce, this research used the rational method and the software Rhinoceros for modeling urban scenarios. Models included criteria that allow for comparing a traditional urbanization perspective of what is expected (without green areas) with alternatives that consider green areas as well as different urban densities and that favor eco-hydrological principles. The high urban-density (green area) scenario shows a sustainable alternative for the micro-watershed by which eco-hydrological principles are fostered, as well as an alternative to high urban density without undermining real-estate profitability. Although calculations could be strengthened by using more local data, the results provide insights for urban planners and developers on the sustainable transformation of the micro-watershed.

AB  - Background: Drought, N deficiency and herbivory are considered the most important stressors caused by climate change in the agro- and eco-systems and varied in space and time shaping highly dynamic and heterogeneous stressful environments. This study aims to evaluate the tomato morpho-physiological and metabolic responses to combined abiotic and herbivory at different within-plant spatial levels and temporal scales. Methods: Leaf-level morphological, gas exchange traits and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) profiles were measured in tomato plants exposed to N deficiency and drought, Tuta absoluta larvae and their combination. Additive, synergistic or antagonistic effects of the single stress when combined were also evaluated. Morpho-physiological traits and VOCs profile were also measured on leaves located at three different positions along the shoot axes. Results: The combination of the abiotic and biotic stress has been more harmful than single stress with antagonistic and synergistic but non-additive effects for the morpho-physiological and VOCs tomato responses, respectively. Combined stress also determined a high within-plant phenotypic plasticity of the morpho-physiological responses. Conclusions: These results suggested that the combined stress in tomato determined a "new stress state" and a higher within-plant phenotypic plasticity which could permit an efficient use of the growth and defense resources in the heterogeneous and multiple stressful environmental conditions.

AB  - Synthetic derivatives of steroid hormones, specifically anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS), have gained prominence due to their observed benefits in enhancing meat quality. The study replicated the administration of banned AAS and investigated their impacts on pigs to contribute to the understanding of animal biochemistry and to explore the feasibility of detecting AAS administration by employing a non-targeted analysis. The effects were corroborated by evaluating changes in the expression of selected proteins, as well as examining haematological and biochemical profiles and histological alterations. Exposure to AAS influenced the expression of proteins related to drug-metabolizing enzymes, muscle and lipid metabolism, kidney function, reproductive processes, immune system functions, and carcinogenic changes. The effects of AAS appear intricate and contingent on factors such as the specific drug used, dosage, and duration of administration. The results underscore that protein expression analysis holds promise as a valuable tool for detecting illicit AAS use in the fattening process.

AB  - Plasma Leptin (LEP) and Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 (IGF-1), related to growth and puberty onset, were assayed in growing buffalo heifers from 8 up to 21 months of age, reared in feedlot (FR, n = 13; initial body weight 132 +/- 11 Kg) or grazing at pasture (PG, n = 13; 137 +/- 12 Kg). The mean age at puberty was not different between the two groups (599.5 and 610.5 days, in FR and PG, respectively). At puberty, FR heifers showed higher BCS, and higher average daily weight gain (DWG) than PG ones (0.87 vs. 0.62 Kg/day), and were heavier (462 vs. 375 Kg). A negative correlation between DWG and age at puberty was significant for the PG group. Plasma Inhibin-A increased in both groups one month before puberty. Plasma LEP and IGF-1 sharply increased 2 months before puberty (about 18 months old) in FR heifers only, which showed higher concentrations of both hormones than PG heifers. Plasma LEP levels correlated positively with body weight and IGF-1. Despite hormone levels being affected by rearing systems, and being lower in heifers grazing at pasture, these latter experienced adequate growth and reproductive maturation. In fact, grazing heifers reached puberty at the same age as the feedlot reared ones, with shorter puberty-conception interval (51.3 vs. 67.2 days, for PG and FR groups, respectively) and no difference in conception rates (83.3 and 84.6%, for PG and FR groups respectively). The higher BW and DWG of FR heifers were due to body fat deposition, which did not anticipate the puberty onset.

AB  - Aquaporins (AQPs) are trans-membrane protein involved in water transport and different cellular functions such as cell adhesion, signalling and proliferation. These membrane proteins are essential for key physiological functions such as organ development, osmoregulation, tissue regeneration and metabolism. The regulation of AQP5 gene expression in ruminants during growth phase has not been analysed in-vivo. Therefore, the gene expression pattern was analysed in Jamunapari goats during 3 months to 12 month of age and adult age group in response to heat stress. The genotyping of the AQP5 gene was carried out by High-Resolution Melting (HRM) in four different goat breeds, which indicated four distinct genotypes in the population. The nucleotide diversity for the AQP5 gene ranged from 0.315 and 0.524 across the breeds. Additionally, a close evolutionary relationship between AQP5 and the HSP70 gene was observed, indicating a shared pathway for heat stress regulation. The m-RNA expression level of AQP5 at 3, 9, 12 month and adult age group exhibited 47.24, 1140, 43.17 and 12.55-fold higher expression than control. The m-RNA expression level of the AQP5 gene was up-regulated and significantly higher (P < 0.05) at 9-month age as compared to the other age groups. Heat stress phenotypes were classified based on respiration rate and heart rate, and the m-RNA expression of AQP5 was higher in heat stress-susceptible (HSS) individuals than heat stress-tolerant (HST) individuals at 3, 9, and 12 months of age. The AQP5 plays a significant role in thermoregulation during growth phases in response to heat stress in goats, however, it is required to understand the role of aquaporins at cellular level as well as to establish the association with production performance in ruminant system in-vivo.

AB  - PurposeThe BMPR1B and BMP15 genes are well known for their considerable associations with prolificacy in sheep. These genes may also affect fertility or prolificacy in other species, including human. This study was conducted to investigate possible causative mutations in BMPR1B and BMP15 genes in human and an indigenous breed of sheep.MethodsBlood samples were collected from 83 singleton- and prolific Mehraban ewes and 81 infertile, singleton- and twin-bearing women. A 190-bp fragment, containing the FecB mutation in ovine BMPR1B, a 380-bp fragment in ovine BMP15 gene and their homologous fragments in human were amplified and then investigated by single-stranded conformation polymorphism and DNA sequencing methods.ResultsThe FecB mutation of BMPR1B (g.159A>G) was detected in the sheep population, but no polymorphic loci were found in the homologous fragment in studied human samples. The studied fragments of BMP15 were monomorphic in both sheep and human samples. A total of nine and 69 point-differences in the studied fragments of BMPR1B and BMP15 genes were detected between the species, respectively. In sheep, the G allele of BMPR1B had a positive effect on litter size (p<0.05), whereby all AG or GG ewes were prolific.ConclusionThe FecB mutation for the first time was detected in Mehraban sheep and therefore could be considered for marker-assisted selection in this breed. The studied fragments of BMPR1B and BMP15 genes are not responsible for reproduction variation in human. More studies on other genes, associated with fertility in human, are necessary in the future.

AB  - In the early estrous stage, ewes exhibit characteristic behaviors, including frequent movement or repetitive tail-wagging. Accurately identifying tail-wagging behavior is essential for determining whether ewes are in estrus, which is crucial for optimizing breeding timing and enhancing productivity in sheep farming. However, detecting ewes' tail-wagging behavior in group-housed environments remains challenging, because the movements of the sheep make it difficult to analyze the body parts of each ewe individually. This study aims to propose a method for detecting tail-wagging behavior of estrous ewes in group-housed environments. The proposed method consists of three main modules: keypoint detection of the sheep skeletal, localization of the tail regions, and detection of tail-wagging behavior using a Temporal-Boost 3D convolutional network. Firstly, YOLOv8-pose is employed to obtain tail skeleton keypoints of the ewes. Secondly, tolerance expansion techniques are used to determine the tail locations of all ewes. Finally, the Temporal-Boost 3D convolutional network extracts features from both RGB and optical flow sequences. To improve classification accuracy, dynamic weighted fusion is then applied to the softmax outputs from both the RGB and optical flow data streams, producing the final classification result. To evaluate the practical effectiveness of this method, a video was selected for tail-wagging behavior detection, which contained 39 actual tail-wagging segments. The proposed method successfully detected 40 continuous tail-wagging segments, capturing all actual segments and achieving an accuracy rate of 97.5%. These results indicate that the method can effectively detect tail-wagging behavior in ewes within group-housed environments, meeting the intelligent detection needs of sheep farms.

AB  - Simple Summary Dioxins are proinflammatory factors that may be transferred to offspring through the placenta during pregnancy. alpha-tocopherol and acetylsalicylic acid are popular agents that limit the spread of inflammation. A histopathological and biochemical analysis was performed to reveal possible changes in liver and blood plasma in response to dioxins, alpha-tocopherol, and acetylsalicylic acid. The conducted research demonstrated the presence of negative effects on the liver morphology and blood plasma proteins of offspring, due to dioxins that were derived from the mother. However, the use of both drugs can significantly reduce the negative effects on offspring whose mothers have been treated with dioxins. Dioxins are chemical compounds that may cause an inflammatory reaction. During dioxin-induced inflammation, generated reactive oxygen species lead to morphological changes in various tissues and in biochemical parameters. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the changes in the livers of rats whose mothers were exposed to dioxins and the protective role of alpha-tocopherol and acetylsalicylic acid in liver inflammation. The study material consisted of Buffalo rats who were the offspring of females treated with dioxin, dioxin + alpha-tocopherol, or dioxin + acetylsalicylic acid. Livers and blood samples were taken from the rats' offspring, and then histopathological and biochemical analyses were performed. The histopathological analysis showed that the changes observed in the livers of neonates were the result of the dioxins derived from their mother. The biochemical analysis showed that the morphological changes in the liver affected its function, which manifested in a higher total protein concentration in the dioxin-treated group, and that the creatinine level in this group was significantly higher than that in the other groups. This effect was reduced by the protective role of alpha-tocopherol and acetylsalicylic acid. Based on these results, we came to the conclusion that dioxins significantly affect the structure of the liver, which negatively affects its function, mainly in the scope of the metabolism of plasma proteins and hepatic enzymes.

AB  - This study aimed to enhance the treatment of bone defects and increase peptide bioavailability. To achieve this, antioxidant-active peptides (DBPs) were extracted from deer antler blood and incorporated into an oxidised sodium alginate/amino gelatine injectable hydrogel (OSA/N-Gel). This bioscaffold was created through the Schiff base reaction, resulting in the development of an injectable hydrogel comprising OSA, amino gelatine, and deer antler blood peptides (OSA/N-Gel/DBP). OSA/N-Gel/DBP is characterised by a loose and porous structure that enhances nutrient flow and confers good degradability, enabling the gradual release of DBP to meet the longlasting treatment requirements for bone repair. In vitro, 5-Ethynyl-2 '-deoxyuridine (EDU), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and Alizarin Red S (ARS) staining showed the pro-proliferative and pro-mineralising abilities of OSA/NGel and OSA/N-Gel/DBP on osteoblasts (MC3T3). OSA/N-Gel/DBP effectively promoted the expression of osteogenesis-related genes, such as ALP and vascular endothelial growth factor (CD31), and deposition of collagen (COL-1), and activated the wingless-related integration site (Wnt) signalling pathway, thereby promoting bone regeneration. The effect of OSA/N-Gel/DBP was significantly superior to that of the OSA/N-Gel group, indicating that DBP has good osteogenic properties. We successfully repaired bone defects and broadened the application of antler blood, thereby providing a novel approach to treating bone defects.

AB  - The presence of residues of veterinary pharmaceuticals in farm wastewaters such as pig slurry represents a problem that needs to be tackled to avoid further contamination of environmental waters and the development of resistant bacteria. For their monitoring and control, it is necessary the existence of reliable analytical tools. The present paper describes for the first time the development and optimization by statistical experimental design of a specifically designed analytical method for the analysis of 21 veterinary drugs, including 18 antibiotics of several families (beta-lactams, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, sulfonamides, macrolides, among others), 1 antiparasitic, 1 analgesic and 1 hormone, in a complex environmental matrix such as the fresh solid phase of pig slurry. The resulting method, consisted of an ultrasound assisted extraction (UAE) combined with in-situ dispersive solid phase extraction (d-SPE) from a 0.3 g of freeze-dried sample aliquot followed by a preconcentration step by compact solid phase extraction (c-SPE) and subsequent instrumental analysis by ultra-high-performance-liquid-chromatography (UHPLC) coupled to mass spectrometry in tandem (MS/MS) by a triple quadrupole, was successfully validated as a very sensitive (method limit of quantification in the low ng g(-1)) and reliable method (relative recoveries around 100% and method repeatability featured by a general relative standard deviation below 20%). Provided raw data was intended to be processed by matrix-matched quantification approach. The resulting methodology was applied to the characterization of several pig manures from different Spanish farms sampled across breeding season between 2018 and 2019. Sample precedence showed to have a high impact in the positives, its frequency and concentration. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Worldwide increasing levels of anthelmintic resistance are pushing farmers and health advisors towards a more sustainable management of gastrointestinal nematodes (GIN), one of the greatest threats to the viability of grazing small ruminant production systems, and to these animals' welfare. These Strongyloidea develop freely in livestock dung, where they are exposed to predatory organisms that can eventually break their cycle. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of phoretic mites of dung beetles Macrocheles sp. (Macrochelidae) on the gastrointestinal nematode Haemonchus contortus (Rudolphi, 1803) that has a free-living larval stage that evolves in sheep feces. Direct observations under a stereomicroscope confirmed that the studied Macrocheles mites may have an active predatory behavior on the third-stage (L3) larvae of H. contortus. In order to quantify the effects of the mites' predation on the survival of L3 nematode larvae, we designed experimental units, replicated across five trials, and containing free-living stages of the nematode either in the presence or absence of mites. The number of H. contortus larvae that reached the third-stage was significantly reduced in the presence of mites, despite a variable intensity of the predatory effects between trials. This is the first report of a predatory activity of phoretic mites of dung beetles' on a livestock gastrointestinal nematode. This first step encourages further studies in order to have a better quantification of this interaction, and to investigate to which extent the phoretic mites of dung beetles can impact H. contortus populations in natural conditions.

AB  - Memory persistence is a crucial aspect of long-term memory (LTM) and involves late consolidation processes that modulate memory stability over time. Acute physical exercise (PE) has emerged as a potential strategy to modulate memory consolidation and enhance memory persistence. While its effects have been extensively explored in the early consolidation phase, its impact on the late phase remains unexplored. In this study, we investigated the effects and mechanisms of an acute PE on the late consolidation window of novel object recognition (NOR) memory in rats. A 30-minute running session applied 11 h after NOR memory acquisition significantly increased memory persistence for at least 7 days. The inhibition of hippocampal protein synthesis immediately after acute PE using anisomycin (a ribosomal inhibitor) or rapamycin (an mTOR pathway inhibitor) impaired the effect of PE on memory persistence. Animals only presented memory 1 day after acquisition. The same effect was observed with the inhibition of beta-adrenergic receptors by timolol. Although there were no differences between the groups' comparison, blocking D1/D5 receptors after acute PE resulted in a lack of memory persistence in the dichotomous testing (remember/non-remember). Therefore, our exploration of the mechanisms underlying this enhancement revealed the involvement of protein synthesis and the requirement of beta-adrenergic and dopaminergic D1/D5 receptors in the dorsal hippocampus. These findings provide valuable insights into PE as a potential memory modulator, contributing to expanding our understanding of memory consolidation dynamics and acute PE effects.

AB  - The present study is the first record of deducing age-wise and sex-wise normal reference intervals (RIs) for various serum biochemical attributes in apparently healthy Sipli sheep being reared under intensive farming system at Livestock Farm of the Faculty of Veterinary and Animal Sciences (FV&AS), The Islamia University of Bahawalpur (IUB). Blood samples were aseptically collected, serum was harvested and analyzed for serum chemistry analytes through semi-automatic chemistry analyzer using commercial kits. For the sake of analysis, groups were assigned as per age i.e. G1= up till 1year (n= 41), G2= from 1 to 2 years (n= 46), G3= from 2 to 3 years (n= 43) and as per sex i.e. females (n= 79) and males (n= 51). All the overall mean values and RIs for all the studied attributes were within the reference ranges provided in earlier studies for sheep. Bilirubin, Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) and creatinine were significantly (P <= 0.05) lower in females as compared to those in males. However, uric acid was significantly (P <= 0.05) higher for females 52.8 +/- 2.6mmols/L as compared to 44.5 +/- 2.9mmols/L for males. The remaining attributes (Alanine Transaminase, Aspartate Aminotransferase, Total Proteins, Albumin, Glucose, Low Density Lipoproteins, High Density Lipoproteins and Urea) did not differ-significantly (P >= 0.05) between male and female sheep under study. For age-related results, only ALP, glucose and HDL were significantly (P <= 0.05) different between the three studied age groups of Sipli sheep. The ALP and glucose were higher in G1 animals (up till 1 year) whereas HDL was lower in G2 animals (from 1 to 2 years) as compared to their counter-part groups 1 and 3. The data can be beneficial in diagnostic/prognostic purpose for veterinarians, academicians, researchers and all other stakeholders of sheep-rearing sector in Pakistan as well as for other indigenous sheep breeds being reared under similar climatic conditions throughout the world.

AB  - Simple Summary Osteoporosis is a significant public health issue around the world, with post-menopausal osteoporosis due to estrogen deficiency resulting in approximately 3/4 of cases. Treatment with glucocorticoids is another common cause of osteoporosis in humans. Sheep are a well-established model for osteoporosis in humans. In this study, aged sheep had their ovaries removed (ovariectomy) to simulate estrogen deficiency, and some sheep were also treated with glucocorticoids. The results showed that expression of the gene klotho in the kidney had the most marked difference in ovariectomized sheep treated with glucocorticoids for 2 months followed by a recovery period of 3 months. Klotho is known as the "anti-aging" hormone and is an important regulator of calcium and phosphorus metabolism. It may therefore be involved in the recovery of bone mineral density seen in ovariectomized sheep treated with glucocorticoids for 2 months followed by euthanasia at 5 months. As such, it could be an important treatment target for osteoporosis in humans. Osteoporosis is a significant public health issue around the world, with post-menopausal osteoporosis due to estrogen deficiency resulting in approximately 3/4 of cases. In this study, 18 aged Merino ewes were ovariectomized, and 10 were controls. Three of the ovariectomized ewes were treated weekly with 400 mg of methylprednisolone for 5 months and three were treated weekly for 2 months, followed by a 3-month recovery period. At 2 months, five control animals and six ovariectomized animals were euthanized. At 5 months, all the remaining ewes were euthanized. Kidney samples were collected postmortem for qPCR analysis of NPT1, PTH1R, NPT2a, NPT2c, Klotho, FGFR1IIIc, VDR, CYP24A1, CYP27B1, TRPV5, TRPV6, CalD9k, CalD28k, PMCA and NCX1. Ovariectomized sheep had significantly greater VDR expression compared with other groups. Ovariectomized sheep treated with glucocorticoids for 2 months followed by euthanasia at 5 months showed significant differences in TRPV5, CYP24A1 and klotho gene expression compared to other groups. Differences in klotho expression were most marked after adjustment for repeated measures (p = 0.1). Klotho is known as the "anti-aging" hormone and is involved in calcium and phosphorus metabolism. Klotho may be involved in the recovery of bone mineral density in ovariectomized sheep treated with glucocorticoids for 2 months followed by euthanasia at 5 months. Further research on the role of klotho is recommended.

AB  - Neuropeptide Y (NPY) has anxiolytic-like effects and facilitates the extinction of cued and contextual fear in rodents. We have previously shown that the intracerebroventricular administration of NPY reduces the expression of social fear in a mouse model of social fear conditioning (SFC). In the present study, we aimed to identify the brain regions that mediate these effects of NPY. We show that NPY (0.1 nmol/0.2 mu L/side) reduces the expression of SFC-induced social fear in a brain-region-dependent manner. In more detail, NPY reduced the expression of social fear when administered into the dorsolateral septum (DLS) and central amygdala (CeA), but not when administered into the dorsal hippocampus (DH), medial amygdala (MeA) and basolateral amygdala (BLA). We also investigated whether the reduced expression of social fear might partly be due to a reduced anxiety-like behavior, and showed that NPY exerted anxiolytic-like effects when administered into the DH, DLS, CeA and BLA, but not when administered into the MeA. This study identifies the DLS and the CeA as brain regions mediating the effects of NPY on the expression of social fear and suggests that partly distinct neural circuitries mediate the effects of NPY on the expression of social fear and on anxiety-like behavior.

Groundwater nitrogen concentrations were monitored at both sites, during and after the removal of previously planted species. Sea buckthorn and Corsican Pine were removed in a single season from site one, however a series of sea buckthorn removal events occurred at site two over a 4 year period. Sea buckthorn was pulled up with the roots and burnt at site, but the tree roots were left in the ground. Concentrations of NO3-N and total N from shallow piezometers and eluted sand samples were assessed against pre-defined criteria which treat N as a groundwater contaminant in coastal dune systems. It was found that neither the management of the golf course at the first site, or the removal of the Corsican pines at the second increased groundwater nitrogen above the 'level of concern', set at <0.2 mg/l N. Growing sea buckthorn was seen to cause 'possible contamination' in groundwater (between 0.2 and 1 mg/l N). Sea buckthorn removal increased the groundwater NO3-N concentrations above the Threshold Value of 3 mg/l NO3-N and subsequent attenuation of groundwater nitrogen concentrations to 'below concern' took <5 years. Dual nitrate isotopes provided strong evidence for denitrification as the primary reason for this decrease in concentration.

AB  - Intercropping can reduce agricultural pest incidence and represents an important sustainable alternative to conventional pest control methods. Citrus intercropped with guava (Psidium guajava L.) has a lower incidence of Asian citrus psyllid (ACP, Diaphorina citri Kuwayama) and huanglongbing disease (HLB), but the mechanisms are still unknown. In this study, we tested whether volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by guava plants play a role in plant-plant communications and trigger defense responses in sweet orange (Citrus sinensis L. Osbeck) in the laboratory. The results showed that the behavioral preference and developmental performance of ACP on citrus plants that were exposed to guava VOCs were suppressed. The expression of defense-related pathways involved in early signaling, jasmonate (JA) biosynthesis, protease inhibitor (PI), terpenoid, phenylpropanoid, and flavonoid biosynthesis was induced in guava VOC-exposed citrus plants. Headspace analysis revealed that guava plants constitutively emit high levels of (E)-beta-caryophyllene and (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene (DMNT), which can induce the accumulation of JA and promote stronger defense responses of citrus to ACP feeding. In addition, exposure to guava VOCs also increased the indirect defense of citrus by attracting the parasitic wasp Tamarixia radiata. Together, our findings indicate that citrus plants can eavesdrop on the VOC cues emitted by neighboring intact guava plants to boost their JA-dependent anti-herbivore activities. The knowledge gained from this study will provide mechanisms underlying citrus-guava intercropping for the ecological management of insect pests.

AB  - Tea is one of the most popular non-alcoholic beverages globally. The leaves of the tea plants serve as the raw materials for tea production, making tea tree cultivation widespread as an economically significant tree species. Nonexpressor of pathogenesis-related genes 1 (NPR1) is a key regulator of the salicylic acid (SA) signaling pathway, playing a significant role in the plant's response to biotic and abiotic stresses. However, the NPR1-like gene family in tea plants remains elusive. This study aims to systematically analyze the NPR1-like gene family in tea plants. Four CsNPR1-like genes were identified and categorized into three branches based on phylogenetic analysis. Collinearity analysis demonstrated conservation of the NPR1-like gene across different species. Analysis of cis-regulatory elements suggested that CsNPR1-like genes may be involved in various hormonal and stress responses. Protein structure analysis revealed that the CsNPR1-likes exhibited typical ANK and BTB/POZ structural domains. The protein interaction network identified various known and novel NPR1-interacting proteins, including the TGA transcription factor, which was further confirmed in planta. Meta-analysis of transcriptome data indicated that CsNPR1-like genes had spatiotemporal expression patterns and were induced by drought and cold stresses. Additionally, CsNPR1a activates the accumulation of the acidic SA-dependent pathogenic-associated protein PR1 but not the basic chitinase (PR3) in a transient expression assay. This study provides comprehensive information for investigating the NPR1-like gene family in tea plants.

AB  - A legal rhino horn trade is suggested in order to reduce poaching. To examine the implications of this proposition, we conducted a choice experiment with 345 rhino horn consumers in Vietnam, investigating their preferences for legality, source, price and peer experience of medicinal efficacy as attributes in their decision to purchase rhino horn. We calculated consumers' willingness to pay for each attribute level. Consumers preferred and were willing to pay more for wild than semi-wild and farmed rhino horn but showed the strongest preference for legal horn, although higher-income consumers were less concerned about legality. The number of peers having used rhino horn without positive effect reduced preference for wild-sourced horn and increased preference for legality. Our results suggest that a legal trade in rhino horn would likely continue to face competition from a parallel black market. Whether poaching would be reduced depends on the legal supply of wild and semi-wild horns, campaigns ability to change consumer preferences, and regulation efforts.

AB  - Simple Summary It is frequent to see that in-feed antibiotics are added to piglets diets because of their enteric problems after weaning. However, in-feed antibiotics have been forbidden to used in livestock production since 1 July 2020 in China. Therefore, it is urgent to develop some promising alternatives to in-feed antibiotics. Probiotics and plant extracts are considered to be the potential replacements, which have been studied or applied in animal production. In our study, we found that probiotic or Achyranthes bidentata polysaccharides used alone or in combination, the combination augmenting the positive effect more than the independent supplement, could improve piglets' growth performance via promoting intestinal nutrient digestion and absorption and enhancing immune funtion, and the beneficial role was comparable to that of the selected in-feed antibiotics. The experiment aimed to investigate the effects of probiotics and Achyranthes bidentata polysaccharides on the growth performance, nutrients digestibility, and immune function of weaned pigs. One hundred and twenty weaned pigs (about 7 kg BW, 23 +/- 2 d) were allotted to five dietary treatments (CON: antibiotics-free basal diet; ANT: CON + antibiotics; PRO: CON + probiotics; ABPS: CON + Achyranthes bidentata polysaccharides; P-ABPS: PRO + ABPS) for a 28-day trial. Compared with CON, pigs in ANT, PRO, ABPS, and P-ABPS had greater (p < 0.05) ADG, ATTD of CP and GE, serum ALB, IgA and IL-2, duodenal intraepithelial lymphocyte, ileal VH and jejunal mucosa sIgA, but lower (p < 0.05) fecal scores, serum BUN, and IL-1 beta. Meanwhile, ANT, PRO, ABPS, and P-ABPS exhibited similar beneficial roles on growth performance, nutrients digestibility, serum parameters, and immune function. Interestingly, P-ABPS effects were similar to those obtained with ANT rather than with PRO or ABPS. In conclusion, Dietary PRO or ABPS used alone or in combination (P-ABPS), the combination augmenting the positive effect more than the independent supplement, could improve piglets' growth performance via promoting intestinal nutrient digestion and absorption and enhancing immune function, indicating it had the potential to act as an alternative to in-feed antibiotics used in piglet diets.

AB  - Inhibin beta-A (INHBA), a TGF-beta superfamily member, is crucial for developing follicles. Although miRNAs are essential for post-transcriptional gene regulation, it is not yet known how they affect the expression of INHBA during follicle development. Using bioinformatics analyses, miR-134-3p was found, in this investigation, to be a crucial microRNA that targets INHBA in sheep GCs. Furthermore, when the follicular diameter expanded, there was a discernible decline in miR-134-3p expression. The miR-134-3p overexpression markedly reduced the proliferation of GCs, whereas its knockdown augmented it. Moreover, cell cycle progression was enhanced by miR-134-3p overexpression. Furthermore, miR-134-3p overexpression heightened GC apoptosis, while its knockdown reduced it. Importantly, miR-134-3p overexpression blocked the PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis, whereas its knockdown stimulated it. Overall, the outcomes of transfections with INHBA and miR-134-3p showed that, in sheep GCs, miR-134-3p targets INHBA to control cell proliferation and apoptosis. In summary, these results add to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involving important miRNAs in ewe fecundity by indicating that miR-134-3p influences cell proliferation, cell apoptosis, and the TGF-beta/PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis, which, in turn, influences the follicular development of sheep GCs.

AB  - The liver is the center for uptake, synthesis, packaging, and secretion of lipids and lipoproteins. The research on lipid metabolism in pigs is limited. The objective of the present study is to identify the genes related to lipid metabolism and oxidative stress in pigs by using transcriptomic analysis. Liver segments were collected from 60 Jinhua pigs for the determination of liver lipid content. The 7 pigs with the highest and lowest liver lipid content were set as group H and group L, respectively. Liver segments and serum samples were collected from each pig of the H and L groups for RNA sequencing and the determination of triglycerides (TG) content and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) content, respectively. The HDL content in the serum of pigs in the H group was significantly higher than the L group (P < 0.05). From transcriptomic sequencing, 6162 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, among which 2962 were upregulated and 3200 downregulated genes with the increase in the liver content of Jinhua pigs. After GO enrichment and KEGG analyses, lipid modification, cellular lipid metabolic process, cholesterol biosynthetic process, fatty acid metabolic process, oxidoreduction coenzyme metabolic process, oxidoreductase activity, acting on CH-OH group of donors, response to oxidative stress, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), sphingolipid metabolism, and oxidative phosphorylation pathways were involved in lipid metabolism and oxidative stress in Jinhua pigs. For further validation, we selected 10 DEGs including 7 upregulated genes (APOE, APOA1, APOC3, LCAT, CYP2E1, GPX1, and ROMO1) and 4 downregulated genes (PPARA, PPARGC1A, and TXNIP) for RT-qPCR verification. To validate these results in other pig species, we analyzed these 10 DEGs in the liver of DurocxLandracexYorkshire pigs. Similar expression patterns of these 10 DEGs were observed. These data would provide an insight to understand the gene functions regulating lipid metabolism and oxidative stress and would potentially provide theoretical basis for the development of strategies to modulate lipid metabolism and even control human diabetes and obesity by gene regulations.

The antioxidant capacity was noticeable in both flours, although the peel was the one with the highest total betalain content and polyphenolic compounds. Likewise, firmness and consistency increased in yogurts with prickly pear without negative effects on the growth and development of lactic acid bacteria starter strains. Sensory evaluation results showed that only color was affected, and the yogurts enriched with prickly pear flours achieved good acceptance by the consumers.CONCLUSIONSPrickly pear flours could be a viable alternative in the development of dairy products such as yogurt with functional properties.

AB  - Accurately and rapidly recognizing the behaviors of group-housed pigs plays a very important role in pig farm production management. Recognizing multiple behaviors in one scene remains a challenge. This study proposed a multi-behavior detection method of group-housed pigs based on YOLOX and SCTS-SlowFast (SC-Conv-TSSlowFast) to recognize four behaviors (Eating or Interaction with feeding though, Drinking or Interaction with drinker, Standing and Walking) and locate corresponding pig locations. Firstly, YOLOX object detection module is used to locate the locations of group-housed pigs. Secondly, SCTS-SlowFast behavior recognition module is proposed to classify the behaviors category of pigs in the located regions, in which Self-Calibrated Convolution (SC-Conv) and Temporal-Spatial (TS) attention mechanism are specially introduced to improve behavior feature extraction capability of the model. Finally, the results of two modules are combined to realize the task of multibehavior detection of group-housed pigs. To evaluate the proposed method, a multi-behavior video dataset of group-housed pigs with 420 video segments is established. This study achieved a mAP value of 80.05% for four behaviors of group-housed pigs, and counted the duration of these behaviors throughout one day from 8:00 to 16:00 as well as their corresponding changing trends. It verifies the potential and feasibility of proposed method in automatically and simultaneously monitoring and analyzing multiple typical behaviors of group-housed pigs. We shared our behavior detection dataset at https://github.com/IPCLab-NEAU/Group-housed-pigs-Multi-Beha vior-Detection for precision livestock farming research community.

AB  - Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (APP) is a non-spore-forming, Gram-negative facultative, anaerobic bacterium frequently associated with piglet respiratory disease syndrome, which occurs at a notably higher incidence in the winter months and contributes to considerable economic losses to the global pig industry. Following APP infection, porcine lung tissues exhibit a robust inflammatory response characterized by the accumulation of porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs), suggesting that the magnitude of the immune response elicited by PAMs is a critical determinant of the resolution of APP infection. Furthermore, the (32-adrenergic receptor (ADRB2) is predominantly expressed on the surface of PAMs, although the potential influence of ADRB2 on the immunological reactivity of PAMs post-APP infection remains unclear. Additionally, the regulatory effects of ADRB2 are closely associated with intracellular signaling of the cAMP-PKA pathway, which plays a pivotal role in shaping the immune response of PAMs. The aim of this study was to elucidate the critical regulatory mechanisms underlying the influence of ADRB2 on the antibacterial immunity capacities of PAMs in order to provide a theoretical foundation for the development of ADRB2-based immunomodulatory strategies and offer new insights into the intricate regulatory network governing host antibacterial immunity in response to APP infection.

AB  - Dissolved organic matter (DOM) can clearly reflect composting components changes, thus it is supposed to indicate the humification process during composting. To demonstrate this, three compost mixtures and two techniques were arranged. DOM evolution was detected by three spectral techniques. X-ray diffraction (XRD) showed that the crystal structure substances decreased gradually during the composting, including cellulose, struvite, sylvine, quartz, and calcite; Specifically, the struvite was found, which was conducive to the fixation of nitrogen and phosphorus. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and three-dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy (3D-EEM) further showed that pig manure-based mixtures, added cabbage, and windrow composting are beneficial to sugar, protein, fulvic acid, and soluble microbial by-products decompose and humic acids produce. This process was closely related to the change of physical-chemical parameters (temperature; pH; moisture content; and NH4+-N content) and maturity index (C/N ratio, E4/E6 and GI). Therefore, DOM evolution could quickly reflect the maturity process of compost. In subsequent research, the quantitative analysis of DOM components can be considered to modify DOM spectral parameters, or to build a model, so as to achieve rapid evaluation of compost maturity.

AB  - An effective culture system for producing embryos was developed from isolated microspores of sweet pepper (Capsicum annuum L.). The present work aimed to define exogenous arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs) on the embryogenesis of sweet pepper under the growth environments of donor plants. The experiments were performed with the cultivars Arancia, California wonder, Californium, Camelot, Inspiration, Plato, and Taranto under three different growth environments of the donor plants. The impacts of the different numbers of sweet pepper ovaries (0, 5, 10, and 15) were evaluated on microspore embryogenesis of cultivars in a factorial design with five replications. The simultaneous application of 10 ovaries in stress (sucrose starvation; temperature) and induction media resulted in the highest embryogenesis of the seven aforementioned cultivars under field conditions. Also, the impacts of 0, 80, 120, and 200 mg L-1 gum arabic were studied on embryogenesis in stress and induction media. The treatments containing 120 mg L-1 gum arabic showed the highest embryogenesis across all cultivars, except the California Wonder cultivar in the field conditions. Also, the simultaneous impact of the number of ovaries and concentrations of gum arabic on embryogenesis were studied. A combination of ten ovaries and 120 mg L-1 gum arabic generated the highest embryogenesis in the majority of cultivars. The results revealed that ovaries of sweet pepper and gum arabic had a significant impact on the efficiency of microspore embryogenesis in sweet pepper plants under field conditions.

AB  - Simple Summary Feathers contain around 90% of keratin which compose of unbalanced amino acids with low digestibility and limiting the usage in monogastric animal diets. To improve the nutrient value of feather through fermentation using keratinase-producing microbes pose a high economic potential. This study investigates the effects of two-stage fermented feather-soybean meal product (TSFP) on growth performance, blood characteristics, and immunity of finishing pigs. In growth performance, 2.5-5% TSFP promotes the average daily feed intake and feed conversion rate with a best performance of 5%. In blood characteristics, 5% TSFP increased HDL-C, and decreased LDL-C and blood urea nitrogen content. In immunity, 5% TSFP increased lymphoblastogenesis stimulated by lipopolysaccharide and concanavalin A, and promoting IFN-gamma, IgA productions, and phagocytic cells oxygen burst capacity. It appears that TSFP improves the growth performance and immunity of finishing pigs. This study investigates the effects of two-stage fermented feather meal-soybean meal product (TSFP) on growth performance, blood characteristics, and immunity of finishing pigs. Firstly, feather meal-soybean meal is subjected to aerobic fermentation with Bacillus subtilis var. natto N21, B. subtilis Da2 and Da15, B. amyloliquefaciens Da6, Da16 for two days, and anaerobic fermentation with B. coagulans L12 for three days. Then, the fermented product is air-dried into an end product-TSFP. Eighty hybrid pigs (Duroc x KHAPS) with equal numbers of both sexes are randomly assigned into 3% fish meal, 0%, 2.5%, or 5.0% TSFP groups with five replicates per group. Our results show that the average daily feed intake and feed conversion rate of TSFP groups are significantly better than the other groups at 0-3 weeks (p < 0.05). The 5% TSFP group significantly increased HDL-C in the blood (p < 0.05), and decreased LDL-C and blood urea nitrogen content (p < 0.05). The lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and concanavalin A (ConA) in 5% TSFP group and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) content in 2.5% and 5% TSFP groups are significantly higher than the other groups (p < 0.05). The phagocytic oxygen burst capacity and serum IgA content of the 5% TSFP group are significantly higher than those of the fishmeal group (p < 0.05). The CD3, CD4, and CD4 + CD8 + T cells subsets in 2.5% and 5% TSFP groups are significantly higher than the control group (p < 0.05). In conclusion, TSFP has a positive effect on the growth performance and immunity of finishing pigs with the best performance on 5% TSFP.

AB  - Aim: Myopia is a common chronic eye disease, this study is to investigate the effects of exogenous retinoic acid (RA) on intraocular parameters, especially choroidal thickness (CT) and retinal thickness (RT), in guinea pigs with form deprivation myopia (FDM).Methods: A total of 80 male guinea pigs were divided randomly into 4 groups: Control, FDM, FDM + RA, and FDM + Citral groups. The FDM + RA group was given 24 mg/kg RA dissolved in 0.4 mL peanut oil; the FDM + Citral group was given citral 445 mg/kg dissolved in 0.4 mL peanut oil; The other two groups were given 0.4 mL peanut oil. After 4 weeks, the refractive error (RE), axial length (AL), and intraocular pressure (IOP) of all guinea pigs were measured, and the parameters of RT and CT were obtained using enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography (EDI-OCT).Results: After 4 weeks, both the RE and AL in the FDM and FDM + RA groups were increased, and the RT and CT in both groups were smaller than those in the Control group (p < 0.05). Only the IOP of the right eye in the FDM + RA group increased significantly (p < 0.05). The RT of the right eye of the 4 groups was compared: Control group > FDM + Citral group > FDM group > FDM + RA group. Compared with the RT of the left eye and the right eye among the 4 groups, the RT of the right eye in the FDM and FDM + RA groups was significantly less than that in the left eye (p < 0.05). Moreover, the CT of the right eye in the Control group was greater than that in the other three groups (p < 0.0001). There was no significant difference in the CT among the FDM, FDM + RA, and FDM + Citral groups (p > 0.05). In contrast to the RT results, the CT results of the left and right eyes in the FDM + Citral group showed statistically significant differences (p < 0.05).Conclusion: RA participates in the progression of FDM as a regulatory factor. Exogenous RA can increase the RE, AL, and IOP of FDM guinea pigs, and might aggravate the retinal thinning of FDM guinea pigs. Citral can inhibit these changes, but RA might not affect the thickness of the choroid.

AB  - Instead of red anthocyanins, birches synthesise colourless (to human eye), UV-absorbing flavonols during autumn senescence. To test if flavonols protect against insects, and if leaves with high or low amounts of flavonols differ in their photosynthetic functions, aphid-free and aphid-infested green and senescing birch leaves were collected from outdoor-grown trees and analysed. Photosynthetic parameters were greatly affected by the leaf chlorophyll content (i.e. the phase of senescence). Photochemical quenching and the amount of functional Photosystem I decreased linearly with chlorophyll content, while FV/FM (Photosystem II functionality) decreased strongly only at the end of senescence. Non-photochemical quenching of excitation energy (NPQ) increased towards the end of senescence. However, no significant differences in the total flavonol amounts, nor in individual flavonol species, were found between aphid-free and aphid-infested leaves, suggesting that flavonols play no role in defence against aphid herbivory. Interestingly, both green and senescing leaves with a high flavonol content showed low FV/FM values. High flavonol content slowed down PSII photoinhibition and improved recovery, but only in green leaves. Previously, we proposed that anthocyanins provide an additional sink for photosynthates at the nitrogen resorption phase during autumn senescence, and the present data may suggest that flavonol synthesis plays a similar role.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of pulp and leaves of Glycyrrhiza glabra to reduce the ruminal biogas production in sheep. Five experimental diets of two levels of Glycyrrhiza glabra pulp (GGP) and Glycyrrhiza glabra leaves (GGL) at 150 and 300 g/kg dry matter (DM) were assessed for biogas production and fermentation parameters. Diets were control (diet without GGP or GGL), GGP15 (diet contains GGP at 150 g/kg DM), GGP30 (diet contains GGP at 300 g/kg DM), GGL15 (diet contains GGL at 150 g/kg DM), and GGL30 (diet contains GGL at 300 g/kg DM). Inclusion of 150 and 300 g/kg GGP and 300 g/kg GGL decreased (P < 0.0001) asymptotic biogas production (A), fermentation rate (mu), biogas production at 24 h of incubation (GP(24)), apparent degraded substrate (ADS), in vitro organic matter disappearance (OMD), and metabolizable energy (ME). Microbial protein biomass (MP) was improved (P = 0.003) by GGP15, GGL15, and GGL30 versus control. Total VFAs (P = 0.003), acetate (P = 0.009), and butyrate (P = 0.002), CH4 (mmol and mL/g OMD), CO2 (mmol and mL/g OMD) (P = 0.0003 and P = 0.0002, respectively), were decreased in GGP15, GGP30, and GGL30 diets versus control. Acetate to propionate ratio (Ac/Pr) was decreased (P = 0.038) in GGL30 diet compared to other diets. Replacing GGP and GGL with alfalfa reduced NH3-N concentration (P = 0.022), total protozoa (P < 0.0001), Isotricha spp. (P = 0.047), Dasytricha spp. (P = 0.067), subfamilies of Entodiniinae (P < 0.0001), and Diplodiniinae (P = 0.06). Results suggested that inclusion of dietary GGL at 150 g/kg dry matter positively modified some rumen parameters such as microbial protein production, protozoa population, and NH3-N concentration, which may be useful economically in ruminant animals and decreasing of environmental pollution.

AB  - Background Adiponectin (ADIPOQ) plays a critical role in energy and lipid metabolism, indicating that adiponectin could affect livestock productivity. There is an association between polymorphisms in the ADIPOQ gene and variations in livestock productive traits. Therefore, this study investigated the relationship between ADIPOQ polymorphism and productive traits in Awassi ewes. Methods and results This study included 200 sexually mature ewes, aged 2.5 to 5 years, non-pregnant and not lactating. A phenotypic measurement consisting of live weight and body dimensions, was taken. Samples of blood were taken for extraction of genomic DNA and PCR-SSCP based genotyping, followed by sequencing to confirm variants in amplified fragments. A novel c.198,473,337 C > A SNP was found in exon 1 of the ADIPOQ gene confirming heterogeneity with genotypes AA, CC, and CA. The AA genotype differed significantly (P < 0.05) by comparison with the CA and CC genotypes concerning live body weight and body measurements. An association between productive traits and the c.198,473,337 C > A SNP revealed a significant association of the A allele (odds ratio: 2.22 (95% CI: 0.94-5.30) in the additive genetic model. Conclusion Sheep with the AA genotype were heavier and had larger body dimensions, implying superior production and reproduction. Further studies are required in other breeds to prove the results.

AB  - Chicken manure and pig fat are found abundantly around the globe, and there is a challenge to get rid of them. This waste has considerable energy potential to be recovered into fuel, but extracting this energy from some by-products, especially fat, isn't an easy task. When anaerobic digestion technology stepped to the level of anaerobic co-digestion, the utilisation of hardly degradable waste became feasible. Our research was conducted on anaerobic co-digestion of chicken manure as the primary substrate with pig fat as a fat reach supplement in a semi-continuous mode at different organic load rates. The influence of fat waste on the process of biogas production from chicken manure and the composition of the obtained products was determined using an organic load rate of 3.0-4.5 kg VS center dot(m(3)center dot day)(-1). A sturdy and continuously growing biogas production was observed at all organic load rates, implying the synergetic effect on chicken manure and pig fat co-digestion. The highest specific methane yield, 441.3 +/- 7.6 L center dot kg VS-1, was observed at an organic load rate of 4.5 kg VS center dot(m(3)center dot day)(-1). The research results showed that co-digestion of chicken manure with pig fat is an appropriate measure for fat utilisation and contributes to the increase in biogas yield, methane concentration, and overall methane yield at investigated organic load rates.

AB  - The present study was planned to understand the influence of time of day and the breed on semen quality in sheep. Ninety-six semen ejaculates were collected for semen analysis. Results indicated that semen collected in the morning had significantly (p < 0.01) better volume, mass and percent progressive motility, Hypoosmotic swelling test (HOST) reacted sperm percentage, percentage viable sperm with intact acrosomes, viable sperm with highly active mitochondria, seminal plasma superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) levels and significantly (p < 0.05) lower malondialdehyde (MDA) level and percentage of spermatozoa with compromised DNA. Crossbred also showed significantly better results compared to Corriedale sheep. The SOD and GPx levels were positively (p < 0.05) correlated with sperm motility, plasma membrane and acrosomal integrity and negatively (p < 0.05) correlated with MDA levels irrespective of the breed and time. This study highlights that both the time of semen collection and the breed of sheep significantly influence sperm quality and the enzymatic antioxidant capacity of seminal plasma. These factors should be carefully considered when planning semen cryopreservation and artificial insemination programs in sheep. Notably, this is the first study to establish reference values for various seminal oxidant and antioxidant parameters in sheep, providing a valuable baseline for future research.

AB  - Insects are of great importance in the ecosystem. In some cases, however, they can be directly or indirectly harmful to humans. Pest insects in museums are good examples of such insects. Especially organic cultural heritage is often the target of these pests. To accomplish effective pest control, it is necessary to obtain knowledge on pest species and their effects. In this study, pest specimens including adults, larvae, pupae and exuviae materials (Total: 1323 specimens) were collected from 59 furs belonging to 12 species of mammals in Zoological Collection of University Istanbul (ZMUI). The species of these pests from various life stages were identified and the numbers were recorded. Further analyses were conducted through the means of Corresponding Analysis and a potential correlation between pest species and species of hosting furs was investigated 9 species of museum pests were identified; Anthrenus verbasci (Linnaeus, 1767), Attagenus brunneus Faldermann, 1835, Dermestes maculatus (DeGeer, 1774), Lasioderma serricorne (Fabricius, 1792), Lepisma sp., Monopis sp., Ptinus clavipes Panzer, 1792, Stegobium paniceum (Linnaeus, 1758) and Tineola bisselliella (Hummel, 1823). Among the pest species, Anthrenus verbasci is the species with the highest specimen count in the collection, as well as the most commonly distributed species. Museum pests are mainly observed on the furs of herbivore mammals. This observation is demonstrated with Corresponding Analysis. Also through Corresponding Analysis, a correlation between the species of pest insects and the diets of the species of hosting furs was demonstrated.

AB  - Mammalian spermatogenesis is a complex biological process that is regulated by multiple types of cells. The heterogeneity of these cells poses a challenge for analyzing different cell types at different developmental stages. To characterize the transcriptomic landscape of porcine spermatogenesis and identify potential marker genes for spermatogonia, an unbiased transcriptomic study of spermatogenesis in neonatal and sexually mature six-month-old Meihua pigs was performed using 10x Genomics single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Through the collection of scRNA-seq data from 13,839 cells from Meihua pig testes, three germ cells (spermatogonia, spermatocytes and spermatids) and eight somatic cells (Sertoli cells, Leydig cells, myoid/stromal cells, endothelial cells, T cells/macrophages and erythroblasts) were identified. Pseudo-timing analysis showed that myoid cells and stromal cells originated from common progenitors in Meihua pigs. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in testicular somatic cells were enriched in the pathways of Ribosome, Oxidative phosphorylation, Protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, Retrograde endocannabinoid signaling, Cellular senescence and Insulin signaling. Meanwhile, in the three different germ cells, except for pathways which were the same as the first three pathways for somatic cells, DEGs were also enriched in the Spliceosome, Cell cycle, Autophagy and Mitophagy pathways. Furthermore, the candidate marker gene TKTL1 in spermatogonia was identified using immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. In conclusion, we collected transcription datasets and constructed single-cell developmental maps of germ cells and somatic cells during the testicular development of Meihua pigs, which provided new insights into the spermatogenesis of Meihua pigs and the development of various types of cells in their testes.

AB  - Seabirds are widely used as indicators of marine pollution, including mercury (Hg), because they track contaminant levels across space and time. However, many seabirds are migratory, and it is difficult to understand the timing and location of their Hg accumulation. Seabirds may obtain Hg thousands of kilometers away, during their non-breeding period, and deposit that Hg into their terrestrial breeding colonies. We predicted that Hg concentration in rectrices reflects exposure during the previous breeding season, in body feathers reflects non-breeding exposure, and in blood collected during breeding reflects exposure during current breeding. To test this hypothesis, we measured total Hg concentration in these three tissues, which reflect different timepoints during the annual cycle of rhinoceros auklets (Cerorhinca monocerata) breeding on both sides of the North Pacific (Middleton Island in Alaska and Teuri Island in Hokkaido), and tracked their wintering movement patterns with biologging devices. We (i) identify the wintering patterns of both populations, (ii) examine Hg levels in different tissues representing exposure at different time periods, (iii) test how environmental Hg exposure during the non-breeding season affects bird contamination, and (iv) assess whether variation in Hg levels during the non-breeding season influences levels accumulated in terrestrial plants. Individuals from both populations followed a figure eight looping migration pattern. We confirm the existence of a pathway from environmental Hg to plant roots via avian tissues, as Hg concentrations were higher in plants within the auklet colonies than at control sites. Hg concentrations of breast feathers were higher in Alaskan than in Japanese auklets, but Hg concentrations in rectrices and blood were similar. Moreover, we found evidence that tissues with different turnover rates could record local anthropogenic Hg emission rates of areas visited during winter. In conclusion, Hg was transported across thousands of kilometers by seabirds and transferred to local plants. (C)& nbsp;2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonists are among the agents that can be used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus, and they have also been reported to have neuroprotective effects. This study examined the effects of GLP-1 agonist Liraglutide on CREB, BDNF, Trk-B expression and emotional/cognitive behaviors in an experimental schizophrenia-like behavior model induced by MK-801. MK-801 (0.25 mg/kg, 0.1 ml/kg body weight) and/or Liraglutide (300 mcg/kg) were injected intraperitoneally once a day for 7 weeks into 8-10 weeks old male Balb/c mice (n symbolscript 78). Mice were randomly divided into 5 groups: symbolscript MK-801 symbolscript symbolscript MK-801 symbolscript co-treatment, and symbolscript co-treatment. A Morris water maze test, an elevated plus maze test, and an open field test were performed after injection. Western blots were performed on mice' hippocampus and PFC for BDNF, Trk-B, CREB, and p-CREB expression. Our study found that MK-801 impaired emotional and cognitive functions in mice. MK-801 administration did not affect Liraglutide's positive effects on spatial learning and memory activity in the symbolscript group. Liraglutide administration (Lir-symbolscript group) improved the BDNF/Trk-B and p-CREB/CREB ratio in the hippocampus, and the p-CREB/CREB ratio in the PFC to the control group level. The negative effects of MK-801 on cognitive behavior were not reversed by Liraglutide in the MK-801 symbolscript group. In conclusion, Liraglutide does not affect NMDA receptor blockade-induced emotional and cognitive behaviors. However, it has a protective effect against cognitive impairment. Furthermore, it is possible that the GLP-1 receptors in the hippocampus and PFC are involved in the modulation of NMDA receptor activity through CREB activation/deactivation.

AB  - Aims: Considering that serotoninergic agents attenuate symptoms of anxiety and are used to treat depression, we investigated whether subchronic treatment with imipramine, a serotonin/noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, would prevent the anxiogenic-like behaviour induced by acute and/or chronic ethanol withdrawal. We also investigated whether those changes were related to the disfunctioning of hypothalamic?pituitary?adrenal (HPA) axis and serotonergic neurotransmission. Main methods: 264 Male Wistar rats were treated with ethanol 6% (vol./vol.) for 21 days. Acute ethanol withdrawal was induced by abrupt discontinuation of treatment and sustained for 48 h. Protracted abstinence was sustained for an additional period of 21 days. Behavioural tests included the Elevated Plus Maze (EPM) or Light/ Dark Box (LDB) after acute abstinence, and the Forced Swim Test (FST) after protracted abstinence. Imipramine (15 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered 24, 19 and 1 h before EPM or LDB tests. Key findings: Acute abstinence decreased exploration of the open arms of the EPM, without changing exploration of LDB. Additionally, chronic abstinent rats displayed more time immobile in the FST, when compared to control animals. These effects were attenuated by imipramine treatment, without changing basal response. Imipramine prevented protracted abstinence -induced decrease in glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and serotonin transporter (SERT) expression in the dorsal hippocampus. Significance: Our findings indicate that chronic ethanol withdrawal affects the hippocampal serotonergic system by decreasing serotonin transporter expression. It also disturbs the HPA axis functioning through an imbalance on GR and mineralocorticoid (MR) expression.

AB  - Recently, several papers have been published regarding the use of preprocessing models, such as Discrete Wavelet, in Data-Driven Forecasting Frameworks (DDFF). However, these models face unresolved issues, including the use of future data, boundary-affected data, and incorrect selection of decomposition level and wavelet filter, which can lead to inaccurate results. In contrast, the Wavelet-based Data-Driven Forecasting Framework (WDDFF) overcomes these problems. To address the first two issues, we can use Maximal Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform (MODWT) and a-trous algorithm (AT). Although there is currently no definitive solution for selecting the decomposition level and wavelet filter, we propose a novel approach using Entropy to address these issues. By utilizing the concept of predictability of time series using entropy, we can determine the optimal decomposition level and suitable filter to develop the Maximal Overlap Discrete Wavelet-Entropy Transform (MODWET) and apply it to WDDFF accurately. This study, demonstrates the effectiveness of MODWET through three real-world case studies on the CAMELS data set. In these studies, we will forecast the streamflow of specific stations one month ahead to prove the effectiveness of using preprocessing algorithms for forecasting models. The proposed model combines Input Variable Selection (IVS), preprocessing model, and Data-Driven Model (DDM). We will conclude that MODWET-ANN is the most effective model and highlight how entropy can accurately identify the optimal decomposition level and filter, resolving the concerns associated with using WDDFF in hydrological forecasting problems.

AB  - The occurrence of stress is unavoidable in the process of livestock production, and prolonged stress will cause the decrease of livestock productivity. The stress response is mainly regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA axis), which produces a large amount of stress hormones, namely glucocorticoids (GCs), and generates a severe impact on the energy metabolism of the animal body. It is reported that m(6)A modification plays an important role in the regulation of stress response and also participates in the process of muscle growth and development. In this study, we explored the effect of GCs on the protein synthesis procession of porcine skeletal muscle cells (PSCs). We prove that dexamethasone affects the expression of SLC7A7, a main amino acid transporter for protein synthesis by affecting the level of m(6)A modification in PSCs. In addition, we find that SLC7A7 affects the level of PSC protein synthesis by regulating the conduction of the mTOR signaling pathway, which indicates that the reduction of SLC7A7 expression may alleviate the level of protein synthesis under stress conditions.

TI  - Impact of gastric coagulation on the kinetics of release of fat globules from milk of different species
T2  - FOOD & FUNCTION
LA  - English
AB  - The behavior of fat globules during the gastric digestion of raw and pasteurized cow, goat, and sheep whole milks was studied using a human gastric simulator. Microstructural and physicochemical analysis revealed that, initially, the coagulation of the milks in the human gastric simulator resulted in the majority of the milk fat globules being entrapped within the curd. As the digestion progressed, the proportion of fat globules entrapped within the aggregated protein matrix (curd) decreased; there was also some flocculation as well as coalescence of the fat globules within the curd. The liberation of the entrapped fat globules from the curd to the liquid phase of the chyme was strongly dependent on the disintegration and hydrolysis of the structured casein network. Surprisingly, the fat globules released (or already present) into the liquid phase of the chyme were not as extensively coalesced as those remaining within the curd. These phenomena were observed to be similar for the raw and pasteurized whole milk of all species. The pasteurized whole milks from all species formed relatively less structured coagula compared with their raw milk counterparts, leading to a greater extent of protein breakdown and, thus, higher proportions of fat release from the pasteurized milk curds. This study provides a deeper understanding of how the curd-forming properties of different mammalian milks in the gastric environment provide controlled delivery of nutrients (such as protein and fat).

AB  - Simple Summary In the Russian Federation, small ruminant lentiviruses (SRLVs) circulate, causing slow infections that often develop and progress without clinical signs. The detection of seropositive animals leads to economic restrictions, including the prohibition of livestock product sales and the sale of breeding animals. In the investigation of biological samples from a clinically asymptomatic goat from a private farm, serological and molecular genetic methods (ELISA, PCR) yielded a positive result for lentivirus and antibodies against it. Subsequently, the virus was isolated in cell culture, and its presence was confirmed using transmission electron microscopy. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the virus belongs to subtype B1. Extensive monitoring studies in different regions of the Russian Federation would give a clearer picture on the distribution of SLRVs and their classification. This article presents the results of virological and genetic studies of an isolate of caprine arthritis encephalitis (CAE) virus from the republic of Mordovia, Russian Federation. The isolate was found during monitoring studies of goat blood samples for the viral genome, and the presence of antibodies to lentiviruses was detected. According to the recommendation of the OIE, the positive result of PCR was confirmed with nucleotide sequencing. It was found that the obtained nucleotide sequence is identical to the genome of small ruminant lentiviruses presented in the GenBank database. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the isolate "Mordovia-2018" was included in the same cluster with an isolate from the Tver region of the Russian Federation detected in 2008. The sequence of the fragment of the env-gene of the isolate from the republic of Mordovia is available in GenBank under the number MN186380.1. To isolate the virus, a fraction of peripheral blood monocyte cells from the animal's blood was added to a monolayer of lamb synovial membrane cell culture, and ten passages were carried out. The first manifestations of the cytopathic effect were observed after the third passage on the eighth day of cultivation in the form of single large cells of irregular shape with 5-7 nuclei. At the seventh passage, multiple syncytium with 7-12 nuclei were observed. At subsequent passage levels, the formation of syncytium containing more than 10-14 nuclei was observed.

AB  - Several structural attributes associated with the buds of shoot apices of angiosperms have been related to protection both at the mechanical and chemical defense levels. Although several characteristics related to the protection of shoot buds are known in different taxa of Sapindales, their occurrence in the neotropical genus Homalolepis (Simaroubaceae) are still unknown. Homalolepis includes 28 species mostly with extra-Amazonian distribution, occurring mainly in the Brazilian domains of the "Cerrado" and the Atlantic Forest. Its species vary widely in terms of habit, many of which are considered adaptations to the environments in which they occur. In this study, usual light and scanning electron microscopy techniques were applied in order to analyze the morphoanatomical and histochemical characteristics associated with the protection of apical and lateral shoot buds in phanerophyte (H. arenaria Devecchi & Pirani (Devecchi & Pirani), H. glabra (Engl.) Devecchi & Pirani and H. insignis (A.St.-Hil. & Tul.) Devecchi & Pirani) and geophyte (H. pumila Devecchi & Pirani, H. salubris (Engl.) Devecchi & Pirani and H. suffruticosa (Engl.) Devecchi & Pirani) species. Glandular prophylls, cataphylls, suberized layer on the leaf primordium, colleters, non-glandular trichomes, as well as a secretory canal with precocious development in the leaf primordium are among the characteristics that can be considered strategies for the protection of shoot buds in the studied species. Such structures are related to physical (cataphyll and suberized layer) and chemical (prophylls and secretory canal) protection or both (trichomes), against desiccation or attack by herbivores.

AB  - Generating high-quality variant callsets across diverse species remains challenging as most bioinformatic tools default to assumptions based on human genomes. DeepVariant (DV) excels without joint genotyping while offering fewer implementation barriers. However, the growing appeal of a "universal" algorithm has magnified the unknown impacts when used with non-human species. Here, we use bovine genomes to assess the limits of using human genome-trained variant callers, including the allele frequency channel (DV-AF) and joint-caller DeepTrio (DT). Our novel approach, TrioTrain, automates extending DV for diploid species lacking Genome-in-a-Bottle (GIAB) resources, using a region shuffling approach to mitigate barriers for SLURM-based clusters. Imperfect animal truth labels are curated to remove Mendelian discordant sites before training DV to genotype the offspring correctly. With TrioTrain, we use cattle, yak, and bison trios to create the first multispecies-trained DV-AF checkpoint. Although incomplete bovine truth sets constrain recall within challenging repetitive regions, we observe a mean SNV F1 score >0.990 across new checkpoints during GIAB benchmarking. With HG002, a bovine-trained checkpoint (28) decreased the Mendelian inheritance error (MIE) rate by a factor of two compared with the default (DV). Checkpoint 28 has a mean MIE rate of 0.03% in three bovine interspecies cross genomes. These results illustrate that a multispecies, trio-based training strategy reduces inheritance errors during single-sample variant calling. Although exclusively training with human genomes deters transferring deep-learning-based variant calling to new species, we use the diverse ancestry within bovids to illustrate the need for advanced tools designed for comparative genomics.

AB  - Organophosphorus compounds (OPs) are neurotoxic molecules developed as pesticides and chemical warfare nerve agents (CWNAs). Most of them are covalent inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), a key enzyme in nervous systems, and are therefore responsible for numerous poisonings around the world. Many animal models have been studied over the years in order to decipher the toxicity of OPs and to provide insights for therapeutic and decontamination purposes. Environmental impact on wild animal species has been analyzed to understand the consequences of OP uses in agriculture. In complement, various laboratory models, from invertebrates to aquatic organisms, rodents and primates, have been chosen to study chronic and acute toxicity as well as neurobehavioral impact, immune response, developmental disruption, and other pathological signs. Several decontamination approaches were developed to counteract the poisoning effects of OPs. Among these, enzyme-based strategies are particularly attractive as they allow efficient external decontamination without toxicity or environmental impact and may be of interest for treatment. Approaches using bioscavengers for prophylaxis, treatment, and external decontamination are emphasized and their potential is discussed in the light of toxicological observations from various animal models. The relevance of animal models, regarding their cholinergic system and the abundance of naturally protecting enzymes, is also discussed for better extrapolation of results to human.

AB  - Aim: To study the alterations in growth mechanisms, cellular differentiation and biochemical processes in Alstonia scholaris (L.) R. Br. post attack of Methodology: The studies were conducted in the Department of Forestry & Natural Resources, Punjab Agricultural University where healthy and psyllid galled leaves at different developmental stages were collected from five trees. Data on the morphological, anatomical and biochemical parameters of P. tuberculata infested Alstonia leaves and pods were recorded. Results: The perusal of data suggested that the diameter of gall chamber of P. tuberculata on Alstonia leaves ranged from 0.1 to 1 cm. The upper and lower epidermal thickness decreased in infested leaves. In mesophyll cells, the thickness of palisade tissues, spongy tissues and vascular bundles increased in infested leaves as compared to healthy leaves. The total soluble sugars content in infested leaves (2.90 mg g f.wt.) and pods (3.90 mg g f.wt.) were significantly higher than healthy leaves (1.61 mg g f.wt.) and pods (1.61 mg g f.wt.), respectively. Also, the total soluble protein and proline content were significantly higher in the infested leaves and pods than healthy leaves and pods. The total chlorophyll content in healthy leaves (2.25 mg g f.wt.) and healthy pods (2.19 mg g f.wt.) was significantly higher than total chlorophyll in infested leaves (0.26 mg g f.wt.) and infested pods (0.27 mg g Interpretation: P. tuberculata herbivory resulted in morpho-anatomical and biochemical changes in A. scholaris as a plant response against biotic stress.

AB  - The use of pesticides may pose a serious threat to soil and water quality, human health, food safety, aquatic species and beneficial insects. Biological control is an effective component of integrated pest management comprising importation, augmentation and conservation. Conservation of natural enemies could enhance or limit the efficiency of herbivorous insect pests. The present study was designed to evaluate the efficiency of Diaeretiella rapae (McIntosh) and other food resources impacts on parasitoid's fecundity, survival and efficiency. The effect of different insecticides [Carbosulfan, Imidacloprid, Diafenthiuron and Lufenuron] was also evaluated in a laboratory controlled experiment. The results revealed that females fed on aphid honeydew proved to be of poor quality as compared to other sugar sources, including honey and sugar solution and has a positive impact of mating on monogenesis. The negative impact was observed on oviposition activity by female reared in the laboratory having less number of mature eggs than females collected in the field. All insecticides demonstrated dose-dependent mortality of D. rapae. In conclusion, food and host availability and insecticides affect the efficiency of D. rapae. These results could lead to the hypothesis that D. rapae females have a high mortality rate in the field due to lower aphid hosts.

AB  - Exposure to alcohol during pregnancy produces Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders, which in its most severe form is characterized by physical dysmorphology and neurobehavioral alterations. Moderate prenatal alcohol exposure (mPAE) is known to produce deficits in discrimination of spatial locations in adulthood. However, the impact of mPAE on higher-order sensory representations, such as discrimination of perceptually similar stimuli, is currently unknown. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that mPAE would disrupt performance on hippocampal-sensitive tasks that require discrimination between perceptually similar objects or discrimination between spatial locations in a radial arm maze. Here we report that male mPAE rats exhibited intact performance on three types of object discrimination tasks: one in which rats discriminated between distinct toy objects, a second in which discrimination was made between distinct and similar LEGO objects, and a mnemonic similarity task in which rats discriminated between randomly presented LEGO objects that varied in similarity with a learned object. Although adult male mPAE rats performed similarly to control rats on all three object discrimination tasks, they showed deficits when tested in a radial arm maze spatial discrimination task. Specifically, male mPAE rats expressed a significantly higher number of working memory errors (returns to previously visited arms) and were more likely to use non-spatial strategies during training. Together, the findings of the present study support the conclusion that mPAE produces specific deficits in the online processing of spatial information and executing spatial navigation strategies, but spares the ability to discriminate between perceptually similar stimuli.

AB  - IntroductionSocial memory involves social recognition: the ability to discriminate between two or more conspecifics when one has been previously encountered. The CA2 region of the hippocampus has been implicated in social memory, as lesions and dysfunction to this area lead to social memory impairments. A variety of psychogenic manipulations during postnatal sensitive developmental periods are associated with social memory impairments later in life. MethodsIn this study, we exposed preadolescent rats to a sexually, mature unrelated male and examined whether this was associated with changes in postadolescent social memory and c-Fos labeling in the CA2 region. Male and female Long-Evans rats were exposed to a male, adult rat on postnatal days 19-21 (P19-21). Social memory was measured during the postadolescent period and defined as increased interactions towards a novel age-matched rat in contrast to a previously-encountered age-matched rat. After the test, rats were euthanized and brain tissue was then collected to quantify c-Fos labeling within the CA2 region. ResultsCompared to home cage controls and controls not exposed to the adult male, male and female rats exposed to the unrelated adult during preadolescence were unable to discriminate between a novel and previously encountered conspecific during the postadolescent test showing social memory deficits. The groups that showed social recognition deficits also had significantly fewer c-Fos-positive cells within the CA2 region compared to the control groups. DiscussionThese findings indicate that threatening psychogenic encounters during preadolescence can have detrimental long-term effects on social memory potentially via disrupted activity in the CA2 hippocampal region.

AB  - The synergetic evolution and assessment of pollutants and carbon reduction of industrial system by symbiotic regulation is the key scientific problem of eco-industrial transformation of industrial system. Based on actual production data from the typical iron and steel industries of Jiayuguan and Tangshan, this study explores the synergistic evolution of pollutant and carbon emission reductions in the iron and steel industry under three different scenarios (Retrospective, Current, and Developing) of the symbiotic regulation of 3Rs (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) through exergy analysis and ecological network analysis. The results of the synergetic evolution show that the recycling of fuel gas is the main source of the 3Rs exergy flow. With the symbiotic regulation of 3Rs, the exergy loss of iron and steel industrial system decreases, and exergy efficiency increases from 70% to about 80%. Ironmaking has the largest exergy loss of about 6200 MJ/tcs, which becomes the key to future regulation. Thermoelectricity is the most active component in terms of circulation (e.g., Detritivory Herbivory ratio of 3.32, 19.75, and 9484.24, respectively). The number of competition relationships decreases by 62.5%. In addition, 3Rs has little effect on robustness of the system. The symbiotic regulation of 3Rs drives the iron and steel industrial system toward eco-industrial transformation. The results could be benefit for policy development and green sustainable development in the industrial system.

AB  - Acidification of slurry is a promising approach for reducing ammonia emissions during the application procedure. Since only a few studies have been conducted focusing on ammonia emissions during the application of liquid organic fertilizers on the soil surface, a suitable incubation system was developed to evaluate the effects of acidification under controlled conditions. This incubation system was used to measure the ammonia emissions of various liquid organic fertilizers. The substrates were acidified with sulfuric and citric acid to different pH values to determine both the influence of the pH value of the substrates and of the type of acid on the ammonia emissions. The emissions decreased with declining pH value, and the reduction in emissions compared to the initial pH of the substrate was over 86% for pH 6.5 and over 98% for pH 6.0 and below. At the same pH value, the ammonia emissions did not differ between substrates acidified with citric acid and sulfuric acid, although more than twice as much 50% citric acid was required compared to 96% sulfuric acid to achieve the same pH value. Overall, our results demonstrate that the incubation system used is suitable for measuring ammonia emissions from surface-applied liquid organic fertilizers. The system allows for the differentiation of emission levels at various pH levels and is therefore suitable for testing the effectiveness of additives for reducing ammonia emissions from liquid organic fertilizers.

AB  - Using an in vivo method for the assessment of polyphosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis, we examine whether spatial learning and memory extinction cause changes in mGlu5 metabotropic glutamate receptor signaling in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. We use the following five groups of mice: (i) naive mice; (ii) control mice exposed to the same environment as learner mice; (iii) leaner mice, trained for four days in a water maze; (iv) mice in which memory extinction was induced by six trials without the platform; (v) mice that spontaneously lost memory. The mGlu5 receptor-mediated PI hydrolysis was significantly reduced in the dorsal hippocampus of learner mice as compared to naive and control mice. The mGlu5 receptor signaling was also reduced in the ventral hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of learner mice, but only with respect to naive mice. Memory extinction was associated with a large up-regulation of mGlu5 receptor-mediated PI hydrolysis in the three brain regions and with increases in mGlu5 receptor and phospholipase-C beta protein levels in the ventral and dorsal hippocampus, respectively. These findings support a role for mGlu5 receptors in mechanisms underlying spatial learning and suggest that mGlu5 receptors are candidate drug targets for disorders in which cognitive functions are impaired or aversive memories are inappropriately retained.

AB  - BackgroundThe deer antler, a remarkable mammalian appendage, has a growth rate surpassing that of any other known osseous organ. Emerging evidence indicates that circRNA and MAPK1 play critical roles in chondrocytes. Thus, exploration of their functions in antler chondrocytes will help us to understand the mechanism regulating the rapid antler growth.MethodsqRT-PCR, western blot, and immunohistochemistry were used to assess the expression of mRNAs and proteins. CCK-8, EdU, Cell migration, ALP activity detection, and ALP staining examined the effects of MAPK1 in antler chondrocytes. FISH, RIP, and luciferase assays were performed to evaluate the interactions among circRNA3634/MAPK1 and miR-124486-5. RIP and RAP assays proved the binding interaction between circRNA3634 and RBPs. Me-RIP was used to determine the m6A methylation modification of circRNA3634.ResultsThis study revealed high MAPK1 expression in antler cartilage tissue. Overexpression of MAPK1 promoted the proliferation, migration, and differentiation of antler chondrocytes and increased the expression of MAPK3, RAF1, MEK1, RUNX2, and SOX9. The silencing of MAPK1 had the opposite effect. CircRNA3634 was found to act as a molecular sponge for miR-124486-5, leading to increased MAPK1 expression and enhanced proliferation and migration of antler chondrocytes through competitive miR-124486-5 binding. We discovered that METTL3 mediates m6A modification near the splicing site of circRNA3634 and is involved in the proliferation and differentiation of antler chondrocytes. The m6A reader YTHDC1 facilitated the nuclear export of circRNA3634 in an m6A-dependent manner. Our results indicate that m6A-modified circRNA3634 promotes the proliferation of antler chondrocytes by targeting MAPK1 and show that the nuclear export of circRNA3634 is related to the expression of YTHDC1, suggesting that circRNA3634 could represent a critical regeneration marker for the antler.ConclusionsOur results revealed a novel m6A-modified circRNA3634 promoted the proliferation and differentiation of antler chondrocytes by regulating MAPK1. The nuclear export of circRNA3634 was related to the expression of YTHDC1.

AB  - Many subclinical diseases associated with inflammation occur in sheep during the periparturient period. Clinical symptoms are usually detected at an advanced stage of the disease; therefore, there are considerable risks of permanent health disorders in fetuses or dams. Determination of acute phase proteins (APPs) as markers of inflammation may allow for an earlier diagnosis and effective treatment. Furthermore, multi-fetus pregnancies are often associated with hematological disturbances. The study objective was to compare plasma concentrations of serum amyloid A (SAA), haptoglobin (Hp), fibrinogen (Fb), and cortisol in ewes bearing one and two fetuses in the period from 2 weeks before to 2 weeks after parturition as well as to determine hematological parameters in peripheral blood. There was an important effect of fetal number on APP and cortisol concentrations in periparturient ewes. There was a greater concentration of SAA, Hp, Fb, and cortisol in ewes bearing two fetuses compared with those bearing one fetus. Profiles for APP and cortisol concentrations and hematological parameters were similar for ewes bearing one and two fetuses, and trends were within normal reference ranges for the periparturient period. Furthermore, there were no differences in values for hematological variables between ewes bearing one and two fetuses. with there being no ewes with anemia. In summary, separate determination of the previously undefined physiological ranges of APPs and cortisol for ewes bearing one and two fetuses may facilitate diagnosis of subclinical disorders and enable comparison of laboratory test results with different reference values for ewes bearing different numbers of fetuses.

AB  - The 2978 faunal bone remains recovered from the Bronze Age levels at the Castillejo del Bonete site between 2005 and 2019 were analyzed in this study. In the main structure (Great Tumulus 1, Tumulus 2, and Tomb 5), the faunal bone remains were identified and interpreted as offerings in a funerary context. In Enclosure 4, a large building possibly dedicated to the celebration of wakes and rituals-including the eating of food and drinking-in honor of the deceased, the anthropic modifications on the bone surfaces indicate their possible consumption. The cave is constituted by four galleries with inhumations (in Galleries 2, 3, and 4) and pithoi (in Gallery 4). Wild and domestic animals were identified in the cavity, and the caprine (likely sheep) is the best represented taxa in the entire cave. The almost complete skeletal representation; the predominance of fetal, neonate, and juvenile individuals; the absence of anthropic modifications related to consumption, in addition to the bone industry made of caprine bones (such as an eye idol and anthropomorphic artefacts), suggest that caprines were used as offerings to the deceased that accompany them. Postdepositional taphonomic alterations, the animals not having been found in anatomical connection, and the refits of the bones between different stratigraphical units indicate the repeated use of the cave during the Bronze Age.

AB  - Pork meat is closely related to physicochemical alterations during growth and development, resulting in differences in nutritional value and meat flavor. This study aimed to evaluate the composition of amino acids, fatty acids, and metabolic profiles in the longissimus thoracis muscle (LM) of Shaziling pigs aged 30, 90, 150, 210, and 300 days. The results showed that the predominant fatty acids identified in the LM of Shaziling pigs were C16:0, C16:1, C18:0, C18:1n9c, and C18:2n6c. An opposite correlation was observed for C18:2n6c and n6/n3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (P < 0.05). Alanine, aspartate, glutamate, D-glutamine, and D-glutamate metabolism were the main metabolic pathways for the Shaziling pig meat flavor (P < 0.05). Moreover, the correlation coefficients revealed that the contents of anserine, C16:0, C16:1, and C18:1n9c were positively correlated with intramuscular fat and/or pH(24h) and were negatively correlated with the values of L* (lightness) and b* (yellowness) (P < 0.05). In conclusion, age greatly affected the meat quality of Shaziling pigs, and the contents of muscular anserine, C16:0, C16:1, and C18:1n9c might be promising indicators for better meat quality.

AB  - The efficiency of combining oestrous induction via a light program (16 h of light and 8 h of darkness for 60 days, ending on Day 0 - D0) with cloprostenol administration, followed by the male effect or not, was tested in acyclic Saanen goats during the non-breeding season (June/2019 to January/2020). Initially, all animals (males and females) were submitted to the described light program; 60 days after its ending (D60), the females were divided into two groups, with (G1; n = 67) or without (G2; n = 61) a male effect from D60 to D75 after the light program. At D75, both groups received two cloprostenol doses (120 mu g; intramuscular) 7.5 days apart (D75 and D82.5). Artificial insemination was performed at a specific time according to the oestrous onset (approximately 68.4 +/- 1.2 h between the second cloprostenol dose and IA). Ultrasound scans were performed at different intervals to evaluate follicular dynamics and confirm pregnancy. At the first cloprostenol dose (D75), the proportion of does with at least a corpus luteum (CL), which indicates resumed cyclicity, was greater in G1 than in G2 (85.2% vs. 48.8%; p < .05), although no difference was found at the second dose (p > .05). The adjusted pregnancy rates (number of pregnant goats/oestrous goats) differed between G1 and G2 (21.7% vs. 42.0%; p < .05). G1 also showed a higher frequency of functional CL (based on blood flow and morphology) compared to G2 (96.9% vs. 66.7%; p < .05) at D116. A male effect using photo-stimulated bucks after the first cloprostenol dose increased the number of does presenting CL after buck removal, and no impairment in the pregnancy rates of multiparous does was found.

AB  - In order to study the impact of acute temperature challenge on juvenile hippocampus's growth, the variations of external behavioural indexes and internal physiological, biochemical and genetic indexes were analysed at the same time under acute temperature change. In this paper, the external indexes we selected were the response parameters of feeding behaviour (including feeding reaction time, feeding rate and food intake, etc.). The internal indicators include biochemical indicators (SOD, CAT, AKP, ACP, Trypsin, LPS and AMS enzyme activity and MDA content) and fold change (differentially expression multiples) of differentially expressed gene (Hsp70, Hsp90, Gst, Pyy, mTOR, Bcl-2, Casp9, Casp3, Gadd45 alpha, Fadsd6, Cpt1, Fas, Cyp51, Pdha1, Mdh1, Idh3b and G6pd). The results showed that the juvenile's external indexes had changed significantly at 12 h after short-term temperature challenge exposed. At the same time, the feeding reaction time (s) was extend, and the feeding rate (individuals/min) and food intake (individual) were reduced, suggesting that the growth of juvenile might be suppressed by temperature challenge. At the same time, MDA and AMS showed a significant correlation with the feeding behaviour parameters, and several function genes Gadd45 alpha, Casp3, Idh3b and G6pd also showed a correlation with the behavioural parameters. Our study provide a valuable information for understanding the mechanism of internal and external reaction in juvenile seahorse, which exposed to short-term temperature challenge. It is useful to explore the mechanism of how temperature affects fish growth. And the external behavioural indexes can correctly reflect the excessive fluctuation of environmental temperature that is harmful to the juvenile.

AB  - Simple Summary Several studies have studied the influence of diet supplementation on goat milk quality, but the number of animals included is normally small or does not reflect real commercial conditions. Moreover, little technological and sensory input is provided. Thus, our study included 350 goats divided into three groups (one control, two supplemented with ingredients rich in n-3). Dietary n-3 treatments modify the fatty acid profile without making any sensory difference to milk and fresh cheese, accompanied by marginal modifications to the physicochemical profile. Therefore, milk obtained from animals receiving dietary supplementation can be provided to the dairy industry.Abstract This study analyzes the influence of the incorporation of flaked linseed and fish oil in the diet on the resulting milk and cheese. Three dietary treatments were assayed in 350 milking Murciano-Granadina multiparous goats in full-lactation: a control diet and two experimental diets, one including flaked linseed (FL) at 3.88% of dry matter, and the other containing salmon oil (SO) at 2.64% of dry matter for three periods of 21 d. None of the dietary treatments affected the daily milk yield, cheese yield, or the physicochemical parameters of the milk and cheese. Regarding the fatty acid profile (FA), the milk and cheese from animals whose diets were supplemented with SO had a higher percentage of fatty acids than those obtained with the FL-supplemented diet, except for C18:0, C18:1, C18:2 n-6, trans-9, trans-12 C18:2, cis-9, trans-11 C18:2, C18:3, and C19:0, which reached their highest levels in milk obtained with the diet supplemented with FL. The decrease in the percentage of C16:0 was greater in the milk derived from the FL diet than from the SO diet. The FL-supplemented diet improved the nutritional value of milk due to a reduction in saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and increases in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA). The decrease in n-6/n-3 in the observed milk was more pronounced with the FL diet. No differences in the sensory profile were found for the milk and cheese derived from the different dietary treatments. Dietary n-3 treatments modified the fatty acid profile without making any sensory difference to milk and fresh cheese, accompanied by marginal modifications to the physicochemical profile. We conclude that dietary supplementation with flaked linseed or fish oil produces milk and cheese from Murciano-Granadina goats with a higher nutritional quality without modifying the sensory profile of the corresponding products obtained from animals that were fed a routine diet.

AB  - Male bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) participate in seasonal ramming bouts that can last for hours, yet they do not appear to suffer significant brain injury. Previous work has shown that the keratin-rich horn and boney horncore may play an important role in mitigating brain injury by reducing brain cavity accelerations through energy dissipating elastic mechanisms. However, the extent to which specific horn shapes (such as the tapered spiral of bighorn sheep) may reduce accelerations post-impact remains unclear. Thus, the goals of this work were to (a) quantify bighorn sheep horn shape, particularly the cross-sectional areal properties related to bending that largely dictate post-impact deformations, and (b) investigate the effects of different tapered horn shapes on reducing post-impact accelerations in an impact model with finite element analysis. Cross-sectional areal properties indicate bighorn sheep horns have a medial-lateral bending preference at the horn tip (p = 0.006), which is likely to dissipate energy through medial-lateral horn tip oscillations after impact. Finite element modeling showed bighorn sheep native horn geometry reduced the head injury criterion (HIC15) by 48% compared to horns with cross-sections rotated by 90 degrees to have a cranial-caudal bending preference, and by 125% compared to a circular tapered spiral model. These results suggest that the tapered spiral horn shape of bighorn sheep is advantageous for dissipating energy through elastic mechanisms following an impact. These findings can be used to broadly inform the design of improved safety equipment and impact systems.

AB  - Seven species of Polydrusus Germar weevils (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) occur in the United States of America and Canada, three of which are introduced from Europe, are polyphagous, and may be displacing native weevil fauna in select areas of North America. We review host plant information for these species and provide distributional maps for each. We also present results on the seasonal phenology and sex ratios of two nonnative species, Polydrusus impressifrons (Gyllenhal) and Polydrusus formosus (Mayer), recorded in 2020 and 2021 in two orchards of hybrid hazelnuts (Betulaceae) in Minnesota, United States of America. These two species may present an episodic threat to the burgeoning hybrid hazelnut industry due to their ability to damage buds, foliage, and roots of hardwoods. We found that adults of these two species began emerging in late May of each year and remained present until mid-July. We found higher numbers of P. formosus than of P. impressifrons on hazel plants. Sex ratios of both species were generally between 50-60% male. We supply a compendium of species descriptions that (1) distinguishes between native and nonnative species and (2) identifies the sex of nonnative species. This research contributes to work on the ecology of Polydrusus, conservation of native species, and the management of tree crops.

AB  - Inadequate gonadal maturation and poor spawning performance increasingly threaten the sustainability of shrimp aquaculture. Unraveling the mechanisms regulating ovarian development and maturation hence is critical to address industry challenges. Vitellogenin (Vtg), a precursor of yolk protein found in the hepatopancreas and ovary of shrimp, plays a key role in facilitating shrimp's oocyte maturation and embryonic development after oviposition. This study found that FpVtg was specifically expressed in F. penicillatus hepatopancreas and ovary. FpVtg was localized predominantly in the oocyte cytoplasm and distributed uniformly in the hepatopancreas tissue. Silencing FpVtg led to apoptosis in both hepatopancreas and ovary tissues. Furthermore, FpVtg depletion upregulated the expression of ovarian peritrophin 1, ovarian peritrophin 2, serine proteinase inhibitor 6, and juvenile hormone esterase-like carboxylesterase 1, while downregulated that of vitellogenin, delta-9 desaturase, and insulin-like receptor. KEGG pathway analysis implicated such as PI3K-AKT signaling, RNA transport, ECM-receptor interaction, hippo signaling, oocyte meiosis, and apoptosis were enriched and involved in ovarian development. These findings have provided insights into the FpVtg's reproductive role and the associated regulatory genes and pathways in F. penicillatus. This knowledge can contribute to establishing strategies to improve the breeding and aquaculture production of F. penicillatus by elucidating its vitellogenesis regulation in redtail prawn and other penaeid species. Further characterization of the implicated pathways and genes will clarify the intricacies underlying ovarian maturation.

AB  - The main aim of this study was to determine the concentration of total mercury (T-Hg) in different tissues, hair, and faeces from a long-lived animal that actively lives in the subalpine and alpine zone within temperate climate zone throughout the year. Levels of T-Hg in samples from naturally deceased Tatra chamois (n = 72) from the Tatra Mountains (Slovakia) were determined using direct mercury analyses on the basis of dry weight. The mercury concentrations in hair samples were compared over the last three decades. Seasonal changes in mercury concentration and differences in the amounts of mercury in various tissues, hairs, and faeces between age and sex groups were also studied. The highest mercury concentrations in organs were found in the kidneys of Tatra chamois, with mean values of 0.45 +/- 0.07 mu g/g (dry weight) for adults (n = 18) and 0.39 +/- 0.12 mu g/g (dry weight) for juveniles (n = 6). These values are considerably high compared to expected Hg levels in wild ungulates from foothill and mountain areas in the temperate zone. Juveniles had higher levels of T-Hg in their muscles (0.011 +/- 0.001 mu g/g dry weight, n = 10) and faeces (0.189 +/- 0.025 mu g/g dry weight, n = 7) when compared to adults that had 0.007 +/- 0.001 mu g/g dry weight of T-Hg in muscles (n = 29) and 0.113 +/- 0.015 mu g/g dry of T-Hg weight in faeces (n = 19). T-Hg concentrations in individual tissues (heart, kidney, liver, lungs, spleen, tongue, muscle, bone), hairs, and faeces were not significantly different between males and females. Mercury levels in the hair of Tatra chamois have increased significantly since the 1990s (median value of T-Hg: 0.025 mu g/g dry weight) with the highest values presenting during the 2000s (0.029 mu g/g dry weight). Since 2010 (0.016 mu g/g dry weight), levels have declined when compared to those observed during the 1990s and 2000s. Therefore, we can conclude that T-Hg deposition in alpine areas of the Tatra Mountains shows a declining trend since the 2010s. T-Hg concentrations in the heart, muscle, and hair were higher in summer compared to winter. Seasonal changes in mercury concentrations are likely most related to the seasonal availability of food, but may also be related to moulting periods, and this correlation must be explored further.

AB  - Cognitive impairment affects patients suffering from various neuropsychiatric diseases, which are often accompanied by changes in the glutamatergic system. Epidemiological studies indicate that predispositions to the development of neuropsychiatric diseases may be programmed prenatally. Mother's improper diet during pregnancy and lactation may cause fetal abnormalities and, consequently, predispose to diseases in childhood and even adulthood. Considering the prevalence of obesity in developed countries, it seems important to examine the effects of diet on the behavior and physiology of future generations. We hypothesized that exposure to sugar excess in a maternal diet during pregnancy and lactation would affect memory as the NMDA receptor-related processes. Through the manipulation of the sugar amount in the maternal diet in rats, we assessed its effect on offspring's memory. Then, we evaluated if memory alterations were paralleled by molecular changes in NMDA receptors and related modulatory pathways in the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus of adolescent and young adult female and male offspring. Behavioral studies have shown sex-related changes like impaired recognition memory in adolescent males and spatial memory in females. Molecular results confirmed an NMDA receptor hypofunction along with subunit composition abnormalities in the medial prefrontal cortex of adolescent offspring. In young adults, GluN2A-containing receptors were dominant in the medial prefrontal cortex, while in the hippocampus the GluN2B subunit contribution was elevated. In conclusion, we demonstrated that a maternal high-sugar diet can affect the memory processes in the offspring by disrupting the NMDA receptor composition and regulation in the medial prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus.

AB  - Bioarchaeological studies provide a valuable contribution to the understanding of the economy and activities of prehistoric populations in mountain regions. The Late Bronze Age in the Caucasus is an epoch of fundamental transformations that is accompanied by the development of a semi-stationary pastoral economy and ultimately by the emergence of combined mountain agriculture. So far, only a few archaeozoological assemblages from this period have been published. The site of Ransyrt-1 in the North Caucasus offers a substantial collection of bone material from the remains of a mountain sanctuary. Analysis of the animal remains as well as preliminary isotopic analyses of strontium, oxygen, and carbon shed light on animal exploitation at this site. Comparisons with slightly later settlements in the North and South Caucasus illustrate the development of intensive livestock management strategies in the Late Bronze Age in this region at the interface between Southwest Asia and the Eurasian steppe.

AB  - The apoptosis of granulosa cells can result in follicular atresia, a key process in follicle selection and development. The related molecular mechanisms were explored to study the effects of liver receptor homolog-1 (Lrh-1) on apoptosis, sodium-titanium system, and steroid synthesis of granulosa cells from Hu sheep in vitro. After constructing, designing, and synthesizing the Lrh-1 overexpression vector, liposomes were used to transfect Hu sheep granulosa cells. Thereafter, qRT-PCR and Western blot were used to detect the mechanism of Lrh-1 on the titanium system and steroid synthesis of Hu sheep granulosa cells. The overexpression efficiency was determined by fluorescence 48 h after liposome transfection into the Hu sheep granulosa cells in vitro culture. The transfection efficiency was higher, hence providing a basis for subsequent experiments. However, the protein level and transcriptional level of Lrh-1 significantly increased after transfection with Lrh-1 overexpression vector in Hu sheep granulosa cells. We further revealed that after Lrh-1 overexpression in Hu sheep granulosa cells, the expression of the pro-apoptotic gene Bax decreased significantly, while that of the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2 increased significantly, as well as the sodium peptide system. Moreover, the expression levels of natriuretic peptide precursor A, B, and C (NPPA, NPPB, NPPC) all showed an upward trend, while the expression levels of steroid synthesis-related genes (P450arom and P450scc) decreased. The above results showed that Lrh-1 overexpression influenced the apoptosis, sodium peptide system, and steroid synthesis.

AB  - Cortical Layer 1 (L1) acts as a critical relay for processing long-range inputs. GABAergic inhibitory interneurons (INs) in this layer (Layer 1 interneurons [L1INs]) function as inhibitory gates, regulating these inputs and modulating the activity of deeper cortical layers. However, their characteristics and circuits in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) remain poorly understood. Using biocytin labeling, we identified three distinct morphological types of mPFC L1INs: neurogliaform cells (NGCs), elongated NGCs (eNGCs), and single-bouquet cell-like (SBC-like) cells. Whole-cell recordings revealed distinct firing patterns across these subtypes: NGCs and eNGCs predominantly exhibited late-spiking (LS) patterns, and SBC-like cells displayed a higher prevalence of non-LS (NLS) patterns. We observed both electrical and chemical connections among mPFC L1INs. Optogenetic activation of NDNF+ L1INs demonstrated broad inhibitory effects on deeper layer neurons. The strength of inhibition on pyramidal neurons (PyNs) and INs displayed layer-specific preference. These findings highlight the functional diversity of L1INs in modulating mPFC circuits and suggest their potential role in supporting higher order cognitive functions.

AB  - In addition to physiological functions, sticky plant trichomes perform a variety of anti-herbivory functions, such as deterring invertebrate and mammalian herbivores, and attracting the natural predators of stuck arthropods by providing them with immobilized prey. However, since the adaptive value of sticky glands has only been studied in a small fraction of trichrome-bearing plant species, other functions of these structures may yet be discovered. Several hemiparasitic plants, which obtain nutrients by both photosynthesis and from the roots of other plants, bear dense glandular trichomes on their aboveground parts. Field observations of the alien hemiparasitic plant Parentucellia viscosa were conducted in central Japan. The plants colonized a sparsely vegetated riverbank and gradually increased in number over time. The glandular trichomes on the plants not only entrapped small insects, but also grass seeds. It is thus possible that various sticky hemiparasitic plants, including P. viscosa, may intercept and capture the dispersed seeds of other plants, ensuring that their own seeds germinate in the same vicinity as those of the dispersing hostplant seeds in the following season. In so doing, P. viscosa may provision future ju-venile plants with potential hosts. This scenario may be restricted to the early colonizing phase on plantless areas of disturbed soil. The seed-intercepting function of the glandular trichomes may act in conjunction with direct and indirect anti-herbivore defenses, and lower the dispersal of seeds of wind-borne plants in the vicinity beyond the reach of this hemiparasite.

AB  - Variations in plant genotypes and phenotypes are expressed in ways that lead to the development of defensive abilities against herbivory. Induced defenses are mechanisms that affect herbivore insect preferences and performance. We evaluated the performance of resistant and susceptible phenotypes of Bauhinia brevipes (Fabaceae) against attacks by the gall-inducing insect Schizomyia macrocapillata (Diptera). We hypothesized that there is a positive relationship between resistance to S. macrocapillata and host plant performance because resistance can have a high adaptive value. We evaluated plant architecture, nutritional leaf quality, leaf fluctuating asymmetry, and reproductive capacity between phenotypes. Plant performance was evaluated at three ontogenetic stages: seed, seedling, and juvenile. Overall, there were no differences in vegetative and reproductive performance or asymmetry between the resistant and susceptible mature plants. We found no relationship between leaf nutritional quality and resistance to S. macrocapillata. Plant performance was consistent across ontogeny for both phenotypes, except for five variables. Contrary to our expectations, the susceptible plants performed equally well or better than the resistant plants, suggesting that tolerance and overcompensation to herbivory in B. brevipes may be mediated by induced defense. Our study highlights the importance of multiple layers of plant defense against herbivory, where plant tolerance acts as a secondary barrier in plants susceptible to gall-inducing insects.

AB  - Groundhog Day is a widespread North American ritual that marks the onset of spring, with festivities centered around animals that humans believe have abilities to make seasonal predictions. Yet, the collective success of groundhog Marmota monax prognosticators has never been rigorously tested. Here, we propose the local climate-predicted phenology of early blooming spring plants (Carolina spring beauty, or Claytonia caroliniana, which overlaps in native range with groundhogs) as a novel and relevant descriptor of spring onset that can be applied comparatively across a broad geographical range. Of 530 unique groundhog-year predictions across 33 different locations, spring onset was correctly predicted by groundhogs exactly 50% of the time. While no singular groundhog predicted the timing of spring with any statistical significance, there were a handful of groundhogs with notable records of both successful and unsuccessful predictions: Essex Ed (Essex, Connecticut), Stonewall Jackson (Wantage, New Jersey), and Chuckles (Manchester, Connecticut) correctly predicted spring onset over 70% of the time. By contrast, Buckeye Chuck (Marion, Ohio), Dunkirk Dave (Dunkirk, New York), and Holland Huckleberry (Holland, Ohio) made incorrect predictions over 70% of the time. The two most widely recognized and long-tenured groundhogs in their respective countries-Wiarton Willie (Canada) and Punxsutawney Phil (United States)-had success rates of 54% and 52%, respectively, despite over 150 collective guesses. Using a novel phenological indicator of spring, this study determined, without a shadow of a doubt, that groundhog prognosticating abilities for the arrival of spring are no better than chance.
   Significance Statement The groundhog has long been considered North America's premiere prophet for projecting the onset of spring. Yet, the accuracy of groundhog predictions with few exceptions has remained overlooked and untested. By using a straightforward indicator of spring across the range of groundhog locations-the climate-inferred flowering date of Carolina spring beauty, one of North America's earliest spring blooms-our results indicate that groundhog predictions have odds that are no better than a coin toss. Of 530 guesses, groundhogs managed a success rate of exactly 50%, and not a single groundhog of the 33 tested stood out as being meaningfully successful at predicting the onset of spring. While groundhogs provide an enjoyable ritual, rodent forecasters should stop hogging the spotlight.

AB  - Methamphetamine (METH), a stimulant that is extremely addictive, directly affects the central nervous system. METH's abuse and consumption are directly linked to mental illnesses, psychosis, and behavioral and cognitive impairments. It may disrupt the reward system and dopaminergic transmission. METH's rewarding qualities are associated with a rise in dopamine. Additionally, cannabidiol (CBD), one of the primary cannabinoid components of the cannabis plant, significantly affects dopaminergic transmission and may aid in reward- and addiction-related behaviors. To shed light on the role of the D2-like dopamine receptor (D2R) in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG), the present study examined the effects of CBD on the acquisition and expression of the conditioned place preference (CPP) induced by METH. The function of D2R was ascertained by delivering Sulpiride microinjections, as a D2R antagonist Sulpiride (0.25, 1, and 4 mu g/0.5 mu L DMSO12%) into the DG. Moreover, an intracerebroventricular injection of CBD at a dose of 10 mu g/5 mu L for CPP acquisition and 50 mu g/5 mu L for CPP expression was given to rats. According to the current research, CBD dramatically reduced the acquisition and expression of CPP resulting from METH. However, Sulpiride suppressed the effect of CBD on METH-induced CPP acquisition and expression, with a greater impact on expression experiments. Ultimately, this study proposed that the expression experiment of METH-induced CPP appears to be heavily dependent on D2R in the DG.

AB  - G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER), which is different from traditional estrogen nuclear receptors (ERs), mediates the rapid transduction of nongenomic signals in cells, and works by regulating transcription and intracellular second messengers. Studies have shown that GPER may regulate oocyte maturation, but the relevant mechanism is not entirely clear. Here, goat cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were used as a model to explore the regulation and mechanism of GPER on oocyte maturation. Our study showed that 17 beta-estradiol (E-2) significantly reduced cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) synthesis in COCs and accelerated the meiotic resumption of goat oocytes via GPER. Further investigation found that GPER mediated the downregulation of natriuretic peptide receptor 2 (NPR2) protein expression in goat cumulus cells by E-2. In addition, we found that E-2 significantly upregulated the mRNA levels of epidermal growth (EGF)-like factors in goat cumulus cells through GPER, and activated the downstream EGF receptor (EGFR) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling pathways. Both AG1478 (EGFR inhibitor) and U0126 (ERK1/2 inhibitor) abolished the inhibitory effect of E-2 on the protein expression of NPR2. These results indicate that, through GPER, E-2 upregulates the mRNA levels of EGF-like factors in goat cumulus cells and activates the downstream EGF signaling network to suppress the expression of NPR2 protein, which results in a decrease in cGMP synthesis and acceleration of meiotic resumption in goat oocytes.

AB  - Leaf spectra (reflectance and transmittance) are commonly measured using a portable spectroradiometer and an integrating sphere or contact probe with an artificial light source. However, spectral data may be obscured due to water vapor and low signal-to-noise ratios, especially in the shortwave infrared-2 region (SWIR-2, 2001-2500 nm). Therefore, we proposed a spectral reconstruction approach to retrieve noise-free SWIR-2 fresh green leaf spectra by referring to the previously published quality-controlled fresh green leaf spectral reference databases. We processed 896 pairs of fresh tea (Camellia sinensis var. sinensis) leaf reflectance/transmittance from Alishan in central Taiwan. We selected a subset (500-1900 nm) of the spectra in the visible, near-infrared, and SWIR-1 regions (VNS-1) that were relatively insensitive to atmospheric conditions. We matched those spectra with publicly available reference green leaf spectral databases, and selected the one that was most similar to each Alishan VNS-1 spectrum. We then used multivariable linear regression, linear parameter multiplication and spectral reversion to reconstruct SWIR-2 spectra. Finally, we used another set of green leaf spectral databases to assess the performance of the proposed method. The performance of the reconstruction approach was satisfactory, with mean (+/- standard deviation) root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) of 0.0041 +/- 0.0019 (reflectance) and 0.0054 +/- 0.0027 (transmittance) for each spectrum and RMSEs of 0.0058 +/- 0.0027 (reflectance) and 0.0055 +/- 0.0043 (transmittance) for each SWIR-2 band. The proposed approach successfully modeled SWIR-2, which could be further improved with the availability of a more comprehensive set of green leaf reference spectral databases.

AB  - Camel is continually exposed to stressful desert environment that enhances generation of reactive oxygen species, including hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Catalase plays an important role in detoxification of H2O2. A highly active catalase from camel kidney was purified to homogeneity, with a specific activity of 1,774,392 U/mg protein, using ion exchange and metal chelate affinity chromatography. The molecular weight of the enzyme was 268 kDa consisting of four identical subunits of 63 kDa. The enzyme showed higher optimum temperature (45 degrees C) and higher activation energy (4.37 kJ mol(-1)). The thermodynamic parameters, Delta H, Delta G and Delta S, were determined. The effect of various metal ions and chemicals on enzyme activity was investigated. K-m, V-max, k(cat) and k(cat)/K-m values for H2O2 were found to be 46 mM, 10,715,045 U/mg, 48,265,968 s(-1) and 2,966,562 s(-1 )mM(-1), respectively. Camel kidney catalase displayed higher affinity efficiency for H2O2 and can protect reduced glutathione (GSH) from oxidation by H2O2. Sodium azide was found to be a noncompetitive inhibitor of enzyme with K-i and IC50 of 17.88 mu M and 20.94 mu M, respectively. Camel catalase showed unique biochemical properties. Interestingly, camel catalase can protect molecules (GSH) and organ functions (kidney) from the toxic effects of H2O2 induced by stressful desert environment.

AB  - Caterpillar feeding immediately triggers the release of volatile compounds stored in the leaves of cotton plants. Additionally, after 1 d of herbivory, the leaves release other newly synthesised volatiles. We investigated whether these volatiles affect chemical defences in neighbouring plants and whether such temporal shifts in emissions matter for signalling between plants. Undamaged receiver plants were exposed to volatiles from plants infested with Spodoptera caterpillars. For receiver plants, we measured changes in defence-related traits such as volatile emissions, secondary metabolites, phytohormones, gene expression, and caterpillar feeding preference. Then, we compared the effects of volatiles emitted before and after 24 h of damage on neighbouring plant defences. Genes that were upregulated in receiver plants following exposure to volatiles from damaged plants were the same as those activated directly by herbivory on a plant. Only volatiles emitted after 24 h of damage, including newly produced volatiles, were found to increase phytohormone levels, upregulate defence genes, and enhance resistance to caterpillars. These results indicate that the defence induction by volatiles is a specific response to de novo synthesised volatiles, suggesting that these compounds are honest signals of herbivore attack. These findings point to an adaptive origin of airborne signalling between plants.

AB  - Despite the key role of casein genes and their effect on quantitative traits and technological assets of milk, few studies manipulated it in camels, unlike other ruminants. Thus, this investigation was performed to lighten up the genetic polymorphism of CSN2 and CSN3 genes, in Maghrebi camels, via PCR-SSCP and DNA sequencing tools, by measuring the impacted milk composition traits. Sixty-eight blood samples were collected from Maghrebi camels in Mersa Matrouh, Egypt. Also, 68 milk samples were collected at different stages of the lactation period. Protein, fat, lactose, total solid, and ash were estimated in all milk samples by biochemical methods. The results of the PCR-SSCP and the sequence analysis showed two genotypes (CC and CA) in CSN2 gene with one SNP (41 T > G) for CC genotype and two SNPs (41 T > G and 462A > C) for CA genotype, as showed three genotypes (AA, AT, and TT) in CSN3 gene with two SNPs (42C > A and 346 T > A) for AA genotype, two SNPs (42C > A and 100 C > T) for TT genotype, and four SNPs (42C > A, 100C > T, 238 T > G, and 346 T > A) for AT genotype. Allele C of CSN2 gene affected milk fat only at the first day and the first seven days of lactation period, while allele T of CSN3 gene affected both the studied milk composition initiated from the first seven days to the end of the lactation period. The genetic discrimination of the understudied genes may be utilized as a valuable marker in the selection of superior animals, through the favorable alleles and genotypes to improve the camel milk composition.

AB  - Ozone is a strong oxidant which has a good degradation effect on organic matter and a good disinfection effect. In the present study, the effects of different ozone concentration and treatment time on total nitrogen, total phosphorus, total potassium, organic matter (OM), 5 day biological oxygen demand (BOD5), chemical oxygen demand (CODCr) and hygiene indexes in pig manure water under the condition of 5% total solid concentration (TS) were studied. The current research aims at optimizing concentration and time of ozone treatment in pig manure water. Therefore, 5 different ozone concentrations (i.e. 0, 60, 120, 180 and 240 mg/L) are applied to treat fecal water for 10, 20, 30 and 40 minutes. The results showed that the pH, OM content, total phosphorus, total potassium and total nitrogen content of fecal water do not change significantly. On the other hand, with the increasing ozone concentration and treatment time, the contents of BOD5, CODCr and suspended solid (SS) in fecal water have a decreasing trend. While the mortality rate of eggs of Ascaris lumbricoides were 95%, the number of E. coli groups was 10(-4) as the standards. According to the obtained data, the effect of ozone has enhanced with increasing ozone concentrations. The optimal treatment condition was applying ozone at 240 mg/L for 40 minutes.

AB  - Simple Summary The effects of temperature and the host plant on the digestion rate of thrips, Frankliniella intonsa (Trybom), were assessed using a molecular diagnostic tool. The digestion rates of F. intonsa were determined as detectability half-lives of plant DNA in the gut content of thrips. Compared to the optimal temperature (26 degrees C), high and low temperatures (16 degrees C and 32 degrees C) both seem to accelerate the digestion in F. intonsa. The protein content of plants played an important role in the digestive response of F. intonsa to temperature changes. The results provide a direct insight and a better understanding of digestion in thrips.Abstract Frankliniella intonsa (Trybom) (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) is an important type of thrip and a polyphagous pest, which poses a serious threat to many crops, especially those in tropical regions of China. Its feeding behavior and the damage caused vary among different host plant species and are affected by ambient temperature and plant nutrients as well. The digestion rate is an important index for directly observing the digestion process, but there have been no studies directly measuring the digestion in thrips under the influence of different temperatures and host plants. Here, the digestion rate of F. intonsa was assessed by using a molecular diagnostic tool. We also determined the nutrient content in three host plant (mango, cowpea, and pepper), including soluble proteins, free fatty acids, soluble sugars, and water. The results showed that the high and low temperatures (16 degrees C and 32 degrees C) both seemed to accelerate the digestion of F. intonsa compared to the optimal temperature (26 degrees C) and the protein content of plants played an important role in the digestive response of F. intonsa to temperature changes. The findings can help reveal the feeding damage caused by F. intonsa to different plants and help to better understand its feeding ecology, according to its interaction with the host plant.

AB  - Simple Summary This study aimed to investigate the impact of two different machine milking vacuum levels on the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of milk and the hygiene of mammary glands in ewes, when administered vitamin E and selenium (Se). The results indicated that the chemical composition of milk was not affected by the vacuum level, but the supplementation of vitamin E and Se had a positive influence on milk quality. Milk yield was notably increased with the 46 kPa vacuum level (high vacuum level). Furthermore, the supplementation of vitamin E and Se reduced the somatic cell count (SCC), which indicated better mammary gland health status at both vacuum levels. Significant differences in total bacterial count (TBC) between the vacuum levels were not observed, regardless of vitamin E and Se administration. In conclusion, the study suggests that increased vacuum level can improve milk yields and the supplementation of animal diets with vitamin E and Se has a positive impact on milk quality as well as on reducing SCC and improving the hygiene of machine milked ewes' mammary glands.Abstract The aim of this research was to study the effect of two machine milking vacuum levels on the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of milk and mammary gland hygiene of ewes, when vitamin E and Se were administrated supplementarily. The experiment was conducted at the Vlasti Research Station in the Greek province of West Macedonia. Ninety-six ewes of the Mountainous Greek sheep breed were used. Animals were separated in four equal groups of 24 ewes per group. A 2 x 2 factorial design was applied, with two milking vacuum levels (38 kPa and 46 kPa) and two rations, one supplemented with vitamin E (300 I.U.) and Se (3 mg/kg DM feed) and one without any vitamin E and Se supplementation. Six test days were assigned (evening and morning milkings) at 14-day intervals, from April to July. Following milk yield control, milk samples were collected for chemical composition and somatic cell count (SCC) determination. At the end of milking of each lot, the milk from the terminal receiver of the milking machine was received for the evaluation of total bacterial count (TBC). The results revealed that milk yield was improved considerably in the case of 46 kPa vacuum level. Moreover, the chemical composition of milk was not influenced by vacuum level; however, the administration of vitamin E and Se appeared to have a positive effect. Moreover, the addition of vitamin E and Se decreased somatic cell counts (number and log10) at the two assessed machine milking vacuum levels. In reference to TBC and their log10, significant differences were not observed at both milking vacuum levels, regardless of vitamin E and Se administration. Statistical analysis did not indicate any interactions between the factors that were studied. Therefore, it is concluded that the quantity of vitamin E and Se supplemented to the ration has a positive effect on decreasing SCC and consequent positive action in the hygiene of the mammary glands of machine milked ewes.

AB  - Simple Summary Goats have been used as animal models in many studies, and therefore, the need for safer anesthesia for research or surgical intervention is gaining much attention. In this current study, we evaluated the quality of anesthesia and the immediate postoperative analgesia of a newer anesthetic combination nalbuphine-ketamine, compared with ketamine alone in xylazine-sedated goats. This combination has been shown to allow the calm, acceptable induction of anesthesia and recovery. In addition, goats anesthetized with nalbuphine-ketamine exhibited a significant decrease in total pain scores postoperatively compared with ketamine. This study concluded that adding nalbuphine to ketamine improves the quality of anesthesia and reduces immediate postoperative pain in goats. Goats have been used as animal models in research, and the need for achieving safer anesthesia for research or surgical intervention is gaining much attention. The objective of this study was to evaluate intraoperative effects and the immediate postoperative analgesia of nalbuphine-ketamine regimen in goats. Twenty clinically healthy adult female crossbred goats weighing 14 +/- 2 kg were allocated randomly into each of two equally sized groups. All animals were sedated with intramuscular (IM) xylazine (0.07 mg/kg), then anesthesia was intravenously (IV) induced with ketamine alone (10 mg/kg) (XK group), or a combination of nalbuphine (0.5 mg/kg) and ketamine (5 mg/kg) (XNK group). Following induction, left flank laparotomy was performed and then sutured. The quality of anesthesia and immediate postoperative analgesia was evaluated. Immediate postoperative analgesia was assessed up to 5 h after standing, using a modified Unesp-Botucatu acute composite pain scale (USAPS). Serum cortisol, glucose, insulin, and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured at 1/2, 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 h, postoperatively (PO). The USAPS pain scores were significantly lower in the XNK compared to the XK group (p < 0.05). The XNK group exhibited a statistically significant difference in the level of serum cortisol at 1/2 and 1 h PO (p = 0.018 and 0.045, respectively) compared to the XK group. At 2, 4, 6 h PO, CRP significantly decreased (p = 0.023, 0.040 and 0.005, respectively) in the XNK compared to the XK group. Nalbuphine-ketamine produced an acceptable induction of anesthesia and recovery compared to ketamine. Recovery with nalbuphine-ketamine was faster and better quality. The USAPS pain scores were lower in nalbuphine-ketamine, indicating that this novel combination produces better postoperative pain control than ketamine alone.

AB  - We have shown that STK35 and IFT27 genes are differentially expressed in spermatozoa from boars with good and poor semen freezability (GSF and PSF, respectively). STK35 is a stress-related gene that is implicated in spermatogenesis, whereas IFT27 is a motility-related gene that is mainly involved in intracellular protein transport. In this study we hypothesized that polymorphic variants in the 50flanking regulatory regions of STK35 and IFT27 genes could contribute to differences in semen freezability. We also predicted the interactions of the polymorphic variants with transcription factors on the gene promoter activity, using bioinformatics. The 50-flanking region sequences of the STK35 and IFT27 were PCR amplified and analyzed by Sanger sequencing method. Protein expression in STK35 and IFT27 was determined in pre-freeze (PF) and frozen-thawed (FT) spermatozoa, using western blotting analysis. Sanger sequencing revealed a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs327863835 (C > T) in STK35 promoter, while two SNPs (rs337563873, A > T; rs331520020, T > C) were detected in IFT27 promoter. STK35 and IFT27 promoter polymorphisms showed significant allele frequency differences between the GSF and PSF groups. Using bioinformatics approaches, we predicted that SNPs resulted in the generation of additional transcription factor binding sites for NFATC2, ELK1 and GR-b, which appeared to enhance or repress the promoter activity of STK35 or IFT27 in either freezability group. Wide variations in STK35 and IFT27 protein expression were observed among the boars, however, significantly higher protein expression was detected in IFT27 in FT spermatozoa of the GSF group. We suggest that the upstream variants, detected in STK35 and IFT27 promoters, might regulate the transcriptional activity of the genes by affecting their potential binding of transcription factors. The results indicate that the allelic variants in STK35 and IFT27 could be considered as potential genetic markers for predicting boar sperm freezability. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Tea plants (Camellia sinensis L.) use ammonium and nitrate as the main sources of nitrogen (N), but they respond differently to these two compounds. In this study, we investigated the effect of the ammonium:nitrate ratio on tea plant growth as well as N uptake and metabolism. A kinetics analysis showed that both ammonium and nitrate were absorbed, with no major differences within the concentration range 0.71-2.86 mM. Additionally, growth peaked when the ammonium:nitrate ratio was 25:75. The concentrations of several free amino acids, including theanine, in new leaves and roots increased as the proportion of ammonium increased. Glutamine concentrations in new leaves and roots were highest at ammonium:nitrate ratio of 25:75. Moreover, the transcription of key genes involved in theanine and glutamine biosynthesis was differentially affected by changes in N ratios, which explained the differences in metabolic changes. The glutamine:theanine ratio was higher at an ammonium:nitrate ratio of 25:75 than at 100:0 and 75:25, suggesting that the ammonium:nitrate ratio may affect the ratio of glutamine synthesis activity to theanine synthesis activity. We examined N metabolism regulatory genes and identified candidate genes, including SENSITIVE TO PROTON RHIZOTOXICITY 3.1 and NITRATE-INDUCIBLE GARP-TYPE TRANSCRIPTIONAL REPRESSOR 1.2, in tea plants. These transcription factor genes are involved in the regulation of nitrate absorption and metabolism. Identifying genes that regulate N metabolism is essential for improving N use efficiency. The study findings will be useful for optimizing N fertilization management practices to control tea growth and quality.

AB  - Cephalopina titillator had adverse effects on the camel health such as difficult breathing, reduction of milk production, fertility, and tissue damage. Therfore; this study aimed to describe of the fine ultrastructure of the adult fly and different stages of larvae using light and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The larvae collected from the slaughtered camel at Cairo slaughter-house from January to May 2019. The second and third instar larvae of C. titillator were collected from the nasal passages; sinuses and turbinates. The pseudocephalon of the third larval stage had two long curved maxillae and two antennary lobes which provided several sensory papillae. However, the last abdominal segment showed two peritremes in a deep pit surrounded with two lips that contain several large sensory papillae and small spines at the tegument surface. Many basiconic sensilla are situated on the ventral depression close to the posterior spiracular. Sensilla on insect body parts play an important role in their behavior for deposited larvae. This is the first overall observation about sensilla on the whole body of Cephalopina titillator adults and larvae, which have great significance on the behavior, identification, and evolution of the adult fly.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of dietary resveratrol (RES) and beta-Hydroxy-beta-methyl butyric acid (HMB) on immune, oxidative, and morphological changes in the livers of Tibetan sheep using transcriptomics and metabolomics. One hundred and twenty male Tibetan lambs of a similar initial weight (15.5 +/- 0.14 kg) were randomly divided into four groups with thirty lambs per treatment: (1) H group (basal diet without RES or HMB); (2) H-RES group (1.5 g/day of RES); (3) H-HMB group (1250 mg/day of HMB); (4) H-RES-HMB group (1.5 g/day of RES and 1250 mg/day of HMB). The experiment was conducted for 100 days, including a pre-test period of 10 days and a formal period of 90 days. The results showed significantly increased concentrations of glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and IgM in the H-RES-HMB group (p < 0.05), while the malondialdehyde levels were significantly decreased (p < 0.05). The glycolytic indices including creatinine kinase (CK), malate dehydrogenase (MDH), and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) were significantly increased in the H-RES-HMB group compared with the others (p < 0.05). A histological analysis showed that the hepatic plate tissue in the H-RES-HMB group appeared normal with multiple cells. The transcriptomic analysis showed that the expression of genes associated with the calcium signaling pathway (MYLK2, CYSLTR2, ADCY1, HRH1, ATP2B2, NOS2, HRC, ITPR1, and CAMK2B) and the NF-kappa B signaling pathway (BCL2 and CARD14) in the H-RES-HMB group were upregulated. The key differential metabolites (d-pyroglutamic acid, DL-serine, DL-threonine, fumarate, and glyceric acid) were enriched in the pathways associated with D-amino acid metabolism, the citrate cycle (TCA cycle), and carbon metabolism. The combined transcriptomic and non-targeted metabolomic analyses showed the co-enrichment of differential genes (NOS2 and GLUD1) and metabolites (fumarate) in arginine biosynthesis-regulated glycolytic activity, whereas the differential genes (ME1, SCD5, FABP2, RXRG, and CPT1B) and metabolites (Leukotriene b4) co-enriched in the PPAR signaling pathway affected the immune response by regulating the PI3K/AKT and cGMP/PKG signaling. In conclusion, the dietary RES and HMB affected the hepatic antioxidant capacity, immune response, and glycolytic activity through modulating the transcriptome (BCL2, CAMK2B, ITPR1, and IL1R1) and metabolome (DL-serine, DL-threonine, fumaric acid, and glycolic acid).

AB  - In 2022, a significant PRV outbreak in a southwestern China pig farm led to a high incidence of sow abortion. A serological analysis using gE antigen-based ELISA revealed a high prevalence (69.30%) of PRV gE antibodies among the affected pigs, with a significant variation across different pig populations (1.11-76.12%). We collected additional 5552 pig serum samples and 580 pig cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from various pig farms in Southwest China between 2022 and 2024. The seropositive rates for PRV gE antibodies ranged from 2.36% and 8.65% in the serum samples, while the positive detection rates for the PRV gE gene in the cerebrospinal fluid samples, as determined by PCR, were between 1.06% and 2.36%. The PCR analysis and sequencing of the PRV gB, gC, gE, and TK genes from eight randomly selected samples identified two distinct strains, CQ1 and CQ2. CQ1's gC gene showed similarity to the vaccine strain Bartha, while the other genes aligned with Chinese classical strains, suggesting its potential genetic recombination. CQ2 aligned with the Chinese classical strain SC. Although the overall PRV infection in Southwest China's pig farms is relatively low, occasional outbreaks with high positivity rates are observed. These findings highlight the necessity for increased surveillance and stringent control measures to safeguard the swine industry.

AB  - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessment of fetal blood oxygen saturation (SO2) can transform the clinical management of high-risk pregnancies affected by fetal growth restriction (FGR). Here, a novel MRI method assesses the feasibility of identifying normally grown and FGR fetuses in sheep and is then applied to humans. MRI scans are performed in pregnant ewes at 110 and 140 days (term = 150d) gestation and in pregnant women at 28(+3) +/- 2(+5) weeks to measure feto-placental SO2. Birth weight is collected and, in sheep, fetal blood SO2 is measured with a blood gas analyzer (BGA). Fetal arterial SO2 measured by BGA predicts fetal birth weight in sheep and distinguishes between fetuses that are normally grown, small for gestational age, and FGR. MRI feto-placental SO2 in late gestation is related to fetal blood SO2 measured by BGA and body weight. In sheep, MRI feto-placental SO2 in mid-gestation is related to fetal SO2 later in gestation. MRI feto-placental SO2 distinguishes between normally grown and FGR fetuses, as well as distinguishing FGR fetuses with and without normal Doppler in humans. Thus, a multi-compartment placental MRI model detects low placental SO2 and distinguishes between small hypoxemic fetuses and normally grown fetuses.

AB  - Known elicitors of plant defenses against eggs of herbivorous insects are low-molecular-weight organic compounds associated with the eggs. However, previous studies provided evidence that also proteinaceous compounds present in secretion associated with eggs of the herbivorous sawfly Diprion pini can elicit defensive responses in Pinus sylvestris. Pine responses induced by the proteinaceous secretion are known to result in enhanced emission of (E)-beta-farnesene, which attracts egg parasitoids killing the eggs. Here, we aimed to identify the defense-eliciting protein and elucidate its function. After isolating the defense-eliciting protein from D. pini egg-associated secretion by ultrafiltration and gel electrophoresis, we identified it by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry as an annexin-like protein, which we named 'diprionin'. Further GC-MS analyses showed that pine needles treated with heterologously expressed diprionin released enhanced quantities of (E)-beta-farnesene. Our bioassays confirmed attractiveness of diprionin-treated pine to egg parasitoids. Expression of several pine candidate genes involved in terpene biosynthesis and regulation of ROS homeostasis was similarly affected by diprionin and natural sawfly egg deposition. However, the two treatments had different effects on expression of pathogenesis-related genes (PR1, PR5). Diprionin is the first egg-associated proteinaceous elicitor of indirect plant defense against insect eggs described so far.

AB  - Melatonin (MEL) is involved in homeostasis of the epididymis lumen environment. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) partakes in the development of gonads and organs in male animals. However, whether MEL secretion, the expression of its receptors, MT1 and MT2, and sheep epididymal epithelial cell apoptosis is regulated by DHT remains unclear. In this study, we used immunohistochemical staining to detect the distribution patterns of DHT synthetases [5 alpha-reductase (5 alpha-red)] and its androgen receptor (AR) in sheep epididymides. 5 alpha-red1, 5 alpha-red2 and AR were positively expressed in sperm, epididymal epithelial cells, and the smooth muscle cells of the caput, corpus and cauda regions of the epididymis. DHT concentration and the expression levels of 5 alpha-red and AR in the caput, corpus and cauda regions were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis. DHT concentration in the caput was significantly higher than those in corpus and cauda, probably because of the high expression of 5 alpha-red2 in the caput and secretion and transport of DHT by the testicles. DHT inhibited MEL secretion, the expression of its membrane receptors and MEL synthetases in cultured sheep epididymal epithelial cells in vitro. In addition, the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, ACT CASP3 and caspase-3 mRNA expression were also decreased. The decreasing effect was partially reversed after flutamide treatment. Therefore, DHT regulates sheep epididymal function by influencing MEL expression and apoptosis-related factors. This study provides basic data for further research on the reproductive physiology of male animals.

At present, scant information exists on the long-range migration of the polyphagous armyworm, Spodoptera exigua and its underlying climatic determinants (i.e. East Asian or South Asian monsoon circulation). In this study, we employed a population genetics approach to delineate S. exigua migration patterns across multiple Asian countries. RESULTS Using mitochondrial cytochrome I (COI) and microsatellite markers, low-to-moderate levels of genetic diversity were detected among 101 S. exigua populations collected across China, Pakistan and Vietnam. Haplotype diversity and nucleotide diversity did not differ between years. Two spatially explicit genetic clusters were detected, an eastern and a western clade, with the former comprising populations in the East Asia monsoon area. No genetic differentiation was recorded among armyworm populations in the year-round breeding area, nor among those of the overwintering and nonoverwintering areas. Five of the most widespread mitochondrial haplotypes reflected the extensive gene flow across at a large spatial scale. CONCLUSION Low-to-moderate levels of genetic diversity were observed, and evidence was found for genetic clustering in certain geographical areas. Accordingly, our unique insights into S. exigua population genetics and spatiotemporal migration dynamics help to guide applied ecological studies, ecological intensification schemes or (area-wide) pest management campaigns in China and abroad.

AB  - Using spatial cell-type-enriched transcriptomics, we compare plaque-induced gene (PIG) expression in mi-croglia-touching plaques, neighboring plaques, and far from plaques in an aged Alzheimer's mouse model with late plaque development. In 18-month-old APPNL-F/NL-F knockin mice, with and without the Alzheimer's disease risk mutation Trem2R47H/R47H, we report that expression of 38/55 PIGs have plaque-induced micro-glial upregulation, with a subset only upregulating in microglia directly contacting plaques. For seven PIGs, including Trem2, this upregulation is prevented in APPNL-F/NL-FTrem2R47H/R47H mice. These TREM2-depen-dent genes are all involved in phagocytic and degradative processes that we show correspond to a decrease in phagocytic markers and an increase in the density of small plaques in Trem2-mutated mice. Furthermore, despite the R47H mutation preventing increased Trem2 gene expression, TREM2 protein levels and micro-glial density are still marginally increased on plaques. Hence, both microglial contact with plaques and func-tioning TREM2 are necessary for microglia to respond appropriately to amyloid pathology.

TI  - An Application of Spatio-Temporal Modeling to Finite Population Abundance Prediction

AB  - Spatio-temporal models can be used to analyze data collected at various spatial locations throughout multiple time points. However, even with a finite number of spatial locations, there may be insufficient resources to collect data from every spatial location at every time point. We develop a spatio-temporal finite-population block kriging (ST-FPBK) method to predict a quantity of interest, such as a mean or total, across a finite number of spatial locations. This ST-FPBK predictor incorporates an appropriate variance reduction for sampling from a finite population. Through an application to moose surveys in the east-central region of Alaska, we show that the predictor has a substantially smaller standard error compared to a predictor from the purely spatial model that is currently used to analyze moose surveys in the region. We also show how the model can be used to forecast a prediction for abundance in a time point for which spatial locations have not yet been surveyed. A separate simulation study shows that the spatio-temporal predictor is unbiased and that prediction intervals from the ST-FPBK predictor attain appropriate coverage. For ecological monitoring surveys completed with some regularity through time, use of ST-FPBK could improve precision. We also give an R package that ecologists and resource managers could use to incorporate data from past surveys in predicting a quantity from a current survey. Supplementary materials accompanying this paper appear on-line.

AB  - Feeding HC diets has been found to induce metabolic dysregulation in the colon. However, the mechanisms by which changes in colonic flora and metabolites damage the colonic epithelium are poorly studied. Therefore, the present experiment used a multi-omics technique to investigate the mechanism of colonic injury induced by high-concentrate diets in lambs. Twelve male Dumont lambs were randomly split into two groups: a low-concentrate diet (LC = concentrate/forage = 30:70) group and a high-concentrate diet (HC = concentrate/forage = 70:30) group. The results showed that the HC group presented significantly increased lipopolysaccharide (LPS) concentrations in the colonic epithelium and significantly decreased serum total cholesterol (TC), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) levels (p < 0.05), which led to cavities and inflammatory cell infiltration in the colonic epithelium. The HC group had significantly lower pH and less VFAs in colon contents, as well as a significantly increased abundance of bacteria of the genera [Eubacterium]_coprostanoligenes_group, Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group, Treponema, Clostridia_UCG-014, Alistipes, Ruminococcus, Christensenellaceae_R-7_group, UCG-002, Bacteroidales_RF16_group and Lachnospiraceae_AC2044_group compared to the LC diet group. These microorganisms significantly increased the level of metabolites of cholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acid, LysoPA (P-16:0/0:0), methapyrilene, and fusaric acid. A transcriptome analysis showed that cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, glutathione metabolism, and the peroxisome signaling pathway were downregulated in the colon epithelium of the lambs fed the HC diet. Therefore, the HC diet caused epithelial inflammation and oxidative damage by affecting the interaction between the microbial flora of the colon and metabolites and the host epithelium, which eventually disrupted colon homeostasis and had a negative impact on sheep health.

AB  - Background Currently, increasing attention is being paid to the important role of intestinal microbiome in diabetes. However, few studies have evaluated the characteristics of gut microbiome in diabetic miniature pigs, despite it being a good model animal for assessing diabetes. Methods In this study, a mini-pig diabetes model (DM) was established by 9-month high-fat diet (HFD) combined with low-dose streptozotocin, while the animals fed standard chow diet constituted the control group. 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing was performed to assess the characteristics of the intestinal microbiome in diabetic mini-pigs. Results The results showed that microbial structure in diabetic mini-pigs was altered, reflected by increases in levels of Coprococcus_3 and Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1, which were positively correlated with diabetes, and decreases in levels of the bacteria Rikenellaceae, Clostridiales_vadinBB60_group, and Bacteroidales_RF16_group, which were inversely correlated with blood glucose and insulin resistance. Moreover, PICRUSt-predicted pathways related to the glycolysis and Entner-Doudoroff superpathway, enterobactin biosynthesis, and the l-tryptophan biosynthesis were significantly elevated in the DM group. Conclusion These results reveal the composition and predictive functions of the intestinal microbiome in the mini-pig diabetes model, further verifying the relationship between HFD, gut microbiome, and diabetes, and providing novel insights into the application of the mini-pig diabetes model in gut microbiome research.

AB  - The alteration of landscape by anthropogenic activity has reduced the foraging habitats of insectivorous bats. Thus it is important to understand the habitat selections of insectivorous bats and patterns of prey availability, especially in human-altered environments. We investigated bat activity in five classified habitats, namely: old-growth forest, remnant forest, citrus orchard, cornfield and paddy field in the forest-dominated Himalayan country of Bhutan. We monitored bat activity acoustically across 120 sites from May to November 2018. Thirteen different taxa and one unknown QCF bat were identified from 2,558 bat passes. Overall bat activity was dominated by open-space foragers such as Scotophilus kuhlii, Taphozous sp., Otomops wroughtoni and Nyctalus leisleri, showing comparative variations in habitat selection. But, Rhinolophus specifically, R. luctus was rarely present in open habitats such as cornfield and paddy fields, and was found to be one of the most abundant species in cluttered habitats, e.g., old-growth forest and remnant forest. Bat activity was higher in old-growth forest compared to paddy and remnant forest, but was not significantly different from cornfield and citrus orchard. Insect biomass positively correlated with bat activity. Our findings suggest that the habitat selection of insectivorous bats is influenced by prey abundance and habitat types. Although remnant forest was poorly associated with insect prey, the species richness of bats found there was almost equal to that of old-growth forest. Thus, remnant forest was found to be an important habitat, apparently serving as a corridor for the narrow-space foragers in the study landscape in Bhutan.

AB  - Herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) are well known for their roles in herbivore deterrence and attraction of natural enemies, but their direct impact on insect reproduction remains largely unexplored. In this study, we provide novel evidence that two representative HIPVs, 2-heptanol and alpha-cedrene, exert opposing effects on the reproduction of Chilo suppressalis, a major rice pest. While both volatiles repelled adults, alpha-cedrene unexpectedly enhanced oviposition, whereas 2-heptanol significantly suppressed egg laying. To examine these effects, we conducted oviposition assays, preoviposition and longevity tests, combined with qPCR and transcriptome analyses to explore underlying molecular responses. Mechanistically, alpha-cedrene upregulated Kr-h1, a gene linked to juvenile hormone signaling and vitellogenesis, promoting reproductive investment. Transcriptomic profiling revealed divergent molecular responses: alpha-cedrene activated reproductive pathways, whereas 2-heptanol induced stress- and immune-related genes, suggesting a trade-off between stress defense and reproduction. These findings demonstrate that HIPVs can exert compound-specific reproductive effects beyond repellency. This work fills a key knowledge gap and highlights the potential of HIPVs as precision tools in pest management strategies that exploit behavioral and physiological vulnerabilities beyond repellency.

AB  - Methane production from anaerobic digestion of chicken manure requires addressing the challenges posed by high nitrogen-containing substrates. One potential solution is the use of modified biochar to adsorb inhibitors and enhance the anaerobic digestion process. This study focused on preparing magnesium-modified biochar (Mg-BC), iron-modified biochar (Fe-BC), and magnesium-iron modified biochar (Mg/Fe-BC) through specific methods, and comparing their performance in simulated solutions for ammonia nitrogen adsorption. The results indicated that Mg/Fe-BC exhibited superior specific surface area, crystallinity, and functional groups compared to Mg-BC and Fe-BC. Its maximum adsorption capacity (87.83 mg/g) surpassed that of Mg-BC (26.77 mg/g) and Fe-BC (14.57 mg/g). Furthermore, the addition of 2%, 3%, and 5% Mg/Fe-BC to the biogas slurry resulted in NH4+-N removal efficiency of 16.38%, 32.85%, and 38.57%, respectively. In the anaerobic digestion test using chicken manure, adding 2%, 3%, and 5% Mg/Fe-BC effectively mitigated ammonia inhibition, leading to a substantial increase in cumulative methane production by 116%, 196%, and 229%, respectively. The addition also decreased the oxidation reduction potential, promoted the decomposition of volatile fatty acids and COD, and kept ammonia nitrogen within a final concentration range of 2.67-3.63 g/L, which helped maintain the stable operation of the system. Mg/Fe-BC facilitated the enrichment of acetogenic bacteria and enhanced the abundance of predominant archaea, including Methanosarcina and Methanosaeta. These findings provided valuable insights into the ammonia nitrogen adsorption characteristics of Mg/Fe-BC and its effectiveness in enhancing methane production from chicken manure anaerobic digestion.

AB  - Simple Summary Peste des petits ruminants (PPR) is a highly contagious animal disease affecting small ruminants that causes high morbidity and mortality. To prevent outbreaks, Karnataka state, India, has implemented the PPR-Control programme (PPR-CP) with a 'mass vaccination' strategy since 2010-11, resulting in a significant reduction in the number of outbreaks. However, the state continues to report outbreaks every year due to various reasons. Presently, the state is planning to eradicate the disease by 2025-26 by employing a new mass vaccination programme in coordination with the government of India's PPR eradication plan. In this study, we report on the current status of PPR, its economic cost, the financial viability of vaccination plans, and the perspectives of field veterinarians in controlling and eventually eradicating the disease in Karnataka state. The disease incidence in the state declined significantly due to the implementation of mass vaccination and the benefits of vaccination outweighed the cost many-fold. The majority of the veterinarians concurred with the various activities of PPR-CP but a few indicated disagreement with the plan per se, the coordination between the functionaries, the available funding and the acceptance of the programme by farmers. In this study, we assessed the PPR disease status, its economic cost, the financial viability of vaccination, and the perspectives of field veterinarians on the PPR vaccination programme implemented in Karnataka state, India. In addition to secondary data, cross-sectional surveys undertaken during 2016-17 (survey I) and 2018-19 (survey II) from 673 sheep and goat flocks and data collected from 62 veterinarians were analysed. The economic costs and perceptions of veterinarians were analysed using deterministic models and the Likert scale, respectively, and the financial viability of vaccination programmes under the best (15%), base (20%), and worst-case (25%) PPR incidence scenarios, considering two different vaccination plans (plan I and plan II), was assessed. The disease incidence in sheep and goats was found to be 9.8% and 4.8% in survey I and survey II, respectively. In consonance with the increased vaccination coverage, the number of reported PPR outbreaks in the state declined significantly. The estimated farm-level loss of PPR varied between the surveyed years. Even under the best-incidence scenario, under vaccination plan-I and plan-II, the estimated benefit-cost ratio (18.4:1; 19.7:1), the net present value (USD 932 million; USD 936 million) and the internal rate of return (412%) implied that the vaccination programmes were financially viable and the benefits outweighed the cost. Though the majority of veterinarians perceived that the control programme was well planned and rolled out in the state, a few of them disagreed or were neutral towards the plan per se, towards the coordination between functionaries, the availability of funding, and the programme acceptance by farmers. Despite many years of vaccination, PPR still persists in the Karnataka state for various reasons and in order to eradicate the disease, a review of the existing control programme with strong facilitation from the federal government is needed.

AB  - Incorrect use of neonicotinoid pesticides poses a serious threat to human and pollinator health, as these substances are commonly present in bee products and even drinking water. To combat this threat, the study developed a new method of degrading the pesticide imidacloprid using surface discharge cold plasma oxidation technology. The study showed that this method achieved a very high efficiency of imidacloprid degradation of 91.4%. The main reactive oxygen species (H2O2, O3, & sdot;OH, O2- , 1O2) effectively participated in the decomposition reaction of imidacloprid. Reactive oxygen species were more sensitive to the structure of the nitroimine group. Density functional theory (DFT) further explored the sites of reactive oxygen species attack on imidacloprid and revealed the process of energy change of attacking imidacloprid. In addition, a degradation pathway for imidacloprid was proposed, mainly involving reactive oxygen species chemisorption, a ring-opening intermediate, and complete cleavage of the nitroimine group structure. Model predictions indicated that acute oral and developmental toxicity were significantly reduced after cold plasma treatment, as confirmed by insect experiments. Animal experiments have shown that plasma treatment reduces imidacloprid damage to mice hippocampal tissue structure and inhibits the reduction of brain-derived neurotrophic factor content, thus revealing the detoxification mechanism of the body.

AB  - First-phase diets are formulated to help pigs reach a target body weight before switching to a more affordable diet. However, these transitions typically take place on a fixed schedule, which may disadvantage low-body-weight piglets due to their underdeveloped digestive systems and limited feed intake capacity. This study examined the effects of offering low-body-weight (BW) pigs a pre-starter diet until they reached a target BW on growth performance and BW variability. A total of 528 pigs ([Landrace x Yorkshire] x Pietrain), weaned at day 21, representing the smallest 50% of their batch, were divided into medium (5.35 +/- 0.31 kg) and small (3.97 +/- 0.21 kg) groups based on weaning BW. Pigs received a pre-starter diet either for 10 days (FIXED) or until they reached a target BW of 7.9 kg (TBW), followed by a starter feed. Growth performance between the TBW and fixed strategies was similar over the 36-day period. Overall, mortality was higher in small pigs, though small pigs fed using the fixed strategy showed higher mortality than the rest of the groups between days 10 and 36. This study concludes that offering a pre-starter diet based on target BW, instead of a fixed time, did not significantly improve growth performance or batch uniformity but reduced mortality in small pigs from days 10 to 36.

AB  - The use of analgesia in bacterial challenge models has been met with some controversy in the literature. Several publications suggest that the use of analgesics in infection models can interfere with the host immune response, change microenvironments subsequently altering bacterial pathogenesis, and directly act as an antimicrobial as was reported with opioids such as morphine. Any such interactions would compromise the experimental results, deterring researchers from the use of analgesia. Herein, we address the possible effect of analgesics on bacterial colonization in a Staphylococcus aureus surgical site infection model in G & ouml;ttingen minipigs. Retrospectively, an expanded analgesia protocol (buprenorphine presurgery and carprofen postsurgery) was compared with a standard analgesia protocol using buprenorphine alone just before surgery. When examined statistically, the expanded analgesia protocol group was noninferior to the standard analgesia protocol group indicating there was no substantial decrease in bacterial burden when an expanded analgesia protocol was administered. Our results highlight the importance of studying the use of analgesia in all animal models of infection to determine if the analgesics will affect experimental outcomes.

AB  - The conjunctions of the cornea and sclera in the eyes of donkeys, cattle, dogs, sheep, pigs and rabbits, regardless of gender, were examined in this study. No animals were specifically sacrificed for this investigation. Scanning electron microscopy, light microscopy, and dissecting microscopy were used in this research. In the limbus of all the animals investigated, the cornea and sclera fused in accordance with a pattern. At the corneo-scleral junction, the sclera was situated anteriorly and the cornea posteriorly in the dorsal and ventral sections of the bulbus oculi. In the medial and lateral parts of the eyeball, the cornea and sclera were facing each other and interlaced. Pigmentation and the sulcus scleralis externus could be used to identify the macro-and micro-anatomical boundaries of the limbus. In addition, the cytoplasm of basal epithelial cells shrank, signaling the end of the corneal epithelium and the start of the conjunctival epithelium. The presence of Bowman's membrane in cattle and sheep eyes was definitely determined in histological examinations. Bowman's membrane in these animals came to an end at the limbus, which is where the conjunctival epithelium starts and the corneal epithelium ends. In all areas of the cornea, Bowman's membrane revealed irregular, abrupt thickening and thinning. The corneal epithelium was thick in the vertex and thinner towards the limbus, whereas Descemet's membrane was thin in the center (vertex) and thick in the periphery (near the limbus). In this study, pictures and diagrams were used to illustrate the general anatomical, histological, and morphometric characteristics of the limbus in the species under investigation. The data from our study showed that the limbus region of the bulbus oculi was narrow in the lateral and medial parts and wide in the dorsal and ventral parts. This was confirmed in the studied animals as a general rule. The width value will undoubtedly affect the number of cells covered by the regions. It is conceivable that these cells will play a significant role in the decision of where to perform surgical procedures in order to promote wound healing, giving doctors an advantage. In this circumstances, we think that the limbus should be studied in terms of clinical methods because it has different shapes depending on the species and the position of the bulbus.

AB  - Dark pigmentation can be observed in various parts of the plant, ranging from foliage to petals and berries. Here, we review the available knowledge about dark pigmentation in plants and the potential for biotechnological applications. The molecular basis of black pigmentation appears to vary among species, with anthocyanins playing a significant role, although specific anthocyanin types and their mechanisms differ. These findings suggest that the development of phenotypes is species-specific or varies between larger taxonomic groups; this is further supported by the polyphyletic nature of dark pigmentation. Additionally, several different regulatory mechanisms have been described for the occurrence of dark pigmentation. First, the repression or knockout of the competing flavone biosynthesis has been shown to lead to darker pigmentation while another mechanism is based on the activation and upregulation of the anthocyanin biosynthesis genes in the presence of MYB transcription factors. Potential ecological functions of dark pigmentation were identified as protection of the photosynthesis apparatus, camouflage against herbivores, and the attraction of pollinators. Promising industrial applications include microbial factories for the production of natural food colourants, induction of novel phenotypes for the ornamental plant industry and, lastly, increase of anthocyanins within agriculturally relevant crops. Understanding the genetic basis of dark pigment accumulation would facilitate biotechnological and agricultural applications.

AB  - This study aimed to assess population and reproductive aspects of the ampithoid amphipod Cymadusa filosa Savigny, 1816 in a region with pollution by petrogenic hydrocarbons. Sampling of Sargassum furcatum K & uuml;tzing, 1843 fronds and the associated fauna was conducted in March, September and December 2007 and February 2008, on four rocky shores located on S & acirc;o Sebasti & acirc;o Island, southeastern Brazil. A total of 1372 specimens of C. filosa were recorded, including 934 juveniles, 274 females (60 ovigerous) and 164 males. Population mean density ranged from 1.27 to 6.40 ind/g with higher mean values in March 2007 and lower in December 2007 and February 2008. The total body length of males varied from 4.11 to 20.75 mm and of females from 3.58 to 20.22 mm. No significant difference was detected between male and female body length. The overall sex ratio significantly differed from 1:1 proportion and was skewed toward females (0.60:1). Ovigerous females occurred in higher proportion in February 2008 and presented mean fecundity of 26.01 +/- 1.84 eggs/female (mean +/- se), with great variation in the number of eggs found in the marsupium (between 1 and 56). Fecundity increased significantly with increasing female body length. The C. filosa population structure and reproduction were similar to those of populations in other locations, in Brazil and abroad indicating that pollution by petrogenic hydrocarbons in the S & acirc;o Sebasti & acirc;o Channel did not affect the population parameters of C. filosa in this region.

AB  - Osteoporosis is a common metabolic disorder diagnosed by lower bone density and higher risk of fracture. Fragility fractures because of osteoporosis are associated with high mortality rate. Deep understanding of fracture healing in osteoporosis is important for successful treatment. Therefore, the FDA approved the use of small and large animal models for preclinical testing. This study investigated the clinical relevance of a fracture defect model in the iliac crest of the osteoporotic sheep model and its several advantages over other models. The osteoporosis was achieved using ovariectomy (OVX) in combination with diet deficiency (OVXD) and steroid administration (OVXDS). Fluorochrome was injected to examine the rate of bone remodelling and bone mineralization. The defect areas were collected and embedded in paraffin and polymethyl metha acrylate (PMMA) for histological staining. OVXDS showed significantly lower bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC) at all time points. Furthermore, variations in healing patterns were noticed, while the control, OVX and OVXD showed complete healing after 8 months. Bone quality was affected mostly in the OVXDS group showing irregular trabecular network, lower cortical bone thickness and higher cartilaginous tissue at 8 months. The mineral deposition rate showed a declining pattern in the control, OVX, and OVXD from 5 months to 8 months. One the contrary, the OVXDS group showed an incremental pattern from 5 months to 8 months. The defect zone in osteoporotic animals showed impaired healing and the control showed complete healing after 8 months. This unique established model serves as a dual-purpose model and has several advantages: no intraoperative and postoperative complications, no need for fixation methods for biomaterial testing, and reduction in animal numbers, which comply with 3R principles by using the same animal at two different time points.

AB  - Elephant-shrews (Macroscelidea) have long been considered the only mammalian order to be completely monogamous, based on observations of their pair-living social organization. We reviewed primary studies on the four components of social systems (social organization, mating system, social structure, and care system) in elephant-shrews to evaluate whether they truly are monogamous. To identify gaps in our knowledge of their social system, we reviewed evidence for a pair-living social organization, mate fidelity (mating system), pair bonds (social structure), and biparental care (care system). Field data were available for eight species and seven were often pair-living. However, these seven species exhibited intra-specific variation in social organization; two of these species were also solitary living, two species were also group-living, and the remaining three species were both solitary and group-living. The eighth species was exclusively solitary. We reconstructed the ancestral social organization of Macroscelidea using Bayesian phylogenetic mixed-effects models and found that variable social organization, rather than exclusive pair-living, was the most likely ancestral state, though there was high uncertainty. No socio-ecological factors (body size, population density, and habitat) predicted a specific social organization. Observations of mating have been rare, such that no firm statements can be made. However, one unpublished study indicated high levels of extra-pair paternity. Regarding social structure, there was no evidence of pair-bonding, but there was evidence of mate guarding. Only maternal care has been observed, with females having very short nursing bouts. Evidence suggests that despite having often a pair-living form of social organization, Macroscelidea should not be described as a monogamous order, as little or no evidence supports that designation, nor are they exclusively pair-living (social organization) and we urge further field studies on Macroscelidea social systems.

AB  - Placental samples for RNA extraction are collected via non-recovery (euthanasia) or invasive (surgery) methods in small ruminants, such as sheep. Alternatively, delivered placentas could be used, but the feasibility of obtaining high-quality RNA from this tissue is unknown in sheep. We aimed to evaluate the possibility of extracting RNA from naturally delivered ovine placenta, comparing two preservation methods. Twenty-seven single-pregnant sheep were monitored 24/7 from gestational day 140 to parturition. Tissue was collected after placental delivery, preserved using snap frozen (SF, n = 27) and RNAlater (R) (LTR, n = 27) techniques, and processed for RNA extraction using a commercial kit. RNA concentration (ng/mu L), A260/280, and RNA quality number (RQN) were measured. Concentration was higher (p < 0.001) in LTR (70.39 +/- 6.3) than in SF (49.77 +/- 10.5), A260/280 was higher (p = 0.045) in SF (2.06 +/- 0.01) than in LTR (2.03 +/- 0.01), and RQN was higher (p < 0.0001) in SF (6.81 +/- 0.24) than in LTR (2.84 +/- 0.24) samples. Timing of placental delivery did not affect the evaluated indicators. Results indicate that extracting high-quality RNA from delivered placentas preserved via the snap-frozen technique is possible, supporting a method that aligns with the refinement principle of animals used in research.

AB  - In many terrestrial species, there is a relationship between the acoustic features of vocal signals and the underlying motivational state and arousal level of the signaller. This information may be particularly important during complex social interactions, which are common in species where males compete for access to females during the breeding season. However, research into how information on motivation and arousal is used in marine mammals during these interactions is limited. Here, we examined changes in the calling behaviour of humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) female-calf groups with the addition of escorts to investigate if and how potential information on motivation and arousal is encoded within their non-song vocal signals. Female-calf pairs had low overall call rates and used primarily single calls. However, the addition of one or more escorts to the group resulted in a significant increase in individual call rates, the use of long bouts of calls, and a more variable vocal repertoire. These results indicate that humpback whales convey both motivation and arousal by modifying various features of call production, as well as using specific call types, which contributes to our growing understanding of their complex communication system.

AB  - Simple Summary Camellia oleifera is an important woody grain and oil plant worldwide. However, owing to a significant decline in the number of wild pollinators globally and the associated reduction in pollination services and seed production, camellia oil is in short supply. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the pollination mechanisms and efficiency of wild pollinators in C. oleifera seed production. We explored the pollination system of C. oleifera, focusing on the flower-visiting characteristics of its candidate pollinators. We found that Apis mellifera is the best candidate pollinator, but flies and hoverflies also play important roles in the pollination system. Camellia oleifera Abel. is an important woody oil plant, and its pollination success is essential for oil production. We conducted this study to select the best pollinator candidates for C. oleifera using principal component analysis and multi-attribute decision-making. Field observations of the flower-visiting characteristics of candidate pollinators were conducted at three sites. The insect species that visited flowers did not considerably differ between regions or time periods. However, the proportion of each species recorded did vary. We recorded eleven main candidates from two orders and six families at the three sites. The pollen amount carried by Apis mellifera was significantly higher than that of other insects. However, the visit frequency and body length of Apis mellifera were smaller than those of Vespa velutina. Statistical analysis showed that A. mellifera is the best candidate pollinator; Eristalis cerealis is a good candidate pollinator; Phytomia zonata, A. cerana, and V. velutina were ordinary candidate pollinators; and four fly species, Episyrphus balteatus, and Eristalinus arvorum were classified as inefficient candidate pollinators. Our study shows that flies and hoverflies play an important role in the pollination system. Given the global decline in bee populations, the role of flies should also be considered in C. oleifera seed production.

AB  - Leaf spots are the most damaging and common foliar diseases of tea and are caused by several species of fungi. During 2018 to 2020, leaf spot diseases showing different symptoms (large and small spots) were observed in commercial tea plantations in Guizhou and Sichuan provinces of China. The pathogen causing the two different sized leaf spots was identified as the same species (Didymella segeticola) based on morphological characteristics, pathogenicity, and multilocus phylogenetic analysis using the combined ITS, TUB, LSU, and RPB2 gene regions. Microbial diversity analysis of lesion tissues from small spots on naturally infected tea leaves further confirmed Didymella to be present as the main pathogen. Results of sensory evaluation and quality-related metabolite analysis of tea shoots infected with the small leaf spot symptom indicated that D. segeticola negatively affected the quality and flavor of tea by changing the composition and content of caffeine, catechins, and amino acids. In addition, the significantly reduced amino acid derivatives in tea are confirmed to be positively associated with the enhanced bitter taste. The results improve our understanding of the pathogenicity of Didymella species and the influence of Didymella on the host plant, Camellia sinensis.

AB  - While transportation emissions have declined over the past several decades, volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from solvent use applications have increased as urban areas expand. In this work, the Canadian air quality model (GEM-MACH-TEB) is used to assess the importance of solvent emissions during the Michigan Ontario Ozone Source Experiment (MOOSE). Model predictions are compared to ozone and total mono-substituted aromatics (TOLU) observations collected in Windsor, Ontario. For summer 2018, model estimates of TOLU from solvent emissions are smaller (30% for an 8 h daytime average) in Windsor than estimates from positive matrix factorization (44% for a 24 h average). The use of updated U.S. solvent emissions from the EPA's VCPy (Volatile Chemical Product framework) for summer 2021 simulations increases the solvent use source contribution over Detroit/Windsor (30-50% for an 8 h daytime average). This also provides a more uniform spatial distribution across the U.S./Canada border (30-50% for an 8 h daytime average). Long-chain alkanes are the dominant speciation in the model's air pollutant emission inventory and in the observation-derived solvent use factor. Summertime 8 h daytime ozone decreased by 0.4% over Windsor for a 10% solvent use VOC emission reduction scenario. A 10% mobile NOx emission reduction scenario resulted in a 0.6% O-3 decrease over Windsor and more widespread changes over the study region.

AB  - Social nonhuman animals are powerful models for studying underlying factors related to lifelong health outcomes following early life adversities (ELAs). ELAs can be linked to lifelong health outcomes depending on the species, system, sensitive developmental periods, and biological pathways. This review focuses on the literature surrounding ELAs and lifelong health outcomes in large, social, relatively long-lived nonhuman mammals including nonhuman primates, canids, hyenas, elephants, ungulates, and cetaceans. These mammals, like humans but unlike the most-studied rodent models, have longer life histories, complex social structures, larger brains, and comparable stress and reproductive physiology. Collectively, these features make them compelling models for comparative aging research. We review studies of caregiver, social, and ecological ELAs, often in tandem, in these mammals. We consider experimental and observational studies and what each has contributed to our knowledge of health across the lifespan. We demonstrate the continued and expanded need for comparative research to inform about the social determinants of health and aging in both humans and nonhuman animals.

AB  - Pine Island Glacier (PIG) has recently experienced increased ice loss that has mostly been attributed to basal melt and ocean ice dynamics. However, atmospheric forcing also plays a role in the ice mass budget, as besides lowerlatitude warm air intrusions, the steeply sloping terrain that surrounds the glacier promotes frequent Foehn winds. An investigation of 41 years of reanalysis data reveals that Foehn occurs more frequently from June to October, with Foehn episodes typically lasting about 5 to 9 h. An analysis of the surface mass balance indicated that their largest impact is on the surface sublimation, which is increased by about 1.43mm water equivalent (w.e.) per day with respect to noFoehn events. Blowing snow makes roughly the same contribution as snowfall, around 0.34-0.36mmw.e. d 1, but with the opposite sign. The melting rate is 3 orders of magnitude smaller than the surface sublimation rate. The negative phase of the Antarctic oscillation and the positive phase of the Southern Annular Mode promote the occurrence of Foehn at PIG. A particularly strong event took place on 9-11 November 2011, when 10m winds speeds in excess of 20ms(- 1) led to downward sensible heat fluxes higher than 75Wm(-2) as they descended the mountainous terrain. Surface sublimation and blowing-snow sublimation dominated the surface mass balance, with magnitudes of up to 0.13mmw.e. h (-1). Satellite data indicated an hourly surface melting area exceeding 100 km(2). Our results stress the importance of the atmospheric forcing on the ice mass balance at PIG.

AB  - Agricultural productivity relies on plant resistance to insect pests, with silicon (Si) being increasingly recognized as an important anti-herbivore defense. However, the processes by which Si works to counteract the effects of insect injury are not completely understood. The role of Si in mitigating the adverse effects of herbivory has been mostly studied at the species level in various crops, ignoring the sensitivity and variability at the genotypic level. Understanding such variation across genotypes is important because Si-derived benefits are associated with the amount of Si accumulated in the plant. Therefore, the present investigation was pursued to study the effect of different Si concentrations (0, 125, and 250 mg L-1) on Si accumulation and plant growth using two wheat genotypes (WW-101 and SW-2) under grasshopper herbivory for 48 h. The higher Si absorption increased the concentration of leaf chlorophyll, carotenoids, soluble sugars, and proteins. Silicon application at higher con-centrations increased the dry weight, antioxidant enzyme activity, total phenolics, flavonoids and shoot Si concentration, whereas it decreased the electrolyte leakage, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and malonaldehyde (MDA) levels, thereby preventing leaf damage. We infer that the higher Si concentration alleviates the adverse effects of herbivory in wheat by improving the accumulation of secondary metabolites and enhancing the antioxidant defense system. The effects were pronounced in the genotype 'WW-101' compared to 'SW-2' for most of the studied traits, indicating overall stress response to be genotype-dependent. Thus, Si acquisition efficiency of genotypes should be considered while developing efficient crop management strategies.

AB  - Miracle fruit (Synsepalum dulcificum) is a rare valuable tropical plant famous for a miraculous sweetening glycoprotein, miraculin, which can modify sour flavors to sweet flavors tasted by humans. Here, we present a chromosome-level high-quality genome of S. dulcificum with an assembly genome size of similar to 550 Mb, contig N50 of similar to 14.14 Mb, and 37,911 annotated protein-coding genes. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that S. dulcificum was most closely related to Camellia sinensis and Diospyros oleifera, and that S. dulcificum diverged from the Diospyros genus similar to 75.8 million years ago (MYA), and that C. sinensis diverged from Synsepalum similar to 63.5 MYA. Ks assessment and collinearity analysis with S. dulcificum and other species suggested that a whole-genome duplication (WGD) event occurred in S. dulcificum and that there was good collinearity between S. dulcificum and Vitis vinifera. On the other hand, transcriptome and metabolism analysis with six tissues containing three developmental stages of fleshes and seeds of miracle fruit revealed that Gene Ontology (GO) terms and metabolic pathways of "cellular response to chitin," "plant-pathogen interaction," and "plant hormone signal transduction" were significantly enriched during fruit development. Interestingly, the expression of miraculin (Chr10G0299340) progressively increased from vegetative organs to reproductive organs and reached an incredible level in mature fruit flesh, with an fragments per kilobase of transcript per million (FPKM) value of similar to 113,515, which was the most highly expressed gene among all detected genes. Combining the unique signal peptide and the presence of the histidine-30 residue together composed the main potential factors impacting miraculin's unique properties in S. dulcificum. Furthermore, integrated analysis of weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA), enrichment and metabolite correlation suggested that miraculin plays potential roles in regulating plant growth, seed germination and maturation, resisting pathogen infection, and environmental pressure. In summary, valuable genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolic resources provided in this study will promote the utilization of S. dulcificum and in-depth research on species in the Sapotaceae family.

AB  - Lack of CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) affects the transcriptome, composition, and function of large and small airway epithelia in people with advanced cystic fibrosis (CF); however, whether lack of CFTR causes cell-intrinsic abnormalities present at birth versus inflammation-dependent abnormalities is unclear. We performed a single-cell RNA-sequencing census of microdissected small airways from newborn CF pigs, which recapitulate CF host defense defects and pathology over time. Lack of CFTR minimally affected the transcriptome of large and small airways at birth, suggesting that infection and inflammation drive transcriptomic abnormalities in advanced CF. Importantly, common small airway epithelial cell types expressed a markedly different transcriptome than corresponding large airway cell types. Quantitative immunohistochemistry and electrophysiology of small airway epithelia demonstrated basal cells that reach the apical surface and a water and ion transport advantage. This single cell atlas highlights the archetypal nature of airway epithelial cells with location-dependent gene expression and function.

AB  - Suppressed wool prices in Ireland over the last number of years has led to situations where the cost of shearing animals is greater than the wools' value, leading to net losses per animal for farmers. Populations of sheep in Ireland and nutrient values of wool from literature sources were used to determine the quantity of nutrients that could be produced on an annual basis using hydrolysis techniques. Results of this study suggest that up to 15.8% of the nitrogen required to produce Ireland's cereal crops can be met annually using hydrolysed sheep wool in an economically feasible manner along with considerable amounts of sulphur, zinc, and copper. Most of the cost associated with the process is the purchasing of wool from farmers at an economically favourable level for farmers. Based on the spatial distribution of these animals, the town of Athlone is the most suitable location for a processing facility.

AB  - Simple Summary Our study showed that extrusion improves nutritive value, apparent total tract digestibility of nutrients and ileal digestibility of most amino acids in full-fat rice bran and corn distillers dried grain with solubles, which suggests that extrusion could be an effective strategy to improve nutritive values of feed by-products. The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of extrusion on available energy, apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of nutrients and energy, and amino acid (AA) digestibility of full-fat rice bran (FFRB) and corn distillers dried grain with solubles (DDGS) fed to growing pigs. Methods: In Exp. 1, a total of 30 growing pigs with initial body weight (BW) of 36.0 +/- 1.8 kg were fed five different diets, including one corn basal diet and four experimental diets which were formulated by 29.06% FFRB or DDGS with or without extrusion processing. In Exp. 2, 30 ileal-cannulated pigs (initial BW: 20.3 +/- 1.8 kg) were fed five different diets including 40% FFRB or DDGS with or without extrusion, and a N-free diet. Results: The results showed that there were no significant differences in DE and ME contents or ATTD of GE, DM, and OM between DDGS and FFRB (p > 0.05), but the ATTD of CP, NDF, and ADF showed significant differences between DDGS and FFRB (p < 0.05). In addition, the DE and ME values (p < 0.01) and ATTD of GE, DM, OM, and NDF improved when pigs were fed extruded diets (p < 0.05), and a trend to increase the ATTD of CP and ADF was observed when pigs were fed extruded diets (p = 0.06 and 0.07, respectively). The AID and SID levels of CP were not different when pigs were fed diets with or without extrusion. The AID of total indispensable AA increased when pigs were fed extrusion diets (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Feed processing of extrusion could improve nutritive values of FFRB and DDGS.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disorder leading to dementia and cognitive deficits, is influenced by various risk factors. Precise prognoses of AD are crucial to developing effective treatments, and recognizing potential heterogeneity within the population aids prognoses by detecting possible risk factors of each subgroup. Hippo cam- pal structure changes have been connected to Alzheimer's disease and are hypothesized to occur early in the illness's development. In our work, we propose a universal clustering method for metric spaces that combines energy distance and a decision tree to detect the underlying heterogeneity in hippocampal structure. We are able to show that our method helps highlight the importance of utilizing hippo campus information for diagnosis and treatment and improves the prediction accuracy in a case study. The effectiveness of our approach is further backed up by the conducted simulations on widely-used metric spaces.

AB  - Previous studies have demonstrated that Yueju-Ganmaidazao (YG) decoction induces rapid antidepressant-like effects, and the antidepressant response is mostly dependent on the suppression of nitric oxide-cyclic guanosine monophosphate signaling in male mice. This study aimed to investigate the sex difference mediated by calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII)-neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) signaling involved in the antidepressant-like effect of YG in mice. We found that the immobility times in the tail suspension test (TST) were found to be decreased after the single injection of YG in male and female mice with the same dosage. Additionally, chronic administration for 4 days of subthreshold dosage of YG and escitalopram (ES) also significantly decreased the immobility time in mice of both sexes. Chronic subthreshold dosage of YG and ES in LPS-treated mice and in chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) mice both decreased the immobility time, which was increased by stress. Meanwhile, in CUS-treated mice, sucrose preference test, forced swimming test, and open field test were applied to further confirm the antidepressant-like effects of YG and ES. Moreover, CUS significantly decreased the expression of nNOS and CaMKII, and both YG and ES could enhance the expression in the hippocampus of female mice, which was opposite to that in male mice, while endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression was not affected by stress or drug treatment neither in male mice nor in female mice. Finally, subthreshold dosage of YG combined with 7-nitroindazole (nNOS inhibitor) induced the antidepressant-like effects both in female and in male mice, while the single use of YG or 7-NI did not display any effect. However, pretreatment with KN-93 (CaMKII inhibitor) only blocked the antidepressant-like effect of high-dosage YG in female mice. Meanwhile, in CUS mice, chronic stress caused NR1 overexpression and inhibited cAMP response element binding protein action, which were both reversed by YG and ES in male and female mice, implying that YG and ES produced the same antidepressant-like effect in mice of both sexes. The study revealed that chronic treatment with a subthreshold dose of YG also produced antidepressant-like effects in female mice, and these effects depended on the regulation of the CaMKII-nNOS signaling pathway.

AB  - Piglets at weaning experience stress owing to environmental changes. Mixing unfamiliar littermates also induces fighting and biting behaviors among them, affecting their welfare. In addition, post-weaning weight gain or loss is also influenced during the first week of weaning. Many compounds have been identified in the secretions of sows to address these behavioral and welfare issues; nevertheless, the positive influence of these compounds on piglet behavior and welfare is not fully understood. Therefore, we sought to study the interaction between the compounds (myristic acid, oleic acid, lauric acid, palmitic acid, 3-methyl phenol, tiglic aldehyde, and skatole, reported as maternal pheromones/urinary metabolites) and receptor proteins using computational approaches. We used five proteins, including alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP), odorant binding protein (OBP), salivary lipocalin (SAL), pheromaxein, and Von Ebner's Gland Protein (VEGP). We utilized molecular docking with AutoDock Vina and molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) using GROMACS to examine the stability of interactions between the listed compounds and proteins. The binding energies for the docked complexes ranged between -3.4 and -6.7 kcal/mol. Through analysis of the lowest root mean square deviation (RMSD) and hydrogen bond formations, we identified that at least one of the fatty acids exhibited optimal docking with four distinct proteins. The RMSD data for these complexes also indicated stability over a 100-ns MDS period. However, the post-MDS Molecular Mechanics/Poisson Boltzmann Surface Area (MM/PBSA) binding energy data revealed that palmitic acid had the highest stabilizing energy across all five proteins compared to other complexes. Additionally, myristic acid and oleic acid also exhibited a high binding affinity with the proteins. Taken together, our findings suggest that fatty acids could be the most effective semiochemicals for managing behavioral and welfare issues in weaning piglets.

AB  - Phage based therapeutics have shown promising results against the infections caused by the drug resistant bacteria. To combat the problem of antibiotic resistance posed by diarrhoeagenic E. coli, here, we identified and characterized 38 E. coli phages which were isolated from 70 solid sources (goat-faeces and soil). The in vitro lytic range of phage isolates (n=38) against 439 isolates of E. coli was found between 16 and 53%. Three phage isolates with highest host range showed lytic efficacy against 53, 48 and 46% of E. coli isolates, respectively. A preparation with above three phages was developed, and the phages of the preparation were found stable at wide range of temperature, pH and chloroform treatment. Endotoxin content of the preparation was found below the threshold level and it also passed safety and sterility tests. a total of 40 diarrheic goat kids were administered orally with the therapeutic phage preparation for two days twice daily. Total 21 diarrheic goat-kids were successfully treated using the therapeutic phage preparation, whereas 19 kids could not be treated (success rate: 52.5%; 21/40). The results of the current study provide insight for using lytic bacteriophages for therapeutic interventions against drug resistant E. coli responsible for colibacillosis in neonatal goat kids.

AB  - Camellia oleifera is an edible oil tree species native to China. Anthracnose is a common disease of Ca. oleifera, which reduces the production of the trees and brings huge economic losses. We have previously identified the fungus Colletotrichum fructicola as the major pathogen of anthracnose in Ca. oleifera. The retromer complex participates in the intracellular retrograde transport of the cargos from the endosome to the trans-Golgi network in the eukaryotes. Vacuolar protein sorting 29 is a subunit of the retromer complex. Targeted CfVPS29 gene deletion revealed that CfVps29 is involved in growth, conidiation, and the response to cell wall stress. We further found that the Delta Cfvps29 mutant was minimally pathogenic to Ca. oleifera leaves, as a result of its defect in appressorium formation. This study illustrated the crucial functions of CfVps29 in the development, cell wall stress response, and pathogenicity of C. fructicola and, therefore, identified it as a potential fungicide target for the control of anthracnose.

AB  - Exposure to stress at an early age programs the HPA axis which can lead to cognitive deficits in adults. However, it is not known whether these deficits emerge in adulthood or are expressed earlier in life. The aims of the study were to investigate (1) the immediate effects of early injury-induced stress in one-day-old (P1) and repeated stress on at P1 and P2 rat pups on plasma corticosterone levels; and (2) examine the subsequent long-term effects of this early stress on spatial learning and memory, and stress reactivity in early P26-34 and late P45-53 adolescent male and female rats. Intra-plantar injection of formalin induced prolonged and elevated levels of corticosterone in pups and impaired spatial learning and short- and long-term memory in late adolescent males and long-term memory in early adolescent females. There were sex differences in late adolescence in both learning and short-term memory. Performance on the long-term memory task was better than that on the short-term memory task for all early adolescent male and female control and stressed animals. Short-term memory was better in the late age control rats of both sexes and for formalin treated females as compared with the early age rats. These results are consistent with an impaired function of structures involved in memory (the hippocampus, amygdala, prefrontal cortex) after newborn pain. However, activation of the HPA axis by neonatal pain did not directly correlate with spatial learning and memory outcomes and the consequences of neonatal pain remain are likely multi-determined.

AB  - PremiseThe flammability of live leaves in canopies varies considerably among plant species. Identifying macroevolutionary processes that shape variation in leaf flammability contributes to an understanding of the phylogenetic underpinnings of wildfire dynamics.MethodsWe used a phylogenetic comparative approach to examine the macroevolution of live-leaf flammability in 75 plant species of fire-prone dry sclerophyll forests in eastern Australia. We estimated phylogenetic signal in leaf flammability, fitted a series of evolutionary models to test macroevolutionary hypotheses about leaf flammability, and assessed evolutionary correlations between leaf flammability and leaf water content (LWC), leaf mass per area (LMA), leaf area (LA), plant growth form, and fire response strategy.ResultsWe detected weak phylogenetic signal, indicating that leaf flammability exhibited greater variation among closely related species than would be expected under phylogenetic conservatism. The evolution of leaf flammability was equally well described by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model and a Pagel's delta model, implying weak stabilizing selection and an acceleration in leaf flammability evolution over time. We found significant evolutionary correlations such that high leaf flammability was related to low LWC, low LMA, and large LA.ConclusionsOur results show that live-leaf flammability is an evolutionarily labile trait in plant species of fire-prone forests. We suggest that the evolution of the three leaf traits in response to prevailing environmental conditions (such as LWC to water availability, LA to light capture, and LMA to herbivore defence) provide antagonistic selective forces that produce a macroevolutionary pattern of weak stabilising selection on leaf flammability.

AB  - Host plants exert strong selective pressures on phytophagous insects, and shifts in host use or specialisation can influence various phenotypic traits, including morphology. In this study, we examined the effects of adaptation to host secondary metabolites and potential host shifts on wing morphology and developmental instability in two sibling species of cactophilic Drosophila, D. buzzatii and D. koepferae. Using different strains of each species obtained through an artificial selection experiment and host shift simulations, we applied geometric morphometrics to analyse how experimental evolution and novel host exploitation impact wing morphology and developmental instability. Our results showed that adaptation to high concentrations of host secondary metabolites led to a reduction in wing size in D. buzzatii, whereas no such cost was detected in D. koepferae. Additionally, evolutionary changes in wing shape were observed. Host shift simulations resulted in reduced wing size, increased developmental instability and alterations in wing shape in both Drosophila species. In D. koepferae, developmental instability was negatively correlated with wing size, supporting the hypothesis that fluctuating asymmetry serves as a fitness proxy. Our findings highlight the role of correlated evolution following ecological specialisation to host plant chemicals as a key driver of morphological evolution in phytophagous insects.

AB  - Sea turtles, as endangered species with their long lifespans, wide-ranging migration, and high trophic level, are effective bioindicators of marine pollution. Despite the importance of global monitoring of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in sea turtles, research has been limited, especially in Asia. This study examined the accumulation of POPs in the livers of 44 sea turtles from Korean waters, including loggerhead (Caretta caretta) and green turtles (Chelonia mydas). The turtles accumulated the chemicals in the order PAHs > PCBs > DDTs > PBDEs > CHLs, HBCDs, hexachlorobenzene, HCHs > mirex, pentachlorobenzene. Loggerhead turtles had significantly higher levels of DDTs, HCHs, pentachlorobenzene, and PBDEs than green turtles (Wilcoxon rank sum test, p < 0.01), along with a higher proportion of bioaccumulative congeners and isomers, likely due to their primarily carnivorous diet compared to the predominantly herbivorous diet of green turtles. Conversely, HBCD levels were similar in both species, yet green turtles had a higher proportion of gamma-HBCD-the dominant isomer in commercial HBCDs used as plastic additives, with lower bioaccumulation potential-likely reflecting their greater ingestion of plastic debris than loggerhead turtles. Notably, sea turtles had higher ratios of gamma-HBCD to alpha-HBCD and HBCDs to PCBs than seabirds from Korean waters, implying greater exposure to plastic-derived POPs. This study highlights the widespread accumulation of legacy and emerging POPs, including plastic-associated chemicals, in Korean sea turtles. These findings underscore the need for global POP monitoring in sea turtles and further research on the environmental fate and impact of plastic-associated chemicals.

AB  - The interest in automated methods of continuously monitoring the behaviour of farm animals, particularly by means of accelerometers, is growing because behaviour is of specific importance for the assessment of welfare beyond health. At the same time, the need for animal-based and individual-specific welfare indicators has been theoretically recognised. Behavioural complexity could be such an indicator with the potential for automation. In this study, we investigated accelerometer data from 97 fattening pigs - recorded on 185 days in three age classes, two seasons, and four housing levels - to assess behavioural complexity. First, we used a binary classifier to automatically predict phases of low and high activity as a basis for calculating behavioural complexity from the accelerometer data. Second, we trained and validated a random forest classifier to predict eight different behavioural states. The binary classification of activity phases achieved an accuracy of 77 % and the random forest model an accuracy of 84 %. For the binary and the random forest data, five and 12 complexity-features, respectively, were reduced using PCA and the resulting PCs were analysed using mixed effects models. In the binary data, general complexity (PC 1) was higher with higher housing levels (p [housing level] = 0.01; p [global] = 0.07) and duration variability (PC 2) tended to be so (p [housing level] = 0.08; p [global] = 0.38). Additionally, there was a tendency towards higher general complexity in older pigs (p [age] = 0.06). For the random forest data, general complexity (PC1) was lower on average with higher housing levels (without statistical support: p [housing level] = 0.14; p [global] = 0.48) and there was a tendency for a higher transition rate (PC2) with higher housing levels (p [housing level] = 0.07; p [global] = 0.52). These results suggest that the higher behavioural complexity seen in more animal-friendly housing environments can also be observed in automatically recorded data classified in binary phases of low and high activity. The classifier-features calculated from accelerometer data collected from head movements could not unequivocally differentiate between the different behaviours. Therefore, the random forest model could not precisely predict the behaviours needed as the basis to calculate behavioural complexity. All observed patterns were relatively weak such that the observed sensitivity of these automatically recorded variables (PCs) in respect to the housing system is unlikely to translate easily into sufficient specificity for future assessment of welfare of individual animals.

AB  - Simple Summary Although often considered host-specific, there is increasing evidence of a broader-than-expected host tropism for different circoviruses, including porcine circovirus 2 (PCV-2). In this study, the presence of PCV-2 in the lung lymph nodes of Namibian jackals has been demonstrated. The complete genome of the viruses was generated, and they were classified as PCV-2b and shown to have a close genetic relationship with South African and Namibian strains collected from domestic pigs. Since contact between jackals and domestic swine is highly unlikely, one of the most plausible explanations for the infection of the jackals with PCV-2b would involve the dispersal of pig-derived products in the wild environment during recreational activities or the scavenging activity of jackals living in peri-urban areas. However, further studies are required to properly assess how PCV-2 is acquired and maintained in the wild canids and its potential impact on other wild and domestic species. Members of the genus Circovirus have been identified in several host species. While initially considered host-specific, there is growing evidence of their presence in unexpected hosts. Porcine circovirus 2 (PCV-2) is no exception, having been reported in animals belonging to different orders, including carnivores. Recently, PCV-2 was detected in domestic pigs, warthogs and antelopes in Namibia. Considering the potential contact between these populations and wild carnivores, the presence of PCV-2 was investigated in 32 black-backed jackals (Lupulella mesomelas) shot between February and July 2021 as part of predator control operations in Namibia. Two lung lymph nodes tested positive for PCV-2 by PCR, confirming the broader-than-expected PCV-2 host tropism and the susceptibility of canids. Sequence analysis demonstrated a close association between the PCV-2s identified in the jackals and PCV-2b strains collected from South African domestic pigs. Although several hypotheses regarding the source of the jackal's infection are proposed, further studies should be performed to properly assess how PCV-2 is acquired and maintained in the wild and its potential impact on wild and domestic species.

AB  - The work discusses some issues related to the species diversity of helminth larvae developing in the body of freshwater molluscs and insects distributed in the territory of Karakalpakstan, a vast region in Uzbekistan. A total of 42 species of parasites in larval form were identified in the region; 27 species were recorded in aquatic molluscs and 15 species in insects. 29 species were recorded for the first time in Karakalpakstan. We established that the class Gastropoda in the water bodies of Karakalpakstan is represented by 17 species; 9 of them belong to the family Lymnaeidae, 6 species to Planorbidae and 2 to Physidae. 3,477 mollus. individuals of 11 species were infected with larval stages of trematodes. The prevalence of infection in Lymnaeidae (Radix and Lymnaea) ranged from 1.7% to 25.5%. A similar prevalence was recorded in Planorbidae (1.625.4%). Physa fontinalis showed a prevalence of infection of 1.3%. 27 species of parasites in cercarial forms were identified in molluscs. The largest number of cercariae of trematode species was found in molluscs from the family Lymnaeidae (14 species). They were followed by representatives of Planorbidae (12 species). The fauna of cercariae identified in molluscs from water bodies in Karakalpakstan was from 12 families of trematodes. The most common were the cercariae of those species of trematodes that complete their life cycle in wetland birds (20 species). Cercariae of 6 species of trematodes turned out to be parasites of mammals, mainly ungulates. 1 species of trematodes in a larval stage was recorded in each of the fish and amphibian groups. The richest species composition in the studied region was shown by trematode cercariae representing Schistosomatidae (6 species), which were followed by Echinostomatidae (4 species). Cercariae of other trematode families were represented by one, two and three species. It was established that the studied molluscs do not play an equal role as intermediate hosts of trematodes. The richest species composition was shown by populations of Radix auricularia (14 species), Planorbis planorbis (12 species), Anisus spirorbis (9 species), and Lymnaea stagnalis (5 species). Populations of L. bactriana, Pl. tangitarensis were infected by only one species. The prevalence recorded in the studied insects infected with helminth larvae ranged widely from 1.1% to 14.4%. The identified larvae turned out to be representatives of Cestoda (3 species), Trematoda (1 species) and Nematoda (11 species). The largest number of species (4) of helminth larvae were found in beetles from the family Scarabaeidae - Gongylonema pulchrum, Spirura rytipleurites, Choanataenia infundibulum and Echinolepis carioca, and mosquitoes - Dirofilaria immitis, D. repens, Dipetalonema ewansi and Setaria labiatopapillosa. 2 species were recorded in flies - Stephamofilaria stilesi and Parabronema skrjabini. The recorded species belong to the classes Nematoda and Cestoda. The intensity of infection ranged from single to 11-17 individuals. The work provides original data on the morphology and biology of the larvae of the studied mollus.s infected with cercariae of trematodes and insects with metacercariae of trematodes, cysticercoids of cestodes and larvae of nematodes, and presents the structure of communities of larval forms of parasitic worms.

AB  - Bisphenol A (BPA), a typical environmental endocrine disruptor, has raised concerns among researchers due to its toxicological effects. Whether neohesperidin (NEO) can intervene in the toxic effects of BPA remains unknown. This study aims to investigate the effects and mechanisms of NEO on the myogenic differentiation of umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) exposed to BPA. Sheep UC-MSCs were isolated, characterized, and induced to myogenic differentiation. BPA decreased cell viability, cell migration, and the expressions of myogenic marker genes, leading to myogenic differentiation inhibition, which were reversed by NEO. Network pharmacology suggested the IGF1R/AKT1/RHOA pathway as potential targets of BPA and NEO regulating muscle development. Western blot results showed that NEO could reverse the down-regulation of the pathway proteins induced by BPA, and counteract the effects of picropodophyllin (PPP) or MK-2206 dihydrochloride (MK-2206) in the myogenic differentiation of sheep UC-MSCs. Additionally, the expression levels of (p-) IGF1R, AKT1, and RHOA were positively correlated. Taken together, the mechanisms of NEO resistance to BPA involved the IGF1R/AKT1/RHOA signaling pathway. These findings provide a scientific basis for alleviating BPA toxicity, preventing and treating muscular dysplasia, and promoting muscle damage repair.

AB  - Ammonia is a major harmful gas in the environment of livestock and poultry. Studies have shown that excessive ammonia inhalation has adverse effects in pig heart. However, the mechanism of ammonia-induced cardiac toxicity in pigs has not been reported. L-selenomethionine is a kind of organic selenium (Se) which is easily absorbed by the body. Therefore, in this study, twenty-four 125-day-old pigs were randomly divided into 4 groups: C (control) group, A (ammonia) group, Se group (Se content: 0.5 mg kg(-1)), and A (ammonia) + Se group. The mechanism of ammonia-induced cardiotoxicity and the alleviating effect of L-selenomethionine were examined. The results in the A group showed as follows: a large number of myocardial fiber edema and cytoplasmic bleakness were observed in the heart; a large number of mitochondrial autophagy were observed; ATP content, ATPase activities and hematological parameters decreased significantly; Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) markers (GRP78, IRE1 alpha, ATF4, ATF6, and CHOP) were significantly induced in the mRNA and protein levels; PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway was activated; and autophagy key genes and proteins (Beclin-1, LC3, ATG3, and ATG5) were significantly up-regulated. The results of comparison between the A + Se group and the A group were as follows: the degree of edema of cardiac muscle fiber in the A + Se group was somewhat relieved; the level of mitochondrial autophagy decreased; ATP content and ATPase activities increased significantly; the mRNA and protein levels of ERS markers were significantly down-regulated; the expression level of PI3K/AKT/ mTOR signaling pathway was decreased; and the mRNA and protein levels of key autophagy genes were decreased. However, the changes of these indexes in the A + Se group were still significantly different from those in the C group. Our results indicated that L-selenomethionine supplementation inhibited ammonia-induced cardiac autophagy by activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, which confirmed that L-selenomethionine could alleviate the cardiac injury caused by excessive ammonia inhalation to a certain extent. This study aims to enrich the toxicological mechanism of ammonia and provide valuable reference for future intervention of ammonia toxicity.

AB  - As an alternative to ejaculated semen, epididymal spermatozoa (ES) can be recovered and cryopreserved for use in artificial insemination and other assisted reproductive technologies. However, variabilities in the sperm response to freeze-thaw procedures challenge its inherent value. Therefore, the present study aims to clarify the freezability phenomena in the swamp buffalo ES, where pieces of literature do not abound. Here, we isolated ES from swamp buffaloes using abattoir-derived, post-mortem caudal epididymis by slicing-flushing technique. Following cryopreservation by slow-freezing, ES samples were classified into high (HF) and low freezability (LF) based on their post-thaw total and progressive motilities. Conventional sperm parameters and proteins of in -terest, such as glutathione S-transferase Mu 3 (GSTM3) and ATP synthase beta subunit (ATP1B1), were assessed and compared between HF and LF. Computer-assisted sperm analysis revealed that nearly all motion and ki-nematic parameters significantly differed among freezability groups except for wobble, linearity, and straight-ness. Moreover, intracellular reactive oxygen species production was evident in both HF and LF after fluorescence staining, with the latter having considerably greater malondialdehyde levels than the former. Immunohistochemical labeling demonstrated that both GSTM3 and ATP1B1 proteins were present in the ES and the epididymal tubular epithelium. Although the GSTM3 relative amounts, as analyzed through Western blot, were significantly higher in LF than HF in association with lipid peroxidation, no significant differences were observed in the case of ATP1B1. Such variations in motility, motion and kinematics, oxidative stress status, and specific sperm proteins suggest their potential utility in distinguishing freezability phenotypes in swamp buffalo ES.

AB  - Background and Aims Theaceae, with three tribes, nine genera and more than 200 species, are of great economic and ecological importance. Recent phylogenetic analyses based on plastomic data resolved the relationships among the three tribes and the intergeneric relationships within two of those tribes. However, generic-level relationships within the largest tribe, Theeae, were not fully resolved. The role of putative whole-genome duplication (WGD) events in the family and possible hybridization events among genera within Theeae also remain to be tested further. Methods Transcriptomes or low-depth whole-genome sequencing of 57 species of Theaceae, as well as additional plastome sequence data, were generated. Using a dataset of low-copy nuclear genes, we reconstructed phylogenetic relationships using concatenated, species tree and phylogenetic network approaches. We further conducted molecular dating analyses and inferred possible WGD events by examining the distribution of the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (Ks) for paralogues in each species. For plastid protein-coding sequences , phylogenies were reconstructed for comparison with the results obtained from analysis of the nuclear dataset. Results Based on the 610 low-copy nuclear genes (858 606 bp in length) investigated, Stewartieae was resolved as sister to the other two tribes. Within Theeae, the Apterosperma-Laplacea clade grouped with Pyrenaria, leaving Camellia and Polyspora as sister. The estimated ages within Theaceae were largely consistent with previous studies based mainly on plastome data. Two reticulation events within Camellia and one between the common ancestor of Gordonia and Schima were found. All members of the tea family shared two WGD events, an older At-gamma and a recent Ad-beta; both events were also shared with the outgroups (Diapensiaceae, Pentaphylacaceae, Styracaceae and Symplocaceae). Conclusions Our analyses using low-copy nuclear genes improved understanding of phylogenetic relationships at the tribal and generic levels previously proposed based on plastome data, but the phylogenetic position of the Apterosperma-Laplacea clade needs more attention. There is no evidence for extensive intergeneric hybridization within Theeae or for a Theaceae-specific WGD event. Land bridges (e.g. the Bering land bridge) during the Late Oligocene may have permitted the intercontinental plant movements that facilitated the putative ancient introgression between the common ancestor of Gordonia and Schima.

AB  - The study was designed to investigate the protective effect of dietary supplementation with coated benzoic acid (CBA) on intestinal barrier function in weaned pigs challenged with enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC). Thirty-two pigs were randomized to four treatments and given either a basal diet or a basal diet supplemented with 3.0 g/kg CBA, followed by oral administration of ETEC or culture medium. The results showed that CBA supplementation increased the average daily weight gain (ADWG) in the ETEC-challenged pigs (p < 0.05). CBA also increased the serum activity of total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) and the total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), as it decreased the serum concentrations of endotoxin, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in the ETEC-challenged pigs (p < 0.05). Interestingly, the CBA alleviated the ETEC-induced intestinal epithelial injury, as indicated by a reversal of the decrease in D-xylose absorption and a decrease in the serum levels of D-lactate and diamine oxidase (DAO) activity, as well as a decrease in the quantity of apoptotic cells in the jejunal epithelium following ETEC challenge (p < 0.05). Moreover, CBA supplementation significantly elevated the mucosal antioxidant capacity and increased the abundance of tight junction protein ZO-1 and the quantity of sIgA-positive cells in the jejunal epithelium (p < 0.05). Notably, CBA increased the expression levels of porcine beta defensin 2 (PBD2), PBD3, and nuclear factor erythroid-2 related factor 2 (Nrf-2), while downregulating the expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in the jejunal mucosa (p < 0.05). Moreover, CBA decreased the expression levels of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) in the ileal mucosa upon ETEC challenge (p < 0.05). These results suggest that CBA may attenuate ETEC-induced damage to the intestinal epithelium, resulting in reduced inflammation, enhanced intestinal immunity and antioxidant capacity, and improved intestinal epithelial function.

AB  - Background: Emerging data has demonstrated that in mature neurons, SorCS2 localizes to the postsynaptic density of dendritic spines and facilitates plasma membrane sorting of TrkB by interacting with it, transmitting positive signaling from BDNF on neurons. Thus, it is possible that SorCS2 plays a role in the pathophysiology of depression by regulating the BDNF-TrkB system. Methods: In the present study, SorCS2 expression in different brain regions [hippocampus, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), hypothalamus, amygdala, ventral tegmental area (VTA), and nucleus accumbens (NAc)] was thoroughly investigated in the chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) and chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) models of depression. The changes in depressive-like behaviors, the hippocampal BDNF signaling cascade, and amounts of hippocampal immature neurons were further investigated after SorCS2 overexpression by microinjection of the adenovirus associated virus vector containing the coding sequence of mouse SorCS2 (AAV-SorCS2) into the hippocampus of mice exposed to CSDS or CUMS. Results: It was found that both CSDS and CUMS significantly decreased the protein and mRNA expression of SorCS2 in the hippocampus but not in other brain regions. Chronic stress also notably downregulated the level of hippocampal SorCS2-TrkB binding in mice. In contrast, AAV-based genetic overexpression of hippocampal SorCS2 fully reversed the chronic stress-induced not only depressive-like behaviors but also decreased SorCS2TrkB binding, BDNF signaling pathway, and amounts of immature neurons in the hippocampus of mice. Conclusion: All these results suggest that enhancing the hippocampal SorCS2 expression protects against chronic stress, producing antidepressant-like actions. Hippocampal SorCS2 may participate in depression neurobiology and be a potential antidepressant target. Significance statement: Targeting of proteins to distinct subcellular compartments is essential for neuronal activity and modulated by VPS10P domain receptors which include SorCS2. In mature neurons, SorCS2 localizes to the postsynaptic density of dendritic spines and facilitates plasma membrane sorting of TrkB by interacting with it, transmitting positive signaling from BDNF on neurons. Our study is the first direct evidence preliminarily showing that SorCS2 plays a role in depression neurobiology. It was found that chronic stress induced not only depressive-like behaviors but also decreased SorCS2 expression in the hippocampus. Chronic stress did not affect SorCS2 expression in the mPFC, hypothalamus, amygdala, VTA, or NAc. In contrast, genetic overexpression of hippocampal SorCS2 prevented against chronic stress, producing antidepressant-like actions in mice. Thus, hippocampal SorCS2 is a potential participant underlying depression neurobiology and may be a novel antidepressant target. Our study may also extend the knowledge of the neurotrophic hypothesis of depression.

AB  - Insects employ various types of gustatory receptors (GRs) to identify nutrient-rich food and avoid toxic substances. The larval gustatory system is the critical checkpoint for food acceptance or rejection. As a specialist herbivore, the larvae of Bactrocera minax feed only on unripe citrus fruits. However, how larvae use GRs to check and adapt to the secondary metabolites in unripe citrus fruits remains unknown. In this study, we first performed developmental expression profiles showing that most BminGRs genes were highly expressed in 1st and 2nd instar larvae and that tissue-specific expression indicated high expression of most BminGRs genes in the mouthparts of 2nd instar larvae. Furthermore, we found that silencing BminGR59f by RNA interference (RNAi) affected the growth of 2nd instar B. minax larvae. Hesperidin and naringin were screened as ligands of BminGR59f via RNAi and cell calcium imaging, and the combination of these two flavones increased the body weight of larvae. In summary, we identified a novel gustatory perception pattern in B. minax for detecting hesperidin and naringin, which boosted the growth of B. minax larvae. These results shed light on how specialist herbivores detect and adapt to host metabolites in adverse environments depending on larval GRs.

AB  - During maturation, spermatozoa acquire motility and fertilizing capacity as they transit through the epididymis. Melatonin is a lipophilic hormone with multiple functions in regulating the fertility. Previous studies have shown that melatonin affected the capacitation or maturation of sperm in the epididymis. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of melatonin on epididymal caput epithelial cells in sheep. In the study, we used iTRAQ labelling coupled with LC-MS/MS for quantitative identification of differentially expressed proteins in melatonin-treated sheep epididymal caput epithelial cells. We identified 69 differentially expressed protein; 41 were upregulated and 28 were downregulated in samples from sheep in melatonin treated. We validated the differential expression of a subset of these proteins using qPCR and Western blot. Gene ontology annotation identified that the differentially expressed proteins function in cellular processes and metabolic processes. Notably, five of the differentially expressed proteins as SOD1, COL1A1, PRM1, NQO2, and FN1 are involved in sperm migration and sperm maturation. KEGG enrichment analysis demonstrated significant enrichment in several cardiac-related pathways, such as "PI3K-Akt signaling pathway", "AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications", "ECM-receptor interaction", and "Ribosome". Our results suggest that candidate biomarker (SOD1, COL1A1, PRM1, NQO2, and FN1) discovery can aid in understanding sperm development and maturation in sheep. These results provide insights into the potential mechanisms of melatonin regulation of sperm maturation in epididymal caput epithelial cells.

AB  - Representing one of the last populations of an IUCN Critically Endangered subspecies, estimates suggest the Kordofan giraffe of Cameroon's Benoue Complex number fewer than 300 individuals, threatened by poaching and habitat degradation. This study investigated the viability of Benoue National Park's Kordofan giraffe and efficacy of available interventions through a population viability analysis using VORTEX. The relative impacts of anti-poaching activity, population supplementation, habitat protection and vaccination were explored, alongside a sensitivity analysis investigating parameter uncertainty. The baseline model projects a 78.6% probability of extinction (PE) within 100 years. Poaching of just two individuals every 5 years results in a 98.1% PE, highlighting anti-poaching activity as a vital intervention. Movement of a female-biased group into the park proved effective, with supplementation of 24 females reducing the PE by over 35%, sustaining a raised population size above the baseline for over 60 years on average. Annual carrying capacity reduction of 2% year(-1) for 20 years resulted in a 97.8% PE. Conversely, habitat restoration had little consequence unless combined with further interventions. These findings underscore the magnitude of the threat facing Benoue National Park's Kordofan giraffe. Conservation management should prioritise strengthening existing anti-poaching activity in conjunction with protecting wildlife corridors to aid dispersal.

AB  - The circadian gene PER2 is recognized for its regulatory effects on cell proliferation and lipid metabolism across various non-ruminant cells. This study investigates the influence of PER2 gene overexpression on goat rumen epithelial cells using a constructed pcDNA3.1-PER2 plasmid, assessing its impact on circadian gene expression, cell proliferation, and mRNA levels of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) transporters, alongside genes related to lipid metabolism, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. Rumen epithelial cells were obtained every four hours from healthy dairy goats (n = 3; aged 1.5 years; average weight 45.34 +/- 4.28 kg), cultured for 48 h in vitro, and segregated into control (pcDNA3.1) and overexpressed (pcDNA3.1-PER2) groups, each with four biological replicates. The study examined the potential connection between circadian rhythms and nutrient assimilation in ruminant, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle dynamics, and antioxidant activity and the expression of circadian-related genes, VFA transporter genes and regulatory factors. The introduction of the pcDNA3.1-PER2 plasmid drastically elevated PER2 expression levels by 3471.48-fold compared to controls (p < 0.01), confirming effective overexpression. PER2 overexpression resulted in a significant increase in apoptosis rates (p < 0.05) and a notable reduction in cell proliferation at 24 and 48 h post-transfection (p < 0.05), illustrating an inhibitory effect on rumen epithelial cell growth. PER2 elevation significantly boosted the expression of CCND1, WEE1, p21, and p16 (p < 0.05) while diminishing CDK4 expression (p < 0.05). While the general expression of intracellular inflammation genes remained stable, TNF-alpha expression notably increased. Antioxidant marker levels (SOD, MDA, GSH-Px, CAT, and T-AOC) exhibited no significant change, suggesting no oxidative damage due to PER2 overexpression. Furthermore, PER2 overexpression significantly downregulated AE2, NHE1, MCT1, and MCT4 mRNA expressions while upregulating PAT1 and VH+ ATPase. These results suggest that PER2 overexpression impairs cell proliferation, enhances apoptosis, and modulates VFA transporter-related factors in the rumen epithelium. This study implies that the PER2 gene may regulate VFA absorption through modulation of VFA transporters in rumen epithelial cells, necessitating further research into its specific regulatory mechanisms.

AB  - In a colony of 52 antelope ground squirrels conceived in the wild and raised in the laboratory, 42% of adult animals exhibited freezing and seizure-like behaviour in response to the minor stress of monthly cage changes. This behavioural pattern, which was never exhibited at other times, is similar to that previously described in Mongolian gerbils. Characteristics of the behavioural pattern do not seem to be indicative of a captivity-induced stereotypy.

AB  - During capacitation, proteins in boar sperm are released to maintain the stability of their own state and membrane structure. No studies have analyzed the differences between retained proteins and released proteins during sperm capacitation. In the present study, a Transwell chamber and polycarbonate membrane were used to separate the proteins of boar sperm and their released proteins. Isotopically labeled relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) was used to analyze each compartment protein. A total of 108 differential proteins were identified in the upper and lower chambers of the Transwell, among which 27 were significantly upregulated (p-value<0.05 and |log2 (fold change)|>1) and 81 were significantly downregulated (p-value<0.05 and |log2 (fold change)|<1). These differential proteins were mainly involved in biological processes (e.g., the regulation of cysteine peptidase activity, trans membrane transportation, ion transportation and ATP synthesis) and major signaling pathways (e.g., glutathione/galactose metabolism, cellular adhesion and PI3K-Akt), and most of them interacted with each other to some extent. In conclusion, retained proteins and released proteins of capacitated sperm were effectively separated using a Transwell chamber, and differential proteins were successfully identified from among the proteins. Bioinformatics analysis suggested that these differential proteins affect sperm capacitation mainly by adjusting sperm energy metabolism, motion characteristics and acrosome membrane status.

AB  - We observed white-lipped peccaries (Tayassu pecari) killing infant collared peccaries (Pecari tajacu) on the Osa Peninsula of Costa Rica. Camera trap data indicated high overlap of peccary activity periods, but spatio-temporal avoidance of white-lipped peccaries by collared peccaries. Heterospecific infanticide is unknown among ungulates, but could be an important factor in reinforcing niche partitioning. Abstract in Spanish is available with online material.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A frequent goal of pest management strategies targeting social insects is total colony elimination. Insecticidal baits are highly effective at controlling social insect pests, although their ability to provide total colony elimination has only been well studied in a few species. Genetically testing colony elimination in many urban pest ants can be challenging due to indistinct colony boundaries observed in unicolonial, invasive species; however, some pest ants, such as the dark rover ant (Bra-chymyrmex patagonicus), maintain strict colony borders through aggression towards non-nestmates. Each of these distinct colonies can be identified using molecular markers, allowing for the tracking of individual colonies pre- and post-treatment to measure colony density. While counting the number of foraging workers to assess treatment efficacy may suffice in some cases, it offers little insight into the colony-level impacts of a treatment.
   RESULTS: Using microsatellite markers, distinct rover ant colonies were identified and tracked around residential structures before and after the application of an imidacloprid bait. The number of foraging ants at the treated structures was reduced by an average of 83.0% over a 28-day observation period. Baiting also significantly reduced the total number of colonies present. At the treatment structures, only similar to 25% of the original colonies remained at the end of the study. Colonies with foraging trails <1.5 m from a bait station had a higher chance of being eliminated.
   CONCLUSION: Using insecticidal baits against B. patagonicus can be highly effective at colony elimination; however, with such small foraging ranges and high colony densities, proper placement is required to ensure enough bait is properly positioned to treat all colonies affecting a structure.

AB  - Hippocampal-cortical circuit oscillations in local field potential (LFP) represent network-level signals which promotes behavior. Investigating these signals promote our understanding on how the brain process cognition and emotion, and provide further perspectives into electroencephalogram endophenotypes, especially under the pathological state. The physiological adaptive stress responses to threatening stimuli are critical for individuals. The disturbance of stress response may lead to psychiatric disorders such as major depressive disorder (MDD). To quantitatively examine the effects of acute stress on hippocampal-cortical circuit, we recorded LFPs in the hippocampus (HC) and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). We analyzed three major LFP oscillations with their temporal coupling. Consistent with our hypothesis that strengthened communication of hippocampal-cortical circuit may occur in stress adaption, we found that intensive acute stress induced enhanced ripple-delta-spindle coupling. The LFP coupling may facilitate the recruitment of relevant structures in hippocampal-cortical circuit, in response to acute stress, and play a role in emotional encoding migration.

AB  - Posttraumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) arises secondary to joint injuries and is characteristically driven by inflammatory mediators. PTOA is often studied in the setting of ACL tears. However, a wide range of other injuries also lead to PTOA pathogenesis. The purpose of this study was to characterize the morphological changes in the uninjured ACL in a PTOA inflammatory environment. We retrospectively reviewed 14 ACLs from 13 Yucatan minipigs, 7 of which had undergone our modified intra-articular drilling (mIAD) procedure, which induced PTOA through inflammatory mediators. Seven ACLs were harvested from mIAD minipigs (PTOA) and seven ACLs from control minipigs with no cartilage degeneration (non-PTOA). ACL degeneration was evaluated using histological scoring systems. IL-1 beta, NF-kappa B, and TNF-alpha mRNA expression in the synovium was measured using qRT-PCR. PTOA minipigs demonstrated significant ACL degeneration, marked by a disorganized extracellular matrix, increased vascularity, and changes in cellular shape, density, and alignment. Furthermore, IL-1 beta, NF-kappa B, and TNF-alpha expression was elevated in the synovium of PTOA minipigs. These findings demonstrate the potential for ACL degeneration in a PTOA environment and emphasize the need for anti-inflammatory disease-modifying therapies following joint injury.

AB  - Simple Summary Male germ cell development plays a crucial role in male reproduction, and gene expression also presents an essential regulatory role in its development. Many studies have been devoted to the induction and differentiation of pluripotent stem cells into germ cells in vitro. However, the culture system for pluripotent stem cells from domestic animals is not stable, especially in sheep. Our study attempted to transdifferentiate sheep somatic cells into germ cells in vitro by the overexpression of key germ cell related genes, with the aim of perfecting the construction of germ cell research models in vitro. Therefore, we explored the expression pattern of four crucial genes, bmp4, dazl, nanos3 and sycp2, in Hu sheep testicular development, and investigated the potential efficiency of overexpression of the four candidate genes using the CRISPR/dcas9 system in Leydig cells. We revealed that the overexpression of bmp4, dazl, nanos3 and sycp2 can promote the expression of male germ cell related genes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to construct an overexpression induction system using CRISPR/dcas9 technology, and to induce sheep somatic cells into germ cells in vitro. Male germ cells directly affect the reproduction of males; however, their accurate isolation and culture in vitro is extremely challenging, hindering the study of germ cell development and function. CRISPR/dcas9, as an efficient gene reprogramming system, has been verified to promote the transdifferentiation of pluripotent stem cells into male germ cells by editing target genes. In our research, we explored the expression pattern of the germ cell related genes bmp4, dazl, nanos3 and sycp2 in Hu sheep testicular development and constructed the overexpression model using the CRISPR/dcas9 system. The results indicated that four genes showed more expression in testis tissue than in other tissues, and that bmp4, dazl and sycp2 present higher expression levels in nine-month-old sheep testes than in three-month-olds, while nanos3 expressed the opposite trend (p < 0.05). In addition, the expression of four potential genes in spermatogenic cells was slightly different, but they were all expressed in sheep Leydig cells. To verify the potential roles of the four genes in the process of inducing differentiation of male germ cells, we performed cell transfection in vitro. We found that the expression of the germ cell related genes Prdm1, Prdm14, Mvh and Sox17 were significantly increased after the overexpression of the four genes in Leydig cells, and the co-transfection effect was the most significant (p < 0.05). Our results illustrate the crucial functions of bmp4, dazl, nanos3 and sycp2 in Hu sheep testis development and verified the effectiveness of the overexpression model that was constructed using the CRISPR/dcas9 system, which provided a basis for further male germ cell differentiation in vitro.

AB  - ASAT1 and ASAT2 are trichome-specific acyltransferases in tobacco that sequentially catalyse two additive steps of acyl donors to sucrose to produce di-acylsucrose.
   Glandular trichomes of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) produce blends of acylsucroses that contribute to defence against pathogens and herbivorous insects, but the mechanism of assembly of these acylsugars has not yet been determined. In this study, we isolated and characterized two trichome-specific acylsugar acyltransferases that are localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, NtASAT1 and NtASAT2. They sequentially catalyse two additive steps of acyl donors to sucrose to produce di-acylsucrose. Knocking out of NtASAT1 or NtASAT2 resulted in deficiency of acylsucrose; however, there was no effect on acylsugar accumulation in plants overexpressing NtASAT1 or NtASAT2. Genomic analysis and profiling revealed that NtASATs originated from the T subgenome, which is derived from the acylsugar-producing diploid ancestor N. tomentosiformis. Our identification of NtASAT1 and NtASAT2 as enzymes involved in acylsugar assembly in tobacco potentially provides a new approach and target genes for improving crop resistance against pathogens and insects.

AB  - Simple Summary The databases of mRNA and non-coding-RNAs (miRNA, circRNA, lncRNA) in the ovary of Xinong Sannen goat were reported in this study. The differential expression of mRNA and non-coding RNAs were analyzed, and the comprehensive analysis of the four databases provided RNA networks that regulate estrous cycle, which is essential to improve reproduction. Estrous cycle is one of the placental mammal characteristics after sexual maturity, including estrus stage (ES) and diestrus stage (DS). Estrous cycle is important in female physiology and its disorder may lead to diseases, such as polycystic ovary syndrome, ovarian carcinoma, anxiety, and epilepsy. In the latest years, effects of non-coding RNAs and messenger RNA (mRNA) on estrous cycle have started to arouse much concern, however, a whole transcriptome analysis among non-coding RNAs and mRNA has not been reported. Here, we report a whole transcriptome analysis of goat ovary in estrus and diestrus periods. Estrus synchronization was conducted to induce the estrus phase and on day 32, the goats shifted into the diestrus stage. The ovary RNA of estrus and diestrus stages was respectively collected to perform RNA-sequencing. Then, the circular RNA (circRNA), microRNA (miRNA), long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), and mRNA databases of goat ovary were acquired, and the differential expressions between estrus and diestrus stages were screened to construct circRNA-miRNA-mRNA/lncRNA and lncRNA-miRNA/mRNA networks, thus providing potential pathways that are involved in the regulation of estrous cycle. Differentially expressed mRNAs, such as MMP9, TIMP1, 3BHSD, and PTGIS, and differentially expressed miRNAs that play key roles in the regulation of estrous cycle, such as miR-21-3p, miR-202-3p, and miR-223-3p, were extracted from the network. Our data provided the miRNA, circRNA, lncRNA, and mRNA databases of goat ovary and each differentially expressed profile between ES and DS. Networks among differentially expressed miRNAs, circRNAs, lncRNAs, and mRNAs were constructed to provide valuable resources for the study of estrous cycle and related diseases.

During that period, work in the field expanded from an initial emphasis on management of vector-borne plant pathogens to include biology of the pathosystems. Since 2007, when ESA reorganized the subsections within the society, work on herbivorous vectors of plant pathogens has continued to grow. This article briefly summarizes the work in this field prior to, during, and after the ESA Subsection Cc era. We identify and describe 4 research areas that have characterized the field since 2007: Molecular mechanisms of vector-plant interactions, managing vectors and pathogen transmission in agriculture, illuminating the ecology of vectors and pathogens outside of crops, and pathogen manipulation of host phenotypes and vector behavior. We then identify 10 frontiers and prospects for the field in the coming years that build on these 4 research areas, ranging from molecular and cellular aspects to ramifications for managed and natural ecosystems. We also examine trends in funding and professional opportunities for scientists working on herbivorous vectors and pathogens. Finally, we renew the call for greater integration of work addressing vector-borne plant, animal, and human pathogens due to fundamental similarities in their biology and importance for human well-being within an expanded understanding of the "One Health" paradigm, which currently emphasizes human and animal health.

AB  - Background The black inch worm (BIW), Hyposidra talaca Walker (Lepidoptera: Geometridae), is a pest that defoliates tea leaves in India, posing a significant threat to the tea industry. Nucleopolyhedrovirus (NPV) is capable of infecting larvae of this species, which has raised the possibility of its use as a biocontrol agent.Results Rearing larvae in a semi-synthetic artificial diet produced healthy adults, which is sufficient for mass culture of H. talaca to support one of the IPM components using baculovirus. In artificial diets, the NPV was evaluated for its insecticidal activity against H. talaca. The bioassay findings of inoculated H. talaca nucleopolyhedrovirus virus (HytaNPV) at various concentrations showed that it was effective in killing the BIW. Purified polyhedral inclusion bodies (PIBs) were estimated to a concentration of 1 x 10(10) PIBs per ml by mixing with water, and various concentrations of 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 7.5, 10 ml/l were evaluated against BIW. Both laboratory and field studies revealed that HytaNPV is an eco-friendly and ecologically safe agent for controlling BIW. Besides no residue was estimated in made tea after the seventh day of exposure, and it is nontoxic to non-target species.Conclusion It was found that NPV is environmentally beneficial for the control of pests on tea plants and in production of pesticide-free tea. Tea ecosystems can reduce their reliance on conventional insecticides by using HytaNPV as an alternative bio-insecticide.

AB  - Chronic heat stress (CHS) compromised the immunity and spleen immunological function of pigs, which may associate with antioxidant suppression and splenocyte apoptosis and splenic inflammation. Selenium (Se) exhibited antioxidant function and immunomodulatory through selenoprotein. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the protective effect of dietary hydroxyselenomethionine (Selisso (R), SeO) on chronic heat stress (CHS)-induced porcine splenic oxidative stress, apoptosis and inflammation. Growing pigs were raised in the thermoneutral environment (22 +/- 2 degrees C) with the basal diet (BD), or raised in hyperthermal conditions (33 +/- 2 degrees C) with BD supplied with 0.0, 0.2, 0.4 and 0.6 mg Se/kg SeO for 28 d, respectively. The results showed that dietary SeO supplementation recovered the spleen mass and enhanced the splenic antioxidant capacity of CHS growing pigs. Meanwhile, SeO activated the Nrf2/Keap1 signal, downregulated p38, caspase 3 and Bax, inhibited the activation of NF kappa b and STAT3, and enhanced the protein expression level of GPX1, GPX3, GPX4, SELENOS and SELENOF. In summary, SeO supplementation mitigates the CHS-induced splenic oxidative damages, apoptosis and inflammation in pigs, and the processes are associated with the activation of Nrf2/Keap1 signal and the suppression of NF kappa b, p38(MAPK) and STAT signal. It seems that the antioxidant-related selenoproteins (GPXs) and functional selenoproteins (SELENOS and SELENOF) play important roles in the alleviation processes.

AB  - The mechanobiology of the human femoral neck is a focus of research for many reasons including studies that aim to curb age-related bone loss that contributes to a near-exponential rate of hip fractures. Many believe that the femoral neck is often loaded in rather simple bending, which causes net tension stress in the upper (superior) femoral neck and net compression stress in its inferior aspect ("T/C paradigm"). This T/C loading regime lacks in vivo proof. The "C/C paradigm" is a plausible alternative simplified load history that is characterized by a gradient of net compression across the entire femoral neck; action of the gluteus medius and external rotators of the hip are important in this context. It is unclear which paradigm is at play in natural loading due to lack of in vivo bone strain data and deficiencies in understanding mechanisms and manifestations of bone adaptation in tension vs. compression. For these reasons, studies of the femoral neck would benefit from being compared to a 'control bone' that has been proven, by strain data, to be habitually loaded in bending. The artiodactyl (sheep and deer) calcaneus model has been shown to be a very suitable control in this context. However, the application of this control in understanding the load history of the femoral neck has only been attempted in two prior studies, which did not examine the interplay between cortical and trabecular bone, or potential load-sharing influences of tendons and ligaments. Our first goal is to compare fracture risk factors of the femoral neck in both paradigms. Our second goal is to compare and contrast the deer calcaneus to the human femoral neck in terms of fracture risk factors in the T/C paradigm (the C/C paradigm is not applicable in the artiodactyl calcaneus due to its highly constrained loading). Our third goal explores interplay between dorsal/compression and plantar/tension regions of the deer calcaneus and the load-sharing roles of a nearby ligament and tendon, with insights for translation to the femoral neck. These goals were achieved by employing the analytical model of Fox and Keaveny (J. Theoretical Biology 2001, 2003) that estimates fracture risk factors of the femoral neck. This model focuses on biomechanical advantages of the asymmetric distribution of cortical bone in the direction of habitual loading. The cortical thickness asymmetry of the femoral neck (thin superior cortex, thick inferior cortex) reflects the superior-inferior placement of trabecular bone (i.e., "trabecular eccentricity," TE). TE helps the femoral neck adapt to typical stresses and strains through load-sharing between superior and inferior cortices. Our goals were evaluated in the context of TE. Results showed the C/C paradigm has lower risk factors for the superior cortex and for the overall femoral neck, which is clinically relevant. TE analyses of the deer calcaneus revealed important synergism in load-sharing between the plantar/tension cortex and adjacent ligament/tendon, which challenges conventional understanding of how this control bone achieves functional adaptation. Comparisons with the control bone also exposed important deficiencies in current understanding of human femoral neck loading and its potential histocompositional adaptations.

AB  - Fibroblast growth factor 5 (FGF5) plays key roles in promoting the transition from the anagen to catagen during the hair follicle cycle. The sheep serves as an excellent model for studying hair growth and is frequently utilized in various research processes related to human skin diseases. We used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to generate four FGF5-edited Dorper sheep and only low levels of FGF5 were detected in the edited sheep. The density of fine wool in GE sheep was markedly increased, and the proportion of fine wool with a diameter of 14.4-20.0 mu m was significantly higher. The proliferation signal in the skin of gene-edited (GE) sheep was stronger than in wild-type (WT) sheep. FGF5 editing decreased cortisol concentration in the skin, further activated the activity of antioxidant enzymes such as Glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and regulated the expression of Wnt signaling pathways containing Wnt agonists (Rspondins, Rspos) and antagonists (Notum) in hair regeneration. We suggest that FGF5 not only mediates the activation of antioxidant pathways by cortisol, which constitutes a highly coordinated microenvironment in hair follicle cells, but also influences key signals of the Wnt pathway to regulate secondary hair follicle (SHF) development. Overall, our findings here demonstrate that FGF5 plays a significant role in regulating SHF growth in sheep and potentially serves as a molecular marker of fine wool growth in sheep breeding.

AB  - In response to herbivory, plants emit volatile compounds that play important roles in plant defense. Herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) can deter herbivores, recruit natural enemies, and warn other plants of possible herbivore attack. Following HIPV detection, neighboring plants often respond by enhancing their anti-herbivore defenses, but a recent study found that herbivores can manipulate HIPV-interplant communication for their own benefit and suppress defenses in neighboring plants. Herbivores induce species-specific blends of HIPVs and how these different blends affect the specificity of plant defense responses remains unclear. Here we assessed how HIPVs from zucchini plants (Cucurbita pepo) challenged with different herbivore species affect resistance in neighboring plants. Volatile "emitter" plants were damaged by one of three herbivore species: saltmarsh caterpillars (Estigmene acrea), squash bugs (Anasa tristis), or striped cucumber beetles (Acalymma vittatum), or were left as undamaged controls. Neighboring "receiver" plants were exposed to HIPVs or control volatiles and then challenged by the associated herbivore species. As measures of plant resistance, we quantified herbivore feeding damage and defense-related phytohormones in receivers. We found that the three herbivore species induced different HIPV blends from squash plants. HIPVs induced by saltmarsh caterpillars suppressed defenses in receivers, leading to greater herbivory and lower defense induction compared to controls. In contrast, HIPVs induced by cucumber beetles and squash bugs did not affect plant resistance to subsequent herbivory in receivers. Our study shows that herbivore species identity affects volatile-mediated interplant communication in zucchini, revealing a new example of herbivore defense suppression through volatile cues.

AB  - Aluminum (Al) has been classified as a cumulative environmental pollutant that endangers human health. There is increasing evidence to suggest the toxic effects of Al, but the specific action on human brain development remains unclear. Al hydroxide (Al(OH)3), the most common vaccine adjuvant, is the major source of Al and poses risks to the environment and early childhood neurodevelopment. In this study, we explored the neurotoxic effect of 5 mu g/ml or 25 mu g/ml Al(OH)3 for six days on neurogenesis by utilizing human cerebral organoids from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). We found that early Al(OH)3 exposure in organoids caused a reduction in the size, deficits in basal neural progenitor cell (NPC) proliferation, and premature neuron differentiation in a time and dose-dependent manner. Transcriptomes analysis revealed a markedly altered Hippo-YAP1 signaling pathway in Al(OH)3 exposed cerebral organoid, uncovering a novel mechanism for Al(OH)3-induced detrimental to neuro-genesis during human cortical development. We further identified that Al(OH)3 exposure at day 90 mainly decreased the production of outer radial glia-like cells(oRGs) but promoted NPC toward astrocyte differentiation. Taken together, we established a tractable experimental model to facilitate a better understanding of the impact and mechanism of Al(OH)3 exposure on human brain development.

AB  - Heat-resistant fluorescent glass is an ideal color converter for laser lighting applications. However, the application requirements of high-quality laser lighting are difficult to meet due to the insufficient availability of cyan, green and red emission components. Therefore, the development of fluorescent green glass with high thermal stability and high brightness is the key core technology in the fields of laser lighting and display projection. In this research, a series of green-emitting (BaSr)(2)SiO4-PiG samples with high quantum efficiency were successfully prepared by dispersing (BaSr)(2)SiO4 phosphor in a SiO2-B2O3-CaO-Na2O glass matrix. Meanwhile, the thermal stability, photoluminescence properties, and applicability of (BaSr)(2)SiO4-PiG in solid-state laser lighting applications have been monitored for the first time. Surprisingly, the thermal conductivity of (BaSr)(2)SiO4-PiG is 1.87 W m(-1) K-1 at room temperature, which is much higher than that of other multicomponent glasses. Furthermore, under 2.69 W mm(-2) blue laser incident power density excitation, a maximum luminous flux of 196.7 lm is achieved. More importantly, (BaSr)(2)SiO4-PiG exhibits an excellent luminous efficiency of 98 lm W-1 at a laser incident power density of 2.09 W mm(-2). Based on these investigations, (BaSr)(2)SiO4-PiG would be a reliable and efficient candidate as a green color converter for laser lighting and displays.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to study the chemical composition, rumen degradation characteristics, surface attached microbial community and cellulase activity of garlic skin (GS) and Artemisia argyi stalk (AS), in order to explain their feeding value. Four 14-month-old healthy Min Dong male goats with permanent rumen fistula were selected as experimental animals. The rumen degradation characteristics of GS and AS were determined by using the nylon bag method, and the bacterial composition, cellulase activity and their relationship on the surface of the two groups were analyzed with high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene. The results showed that in GS and AS, the effective degradation rate (ED) values of dry matter (DM) were 42.53% and 37.12%, the ED values of crude protein (CP) were 37.19% and 43.38%, the ED values of neutral detergent fiber (NDF) were 36.83% and 36.23%, and the ED values of acid detergent fiber (ADF) were 33.81% and 34.77%. During rumen degradation, the richness and evenness of bacteria attached to the AS surface were higher. At the phylum level, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were always the main rumen bacteria in the two groups. At the genus level, fiber-degrading bacteria such as Prevotella, Treponema, and Ruminococcus showed higher levels in GS (p < 0.05). Compared with GS, the activity of beta-glucosidase (BG enzyme), endo-beta-1,4-glucanase (C1 enzyme), exo-beta-1,4-glucanase (Cx enzyme) and neutral xylanase (NEX enzyme) attached to AS surface showed a higher trend. Correlation analysis showed that the relative abundance of Succinivibrio and Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group was positively correlated with the rumen degradability of nutrients in GS, and the relative abundance of Christensenellaceae R-7_group, Succinivibrio and Ruminococcus was positively correlated with the rumen degradability of nutrients in AS. The conclusion of this study shows that AS has more potential to become ruminant roughage than GS. In addition, this study also revealed the relationship between cellulase activity and bacteria, which provided new information for us to better analyze the effects of GS and AS on the rumen of ruminants and provided an important theoretical basis for the development and utilization of agricultural by-products.

AB  - Kangaroos are an iconic group of Australian fauna. Despite considerable research on kangaroo behaviour, key gaps remain in our understanding of their social organization in the wild. In particular, it remains largely unknown whether kangaroos form long-term social bonds and what factors might prompt individuals to associate or dissociate from one another. Over 6 years, we monitored the social affiliations of individually identified eastern grey kangaroos, Macropus giganteus, in a large wild population. We investigated the short-term and long-term relationships of kangaroos and the extent those relationships varied with age, sex and reproductive state. We found evidence that long-term relationships among eastern grey kangaroos are possible, especially between adult females. Those individuals that were more sociable within years were also more likely to establish affiliations across years. Contrary to previous studies, we observed females actively associating with other mothers in the years in which they had young. These data suggest that the fission-fusion dynamics of eastern grey kangaroo social behaviour allow females to modulate their social position with conspecifics according to their current reproductive state. We highlight the adaptive implications of the formation of long-term bonds and the changes in social behaviour observed in females.(c) 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Scatter-hoarding birds find their caches using spatial memory and have an enlarged hippocampus. Finding a cache site could be achieved using either Recollection (a discrete recalling of previously experienced information) or Familiarity (a feeling of "having encountered something before"). In humans, these two processes can be distinguished using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. ROC curves for olfactory memory in rats have shown the hippocampus is involved in Recollection, but not Familiarity. We test the hypothesis that food-hoarding birds, having a larger hippocampus, primarily use Recollection to find their caches. We validate a novel method of constructing ROC curves in humans and apply this method to cache retrieval by coal tits (Periparus ater). Both humans and birds mainly use Familiarity in finding their caches, with lower contribution of Recollection. This contribution is not significantly different from chance in birds, but a small contribution cannot be ruled out. Memory performance decreases with increasing retention interval in birds. The ecology of food-hoarding Parids makes it plausible that they mainly use Familiarity in the memory for caches. The larger hippocampus could be related to associating cache contents and temporal context with cache locations, rather than Recollection of the spatial information itself.

AB  - Biogas production from anaerobic digestion (AD) of biowastes is restricted by the recalcitrant nature of many substrates, and this may also reduce the fertiliser value of the produced digestate. The degradability of substrates can potentially be enhanced by physico-chemical pre-treatments before AD, and/or the degradation can be increased by a longer digestion time. In this study, we evaluated the effects of electrokinetic (high voltage) and ultrasonication pre-treatments of biowastes in a two-step AD process on nitrogen fertiliser replacement value (NFRV) of digestates obtained from two biogas plants with contrasting hydraulic retention time (HRT) in the primary AD step. The fertiliser value was tested by direct injection to spring barley and surface-banding to winter wheat, and the ammonium N was 15N-labelled to evaluate ammonia losses. The electrokinetic pre-treatment step significantly (p < 0.05) increased the NH4+-N/total N in the digestates before the second AD step but had an insignificant effect on the fertiliser value in winter wheat and spring barley. Ultrasonication pre-treatment had also no significant effect on the fertiliser value. The two-step AD significantly (p < 0.001) increased 15N re-coveries and mineral fertiliser equivalence of labelled ammonium-N in winter wheat and reduced ammonia losses, with a significant effect (p < 0.001) observed in digestates sourced from a shorter HRT biogas reactor. The fertiliser equivalence of labelled ammonium-N in the digestates was 80-88% after injection, indicating relatively low N immobilisation with all the digestates. NFRV in the crops was mainly explained by the NH4+-N/total N ratio, C/N ratio and dry matter content of the digestates. The findings suggest that electrokinetic and ultra-sonication pre-treatments combined with a second AD step have no considerable impact on the fertiliser value of digestates, whereas a second AD step significantly reduced ammonia losses after application by surface-banding in winter wheat.

AB  - Automated pig monitoring is important for smart pig farms; thus, several deep-learning-based pig monitoring techniques have been proposed recently. In applying automated pig monitoring techniques to real pig farms, however, practical issues such as detecting pigs from overexposed regions, caused by strong sunlight through a window, should be considered. Another practical issue in applying deep-learning-based techniques to a specific pig monitoring application is the annotation cost for pig data. In this study, we propose a method for managing these two practical issues. Using annotated data obtained from training images without overexposed regions, we first generated augmented data to reduce the effect of overexposure. Then, we trained YOLOv4 with both the annotated and augmented data and combined the test results from two YOLOv4 models in a bounding box level to further improve the detection accuracy. We propose accuracy metrics for pig detection in a closed pig pen to evaluate the accuracy of the detection without box-level annotation. Our experimental results with 216,000 "unseen" test data from overexposed regions in the same pig pen show that the proposed ensemble method can significantly improve the detection accuracy of the baseline YOLOv4, from 79.93% to 94.33%, with additional execution time.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Phytate is the primary storage form of phosphorus in grain-based feedstuffs, which can reduce the utilization of the phosphorus, calcium, and other minerals. Additionally, non-starch polysaccha-rides can increase digesta viscosity and thus decrease the nutrient digestion and utilization. The current study has evaluated the effects of a next-generation multicarbohydrase and phytase com-plex on the growth performance, apparent total tract digestibility of nutrients, carcass traits, and meat quality in growing-finishing pigs fed a corn-wheat-soybean meal-based diet. The results showed that dietary supplementation of the multicarbohydrase and phytase complex improved the growth performance and nutrient digestibility but had little effect on carcass traits and meat quality in growing-finishing pigs fed a corn-soybean meal-wheat-based diet. These findings indi-cate that the multicarbohydrase and phytase complex could be used as a promising enzymes product to mitigate the negative effects of phytate and non-starch polysaccharides.
   The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of supplementing a corn-wheat-soybean meal-based diet with a multicarbohydrase and phytase complex (MCPC) on growth performance, apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of nutrients, carcass traits, and meat quality in growing-finishing pigs. A total of 300 pigs (Duroc x Large White x Landrace; body weight = 25.3 +/- 0.7 kg) were randomly allotted to three groups with 10 replicates of 10 pigs each. Pigs from three groups were fed positive control (PC) or negative control (NC), without or with MCPC diets, respectively. The MCPC supplied at least 1800, 1244, 6600, and 1000 units of xylanase, beta-glucanase, alpha-arabinofuranosidase, and phytase per kilogram of diet, respectively. The NC diet was the PC diet but reduced in net energy (NE), digestible amino acids (dig. AA), digestible P (dig. P), and Ca by 74 kcal/kg, 7.0%, 0.134, and 0.119 percentage points, respectively. The diets were fed in 4 growth phases based on body weight (BW): phase 1: 25-50 kg, phase 2: 50-75 kg, phase 3: 75-100 kg, and phase 4: 100-135 kg. Compared to the PC, the NC diet decreased (p < 0.05) body weight gain, feed intake, and(or) feed to gain ratio during the growing/finishing phases 1, 2, 3, and 4. It also reduced (p < 0.05) the ATTD of crude protein, crude fat, P, and Ca of pigs. MCPC supplementation improved (p < 0.05) the body weight gain, feed intake, and(or) feed to gain ratio in phases 2, 3, and 4 and the ATTD of crude protein, crude fat, ash, P, and Ca for the NC diet. Additionally, dietary treatment had no effects on carcass traits and meat quality with the exception that the loin eye area in the NC plus MCPC diet was higher (p < 0.05) than the NC diet. In conclusion, the addition of MCPC to a corn-soybean meal-wheat-based diet reduced in energy and nutrients improved the growth performance and nutrient digestibility but had little effect on carcass traits and meat quality in growing-finishing pigs.

AB  - Simple Summary The relationship between animal welfare and housing conditions is still a matter of debate. The present study aimed to evaluate animal welfare of undocked heavy pigs from the same farm, raised in buildings with different ventilation systems, i.e., mechanical and natural, throughout the fattening period (90-160 kg average weight). Ventilation efficiency was evaluated using computational fluid dynamics. Results showed that overall pigs raised in the mechanical ventilated building were in a more positive affective state. Despite that, with hot temperatures, the higher occurrence of pig soiling indicated heat stress and consequent welfare impairment. The higher frequencies of dog sitting behavior also indicated worsening of welfare conditions in the middle-late phases of fattening, likely imputable to the lack of stimuli and boredom in the pigs. The present study aimed to evaluate animal welfare of pigs from the same farm, raised with two ventilation systems. The study involved 60 pens of fattening pigs, raised in two buildings: one naturally ventilated (NV) and the other mechanically ventilated (MV). Pigs were assessed on three observation days: at 40 kg (T1), 100 kg (T2), and 160 kg (T3) of live weight. Animal-based measures were used such as qualitative behavioral analysis (QBA), behavioral measures (BMs), and lesion and health measures (LHMs). Housing conditions (HCs) measured at each observation day were the number of pigs per pen, space allowance, temperature, light, and CO2. The association study was performed using a general linear model and analysis of variance. Ventilation effect was analyzed by performing computational fluid dynamics. Results showed that overall pigs raised in the MV were in a more positive affective state. Despite that, with hot temperatures, the higher occurrence of pig soiling indicated heat stress in pigs and consequent welfare impairment. The higher frequency of pigs showing dog sitting behavior at T2 and T3 suggest welfare worsening in the last phases of fattening. The study concludes that ventilation system influences animal behavior and overall animal welfare, especially during the warmer season.

AB  - Predatory hunting is a complex species-typical behaviour involving different skills, some of which may include learning. This research aims to distinguish between rigid and flexible parts in live-insect hunting behaviour in nine herbivorous and granivorous rodent species, and to find out whether there is room for cognition in this activity. In laboratory experiments, all species studied manifest skilful attacks towards insects in a manner that is typical for specialised predators chasing a fleeing prey. Voles demonstrate a "core" and somewhat primitive scheme of a hunting pattern: approaching a potential victim, biting it, and then seizing and handling. Hamsters display the tendency to start their attacks by actions with paws, but they can achieve success only using teeth as well. Gerbils can successfully use both paws and teeth to start the attack, which brings their hunting behaviour closer to that of specialised rodent predators. We revealed variability in the display of hunting in different species, methods of seizing the prey, and the number of attempts to attack an insect before catching it. We found specific flexible fragments within the "bite-grasp-handle" bouts that can be precursors for adaptive phenotypic variations and include some cognitive attributes. We hypothesise that the divergence and specialisation of predatory behaviour in rodents can be based on the natural fragmentation of the original hunting patterns, that is, on the loss or recombination of particular behavioural elements. We consider a possible link between the fragmentation of hunting behaviour and social learning in different classes of animals and conjecture an intriguing correlation between predatory activity, cognitive skills and personal traits in rodents.

AB  - Integrins are transmembrane receptors that facilitate cell adhesion and cell-extracellular matrix communication. They are involved in the sperm maturation including capacitation and gamete interaction, resulting in successful fertilization. alpha V integrin belongs to the integrin glycoprotein superfamily, and it is indispensable for physiological spermiogenesis and testosterone production. We targeted the gene and protein expression of the alpha V integrin subunit and described its membrane localization in sperm. Firstly, in mouse, we traced alpha V integrin gene expression during spermatogenesis in testicular fraction separated by elutriation, and we detected gene activity in spermatogonia, spermatocytes, and round spermatids. Secondly, we specified alpha V integrin membrane localization in acrosome-intact and acrosome-reacted sperm and compared its pattern between mouse, pig, and human. Using immunodetection and structured illumination microscopy (SIM), the alpha V integrin localization was confined to the plasma membrane covering the acrosomal cap area and also to the inner acrosomal membrane of acrosome-intact sperm of all selected species. During the acrosome reaction, which was induced on capacitated sperm, the alpha V integrin relocated and was detected over the whole sperm head. Knowledge of the integrin pattern in mature sperm prepares the ground for further investigation into the pathologies and related fertility issues in human medicine and veterinary science.

AB  - The utilization of electroporation for delivering CRISPR/Cas9 system components has enabled efficient gene editing in mammalian zygotes, facilitating the development of genome-edited animals. In this study, our research focused on targeting the ACTG1 and MSTN genes in sheep, revealing a threshold phenomenon in electroporation with a voltage tolerance in sheep in vitro fertilization (IVF) zygotes. Various poring voltages near 40 V and pulse durations were examined for electroporating sheep zygotes. The study concluded that stronger electric fields required shorter pulse durations to achieve the optimal conditions for high gene mutation rates and reasonable blastocyst development. This investigation also assessed the quality of Cas9/sgRNA ribonucleoprotein complexes (Cas9 RNPs) and their influence on genome editing efficiency in sheep early embryos. It was highlighted that pre-complexation of Cas9 proteins with single-guide RNA (sgRNA) before electroporation was essential for achieving a high mutation rate. The use of suitable electroporation parameters for sheep IVF zygotes led to significantly high mutation rates and heterozygote ratios. By delivering Cas9 RNPs and single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides (ssODNs) to zygotes through electroporation, targeting the MSTN (Myostatin) gene, a knock-in efficiency of 26% was achieved. The successful generation of MSTN-modified lambs was demonstrated by delivering Cas9 RNPs into IVF zygotes via electroporation.

AB  - In this work, we report a kind of red emitting phosphor-in-glass (PiG) with low sintering temperature which is more conducive to prevent the denaturation of SrAlSiN3: Eu2+ (SASN:Eu2+) caused by the interface reaction between glass and phosphor. In addition, the PiG contains high content (80 wt%) of phosphor powders, which is beneficial to high power density light excitation. Under the 450 nm excitation the PiG sample showed an internal quantum efficiency value of up to 75.6%, which is close to that of the original powder SASN:Eu2+ (similar to 82.3%). When driven by a 1 W blue LD, the luminous efficacy of PiG reached 94 lm/W. The glass powder used as the matrix for PiG is borosilicate glass prepared from LTA zeolite and boron oxide. This glass has good optical properties and chemical stability.

AB  - The present study was aimed at the identification of population stratifying markers from the commercial porcine SNP 60K array and elucidate the genome-wide selective sweeps in the crossbred Landlly pig population. Original genotyping data, generated on Landlly pigs, was merged in various combinations with global suid breeds that were grouped as exotic (global pig breeds excluding Indian and Chinese), Chinese (Chinese pig breeds only), and outgroup pig populations. Post quality control, the genome-wide SNPs were ranked for their stratifying power within each dataset in TRES (using three different criteria) and FIFS programs and top-ranked SNPs (0.5K, 1K, 2K, 3K, and 4K densities) were selected. PCA plots were used to assess the stratification power of low-density panels. Selective sweeps were elucidated in the Landlly population using intra- and inter-population haplotype statistics. Additionally, Tajima's D-statistics were calculated to determine the status of balancing selection in the Landlly population. PCA plots showed 0.5K marker density to effectively stratify Landlly from other pig populations. The A-score in DAPC program revealed the Delta statistic of marker selection to outperform other methods (informativeness and FST methods) and that 3000-marker density was suitable for stratification of Landlly animals from exotic pig populations. The results from selective sweep analysis revealed the Landlly population to be under selection for mammary (NAV2), reproductive efficiency (JMY, SERGEF, and MAP3K20), body conformation (FHIT, WNT2, ASRB, DMGDH, and BHMT), feed efficiency (CSRNP1 and ADRA1A), and immunity (U6, MYO3B, RBMS3, and FAM78B) traits. More than two methods suggested sweeps for immunity and feed efficiency traits, thus giving a strong indication for selection in this direction. The study is the first of its kind in Indian pig breeds with a comparison against global breeds. In conclusion, 500 markers were able to effectively stratify the breeds. Different traits under selective sweeps (natural or artificial selection) can be exploited for further improvement.

AB  - Nitrate nitrogen (nitrate-N) is crucial for the development of tobacco quality. However, how to enhancing soil nitrification in tobacco plantation is still an immediate concern that requires attention. This study aimed to examine the impact of mixed organic manure on soil nitrification in tobacco cultivation regions. We selected an Ultisols field, which was planted with tobacco from Yunnan province, to explore the impact of adding various organic manures (F1-F6: regular organic manures, F7: mixed organic compost which was derived from crop residues), on soil gross N mineralization and nitrification. This study was conducted through a 75-day indoor leaching experiment, with constant temperature (25 degrees C) and humidity (65% of field water capacity). The results showed that F4 significantly (p <.05) enhanced soil N mineralization, and had the highest mineralized-N and potentially releasable mineralized-N (N-0) due to its highest organic carbon (OC) and total-N, which amounted to 422 mg kg(-1) and 705.7 mg kg(-1), respectively. F7 exhibited a significant increase (p <.05) in the rate of soil N mineralization, with the highest firstorder mineralization rate constant (k(1)) of 0.090 d(-1). Moreover, it displayed a substantial increase (p <.05) in nitrate-N content and potentially releasable nitrate-N (N-p), measuring 41.5 mg kg(-1) and 41.3 mg kg(-1), respectively. Furthermore, F7 exhibited the highest first-order nitrification rate constant (k(2)) of 0.076 d(-1). It also demonstrated a considerably higher net nitrate-N/ mineralized-N ratio of 33.5%, which was significantly (p <.05) greater than that of F1-F6 (nitrate-N/mineralized-N ratio: -7.06 to 1.86%). At day 15 and day 45, F7 exhibited the highest nitrate-N concentration and nitrate-N/mineralized-N ratio (28.1 mg kg(-1) and 49.7%) in comparison to F1-F6, which had lower nitrate-N concentrations (ranging from 0.4 to 6.9 mg kg(-1)) and nitrate-N/mineralized-N ratios (ranging from 0.4 to 11.9%). These results indicate that the addition of mixed organic compost significantly enhances soil nitrification compared to regular organic manures. Therefore, it suggests that incorporating mixed organic compost improves soil nitrification in Ultisols.

AB  - Sound contains mechanical signals that can promote physiological and biochemical changes in plants. Insects produce different sounds in the environment, which may be relevant to plant behavior. Thus, we evaluated whether signaling cascades are regulated differently by ecological sounds and whether they trigger molecular responses following those produced by herbivorous insects. Soybean plants were treated with two different sounds: chewing herbivore and forest ambient. The responses were markedly distinct, indicating that sound signals may also trigger specific cascades. Enzymes involved in oxidative metabolism were responsive to both sounds, while salicylic acid (SA) was responsive only to the chewing sound. In contrast, lipoxygenase (LOX) activity and jasmonic acid (JA) did not change. Soybean Kunitz trypsin inhibitor gene (SKTI) and Bowman-Birk (BBI) genes, encoding for protease inhibitors, were induced by chewing sound. Chewing sound-induced high expression of the pathogenesis-related protein (PR1) gene, confirming the activation of SA-dependent cascades. In contrast, the sound treatments promoted modifications in different branches of the phenylpropanoid pathway, highlighting a tendency for increased flavonols for plants under chewing sounds. Accordingly, chewing sounds induced pathogenesis-related protein (PR10/Bet v-1) and gmFLS1 flavonol synthase (FLS1) genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis and flavonols. Finally, our results propose that plants may recognize herbivores by their chewing sound and that different ecological sounds can trigger distinct signaling cascades.

AB  - There is an extensive collection of literature on the taxonomy and phylogenetics of flatfishes (Pleuronectiformes) that extends over two centuries, but consensus on many of their evolutionary relationships remains elusive. Phylogenetic uncertainty stems from highly divergent results derived from morphological and genetic characters, and between various molecular datasets. Deciphering relationships is complicated by rapid diversification early in the Pleuronectiformes tree and an abundance of studies that incompletely and inconsistently sample taxa and genetic markers. We present phylogenies based on a genome-wide dataset (4,434 nuclear markers via exoncapture) and wide taxon sampling (86 species spanning 12 of 16 families) of the largest flatfish suborder (Pleuronectoidei). Nine different subsets of the data and two tree construction approaches (eighteen phylogenies in total) are remarkably consistent with other recent molecular phylogenies, and show strong support for the monophyly of all families included except Pleuronectidae. Analyses resolved a novel phylogenetic hypothesis for the family Rhombosoleidae as being within the Pleuronectoidea rather than the Soleoidea, and failed to support the subfamily Hippoglossinae as a monophyletic group. Our results were corroborated with evidence from previous phylogenetic studies to outline regions of persistent phylogenetic uncertainty and identify groups in need of further phylogenetic inference.

AB  - Food-hoarding birds hide many different food types, and are able to remember which kind of food they have hidden and where it was located. Usually, these different food types, although potentially of different value to the birds, are all palatable and would be consumed when encountered. We report on the responses of coal tits (Periparus ater) to peanut pieces that were made distasteful with quinine. While birds preferred eating normal peanut pieces over quinine-soaked ones, they were still very likely to hoard the distasteful nuts. Birds also did not distinguish between the two nut types when retrieving them after 30 min. These findings point towards the compulsive and automatic nature of hoarding decision, independent of the value of the food being hoarded. We discuss how high hoarding motivation may interact with eating motivation to drive natural patterns of hoarding intensity in the field. Our findings also suggest that the taste of hoarded food items is not part of the representation of the cache memory. We speculate that this may be because tasting the item and caching the item happens in separate locations and are therefore not associated with each other.

AB  - Trace metals and metalloids in aquatic ecosystems may lead to adverse effects on the survival of fish, especially in the sensitive life stages of vulnerable species. It is still unknown whether threatened fish species in the heavily sediment-laden Yellow River are exposed to toxicity risks associated with multiple trace metals. Herein, we analyzed the concentrations of trace metals in aquatic environmental media and fish tissues across the Yellow River mainstream and assessed the level of metal toxicity to threatened fish. Significantly different concentra-tions of trace metals in fish tissues were measured between at least two categories among near-threatened, vulnerable, endangered, and critically endangered fish. No metal showed a higher concentration in demersal fish than in pelagic fish. Substantially low metal toxicity was observed for the gill of Rhinogobio nasutus (near -threatened) in the upper reaches, as well as for the gill and liver of Silurus lanzhouensis (endangered) in the middle reaches. High contents of suspended sediment in water and high metal concentrations in sediment and suspended matter could influence the survival and reproduction of fish, especially those already with threatened status.

AB  - The isotopic signatures of carbon in primary consumer fish species in the Madeira River basin (Western Amazon) follow a pattern, with basal species feeding mainly on C-3 (e.g., vascular plants and phytoplankton). In this study with 196 specimens of 19 fish species and six trophic guilds, significant differences were found between the two main groups of primary consumers (herbivores and detritivores) in the Madeira River basin. The mercury and delta N-15 data indicated that the fish specimens collected in Puruzinho and Cunia Lakes provided greater trophic magnification factors (TMFs) for this metal than those found in the corresponding rivers. In relation to total mercury (0.09-2.07 mu g g(-1)) and methylmercury (0.05-1.91 mu g g(-1)) concentrations, the piscivorous/carnivorous species exceeded the values recommended by the World Health Organization, with a [MeHg:THg] ratio of about 80%. Preventive and educational practices should be adopted to reduce the possible toxic effects of Hg in the riverside population, for whom fish constitutes the main protein source. Also, biomonitoring of the fish species in the Madeira River should be conducted on an ongoing basis to detect possible alterations in mercury concentrations.

Understanding how these compounds are formed by the plant may enable exploration of their biological function and bioactivities. center dot We employed multiple metabolomics techniques, including a workflow to annotate compounds in the absence of standards, to compare alkaloid content across plants and tissues. center dot Different alkaloid structural types were found to have distinct distributions between genotypes, between tissues and within tissues. Alkaloid structural types also showed different isotope labelling enrichments that matched their biosynthetic relationships. center dot The work suggests that mevalonate derived 30-carbon alkaloids are formed in the phloem region before their conversion to 22-carbon alkaloids which accumulate in the epidermis. This sets the stage for further investigation into the biosynthetic pathway.

AB  - Intensively farmed animals such as pigs inevitably experience a certain degree of psychological stress, which leads to a reduction in production performance. Mental health traits are currently difficult to measure, resulting in a gap in understanding their genetic basis. To address this challenge, we propose a computational framework called mental health of animals (MeHA), capable of revealing genes related to animal mental health traits. Using MeHA, we identified 109 candidate genes associated with pig mental health and discovered their intricate connections with critical functions, such as memory, cognition, and neural development, which are essential components of mental health and cognitive performance. Importantly, our findings provide evidence of the potential impact of these genes on economically important traits, including meat quality and piglet survival. This research underscores the importance of genetic studies in enhancing our understanding of animal behavior and cognition, as well as promoting agricultural practices. By applying our approach to study the genetic basis of mental health in pigs as a case, we confirmed that our framework is an effective way to reveal genetic factors affecting animal mental health traits, which contributes to animal welfare and has potential implications for understanding human mental disorders.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) losses via ammonia (NH3) emissions from manure is one of the main environmental burdens resulting from livestock production. Feeding manure to black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) is envisioned as a new circular strategy to recover manure-N, reduce its environmental impact, and upgrade it into insect proteins to be used in animal feed. However, so far, it remained unknown if BSFL could incorporate N from NH3 in manure into the larval body mass. Here, using the stable isotope N-15 in NH3, we demonstrate that at least 13% of pig manure NH3-N can be incorporated into BSFL body mass. Within the larval body, the tracer was found in both insoluble and soluble nitrogen fractions, including proteins. We discuss interventions that could increase the incorporation of NH3-N into larval proteins and with that reduce NH3 emissions from manure. Our results provide the first reliable quantification of NH3-N assimilation in manure-fed larvae and contributes to quantifying the potential of BSFL for manure management, and as a circular protein source.

AB  - The aim of this study was to analyse the association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms within INHA and ACVR2B and litter size in Dazu black goats. In total, twenty-two SNPs were genotyped in 190 individuals by SNaPshot and resequencing. The results showed that three SNPs (SNP_1, SNP_12 and SNP_13 in this study) were detected to have significant additive genetic effect on the recorded goat litter size (p < .05). The SNP_1 (NC_030809.1), a non-synonymous substitution of G for T at chr2-g. 28314990 in the exon 2 of INHA gene (NM_001285606.1), resulted in homozygote 2 (HOM2) contributed 0.25 and heterozygote (HET) contributed 0.12 larger litter than homozygote 1 (HOM1). Meanwhile, SNP_12 (Chr22-g. 11721225 A > T) and SNP_13 (Chr22-g. 11721227 A > C) (NC_030829.1) simultaneously mutated at the first and third position of a triplet AAA (lysine, K) in the exon 4 of ACVR2B gene (XM_018066623.1) had estimated genetic effects of HOM1 (0.00) and HOM2 (0.03) larger than HET (-0.12). In conclusion, one SNPs (chr2-g. 28314990 T > G) within the exon 2 of INHA and two SNPs (Chr22-g. 11721225 A > T and Chr22-g. 11721227 A > C) in the exon 4 of ACVR2B gene were highly recommended as candidate markers of litter size in Dazu black goats. A large-scale association study to assess the impact of these variants on litter size is still necessary.

AB  - Simple Summary Breeders are searching for methods to protect farming animals against diseases caused by pathogenic bacteria. The easiest way to fight bacteria is to use antibiotics. Unfortunately, their abuse results in the presence of bacteria resistant to the most commonly used antibiotics in the environment. The restrictions on the use of antibiotics have forced the search for natural and safe ways to protect animals. It has been shown that the use of probiotics based on lactic acid bacteria may have a positive effect on the growth and use of feed by broilers, on the stabilization of the intestinal microbiota of chickens and pigs, and in the prevention of mastitis in dairy cows. The use of probiotics (live, nonpathogenic microorganisms) and postbiotics (inanimate bacteria, cell components or post-fermentation by-products) reduces the occurrence of pathogens in large-scale farms. Since 2006, the use of growth-promoting antibiotics has been banned throughout the European Union. To meet the expectations of livestock farmers, various studies have been carried out with the use of lactic acid bacteria. Scientists are trying to obtain the antimicrobial effect against the most common pathogens in large-scale farms. Supplementing the diet of broilers with probiotics (live, nonpathogenic microorganisms) stabilized the intestinal microbiota, which improved the results of body weight gain (BWG) and feed intake (FI). The positive effect of probiotics based on lactic acid bacteria has been shown to prevent the occurrence of diarrhea during piglet weaning. The antagonistic activity of postbiotics (inanimate bacteria, cell components, or post-fermentation by-products) from post-culture media after lactobacilli cultures has been proven on Staphylococcus aureus-the pathogen most often responsible for causing mastitis among dairy cows. The article aims to present the latest research examining the antagonistic effect of lactic acid bacteria on the most common pathogens in broilers, piglets, pigs, and cow farms.

AB  - The benchmark dose (BMD) approach constitutes the most effective and pragmatic strategy for the derivation of a point of departure (PoD) for comparative potency analysis, risk assessment, and regulatory decision-making. There is considerable controversy regarding the most appropriate benchmark response (BMR) for genotoxicity endpoints. This work employed the Slob (2017) Effect Size (ES) theory to define robust BMR values for the in vivo transgenic rodent (TGR) and Pig-a mutagenicity endpoints. An extensive database of dose-response data was prepared and curated; BMD analyses were used to determine endpoint-specific maxima (i.e., parameter c) and within-group variance (i.e., var). Detailed analyses investigated the dependence of var on experimental factors such as tissue, administration route, treatment duration, and post-exposure tissue sampling time. The overall lack of influence of these experimental factors on var permitted the determination of typical values for the endpoints investigated. Typical var for the TGR endpoint is 0.19; the value for the Pig-a endpoint is 0.29. Endpoint-specific var values were used to calculate endpoint-specific BMR values; the values are 47% for TGR and 60% for Pig-a. Endpoint-specific BMR values were also calculated using the trimmed distribution of study-specific standard deviation (SD) values for concurrent controls. Those analyses yielded endpoint-specific BMR values for the TGR and Pig-a endpoints of 33% and 58%, respectively. Considering the results obtained, and the in vivo genetic toxicity BMR values noted in the literature, we recommend a BMR of 50% for in vivo mutagenicity endpoints. The value can be employed to interpret mutagenicity dose-response data in a risk assessment context.

AB  - This study evaluated the effects of serum (egpS) and follicular fluid (egpFF) from estrus guinea pigs as in vitro maturation (IVM) supplements for natural cycle guinea pig oocytes. Two experiments were conducted: the first assessed three IVM media, a commercial medium (CMOM) and two homemade media (HMOM-P and HMOM-S), for oocyte in vitro maturation using 615 bovine oocytes, while the second evaluated the incorporation of 5%, 10%, and 20% egpFF or egpS into IVM media for 1744 guinea pig oocytes. Initially, we optimized the IVM base medium using bovine oocytes to determine the most suitable culture conditions. The results obtained from these experiments served as a critical foundation for subsequent supplementation trials conducted with guinea pig oocytes. The oocytes were cultured in 70 mu L drops under controlled atmospheric conditions, and maturation rates were assessed based on cumulus cell expansion and nuclear progression. The HMOM-S medium significantly enhanced cumulus cell expansion (72.5 +/- 2.88%) compared with the CMOM medium (57.7 +/- 5.33%; p < 0.05). Supplementation with egpFF at 5% (68.8 +/- 6.22%), 10% (76.3 +/- 5.39%), and 20% (80.9 +/- 6.22%) significantly improved both cumulus cell expansion and nuclear progression in high-quality oocytes (types A and B), compared to the control group (43.3 +/- 4.82%). Conversely, supplementation with egpS did not have a significant effect on cumulus cell expansion (p > 0.05); however, it notably improved nuclear maturation in low-quality oocytes (type C) at concentrations of 10% and 20% (p < 0.05). This resulted in an overall improvement in maturation outcomes, particularly for oocytes with compromised initial quality. These findings demonstrated that the IVM of guinea pig oocytes using HMOM-S medium was significantly enhanced by the presence of egpFF, whereas egpS supplementation exhibited a less pronounced effect on IVM outcomes.

AB  - Predatory social wasps are well studied in several aspects; however, foraging behaviour, especially that which takes place away from the nest at often unpredictable locations, or specialized behaviours to find and subdue prey are not well understood. In the Brazilian tropical savanna, the Polistinae wasp Brachygastra lecheguana is specialized in preying on some endophytic weevil larvae which develops inside floral buds. We hypothesized that these wasps utilize a combination of different mechanisms such as visual, chemical (odour) and possible tactile cues to find the weevil larvae. Using a combination of experimental manipulations (visual; chemical; visual/chemical) we tested the wasp???s ability to detect the endophytic larvae in the field. Additionally, we checked the ability of this wasp to detect vibrations produced by the weevils inside the buds. Our results suggest that the B. lecheguana wasp utilizes a sequence of eco-physiological mechanisms to find the endophytic larva inside floral buds: sight, smell, and perhaps touch. The use of multiple cues by this wasp guarantees such a high rate of predation on endophytic beetles that the wasp may have positive implications (reduction in weevils??? infestation) for the future of the host plant???s reproduction.

AB  - Predation rates, reproduction, development, and life table parameters of Hippodamia variegata (Goeze) and Adalia fasciatopunctata revelieri (Mulstant) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) on black bean aphid, Aphis fabae (Scopoli) (Hemiptera: Aphididae), which causes significant losses in broad bean, Vicia faba (L.) (Fabaceae) plants, were determined according to the age-stage, two-sex life table. The experiments were carried out in a climate room with a temperature of 25 +/- 1 degrees C, 60 +/- 5% RH, and 16: 8 h light: dark conditions. The life table parameters of the predators were as follows; H. variegata and A. fasciatopunctata revelieri the intrinsic rate of increase (r) 0.18 +/- 0.09 day-1 and 0.15 +/- 0.01 day-1, the finite rate of increase (lambda) 1.20 +/- 0.01 day-1 and 1.16 +/- 0.02 day-1, the net reproduction rate (R0) 210.83 +/- 53.05 and 66.54 +/- 23.06 individuals, mean generation time (T) 29.33 +/- 0.54 and 27.92 +/- 1.55 days respectively. The net predation rate (C0) of H. variegata and A. fasciatopunctata revelieri on A. fabae were 1075.14 +/- 95.28 and 436.23 +/- 80.19 aphids respectively. As a result of the evaluation of the reproduction, development, life table, predation rates, and predation parameters of the predators, the effectiveness of both predators on pests was proved and it was revealed that H. variegata was a more effective predator on A. fabae than A. fasciatopunctata revelieri.
