AB  - Fires in grassy ecosystems consume vegetation and initiate high-quality regrowth, which results in pyric herbivory when mammalian grazers concentrate feeding in recent burns. For environmentally transmitted parasites with transmission mechanisms linked to vegetation structure, fire should exert direct effects on parasites, as well as indirect effects resulting from subsequent enhanced herbivory, which can affect parasite input and exposure to environmental conditions.We combined an experimental manipulation with observational data in the Serengeti National Park to investigate the direct and indirect effects of fire on parasites. We assessed the direct effects of fire by measuring changes in parasitic nematode larvae in the grass layer before and after fire on paired experimental burned and control plots. To investigate indirect effects linked to pyric herbivory, we sampled herbivore dung, grass biomass, ground temperature and larval densities every month for 5 months following fire in seven pairs of burned and unburned monitoring plots. Finally, to assess if fire-driven changes to larval densities affected host infection burdens, we collected faecal samples from a key host, Grant's gazelle (Nanger granti), each month for 5 months to estimate within-host parasite burdens.Fire killed all larvae and increased grazer dung inputs by 40% for 2 months following fire. Dung inputs after fire led to larval parasite recolonization of burned patches, but intense herbivory kept grass short and larval densities were associated with changes in ground temperature linked to grass biomass and ambient temperature. Grant's gazelles had lower parasite burdens when sampled in areas with higher compared to lower burned area fraction.Fire and pyric herbivory change the densities of larval parasites in the environment and divide the landscape into burned and unburned regions with distinct infection risks for local herbivores.The indirect effects quantified here represent a novel finding with major implications for all grazing systems impacted by fire.
   Mioto katika mifumo ikolojia yenye nyasi nyingi humaliza mimea na kuanzisha uotaji upya wa malisho yenye virutubisho jambo ambalo husababisha ulaji mwingi wa nyasi baada ya moto wakati mamalia walao nyasi wanapokusanyika katika sehemu zilizoungua hivi karibuni. Kwa vimelea vinavyosambazwa katika mazingira vilivyo na njia za uambukizaji zinazohusishwa na muundo wa uotaji wa mimea, moto unapaswa kuwa na athari za moja kwa moja kwa vimelea, pamoja na athari zisizo za moja kwa moja zinazotokana na wanyama kula mimea, ambapo inaweza kuathiri uingizaji na mfichuo wa vimelea katika mazingira.Tuliunganisha majaribio na takwimu za uchunguzi katika Hifadhi ya Taifa ya Serengeti ili kuchunguza athari za moja kwa moja na zisizo za moja kwa moja za moto kwa vimelea. Tulitathmini athari za moja kwa moja za moto kwa kupima mabadiliko ya idadi ya mabuu ya vimelea vya minyoo kwenye safu ya nyasi kabla na baada ya moto katika jozi ya viwanja vilivyochomwa na visivyochomwa. Ili kuchunguza athari zisizo za moja kwa moja zinazohusishwa na ulaji wa mimea baada ya moto, tulichukua sampuli za vinyesi vya wanyama walao nyasi, uzito wa nyasi, jotoridi la ardhini, na msongamano wa mabuu ya vimelea kila mwezi kwa muda wa miezi mitano kufuatia moto katika jozi saba za maeneo ya ufuatiliaji yaliyoungua na ambayo hayajachomwa. Hatimaye, ili kutathmini kama mabadiliko yanayotokana na moto kwa msongamano wa mabuu ya vimelea yaliathiri kiwango cha maambukizi kwa wanyama, tulikusanya sampuli za vinyesi kutoka kwa Swala Granti (Nanger granti), kila mwezi kwa miezi mitano ili kukadiria kiwango cha vimelea ndani ya mnyama.Moto uliua mabuu yote ya vimelea na kuongeza kiwango cha vinyesi vya wanyama kwa 40% kwa muda wa miezi miwili baada ya moto. Ongezeko la vinyesi baada ya moto lilisababisha kurudi upya kwa mabuu ya vimelea kwenye sehemu zilizoungua, lakini ulaji wa nyasi kwa wingi ulipelekea nyasi kuwa fupi na msongamano wa mabuu ulihusishwa na mabadiliko ya jotoridi la ardhini yanayohusishwa na kiwango cha nyasi na halijoto iliyopo. Swala Granti walikuwa na kiwango cha chini cha vimelea walipochukuliwa sampuli katika maeneo yaliyoungua sana ukilinganisha na maeneo yaliyoungua kidogo.Moto na ulaji wa nyasi baada ya moto hubadilisha msongamano wa mabuu ya vimelea katika mazingira na kugawanya mandhari katika maeneo yaliyochomwa moto na yasiyochomwa moto yenye hatari tofauti za maambukizi kwa wanyama walao nyasi wanaopatikana katika eneo husika.Athari zisizo za moja kwa moja zilizohesabiwa hapa zinawakilisha matokeo mapya yenye athari kubwa kwa mifumo yote ya malisho iliyoathiriwa na moto.
   Previous work on fire effects on parasites have focused on the direct impact of fire on parasite survival. Here, we show that concentrated herbivory following fire can lengthen the effects of fire on free-living parasites, and create divided landscapes with burned and unburned areas that have distinct infection risks.image

AB  - Unveiling the intricate relationships between animal movement ecology, feeding behavior, and internal energy budgeting is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of ecosystem functioning, especially on coral reefs under significant anthropogenic stress. Here, herbivorous fishes play a vital role as mediators between algae growth and coral recruitment. Our research examines the feeding preferences, bite rates, inter-bite distances, and foraging energy expenditure of the Brown surgeonfish (Acanthurus nigrofuscus) and the Yellowtail tang (Zebrasoma xanthurum) within the fish community on a Red Sea coral reef. To this end, we used advanced methods such as remote underwater stereo-video, AI-driven object recognition, species classification, and 3D tracking. Despite their comparatively low biomass, the two surgeonfish species significantly influence grazing pressure on the studied coral reef. A. nigrofuscus exhibits specialized feeding preferences and Z. xanthurum a more generalist approach, highlighting niche differentiation and their importance in maintaining reef ecosystem balance. Despite these differences in their foraging strategies, on a population level, both species achieve a similar level of energy efficiency. This study highlights the transformative potential of cutting-edge technologies in revealing the functional feeding traits and energy utilization of keystone species. It facilitates the detailed mapping of energy seascapes, guiding targeted conservation efforts to enhance ecosystem health and biodiversity.

AB  - Overfishing of large herbivorous fishes is connected to the rise of algal-dominated states on coral reefs. The recovery of their populations is challenging, and future herbivore assemblages may be composed of smaller fish. With fisheries now targeting these smaller-sized herbivore populations, coral reef benthic communities may face unknown outcomes. We performed caging experiments in algal-dominated reefs of Northeastern Brazil, that have been depleted of large herbivorous fishes, to appraise the effects of removing small herbivores on benthic community composition and succession. Full cages simulated herbivore removal, and partial cages and open plots functioned as controls. In total, 36 experimental plots were monitored for 1 yr, accounting for the influence of seasonal changes in local conditions of temperature and turbidity. Overall macroalgal cover did not change between experimental treatments, but filamentous algae increased 5-fold inside full cages by the end of the experiment, surpassing articulated coralline forms as the dominant group. Higher temperatures during the dry season promoted filamentous algae when the top-down control of the herbivores was removed, while a reverse pattern was observed when fishes were allowed to feed inside plots. Small herbivores accelerated benthic succession, facilitating the dominance of articulated coralline algae as the climax community. Our findings oppose previous studies performed at sites with high abundances of large-bodied fishes, where herbivory decreased overall macroalgal cover, promoted filamentous and crustose coralline algae and delayed community succession. The further depletion of smaller-bodied herbivores can trigger shifts in benthic community dynamics that interact with water temperature, which may have implications for reef resilience in an ocean-warming scenario.

AB  - The pudu deer Pudu puda is a near-threatened mammal endemic to southern Chile and Argentina. Since this species inhabits mostly human-modified landscapes, addressing the factors that influence habitat use in such environments could aid in their conservation. We evaluated the presence of pudu deer during the spring-summer of 2020-2021 and 2021-2022 at two coastal range sites in the province of Osorno (Huellelhue Community, HC, and Los Riscos, RI) using camera traps. We applied logistic regression (LR) analysis to identify the predictor variables related to vegetation type, human perturbation, and native forest fragmentation that are correlated with the presence or absence of pudu deer as a binary response variable. In HC site, LR analysis identified the most likely top models including the fragmentation variable of the contiguity of patches (AIC(c) = 22.73, Delta(i) = 0.00 and w(i) = 0.77) with a negative effect (beta = -8.573, P < 0.05). In RI locality the top model included the human perturbation variable of the distance to village (AIC(c) = 23.37, Delta(i) = 0.00 and w(i) = 0.71) with a positive effect (beta = 1.805, P < 0.05). Both models accounted for a medium amount of the total variance in the response variable (Nagelkerke R-2 = 51-52%). Results suggest that habitat use by pudu deer is affected by human perturbation and native forest fragmentation. Our findings indicate that maintaining a more continuous native forest or areas of native forest located far from human settlements could represent an important strategy for improving the long-term survival of the species.

AB  - Grazing by livestock can have negative effects on bird biodiversity by reducing habitat quality, trampling nests, and facilitating the presence of domestic predators. For the high Andean wetlands of Arequipa, an optimal load is considered to be 1.35 alpacas/ha and 0. llamas/ha, but it is unknown what effect this load could have on birds that nest in wetlands. In this study we evaluated the effect of livestock load of llamas and alpacas on the nesting of birds in nine high Andean wetlands in Arequipa, Peru. In December 2021, we implemented an experiment with 900 artificial nests (100 nests per site), exposed for 14 days in wetlands subject to different livestock loads. We determined that livestock load had a significant effect on artificial nests, increasing nest trampling. In addition, 32.8% of nests were removed by human activity. Given that livestock loads constitute a threat to birds that nest in wetlands, we recommend regulating livestock loads, as well as using rotational grazing systems, and excluding livestock during avian reproductive seasons.

AB  - Monitoring large herbivores across their core range has been readily accomplished using aerial surveys and traditional distance sampling. But for peripheral populations, where individuals may occur in patchy, low-density populations, precise estimation of population size and trend remains logistically and statistically challenging. For moose (Alces alces) along their southern range margin in northern New York, USA, we sought robust estimates of moose distribution, abundance, and population trend (2016-2019) using a combination of aerial surveys (line transect distance-sampling), repeated surveys in areas where moose were known to occur to boost the number of detections, and density surface modeling (DSM) with spatial covariates. We achieved a precise estimate of density (95% CI = 0.00-0.29 moose/km(2)) for this small population (656 moose, 95% CI = 501-859), which was patchily distributed across a large and heavily forested region (the 24,280-km(2) Adirondack Park). Local moose abundance was positively related to active timber management, elevation, and snow cover, and negatively related to large bodies of water. As expected, moose abundance in this peripheral population was low relative to its core range in other northern forest states. Yet, in areas where abundance was greatest, moose densities in New York approached those where epizootics of winter tick (Dermacentor albipictus) have been reported, underscoring the need for effective and efficient monitoring. By incorporating autocorrelation in observations and landscape covariates, DSM provided spatially explicit estimates of moose density with greater precision and no additional field effort over traditional distance sampling. Combined with repeated surveys of areas with known moose occurrence to achieve viable sample sizes, DSM is a useful tool for effectively monitoring low density and patchy populations.

AB  - Simple Summary Natural habitats are essential providers of biological conservation services. The crucial role of the Gobi Desert, a dominant landscape of desert-oasis ecosystems in natural predator conservation is poorly understood, especially in southern Xinjiang, China's Tarim Basin, where the Gobi Desert is directly adjacent to farmland and characterized by extremely sparse vegetation and more severe climatic conditions. In this context, we investigated the floral composition of the Gobi Desert and gauged the identity, relative abundance, and temporal dynamics of predatory insects associated with the prevailing plant species. We also explored whether certain plant traits and herbivore abundance are related to either natural enemy identity or relative abundance. Our results demonstrate that perennial flowering plants, such as Apocynum pictum (Apocynaceae), Phragmites communis (Poaceae), Karelinia caspia (Asteraceae), and Tamarix ramosissima (Tamaricaceae), are the dominant species of vegetation community in the Gobi Desert, and could sustain diversified arthropod predators, i.e., ladybeetles, spiders, and other natural enemies. This work not only informs sustainable pest management initiatives, but also shows how non-crop habitats at the periphery of agricultural fields underpin ecological resilience under adverse climatic conditions. Natural habitats play crucial roles in biodiversity conservation and shape the delivery of ecosystem services in farming landscapes. By providing diverse resources to foraging natural enemies, they can equally enhance biological pest control. In this study, we described the plant community and foliage-dwelling invertebrate predators within non-crop habitats of the Gobi Desert oases in southern Xinjiang, China. We assessed whether plant-related variables (i.e., species identity, flowering status) and herbivore abundance affect natural enemy identity and abundance. A total of 18 plant species belonging to 18 genera and 10 families were commonly encountered, with Apocynum pictum (Apocynaceae), Phragmites communis (Poaceae), Karelinia caspia (Asteraceae), and Tamarix ramosissima (Tamaricaceae) as the dominant species. Certain plant species (P. communis) primarily provide shelter, while others offer (floral, non-floral) food resources or alternative prey. Predatory ladybeetles and spiders were routinely associated with these plants and foraged extensively within adjacent field crops. Plant traits and herbivore abundance explained up to 44% (3%-44%) variation in natural enemy community and exhibited consistent, year-round effects. Among all plant species, A. pictum consistently had a significantly higher abundance of resident natural enemies, except for August 2019. Our study underlines how perennial flowering plants, such as A. pictum, are essential to sustain natural enemy communities and related ecosystem services in arid settings. This work not only informs sustainable pest management initiatives but also shows how non-crop habitats at the periphery of agricultural fields underpin ecological resilience under adverse climatic conditions.

TI  - The distribution and conservation status of Tapirus terrestris in the South American Atlantic Forest
T2  - NEOTROPICAL BIOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
LA  - English
AB  - Tapirus terrestris is the largest South American land mammal, with an extensive historical distribution and capable of occupying diverse habitats, and yet its populations have declined across its range. In order to provide baseline data on the conservation status of tapirs in the Atlantic Forest, we conducted a long-term study in one landscape, visited 93 forests, and received 217 expert reports over the 15-year study. We estimate that 2,665-15,992 tapirs remain in 48 confirmed populations, occupying 26,654 km(2) of forest or 1.78% of its original range in the biome. Historically, hunting and deforestation were the main causes of decline, but today population isolation is the principal long-term threat. Vortex models indicate that 31.3-68.8% and 70.8-93.8% of the populations are demographically and genetically non-viable over the next 100 years, respectively, and that only 3-14 populations are viable when considering both variables. Habitat use data indicate that tapirs are adaptable to disturbed and secondary forests and will use diverse tree plantations and agricultural lands but hunting and highways keep populations isolated. Reserve staff report tapirs as common/abundant at 62.2% of the sites, and populations as stable and growing in 60% and 36% of the sites, respectively, and there is ample habitat in the biome for a population expansion, but overcoming the causes of isolation will be necessary for this to occur. Lack of adequate funding for protecting reserves is a chronic threat throughout the biome, especially in federal and state/provincial reserves, and increased funding will be necessary to implement effective conservation plans.

AB  - Large-herbivore grazing has been shown to substantially alter tundra soil and vegetation properties as well as carbon fluxes, yet observational evidence to quantify the impact of herbivore introduction into Arctic permafrost ecosystems remains sparse. In this study we investigated growing-season CO2 and CH4 fluxes with flux chambers on a former wet tussock tundra inside Pleistocene Park, a landscape experiment in northeast Siberia with a 22-year history of grazing. Reference data for an undisturbed system were collected on a nearby ungrazed tussock tundra. Linked to a reduction in soil moisture, topsoil temperatures at the grazed site reacted 1 order of magnitude faster to changes in air temperatures compared to the ungrazed site and were significantly higher, and the difference strongly decreased with depth. Overall, both GPP (gross primary productivity, i.e., CO2 uptake by photosynthesis) and Reco (ecosystem respiration, i.e., CO2 release from the ecosystem) were significantly higher at the grazed site with notable variations across plots at each site. The increases in CO2 component fluxes largely compensated for each other, leaving NEE (net ecosystem exchange) similar across grazed and ungrazed sites for the observation period. Soil moisture and CH4 fluxes at the grazed site decreased over the observation period, while in contrast the constantly waterlogged soils at the ungrazed site kept CH4 fluxes at significantly higher levels. Our results indicate that grazing of large herbivores may promote topsoil warming and drying, in this way effectively accelerating CO2 turnover while decreasing methane emissions in the summer months of peak ecosystem activity. Since we lack quantitative information on the pre-treatment status of the grazed ecosystem, however, these findings need to be considered qualitative trends for the peak growing season, and absolute differences between treatments are subject to elevated uncertainty. Moreover, our experiment did not include autumn and winter fluxes, and thus no inferences can be made for the annual NEE and CH4 budgets in tundra ecosystems.

AB  - When organisms select habitat, they may lessen the environmental variance they experience relative to their surroundings. Such discrepancies in variance could reveal organisms' habitat preferences and perceptual ranges, particularly when examined across spatial and temporal scales. To test whether habitat variance might provide such understanding, we applied geostatistics to the variance in availability and use of habitat by GPS-collared adult female white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in central Ontario, Canada. First, to quantify use and availability, we measured vegetation at the locations used by deer during May-June 2022, as well as in the general environment, then applied principal components analysis (PCA) to capture the major gradients in vegetation conditions. Second, to identify habitat selection, we tested for differences between use and availability in both the means and variance of vegetation characteristics. Finally, to depict how variance changed across scales, we constructed spatial and temporal variograms. Based on the first two axes of the PCA, we found that deer selected greater abundance in forage and lower variation in canopy closure. Across space, the selection for reduced variance in canopy appeared largely independent of scale (50-1000 m), implying that the perception capacity of deer may exceed this range. Across time, deer exhibited rising variance in forage abundance at short lags (4-12 h), resembling the periods (6-10 h) when movements were more linear. Deer thus selected for lower variance of habitat without selecting for disproportionate levels of habitat. We propose that selection for diminished variance is a fundamental property of habitat selection, whose scale-dependence might be uncovered with geostatistics.

AB  - Introduced organisms are seen as one of the greatest threats to resource sustainability worldwide, and aquatic macroinvertebrates are regarded as good indicators of the health of water resources. To explore these two perspectives, the responses of macroinvertebrate faunas to native and introduced fishes in three headwater tributaries of the Keiskamma River system, South Africa, were examined by comparing potential indicator communities in reaches considered to be fishless, reaches invaded by introduced salmonid species, and reaches containing native fishes. Patterns in the macroinvertebrate faunal assemblage data were driven strongly by season and flow rate, and less strongly by the presence of insectivorous fishes and biotope availability, a finding in parallel with several similar studies from the region. This affirms that aquatic macroinvertebrate faunas are responsive indicators of both environmental and biotic factors and leaves room for further studies to resolve the effects of non-native fish in the Keiskamma River system and other similar systems from South Africa.

AB  - The functioning of ecosystems critically depends on biodiversity. However, the effects of herbivore diversity on plant damage caused by herbivore feeding remain underexplored. In this study, we tested the prediction that relative losses of foliage to defoliating insects increase with leaf damage diversity (LDD), and we also explored the mechanisms underlying the observed LDD patterns. We measured insect herbivory in 501 individuals of three deciduous woody species (Betula pubescens, Salix phylicifolia, and Vaccinium uliginosum) across 38 localities in north-western Russia, collected 8844 leaves damaged by defoliating insects, classifying the 21,073 feeding events observed in these leaves into 29 damage types. Overall, LDD significantly decreased with increasing latitude but showed no variation along elevation or pollution gradients. Herbivory weakly but significantly increased with increasing LDD, and a strong positive correlation between the rarefied number of leaf damage types and their evenness provided evidence for the complementarity effect underlying this herbivory increase, indicating that insects producing different leaf damage types differ in their resource use.

AB  - Bud banks are considered a crucial factor in regulating the species composition of grassland communities and maintaining the ecological function of alpine grasslands. However, few studies have paid attention to the dynamic changes of bud banks from undisturbed to severely degraded alpine meadows. Therefore, this study examined the correlations between plant diversity and bud bank traits at different stages of alpine meadows degradation. Grass biomasses and plant diversity were found to be highest in moderately degraded meadows, and sedge biomasses were highest in lightly degraded meadows. Lack of disturbance and moderate disturbance by herbivores increased the bud bank density of alpine meadows. Consistent with the changes in bud bank density, bud bank diversity was highest in undisturbed meadows. The structural equation model indicated that the densities of rhizome and the densities and diversities of tiller buds play crucial roles in facilitating the greater diversity of the plant community. Our findings suggest that the diversities and densities of rhizome and tiller buds in the degradation stages are synchronized with changes in plant diversity, and in the regenerative ability of bud banks, which largely determine the outcome of restoration in degraded meadows. These findings could provide a frame of reference for effectively restoring degraded alpine regions by regenerating bud banks. The potential driving force and renewal capacity of bud banks should be taken into account in restoring the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau's degraded meadow.

AB  - The effects of anthropogenic climate change on biodiversity have been recognized on every continent, ocean, and across different taxonomic groups. Here, we study the range dynamics and demography of a cosmopolitan species: the deer mouse, Peromyscus maniculatus. We generated a multilocus SNP dataset using the ddRADseq protocol for 218 individuals across the geographic range within three western North American lineages of this species group. We evaluated population structure using several methods and explored the correlation between geographic and genetic distances. We modeled the demographic history using a site frequency spectrum approach and used a machine learning algorithm to infer current and past (Last Glacial Maximum; LGM) environmental suitability. Lastly, we explored the origin of population expansion for the identified lineages. The genome-wide SNP dataset was able to identify-three regionally distinct groups- 1) P. m. gambelii (southern California); 2) P. keeni (Pacific Northwest); 3) P. m. sonoriensis (a broad population spanning the Pacific Northwest through central California and across the Rocky Mountains into the Great Plains). Demographic analysis indicated the splits between the three populations occurred within the last 500 thousand years, with one very recent (late Holocene) split. Ecological niche models for each of these lineages predicted suitable environment present throughout their known ranges for current conditions, and a severe reduction of northern habitat in the past. The deer mouse has responded to past climate changes by expanding its range during interglacial periods and contracting its range during glacial periods leading to strong population differentiation. But lower magnitude climate change or other processes within the Holocene interglacial period led to population differentiation as well, which is likely still ongoing today given the substantial anthropogenic climate change and other landscape transformations caused by humans during the Anthropocene. By understanding the historical processes that led to the contemporary geographic distribution of biodiversity, we can determine the relative importance of different factors that shape biodiversity, now and into the future.

AB  - Research Highlight: Ferraro, K. M., Welker, L., Ward, E. B., Schmitz, O. J., & Bradford, M. A. (2023). Plant mycorrhizal associations mediate the zoogeochemical effects of calving subsidies by a forest ungulate. Journal of Animal Ecology, . Animals play large roles in ecosystem elemental cycling but predicting effects in diverse contexts remains a substantial challenge. Fundamental to progress is (1) identifying mechanisms by which animals impact nutrient distribution and cycling, and (2) disentangling how environmental context mediates the operation of alternative mechanisms. In an elegant field experiment, Ferraro et al. (2023) provide the first detailed exploration of the impact of nutrient inputs from mammalian parturition on soil functioning and the stoichiometry of plant tissues. The authors find that nitrogen from experimental additions of ungulate parturition material (natal fluids) is rapidly incorporated into microsite soil organic pools and plant tissues. They also find that soil processes (soil microbial biomass, rates of carbon mineralization, nitrogen mineralization and nitrification) and the nitrogen content of plant tissues above- and belowground are increased by addition of parturition material. Notably, the authors identify that increases in some soil processes and plant tissue nitrogen are weaker in microsites dominated by ericoid mycorrhizal plants than those dominated by ectomycorrhizal plants. These findings demonstrate that parturition depositions, a ubiquitous but overlooked mechanism of mammalian impacts on ecosystems, impact ecosystem processes and plant tissue stoichiometry. Furthermore, plant-fungal associations are a predictive axis of context dependency mediating zoogeochemical effects at fine scales. Ferraro et al.'s (2023) novel approach simultaneously advances mechanistic understanding of animal-ecosystem interactions at fine scales and facilitates prediction of ungulate effects on nutrient availability at landscape extents.

AB  - It is indisputable that much of Australias modern biodiversity decline was triggered by European settlement. However, the driver(s) of pre-European extinctions and extirpations are more challenging to identify, particularly on islands where animals are faced with the additional pressures imposed by isolation. Kangaroo Island, South Australia, has been identified as a potential haven for the reintroduction of endangered animals, but the genetic relationship between reintroduction candidates on the mainland and their extinct relatives on Kangaroo Island is poorly understood. Here, we present a late Pleistocene to mid-Holocene genetic record from Kangaroo Island based on bulk bone metabarcoding of two thousand bone fragments excavated from Kelly Hill Cave. We detect 33 species of bird, reptile, fish and mammal and report additional intra-specific genetic diversity in Kangaroo Islands now extinct population of spotted-tailed quoll. Furthermore, we provide genetic evidence that the Eastern grey kangaroo formerly inhabited Kangaroo Island. Taken together, these data establish a more complete baseline of local biodiversity against which reintroduction programmes and bushfire recovery measures can be evaluated, which is more important than ever in light of the recent fires that devastated much of Kangaroo Islands flora and fauna. 0 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Semiarid rangelands throughout the western Great Plains support livestock production and many other ecosystem services. The degree to which adaptive multi-paddock (AMP) grazing management approaches can help achieve desired ecosystem services remains unclear. At the Central Plains Experimental Range in northeastern Colorado, a management-science partnership with a diverse stakeholder group is comparing collaborative adaptive rangeland management (CARM), designed to incorporate AMP principles, to traditional rangeland management (TRM), consisting of season-long grazing during the growing season. Each treatment was implemented on a set of 10, 130-ha pastures paired by soils, topography, and plant communities to evaluate how CARM affects vegetation (composition and production), livestock production (steer weight gain), and wildlife habitat (vegetation structure for grassland birds). For the first 5 years of the experiment, CARM cattle were managed as a single herd using AMP grazing with planned year-long rest in 20% of the pastures. Relative to TRM, CARM enhanced heterogeneity in vegetation structure across the landscape, benefiting two grassland bird species. However, this came at the cost of 12%-16% lower steer weight gains in CARM versus TRM and declining populations of a third bird species of conservation concern in both treatments. Here we discuss how increased understanding of ecological and social processes during the experiment's first 5 years led to changes in the CARM treatment and management objectives during the next 5 years. We also discuss how innovations in remote sensing, environmental sensors, ecosystem modeling, social learning, and economic analyses are being integrated into and supported by the CARM experiment.
   We compare typical season-long grazing management (traditional rangeland management [TRM]) with collaborative adaptive rangeland management (CARM). The CARM treatment was co-produced with a diverse group of stakeholders and employed adaptive rotational grazing. Relative to TRM, CARM enhanced vegetation heterogeneity and grassland bird habitat, but cut steer weights 12%-16%. Reduced weight gain in CARM arose from altered foraging behavior that reduced diet quality at high stock density. In response, stakeholders now employ two rotational herds in the CARM treatment to reduce stock density by 50%.
   The Long-term Agroecosystem Research Network consists of 18 sites distributed across the United States where scientists are conducting long-term research on how prevailing and alternative agricultural management practices affect multiple ecosystem services. Here, we describe the primary experiment being conducted at the Central Plains Experimental Range in northeastern Colorado. This ranch-scale experiment is comparing continuous, season-long grazing management, which is a prevailing practice in the region (i.e., traditional rangeland management [TRM]), with an alternative grazing management approach that was developed by a diverse stakeholder group in collaboration with USDA-ARS scientists (collaborative adaptive rangeland management [CARM]).

AB  - Climate warming causes shorter winters and changes in ice and snow cover in subarctic lakes, highlighting the need to better understand under-ice ecosystem functioning. The plankton community in a subarctic, oligotrophic lake was studied throughout the ice-covered season, focusing on lipid dynamics and life history traits in two actively overwintering copepods, Cyclops scutifer and Eudiaptomus graciloides. Whereas C. scutifer was overwintering in C-IV to C-V stage, E. graciloides reproduced under ice cover. Both species had accumulated lipids prior to ice-on and showed a substantial decrease in total lipid content throughout the ice-covered period: E. graciloides (60%-38% dw) and C. scutifer (73%-33% dw). Polyunsaturated fatty acids of algal origin were highest in E. graciloides and declined strongly in both species. Stearidonic acid (18:4n-3) content in E. graciloides was particularly high and decreased rapidly during the study period by 50%, probably due to reproduction. The copepods differed in feeding behavior, with the omnivore C. scutifer continuing to accumulate lipids until January, whereas the herbivorous E. graciloides accumulated lipids from under-ice primary production during the last months of ice-cover. Our findings emphasize the importance of lipid accumulation and utilization for actively overwintering copepods irrespective of the timing of their reproduction.

AB  - This study aimed to identify the effects of host species on the gut microbial flora in three species (Hemitragus jemlahicus, Pseudois nayaur, and Ovis orientalis) from the subfamily Caprinae, by excluding the impact of environment factors. We investigated the differences in intestinal flora of three species belonging to Caprinae, which were raised in identical conditions. Fecal samples were collected from tahr, mouflon, and bharal, and the V3-V4 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene was analyzed by high-throughput sequencing. The analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences reveals that fecal samples were mainly composed of four phyla: Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Spirochaetes, and Proteobacteria. The most abundant phyla included Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes accounting for >90% of the bacteria, and a higher Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio was observed in tahrs. Moreover, significant differences existed at multiple levels of classifications in the relative abundance of intestinal flora, differing greatly between species. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene indicated that mouflon is closely related to bharal, and it is inconsistent with previous reports in the species evolutionary relationships. In this study, we demonstrated that the gut microbiota in tahr had a stronger ability to absorb and store energy from the diet compared with mouflon and bharal, and the characteristics of host-microbiome interactions were not significant.

AB  - Tropical seagrass beds are productive coastal ecosystems that are important blue carbon sinks and crucial habitats and feeding grounds for consumers at high trophic levels. To understand how energy sustains the ecosystem from seagrass production, we constructed an Ecopath trophic model to reveal the possible pathways of energy flow in the tropical seagrass beds around Dongsha Island, South China Sea. The model indicates that Dongsha seagrass beds were developing but well-structured ecosystems. The productive seagrasses were rarely directly consumed by herbivores and, ultimately, flowed into detrital pools. Detritus was the main food source used to support diverse consumers in the food web. Nevertheless, the low cycling rate (2.74%) suggests that most detritus was not reused or exported and was stored as a large organic carbon pool in the sediments. The detritus-feeding invertebrates are keystone groups in the Dongsha seagrass beds, as they recycle energy from detritus and transfer to top predators such as sharks. The predation of top predators affected the biomasses of other compartments, leading to strong top-down control via a trophic cascade effect.

AB  - A better understanding of carbon use efficiency (CUE) and carbon allocation during disturbance is critical to improve simulations of the global carbon cycle and understanding future climate impacts. Forest thinning of high-stem density, high elevation dry western US forests is becoming more common to reduce severe fire danger but there are uncertainties about how forest thinning may impact forest CUE, carbon allocation and energy flow through the food chain. In three, quarter ha stands with similar soils, elevation and climate along a forest thinning gradient near Flagstaff (AZ), we measured total net primary production (NPP of wood, fine root, and leaves), total autotrophic respiration (R-a of wood, rhizosphere, and canopy respiration), gross primary production (GPP = NPP + R-a) and large mammal herbivory (with camera traps and dung counts) over a similar to 2-year period. We found strong seasonality in all carbon cycling variables and herbivory, peaking during the warm, wet monsoon period. Carbon was produced more efficiently in the thinned stands, with carbon use efficiency (CUE = NPP/GPP) of similar to 0.63, versus the unthinned stand with CUE of 0.38. GPP was similar in the two thinned stands (similar to 3.5 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1)) but was about 30% greater in the unthinned stands (5.0 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1)). Finally, the thinned stand had higher understory NPP, large herbivore consumption and had triple the total energy going into primary consumers. Overall, the thinning, and the return to a more natural prefire suppression forest structure, increased the CUE and energy flow from primary producers to primary consumers.

AB  - The establishment of protected areas and buffer zones has been widely adopted in many countries to mitigate biodiversity loss. However, in contrast to the growing evidence about the beneficial impacts of protected areas, ecological outcomes of buffer zones have rarely been measured. Here, we use data from a large camera trap survey and multi-species occupancy modelling to assess the effectiveness of different management regimes (Bardia National Park, its buffer zone, and areas outside the buffer zone) at safeguarding wildlife in the Terai Arc Landscape of Nepal. Using areas outside the buffer zone as the counterfactual to compare occurrence probability of 25 mammal species >1 kg, we revealed a positive effect of the national park and the buffer zone on seven and six species, respectively. Three species had greater occurrence probability outside the buffer zone than in the national park, but no species had greater occurrence probability outside the buffer zone than inside the buffer zone. Analysis of species richness indicated that management regime differentially affects species groups. For non-threatened and herbivorous species, the buffer zone performed better than areas outside the buffer zone and similar to, or better than, the national park. However, for threatened species and large animalivores (carnivores and insectivores) the national park outperformed the other management regimes. Our results also suggest that the buffer zone partially mitigated the impacts of habitat loss outside the national park, indicating that management regime may play a role in modulating the effect of agriculture on wildlife in human-dominated landscapes in Nepal.

AB  - This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Geranium pratense L. (Meadow Crane's-Bill). The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of Britain and Ireland : distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history and conservation.Geranium pratense is a perennial gynodioecious forb of neutral grassland. In Britain and Ireland, it is particularly abundant on roadside verges, railway embankments, the margins of watercourses and woodland rides. It is generally intolerant of grazing and is absent or scarce in livestock-grazed grassland. Geranium pratense is widespread in England, Wales and Scotland but is scarce in Ireland. It has an extensive native range in Europe and Asia, extending eastwards to Russia, north-western China and Mongolia. It has been widely introduced to new sites within its native range and has been introduced to Canada, the USA and New Zealand.Geranium pratense usually occurs on free-draining soils but also infrequently where drainage is impeded. The soils are often nutrient-rich and weakly acidic to weakly alkaline. The underlying geology is usually non-acidic sedimentary rocks or superficial deposits.Geranium pratense is protandrous and is pollinated by various insects of the orders Hymenoptera, Diptera and Lepidoptera, particularly bumblebees, solitary bees, hoverflies and butterflies. Eleven species of phytophagous insect have been recorded on G. pratense in Britain and Ireland.Geranium pratense has little or no capacity for vegetative spread. Primary seed dispersal is ballistic and seeds may be flung over distances of up to several metres. The species has a transient seed bank, that is germination typically takes place in the winter and spring after seed production, after the physically dormant seeds have become permeable. Seedling establishment is higher in vegetation-free gaps than in undisturbed grassland vegetation.There has been no significant change in its distribution between the late 1950s and 2019, although since 2000, it has expanded its range, mainly via introductions, in northern and western Scotland, west Wales and in Ireland. Alien sites have increased markedly since the 1960s due to introductions from wildflower seed sowing and spread from gardens.

AB  - Cryopreservation involves exposing sperm to stressful conditions that affect cell viability. The high quality of the Azerbaijani water buffalo's by-products, such as buffalo milk, makes it a species of significant importance. Our focus is on protecting its genetic resources by preserving its sperm, as their numbers will decrease in the coming years and they are at risk of extinction. This study's goal was to ascertain how apigenin (A) and trans-ferulic acid (t-FA) affected the semen quality of Azari water buffalo bulls under cryopreservation. Pooled buffalo sperm (n = 35 ejaculations) were diluted in a Tris-based diluent also containing varying amounts of apigenin (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 mM) and trans-ferulic acid (2.5, 5, 10 and 20 mM). Following a freeze-thaw procedure, samples were assayed for total antioxidant capacity (TAC), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione activity (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), progressive motility and total motility, motility properties, plasma membrane functionality, and viability. Sixty days after insemination, the rectal examination was performed on 38 buffaloes that had undergone sexual breeding to confirm pregnancy. The results of the study show that the addition of A-0.2, A-0.4, and t-FA-10 to buffalo semen increases the percentage of intact plasma membrane, motility, and sperm viability, as well as the levels of GSH, GPx, CAT. and TAC. In addition, there is a decrease in MDA and DNA damage after cryopreservation. Furthermore, the results show that 0.4 mM apigenin significantly increases conception rates compared to the control group. The base extender of Tris supplemented with A (0.4 and 0.2 mM) and t-FA (10 mM) improves the antioxidant indices of both frozen and thawed buffalo sperm, which in turn improves post-thawing sperm quality and in vivo fertility improves buffalo sperm.

AB  - Fish feeding on the benthos mediate important ecological processes in reef ecosystems that are threatened by several anthropogenic activities, including plastic pollution. The impacts of plastic pollution on reef ecological processes, such as herbivory, is still unclear. We experimentally tested in the field how the presence of plastic on the benthos affects fish feeding by using a blocked design to compare fish feeding within 1m2 plastic-free areas and areas with either clean plastic or plastic colonized with biofilm in reefs of NE Brazil. Each area was videoed for 10 min, through which we identified fish species, estimated sizes and quantified the number of bites and feeding frequency. The presence of plastic reduced fish feeding on the benthos, regardless of the biofilm pres-ence, and fish barely interacted with plastic debris. Our results demonstrate that the impact of plastic goes beyond entanglement and ingestion, affecting species behavior and ecological role.

AB  - Because of the high growth rates often achieved by invasive alien macrophytes, their establishment in recipient ecosystems may alter the abundance and composition of litter entering detrital pathways, representing a significant-but often overlooked-ecological effect of these invasions. Crassula helmsii (Kirk) Cockayne (New Zealand pygmyweed) is an invasive alien macrophyte, notorious for its profuse growth in invaded waterbodies. C. helmsii is perennial and often forms dense stands, producing abundant detritus. To investigate whether some of C. helmsii's impacts are mediated by this detritus, we conducted an 85-day litterbag experiment comparing decomposition of C. helmsii with that of Callitriche stagnalis Scop. (water-starwort), a commonly co-occurring native macrophyte. Macroinvertebrate assemblage composition was comparable between macrophyte species throughout the experiment, but shifted as plants decayed. Litterbags were initially dominated by the invasive shredder Crangonyx pseudogracilis Bousfield, 1958 and later by Euglesa casertana (Poli, 1791), an interstitial suspension feeder. C. helmsii litter decomposed more slowly, with proportionally less invertebrate-mediated breakdown, but was ultimately colonised by more abundant macroinvertebrates, including more C. pseudogracilis. Decomposition may be slowed by C. helmsii's high carbon: nitrogen ratio. These results suggest that C. helmsii invasion may impact macroinvertebrate assemblages via the production of long-lasting and relatively unpalatable detritus.

AB  - Simple Summary Deer can affect forest ecosystems through foraging behavior. Using indicator species that are sensitive to temporal and spatial variations in deer density has the advantage of managing deer effectively and practically. We examined the response of Dryopteris crassirhizoma to the variations in sika deer density in Hokkaido, Japan. We showed that the grazing intensity of D. crassirhizoma was sensitive to short-term decreases in deer density and positively related to spatial variation in deer density within regions. Dryopteris crassirhizoma can be a useful indicator species and using grazing intensity could help managers rapidly determine their management direction and decide where to focus their efforts. Identifying appropriate indicator species for the impact of deer on forest vegetation is crucial for forest management in deer habitats and is required to be sensitive to temporal and spatial variations in deer density. Dryopteris crassirhizoma was selected as a new indicator to evaluate the response to these variations. We examined the population-level characteristics, morphological characteristics at the individual level, and grazing intensity of D. crassirhizoma at temporally different deer density sites in Hokkaido, Japan. The response of D. crassirhizoma to spatial variation in deer density was also examined within and between two regions in Hokkaido, Japan. Although the population-level characteristics and morphological characteristics did not significantly respond to short-term decreases in deer density, grazing intensity significantly decreased with decreasing deer density. The grazing intensity was also positively related to the spatial variation of deer density within both regions, but the estimated coefficient of the grazing intensity differed between regions. We concluded that D. crassirhizoma can be a useful indicator species of the impact of deer on forest vegetation. The grazing intensity of the indicator species was sensitive to temporal and spatial variations in deer density within the region.

AB  - Understanding and predicting large-scale ecological responses to global environmental change requires comparative studies across geographic scales with coordinated efforts and standardized methodologies. We designed, applied, and assessed standardized protocols to measure tundra herbivory at three spatial scales: plot, site (habitat), and study area (landscape). The plot- and site-level protocols were tested in the field during summers 2014 -2015 at 11 sites, nine of them consisting of warming experimental plots included in the International Tundra Experiment (ITEX). The study area protocols were assessed during 2014-2018 at 24 study areas across the Arctic. Our protocols provide comparable and easy to implement methods for assessing the intensity of invertebrate herbivory within ITEX plots and for characterizing vertebrate herbivore communities at larger spatial scales. We discuss methodological constraints and make recommendations for how these protocols can be used and how sampling effort can be optimized to obtain comparable estimates of herbivory, both at ITEX sites and at large landscape scales. The application of these protocols across the tundra biome will allow characterizing and comparing herbivore communities across tundra sites and at ecologically relevant spatial scales, providing an important step towards a better understanding of tundra ecosystem responses to large-scale environmental change.

AB  - Island populations of small land vertebrates frequently exhibit insular gigantism, presenting with larger body sizes in comparison to mainland counterparts. While insular gigantism has been observed globally, the effects of biogeographic and ecological factors on body size in island systems are not well understood. Here, we examine the biogeographic and ecological associations of insular gigantism. Deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) were live trapped and body mass measured on six of the Gulf Islands and the nearby mainland of British Columbia, Canada. Biogeographic measures of land area and island distance from the mainland and the ecological measure of predator species richness were used in piecewise structural equation modelling to identify associations with insular gigantism. We found evidence of insular gigantism in the Gulf Islands system, with island mice having a larger mean body mass than mainland populations. Land area was positively associated with predator species richness, and predator species richness had a strong negative effect on deer mouse body mass, resulting in the observed pattern of insular gigantism. The concurrent analysis of biogeographic and ecological factors contributes to a better understanding of the evolution of insular gigantism in small vertebrates and its juxtaposition to the phenomenon of insular dwarfism of large vertebrates.

AB  - Accurate and ecologically relevant wildlife population estimates are critical for species management. One of the most common survey methods for forest mammals - line transects for animal sign with distance sampling - has assumptions regarding conversion factors that, if violated, can induce substantial bias in abundance estimates. Specifically, for sign (e.g. nests, dung) surveys, a single number representing total time for decay is used as a multiplier to convert estimated sign density into animal density. This multiplier is likely inaccurate if not derived from a study reflecting the spatiotemporal variation in decay times. Using dung decay observations from three protected areas in Gabon, and a previous study in Nouabale-Ndoki National Park (Congo), we developed Weibull survival models to adaptively predict forest elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis) dung decay based on environmental variables from field collected and remotely sensed data. Seasonal decay models based on remotely sensed covariates explained 86% of the variation for the wet season and 79% for the dry season. These models included canopy cover, cloud cover, humidity, vegetation complexity and slope as factors influencing dung decay. With these models, we assessed sensitivity of elephant density estimates to spatiotemporal environmental heterogeneity, showing that our methods work best for large-scale studies >50 km(2). We simulated decay studies with and without these variables in four Gabonese national parks and reanalyzed two previous surveys of elephants in Minkebe National Park, Gabon. Disregarding spatial and temporal variation in decay rate biased population estimates up to 1.6 and 6.9 times. Our reassessment of surveys in Minkebe National Park showed an expected loss of 78% of forest elephants over ten years, but the elephant abundance was 222% higher than previously estimated. Our models incorporate field or remotely sensed variables to provide an ecological context essential for accurate population estimates while reducing need for expensive decay field studies.

AB  - Invasive predators, land clearing and altered fire regimes have been implicated in species decline and extinction worldwide. Enhanced knowledge of how these factors interact and influence medium-sized mammals is warranted. We tested three hypotheses using occupancy data for a diverse mammal assemblage including three threatened species, five common species, two introduced mesopredators and an apex predator in eastern Australia. We hypothesised that occupancy of mammal species within the assemblage would be influenced by (i) the physical environment (rainfall, vegetation type and elevation), (ii) habitat disturbance (number of fires and habitat fragmentation) and (iii) mesopredator release, whereby occupancy and/or detection of medium-sized mammals are influenced by mesopredators, the feral cat (Felis catus) and the red fox (Vulpes vulpes), which are influenced by an apex predator, the dingo (Canis familiaris). We utilised camera-trapping data from 173 sites (692 camera locations) across a north-south gradient spanning similar to 1500 km in eastern Australia. Although hypotheses i (physical environment) and ii (habitat disturbance) are not mutually exclusive, we show that the variables considered in each were only weakly correlated. We conducted occupancy modelling to investigate the physical environment and habitat disturbance hypotheses. We conducted co-occurrence modelling to investigate interactions between species. The physical environment hypothesis best supported occupancy models for six mammal species: red-necked pademelon (Thylogale thetis), bandicoots (Isoodon macrourus and Perameles nasuta), swamp wallaby (Wallabies bicolor), rednecked wallaby (Macropus rufogriseus), eastern grey kangaroo (Macropus giganteus) and feral cat. The disturbance hypothesis best supported occupancy models for four mammal species: long-nosed potoroo (Potorous tridactylus), red-necked pademelon and both mesopredators. Support for the mesopredator release hypothesis was equivocal. Large macropods showed site avoidance towards the red fox. Four species showed higher detection at sites where mesopredators were not detected. The fox showed a negative detection interaction to the dingo and the cat did not. Our study highlights how factors such as rainfall, land clearing, elevation and number of fires influence the occupancy of species within a diverse mammal assemblage at the macroecological scale. Our findings have implications for the conservation of threatened species in managed landscapes and suggestions for further research following the recent 2019-2020 wildfires.

AB  - Wild boar growth in numbers and range is associated with increasing economic and environmental impact. Hunting has been traditionally used to reduce wild boar numbers. Areas where hunting is not allowed may attract wild boar from neighbouring hunting grounds. This phenomenon is called 'reserve effect' and could cause temporarily localised, high densities of wild boar in areas where hunting is banned. To investigate the occurrence of 'reserve effect', this study was conducted in two natural reserves of 400 and 250 ha inside the Montseny Natural Park, Catalonia, Spain where regular hunting of wild boar is not permitted, and only sporadic driven hunts/year are authorised for population control. The aims of the study were to evaluate if wild boar use these reserves as a refuge when hunting is carried out in the surrounding areas and to assess the effects that occasional drive hunts inside these reserves may have on wild boar numbers and social organization. From 2012 to 2015 camera traps were placed in the two reserves without using any bait. Cameras operated for 1.759 days, including hunting and non hunting seasons, and 37.574 wild boar images were obtained. A 'reserve effect' was detected, as following hunting in the surroundings grounds, the number of wild boar increases inside reserves. Occasional driven hunts conducted in the reserves are effective in reducing the number of individuals and the effects persist for at least 45 days. Hunting disrupts wild boar social organization, as group size was significantly reduced. These results suggested that targeting refuge areas, once hunting in the surroundings causes wild boar to concentrate in these areas, is effective for population control. These findings could also be used to design trategies to optimise population control and offer opportunities for disease management such as vaccination, or to facilitate eradication in areas affected by disease outbreaks.

AB  - Old trees, often living for hundreds or even thousands of years, play vital roles in maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem services. However, their extraordinary longevity occurs under rare circumstances, as most individuals succumb to mortality. From an optimal resource allocation perspective, species adopting a life-history strategy with a high potential maximum lifespan (PML) are expected to also have a higher life expectancy (LE). Here we developed a framework to assess the longevity of 1-cm-diameter trees and calculated the PML and LE for 53 major tree species in Japan. The results revealed that the PML (mean 378 years) was 4.7 times higher than the LE (mean 81 years). Both indices showed a positive correlation, with a regression slope of 0.34; however, the explanatory power of the model was low (R2 = 0.22). This can be attributed to the fact that LE exhibits a stronger negative response to climate-related habitat severity compared with that of PML. Our findings suggest two key points: (1) trees may adopt a hierarchical ordering of demographic parameters that prioritize long-term survival duration over average survival rate, and (2) considering this balance, which varies among species, could enhance the cost-effectiveness of ecosystem restoration.

AB  - 1. Insect herbivory plays a critical role in the regulation of plant populations and community structures. Although the strength of insect herbivory varies with neighbouring tree diversity and identity, it is not clear to what extent insect guilds and leaf traits of host plants mediate the relationships, particularly in diverse natural forests. 2. In this study, we measured leaf herbivory by chewing and mining insect herbivores in 442 saplings of nine species of deciduous trees in a warm-temperate montane forest. We censused neighbouring trees and measured five leaf traits known to influence herbivory (i.e. specific leaf area-SLA, thickness, carbon: nitrogen ratio-C:N ratio, sodium-Na and silicon-Si content) on a subset of saplings. 3. Only herbivory by leaf-mining insects was influenced by the identity and diversity of neighbouring trees. Specifically, the incidence of leaf-miners decreased with the phylogenetic diversity of neighbouring trees and increased with conspecific adult density in the vicinity of focal trees. Furthermore, leaf mining herbivory was positively correlated with the amount of Si in the leaves of focal saplings, and leaf chewing herbivory decreased with increasing C:N ratio in the leaves. In contrast to our hypothesis, the leaf traits of focal saplings did not serve as a functional link between tree diversity and insect herbivory. 4. Synthesis: Overall, this study highlights the importance of considering the specialisation of insect herbivores in understanding the impacts of the diversity and identity of neighbouring trees on the strength of insect herbivory.

AB  - Domestic sheep (Ovis aries) are an attractant to carnivores; however, sheep are often accompanied by humans and livestock guardian dogs (LGDs; Canis familiaris), which defend sheep from depredation. Sheep also compete directly with wildlife for grazing resources. Although practiced for millennia in much of the world outside North America, the effect that transhumance has on wildlife is poorly understood. To test the effect of sheep bands (sheep, humans, and LGDs) on wildlife, we modeled the detection probability of wild mammals relative to the presence of sheep bands in the Northwestern United States. Sheep band presence was associated with a reduction of about half in the likelihood of detecting large carnivores (Ursus americanus, Ursus arctos, Canis lupus, and Puma concolor, p < 0.05) and deer (Odocoileus spp., p < 0.01), both while the band was present and after it left the area. Contrastingly, coyotes (Canis latrans) were more than three times as likely to be detected when sheep bands were present (p < 0.001), and twice as likely after sheep bands left (p < 0.01). Coyotes were the only species we modeled that was more likely to be detected when a sheep band was present. It is unclear how long these effects persist after a sheep band has moved through an area, but our results suggest that transhumance temporarily displaces many large mammals, which results in mesopredator release of coyotes. This study suggests there is a tradeoff between the conservation benefits provided by LGDs and humans protecting sheep and the costs of displacement to some wild mammals.

AB  - Beached birds on marine coastal beaches, along with other megafauna, are a valuable source of biological information, offering insights into species occurrence and factors that negatively affect their populations. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the spatial and temporal variation, and species composition, of coastal and marine birds found on sandy beaches in the Bahia de San Antonio Protected Natural Area (Rio Negro Province, Argentina), and to relate resulting species abundance and richness to oceanographic and environmental variables. A biweekly survey was carried out over two years (2020-2022), during which 672 beached birds were recorded. The overall encounter rate of beached birds was 1.35 birds/km. Most birds were identified to the species level, totaling 27 species belonging to 11 orders. The three most frequently encountered species were Magellanic Penguin Spheniscus magellanicus (49.38%), Kelp Gull Larus dominicanus (43.75%), and Neotropic Cormorant Nannopterum brasilianum (22.5%). The height of high tide and wind direction significantly affected beached bird abundance at various spatial and temporal scales. We conclude that the assemblage of beached birds is heterogeneous, mainly consisting of species that inhabit the Rio Negro Province coast, rather than those from farther offshore. Future studies in the area should include drift experiments and cover a larger geographic scale.

AB  - Numerous studies have examined whether the primary and/or secondary sex ratio in mammals, including humans, deviates from an equilibrium of 1:1. Although effect size in the sex ratio variation is expected to be low, a large sample size allows the identification of even small deviations from parity. In this study, we investigated whether the sex ratio of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) offspring at birth approaches parity, using a large data set from roe deer offspring tagged in Baden-Wurttemberg (Germany, 1972-2019, N = 12,437). In addition, a systematic re-analysis of available data on the secondary sex ratios of roe deer was conducted to test whether our finding withstood the accumulation of further data. The null hypothesis that the sex ratio of roe deer (prenatal sex ratio and sex ratio at birth) approaches parity was rejected. Moreover, the secondary sex ratio of roe deer offspring deviated from the male-biased mean for relatively cold or warm weather conditions during autumn and winter. Our study provides strong evidence for a male-biased sex ratio in a large herbivore and weak evidence for variations in the secondary sex ratio owing to environmental conditions. The pattern is highly relevant in the context of climate change and its impact on the population dynamics of large herbivores.

AB  - In 1749, Linnaeus published Pan Svecicus, a thesis that was defended by his student Nils Hesselgren. The thesis describes food preference trials in cows, goats, sheep, horses, and pigs, and includes 2325 tests with 643 plant species. The data had surprisingly little bearing on the text in the thesis, and even though the experiments quickly became internationally known, the data were merely repeated, rather than discussed. We have digitized the data and linked the species names to modern nomenclature and present the first analysis and discussion of the results. Pigs were most selective (eating 32% of the 204 plant species that were tested on all animals), followed by horses (59%), cows (66%), sheep (82%), and goats (85%). The ruminants (especially goats and sheep) had high overlap in food choice, and the pigs deviated most (despite the fact that pigs are more closely related to the ruminants than are horses). Among plant orders, Fabales and Poales were generally preferred, while Lamiales and Ranunculales were avoided, especially by cows and horses. Cows and horses were also more keen to avoid toxic plant species. All animals showed a preference for species that are today considered nutritious. We now make the data available, for further analyses in ecology, history of science, and other disciplines.

AB  - The exploitation of mid- and large-sized herbivores (ungulates) was central to hominin subsistence across Late Pleistocene Europe. Reconstructing the paleoecology of prey-taxa is key to better understanding procurement strategies, decisions and behaviors, and the isotope analysis of faunal bones and teeth found at archaeological sites represent a powerful means of accessing information about past faunal behaviors. These isotope zooarchaeological approaches also have a near-unique ability to reveal environmental conditions contemporary to the human activities that produced these remains. Here, we present the results of a multi-isotope, multitissue study of ungulate remains from the Middle Paleolithic site of Abri du Maras, southern France, providing new insights into the living landscapes of the Rhone Valley during MIS 3 (level 4.2 = 55 +/- 2 to 42 +/- 3 ka; level 4.1 = 46 +/- 3 to 40 +/- 3 ka). Isotope data (carbon, nitrogen) reveal the dietary niches of different ungulate taxa, including the now-extinct giant deer (Megaloceros). Oxygen isotope data are consistent with a mild seasonal climate during level 4.2, where horse (Equus), bison (Bison), and red deer (Cervus elaphus) were exploited year-round. Strontium and sulfur isotope analyses provide new evidence for behavioral plasticity in Late Pleistocene European reindeer (Rangifer) between level 4.2 and level 4.1, indicating a change from the migratory to the sedentary ecotype. In level 4.1, the strong seasonal nature of reindeer exploitation, combined with their nonmigratory behavior, is consistent with a seasonally restricted use of the site by Neanderthals at that time or the preferential hunting of reindeer when in peak physical condition during the autumn.

AB  - Artificial light at night (ALAN) is recognized as one of the major anthropogenic pollutants jeopardizing biodiversity at a global scale. Few studies have focused on the impacts of nocturnal light on freshwater ecosystems despite their increasing exposure to light pollution worldwide due to human activities along rivers or lakes. By modifying metabolism, the disruption of natural light regime could modify the leaf palatability and affect the plant-herbivore interactions which can partly determine the structure of macrophyte communities. By experimentally mimicking light conditions from sub-urban areas, we measured the effects of low-level light at night on the leaf traits of an aquatic plant, Ceratophyllum demersum, and herbivory by the snail Lymnaea stagnalis, a generalist feeder. We demonstrate that artificial light at night increases the herbivory rate: leaves of C. demersum that had been exposed to ALAN for three months were 1.6 times more consumed by L. stagnalis than control leaves. The increase in C. demersum palatability to the pond snail when plants were exposed to ALAN was not due to a decrease in dry matter content or to a modification of the biomechanical characteristics of the leaves. Because snails have not been exposed to nocturnal light before or during the herbivory experiment, this increase in leaf palatability, is possibly linked to modifications of primary and/or secondary metabolism. Our results suggest that ALAN is a potential key factor affecting ecological processes in aquatic ecosystems such as trophic networks.

AB  - 1. Despite increasing evidence that herbivore-mediated indirect effects play a major role in plant competition, it is unclear how and when they contribute to plant invasiveness. The outcomes of herbivore-mediated indirect effects are primarily dependent on the environment and have complex interactions with the direct interactions between plants.
   2. We evaluated the herbivore-mediated indirect effects of Solidago altissima (Asteraceae) on other co-occurring native Asteraceae species at multiple sites in a native range [the United States (US)] and in an introduced range (Japan) using common garden experiments. We examined the effect of S. altissima on herbivore damage, above-ground vegetative and reproductive traits of the co-occurring Asteraceae species at sites with different densities of a herbivore, the lace bug, Corythucha marmorata, which is native to the US and introduced in Japan.
   3. We observed increased lace bug herbivory in plants grown with S. altissima in Japan but decreased lace bug herbivory in the US. We did not find consistent effect of S. altissima on aboveground vegetative production of co-occurring plants in either ranges. Flower production decreased in plants grown with S. altissima in Japan because of both direct competition and increased herbivory. Direct competition and apparent competition via lace bug herbivory interacted to produce a strong negative effect of S. altissima on co-occurring plants only in Japan.
   4. Synthesis. The findings imply that evolutionary history and the local environment jointly affect herbivore-mediated indirect effects, which play a large role in shaping the pattern of herbivory and plant competition. Another implication of our results is that exotic herbivores may reinforce the negative effects of exotic plants on native plants under high herbivore density environments.

AB  - 1. A combination of theory and experiments predicts that increasing soil nutrients will modify herbivore and microbial impacts on ecosystem carbon cycling.2. However, few studies of herbivores and soil nutrients have measured both ecosystem carbon fluxes and carbon pools. Even more rare are studies manipulating microbes and nutrients that look at ecosystem carbon cycling responses.3. We added nutrients to a long-term, experiment manipulating foliar fungi, soil fungi, mammalian herbivores and arthropods in a low fertility grassland. We measured gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (ER), net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and plant biomass throughout the growing season to determine how nutrients modify consumer impacts on ecosystem carbon cycling.4. Nutrient addition increased above-ground biomass and GPP, but not ER, resulting in an increase in ecosystem carbon uptake rate. Reducing foliar fungi and arthropods increased plant biomass. Nutrients amplified consumer effects on plant biomass, such that arthropods and foliar fungi had a threefold larger impact on above-ground biomass in fertilized plots.5. Synthesis. Our work demonstrates that throughout the growing season soil resources modify carbon uptake rates as well as animal and fungal impacts on plant biomass production. Taken together, ongoing nutrient pollution may increase ecosystem carbon uptake and drive fungi and herbivores to have larger impacts on plant biomass production.

AB  - The daily activity pattern in ruminants consists mainly of alternating foraging with bouts of resting, while other behaviors usually play a minor role in the daily activity budgets of ungulates most of the year. Interactions of both intrinsic and extrinsic factors force animals to adopt compromises to form optimal time proportions for foraging and resting to satisfy their daily energy demands. This paper considers the impact of ambient tem-perature, pasture conditions, body-size, and the effects of lactation and animal growth on the daily activities of goitered gazelles (Gazella subgutturosa). My study found: 1) temperature was the most significant factor leading to the greatest daily hour-to-hour variations in activity, as well as significant monthly changes in activity fluc-tuations; 2) seasonal improvement of forage conditions did not have a distinctive effect on daily activity; 3) the effect of body size, lactation and fawn growth also did not noticeably change activity fluctuations; but 4) factors related to hiding behavior had a significant impact on goitered gazelle activity. Though goitered gazelles are a sexually dimorphic species, they did not demonstrate any significant deviation between males and females in their daily activities in contrast to typical dimorphic ruminants. The goitered gazelles' hiding behavior may provide a possible explanation for this distinction, as other previously observed dimorphic ungulates were mainly species where fawns followed their mothers from birth. Among other influences, ambient temperature and features of their hiding behavior were the most significant factors influencing diurnal activity of goitered gazelles, while age and sex had a weaker impact on daily behaviors.

AB  - Comprehensive information on prey availability and diet composition is important to -formulate effective conservation strategies. Data on these of large apex predators, the tiger Panthera tigris, leopard Panthera pardus, and dhole Cuon alpinus, are deficient in Kalakkad-Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve, India, which harbors low prey density. Therefore, we investigated how these predators coexisted by partitioning limited food resources. We found that prey selection and activity patterns differed among predators. The leopard (D [Jacobs' preference index] = +0.916) and dhole (D = +0.937) preferred the Indian chevrotain Moschiola indica, whereas the tiger preferred the gaur Bos gaurus (D = +0.937). Biomass of tiger's diet mainly consisted of the gaur (75%). In the dhole, the Indian -chevrotain and sambar Rusa unicolor together contributed 91% of biomass, whereas 79% of leopard's biomass was contributed by the Nilgiri langur Semnopithecus johnii and the Indian chevrotain. The leopard and dhole had the highest dietary overlap (O-jk [Pianka Index] = 0.46). The highest activity overlap was found among the leopard, Indian chevrotain, and sambar. The leopard and dhole would compete for the Indian chevrotain, although the competition may be avoided by different activity -patterns. Managements of the Indian chevrotain and gaur are critical for conserving large predators in the region.

AB  - The expansion of urban areas has resulted in the fragmentation and reduction of natural habitats. This leads to a fundamental reconfiguration of interactions between humans and wildlife, with profound ecological, social, and policy implications. However there is a research gap in understanding public perceptions of urban wildlife and their management. This study pursues three objectives: (1) to explore the primary types of conflicts between the public and urban wildlife, focusing on Sika deer (Cervus nippon) as an example; (2) to examine public attitudes towards urban deer; and (3) to investigate differences in public acceptance of hunting and fencing management policies. A questionnaire survey was conducted in the urban area of Kyoto City, Japan in September 2022 (n = 759). The survey addressed issues related to deer behavior in the city, public perceptions of urban deer, and feedback on management policies We employed statistical descriptive analysis to study the main ways in which people interact with urban deer. Subsequently, we examined the urban deer image from the public perspective and public perceptions of urban deer. Additionally, mining analysis was conducted on open-ended responses, and public demands were explored in conjunction with feedback on current management schemes in Kyoto City The results indicate that the main type of human-urban deer conflict has an impact on damaging urban vegetation. Public attitudes towards urban deer and other wildlife (besides deer) show significant differences but tend towards negative attitudes. We found a positive inclination towards the efficacy of fencing as a viable solution concurrently revealing a low-approving sentiment regarding hunting policies. These findings bear implications for the development and enhancement of sustainable management strategies aimed at mitigating the complex challenges posed by the swift urbanisation and evolution of urban ecosystems.

AB  - Background Insufficient knowledge of the genetic and phenotypic diversity in the local Beninese goat population combined with the lack of understanding of its adaptive capacity to ongoing environmental and societal changes hampers the development of strategies for better management and genetic improvement. The objective of this study was to establish the current geographical distribution of goats in Benin based on their morphology and model the potential habitat suitability of the three known main goat phenotypes (i.e., Djallonke goat or Type I, Sahelian goat or Type II, and their Crossbreeds or Type III) under climate change scenarios. Ten qualitative and 26 linear body measurements were taken on 2114 adult female goats sampled across the three vegetation zones of the country. Fifteen ratios were generated from the quantitative variables. The data were analyzed using generalized linear model procedures followed by multiple comparisons of least-squares means and multivariate analytical methods, including canonical discrimination analysis and hierarchical ascendant classification. Each goat was then assigned to one of the three aforementioned main goat phenotypes following its morphological characteristics and according to the a priori cluster membership defined in the previous step. The Maximum Entropy algorithm was used to model the current and future distribution of the three goat phenotypes under climate change scenario using the Representative Conservation Pathways 4.5 and 8.5. Results All linear body measurements varied among vegetation zones. In the discriminant function analysis, 71% of the measured individuals were correctly classified in their vegetation zone of origin by seven measured variables and three ratios. The cluster procedure analysis revealed two groups of goats subdivided into the three main phenotypes. The modeling results showed that the currently highly favorable habitats were distributed in the South for Type I, in the North for Type II, and both South and North for Type III. However, under climate change scenarios, the favorable habitats for Type I decreased while those of Types II and III increased. Conclusions The results of this study confirm the spatial variation of the goat population in Benin. The habitat suitability model can be used to support decision-making toward better management of goat genetic diversity in Benin.

AB  - Aim Connectivity is increasingly important for landscape-scale conservation programmes. Yet there are obstacles to developing reliable connectivity maps, including paucity of data on animal use of the non-habitat matrix. Our aim was to identify important connectivity areas for the endangered Asian elephant Elephas maximus across a 21,210 km(2) region using empirical data and recently developed animal movement models. Location Northeast India. Methods We interviewed 1,184 respondents, primarily farmers, residing across our study region, to collect crowd-sourced data on elephant use of the matrix. We generated a classified land use/land cover map and collated remotely sensed data on environmental and anthropogenic covariates. We used logistic regression to estimate the influence of these covariates on resistance, based on elephant detections recorded via interviews. We modelled elephant movement within the randomised shortest path framework, which allows for scenarios ranging from optimal movement with complete information on the landscape to random movement with no information on the landscape. We calculated the passage of elephants through pixels in our study region, a parameter that denotes the expected number of elephant movements through a particular pixel across movement routes. We overlaid linear infrastructure sourced from secondary data, and human-elephant conflict hotspots generated from our interview data, on passage maps. Results Elephants preferred locations with high vegetation cover, close to forests and with low human population density. We mapped important connectivity areas across the study region, including in three important conservation landscapes. Whilst forests facilitated connectivity, the matrix also played an important contributory role to elephant dispersal. Incorporating information on environmental and anthropogenic drivers of elephant movement added value to connectivity predictions. Main conclusions Fine-scale mapping of connectivity, using empirical data and realistic movement models, such as the approach we use, can provide for informed and more effective landscape-scale conservation.

AB  - The muskox and reindeer are the only ruminants that have evolved to survive in harsh Arctic environments. However, the genetic basis of this Arctic adaptation remains largely unclear. Here, we compared a de novo assembled muskox genome with reindeer and other ruminant genomes to identify convergent amino acid substitutions, rapidly evolving genes and positively selected genes among the two Arctic ruminants. We found these candidate genes were mainly involved in brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis and circadian rhythm. Furthermore, by integrating transcriptomic data from goat adipose tissues (white and brown), we demonstrated that muskox and reindeer may have evolved modulating mitochondrion, lipid metabolism and angiogenesis pathways to enhance BAT thermogenesis. In addition, results from co-immunoprecipitation experiments prove that convergent amino acid substitution of the angiogenesis-related gene hypoxia-inducible factor 2alpha (HIF2A), resulting in weakening of its interaction with prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing protein 2 (PHD2), may increase angiogenesis of BAT. Altogether, our work provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms involved in Arctic adaptation.

AB  - The marking behavior of Siberian Roe deer males in central Yakutia, Siberia is considered in the context of a biological signal field. The optical elements of the Roe deer signal field are trees and shrubs damaged by their horns. Seven species of tree and shrub plants used by Roe deers as marking objects have been found: pine, larch, fir, birch, willow, aspen, and alder. Among them, representatives of conifers predominate. The maximum thickness of a marking tree across the trunk circumference does not exceed 21 cm, the thickness of marking objects averaging 7.0 +/- 3.7 cm. The marking activity of the species rendered on wood and shrub vegetation is performed by demonstrating three damage types: circular stripping across the trunk circumference; vertical stripping along the trunk, and twisting the trunk.

AB  - Owing to the intensified domestication process with artificial trait selection, introgressive hybridisation between domestic and wild species poses a management problem. Traditional free-range livestock husbandry, as practiced in Corsica and Sardinia, is known to facilitate hybridisation between wild boars and domestic pigs (Sus scrofa). Here, we assessed the genetic distinctness and genome-wide domestic pig ancestry levels of the Corsican wild boar subspecies S. s. meridionalis, with reference to its Sardinian conspecifics, employing a genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) assay and mitochondrial control region (mtCR) haplotypes. We also assessed the reliance of morphological criteria and the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) coat colour gene to identify individuals with domestic introgression. While Corsican wild boars showed closest affinity to Sardinian and Italian wild boars compared to other European populations based on principal component analysis, the observation of previously undescribed mtCR haplotypes and high levels of nuclear divergence (Weir's theta > 0.14) highlighted the genetic distinctness of Corsican S. s. meridionalis. Across three complementary analyses of mixed ancestry (i.e., STRUCTURE, PCADMIX, and ELAI), proportions of domestic pig ancestry were estimated at 9.5% in Corsican wild boars, which was significantly higher than in wild boars in Sardinia, where free-range pig keeping was banned in 2012. Comparison of morphologically pure- and hybrid-looking Corsican wild boars suggested a weak correlation between morphological criteria and genome-wide domestic pig ancestry. The study highlights the usefulness of molecular markers to assess the direct impacts of management practices on gene flow between domestic and wild species.

AB  - Ungulate grazing encompasses multiple components, including defoliation, trampling, and excreta return, all of which affect soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics by influencing the balance between rhizodeposition and the subsequent C input and release. However, it remains unclear how ungulate grazing regulates SOC through living roots, especially as evidence from the field is lacking. A (CO2)-C-13 pulse labeling experiment was conducted on an 8-year simulated grazing field experiment, involving separate or combined treatments of defoliation, excreta return, and trampling from grazing animals. We investigated the fate of newly assimilated C in different soil C pools and quantified CO2 release under grazing treatments. Defoliation enhanced C assimilation in soil microorganisms and promoted fungal necromass formation, thereby increasing the microbial carbon pump (MCP) "capacity" (i.e., the net microbial necromass accumulation), contributing more C to SOC (+32%) and mineral-associated organic C (+34%) while reducing soil respiration (-19%). Excreta return stimulated C incorporation into bacterial necromass, enhanced MCP "efficacy" (i.e., the contribution of microbial necromass to SOC) and "capacity", and reduced heterotrophic respiration (-19%). Significant interactions existed between defoliation and excreta return on C-13 recovery of SOC and CO2: excreta return reduced the positive effect of defoliation on C-13 recovery of SOC, while defoliation mitigated the inhibitory effect of excreta return on C-13 recovery of CO2. Trampling increased the contribution of plant-derived C to particulate organic C (POC, +26%) and significantly interacted with defoliation by weakening its positive effect on C-13 recovery of POC. This study advances our understanding of root-derived C formation and stabilization in grazing grassland by disentangling the effects of defoliation, excreta return, and trampling from ungulates. Our work offers new insights for optimizing management practices to effectively utilize the soil MCP for C sequestration in grasslands in response to global climate change.

AB  - The timing of birth has a predominant influence on both the reproductive success of the mother and the life-history trajectory of her offspring. Because early growth and survival are key drivers of population dynamics, there is an urgent need to understand how global change is affecting reproductive phenology and performance. However, identifying when and where birth occurs is often difficult in the wild due to the cryptic behaviour of females around parturition, although this information may also help managers to protect reproductive females and newborn against human disturbance. While several approaches to identify parturition based on movement metrics derived from GPS monitoring have previously been proposed, their performance has not been evaluated over a range of species with contrasted movement characteristics.
   Here, we present a novel approach to detect parturition by combining data on animal movements, activity rate and habitat use. Using machine learning approaches, we evaluated the relative and combined performance of each category of metrics in predicting parturition for three large herbivores with contrasted life histories: a hider-type species, the roe deer Capreolus capreolus and two follower-type species, the Mediterranean mouflon Ovis gmelini musimon x Ovis sp. and the Alpine ibex Capra ibex.
   We first showed that detection of parturition was much improved when birth-related modifications in the habitat use and activity rate of the mother were considered, rather than relying on movement metrics only. We then demonstrated that our approach was highly successful (76%-100% of events correctly identified) in detecting parturition in both follower and hider species. Furthermore, our approach generated estimates for peak birth date and the proportion of parturient females that were comparable with those based on direct observations at the population scale. Finally, our approach outperformed the most commonly employed methods in the literature which generally failed to identify non-reproductive females for the three studied species, and provided birth timing estimates that only poorly match the true parturition date.
   We suggest that by combining sources of information, we have developed a standardised methodological approach for inferring parturition in the wild, not only for large herbivores but also for any species where parturition induces marked behavioural changes in the mother.

AB  - We analyzed the polymorphism of the complete mtDNA cytochrome b gene ( 1140 bp) and 12 microsatellite nDNA loci of the eastern red deer Cervus elaphus subspecies - Siberian C. e. sibiricus and Far East C. e. xanthopygus wapiti. On the territory of Russia, 112 samples were collected from different parts of the range, including Yakutia, where individuals with intermediate morphometric traits were found. We described 41 haplotypes, with no common haplotypes found for Siberian and Far East wapiti. Phylogenetic cytochrome b analysis revealed traces of ancestral polymorphism or introgression from Siberian wapiti into Far East wapiti. The red deer of Yakutia formed two haplogroups, the first group was genetically closer to Siberian wapiti, and the second to American wapiti. The latter may indicate the preservation of ancient lines in Yakutia, which participated in the North America colonization during the Pleistocene glaciation. Microsatellite analysis revealed a little differentiation between the subspecies (Fst = 0.037), reflecting the presence of a constant gene flow between their populations. The genotypes of red deer from Yakutia demonstrate heterogeneity, indicating their mixed origin.

AB  - Understanding the relationship between vegetation attributes and defoliation patterns at multiple spatiotemporal scales is crucial for optimising grazing systems. This study assessed the structural attributes of vegetation and the effects of defoliation frequency and intensity in a campos grassland under two herbage allowance (HA) levels. Vegetation metrics such as forage mass, lamina and sheath height, green/dead ratio, and lamina/sheath ratio were measured. Data were analysed across four spatial hierarchical levels using cluster analysis to describe vegetation heterogeneity and defoliation patterns. Higher HA resulted in greater heterogeneity and more selective grazing behaviour, particularly at finer spatial scales (bite and patch level). The results suggest that maintaining vegetation heterogeneity throughout the year enhances forage selection and grazing efficiency, contributing to more sustainable grazing systems, but may change species composition to higher proportions of less-palatable species over time.

AB  - Restoring free-roaming mammals that fill critical ecological roles requires large connected landscapes that cross jurisdictional boundaries. Plains bison, once nearly extirpated from North America, are now confined to several larger free-roaming herds and a number of small fenced herds in regions where they are often managed as livestock rather than wildlife. Although bison reintroduction efforts are rapidly gaining momentum, restoring free-roaming bison remains challenged by real and perceived wildlife-human conflict. Thus, developing a shared vision for bison recovery, or at least understanding and acknowledging diverse visions, could be critical to success. To address this need, we surveyed experts from government, academia, and conservation organizations to evaluate if there is a shared long-term vision for bison, and to identify the most significant challenges, promising strategies, and research priorities for achieving this vision. We found that most respondents support a future with fenced herds as well as more free-roaming (unfenced) herds, and value bison as wildlife and cultural animals, rather than for livestock. Key challenges to achieving more free-roaming bison included political will, social acceptability, and management across jurisdictional boundaries. Respondents identified successful strategies for overcoming barriers as bottom-up collaborations, economic incentives, and demonstration projects. Research priorities were largely social rather than biophysical, with a strong focus on how to motivate broad public support for free-roaming herds. As an ecological and cultural keystone species, restoring large and connected bison herds where human-bison co-existence is feasible will reap rewards for nature and people.

AB  - Survival of juvenile ungulates represents an important demographic parameter that influences population dynamics within ecosystems. In many ecological systems, the mortality of juvenile ungulates is influenced by various factors, including predation by large carnivores, human hunting activities and weather. While wolves Canis lupus are known to prey on moose Alces alces throughout all seasons, brown bears Ursus arctos primarily engage in predation during early summer, while human harvest primarily occurs in autumn and early winter. Hence, understanding the impacts of predation, harvest, and weather on the survival of juvenile moose is crucial for adaptive population management and the determination of sustainable harvest rates. To investigate the summer and autumn-winter survival of moose calves in relation to carnivore occurrence (wolf presence and bear density), summer habitat productivity, winter severity, human harvest, and migratory behaviour (migratory versus resident), we analysed data collected from 39 GPS-collared female moose in south-central Scandinavia. Our findings revealed significant interannual variation in summer survival rates, with areas with relatively higher bear densities exhibiting calf mortality rates twice as high as those in regions with low bear density. During the autumn-winter period, calf survival was lowest in the presence of wolves and deep snow, and it exhibited a negative correlation with the proportion of clearcuts and young forests within the mother's home range. Additionally, calf survival was negatively correlated with the risk of human hunting, and calves of stationary females displayed ten times higher survival rates compared to migratory individuals. Our study provides valuable insights into the survival of moose calves coexisting with two large carnivores and humans. Improving our understanding of the mechanisms causing calf survival to fluctuate has become increasingly important as many local moose populations in Scandinavia are declining and exposed to expanding predator populations, intense hunting pressure, and other threats associated with climate change.

AB  - Determining herbage intake is pivotal for studies on grazing ecology. Direct observation of animals allows describing the interactions of animals with the pastoral environment along the complex grazing process. The objectives of the study were to evaluate the reliability of the continuous bite monitoring (CBM) method in determining herbage intake in grazing sheep compared to the standard double-weighing technique method during 45-min feeding bouts; evaluate the degree of agreement between the two techniques; and to test the effect of different potential sources of variation on the reliability of the CBM. The CBM method has been used to describe the intake behavior of grazing herbivores. In this study, we evaluated a new approach to this method, that is, whether it is a good proxy for determining the intake of grazing animals. Three experiments with grazing sheep were carried out in which we tested for different sources of variations, such as the number of observers, level of detail of bite coding grid, forage species, forage allowance, sward surface height heterogeneity, experiment site, and animal weight, to determine the short-term intake rate (45 min). Observer (P-exp1 = 0.018, P-exp2 = 0.078, and P-exp3 = 0.006), sward surface height (P-exp2 < 0.001), total number of bites observed per grazing session (P-exp2 P-exp3 < 0.001), and sward depletion (P-exp3 < 0.001) were found to affect the absolute error of intake estimation. The results showed a high correlation and agreement between the two methods in the three experiments, although intake was overestimation by CBM on experiments 2 and 3 (181.38 and 214.24 units, respectively). This outcome indicates the potential of CBM to determining forage intake with the benefit of a greater level of detail on foraging patterns and components of the diet. Furthermore, direct observation is not invasive nor disrupts natural animal behavior.

AB  - Wild pigs (Sus scrofa) are invading many areas globally and impacting biodiversity and economies in their non-native range. Thus, wild pigs are often targeted for eradication efforts. Age- and sex-specific body measurements are important for informing these eradication efforts because they reflect body condition, resource availability, and fecundity, which are common indicators of population trajectory. However, body mass is often difficult to collect, especially on large individuals that require specialized equipment or multiple people to weigh. Measurements that can be rapidly taken by a single land or wildlife manager on any size wild pig without aid from specialized equipment would be beneficial if they accurately infer wild pig body mass. Our goals were to assess whether morphometric measurements could accurately predict wild pig body mass, and to provide tools to directly input these measures and estimate wild pig body mass. Using linear models, we quantified the relationship between body mass and morphometric measurements (i.e., body length, chest girth, ear length, eye to snout length, hindfoot length, shoulder length, and tail length) from a subset (n = 102) of wild pigs culled at the Mississippi Alluvial Valley, Mississippi, USA. We evaluated separate models for each individual morphometric measurement. We then used the model coefficients to develop equations to predict wild pig body mass. We validated these equations predicting body mass of 1592 individuals collected across eight areas in Australia, Guam, and the USA for cross-validation. Each developed equation remained accurate when cross-validated across regions. Body length, chest girth, and shoulder length were the morphometrics that best predicted wild pig body mass. Our analyses indicated it is possible to use the presented equations to infer wild pig body mass from simple metrics.

AB  - The diversity of endotherms and ectotherms may be differently affected by ambient temperature and net primary productivity (NPP). Additionally, little is known about how these drivers affect the diversity of guilds of different trophic levels. We assessed the relative role of temperature and NPP in multitrophic guilds of ectothermic (arthropods: ants, ground beetles, spiders, and harvestmen) and endothermic (large mammals) animals along a tropical elevational gradient. We sampled arthropods at eight elevation belts and large mammals at 14 elevation belts in Atlantic rainforest (ranging from 600 to 2450 m.a.s.l.) of Itatiaia National Park, Southeast Brazil. Overall arthropod species richness was more associated with temperature than overall large-mammal species richness, while the latter was more associated with NPP. When separated into trophic guilds, we found that the species richness associated with NPP increased across arthropod trophic levels from herbivores to predators. Conversely, although NPP influenced large-mammal herbivore species richness, its effects did not seem to accumulate across large-mammal trophic levels since the species richness of large-mammal omnivores was more associated with temperature and none of the variables we studied influenced large-mammal predators. We suggest that thermal physiological differences between ectotherms and endotherms are responsible for the way in which arthropods and large mammals interact with or are constrained by the environment. Furthermore, the inconsistency regarding the role of temperature and NPP on species richness across multitrophic guilds of ectotherms and endotherms could indicate that thermal physiological differences might also interfere with energy use and flux in the food web.

AB  - Coralline red algae (CRA) are key players in the construction and maintenance of biogenic reefs, and they have important functional roles in ecological systems in the Southwestern Atlantic (SWA). Like many other marine organisms, CRA are currently affected by global and local stressors, but little is known about their biodiversity and the environmental drivers that influence their distribution patterns in the SWA. In the present study, we quantified the species richness of CRA in six ecoregions within the SWA using DNA-based species delimitation methods. We then verified their distribution and identified the main drivers shaping the macroecological patterns of richness and beta-diversity. We found 79 phylogenetic species that belong to the three main CRA orders (Sporolithales, Corallinales, and Hapalidiales), in the tropical and warm temperate SWA. Temperature, nutrients, and water current velocity were the main environmental drivers of CRAs in the evaluated ecoregions. The Eastern Brazil ecoregion stands out due to its high richness, exclusive species, beta-diversity between ecoregions, and as a transitional zone of the SWA. The results of our study have several important practical implications with repercussions for monitoring actions and conservation planning for the coastal region. These results show that each ecoregion has unique characteristics, and the mesophotic habitat is of primary importance because it harbors species that are not found in other habitats, and because it provides structural connectivity with shallower habitats.

AB  - Predator-prey interactions occur within the context of relative prey abundance, the nutritional value of prey individuals, and their specific vulnerability to predation. Predation patterns can therefore be expected to vary between seasons, age and sex categories, with this variation important for understanding predator-prey ecology. We examined seasonal prey selection by snow leopards (Panthera uncia) on different age and sex categories of Siberian ibex (Capra sibirica) using data collected from 150 kill sites. These were analysed in relation to known ibex population composition using Jacobs' index, which estimates the strength and direction of prey preference or avoidance. Although solitary felids typically select prey of similar or smaller size than themselves, both male and female snow leopards selected for prime-aged ibex males (>5 years old), despite these being at least twice their body mass. Female ibex, yearlings and medium-sized males, which are similar in size to snow leopards, were preyed upon less than expected. In spring, snow leopards increased their prey selection of females and newborn kids, and reduced their selection of prime males. Our results suggest that the vulnerability of ibex to snow leopard predation is related to their agility in negotiating steep mountain terrain. We propose that the much larger body size of prime-aged ibex males reduces their ability to evade snow leopard ambushes on mountain slopes. In spring, the switch to predation on kids likely relates to the ease of hunting because of their lower agility, with a similar explanation for increased predation on females in late gestation. This seasonal switching between different prey categories, and the snow leopard's specialisation to hunt in steep mountainous terrain, may impose limits on sexual size dimorphism commonly seen in other large felids. In contrast, the vulnerability of prime-aged ibex males to snow leopard predation may reflect a sexually selected handicap, imposed by high sexual size dimorphism.

AB  - Underwater imagery survey was conducted to address changes in Antarctic benthic megafauna communities by recent glacial retreat in Marian Cove, where distance from the glacier was proportional to retreat period. Benthic megafauna communities showed lesser variation due to frequent ice-scouring at 10 m than deeper seabed. At deep seabed (50-90 m), where glacier impacts decreased, benthic megafauna was scarce right in front of the glacier, but near the glacier (similar to 10 years after seabed exposure), density peaked (128 ind. m(-2)) with pioneer species. At the outermost site, pioneer species were extremely limited (5 ind. m(-2)) while late-successional species were abundant (42 ind. m(-2)). Taxonomic and functional diversities peaked near the glacier and outermost site, respectively, indicating different mechanisms of structural and functional change after glacial retreat. This study showed a four-step successional process of benthic megafauna communities after glacial retreat in Antarctic nearshore: high disturbance, colonization, transition, and maturing stages.

AB  - Unconsolidated marine sediment habitats spatially make up the majority of global ocean seabed, yet benthic faunal patterns and their abiotic drivers remain poorly understood. Benthic research in Algoa Bay, on the south coast of South Africa, has largely focused on rocky reefs, while the dominant unconsolidated sediment habitats have been poorly studied. This study describes epibenthic assemblages associated with unconsolidated sediment in Algoa Bay, at between 30 and 100 m depth, and investigates the relationship between biotic patterns and physical drivers. Epibenthic abundance data were quantified from benthic imagery and tested against the long-term means and coefficients of variation of 12 abiotic factors, including depth, mean grain size and bottom temperature. Multivariate analyses revealed two statistically distinct epibenthic communities. This pattern was largely explained by depth, mean grain size, mean bottom temperature and mean current speed (cumulative variation of 52.49%). To a lesser extent, the long-term variability of bottom temperature, current speed and dissolved oxygen also influenced the community (cumulative variation of 34.44%). Visual classification of the substrates indicated that a mixed substrate type (i.e. sand and a low percentage of rock) significantly influences the benthic community. The findings suggest that a combination of depth and substrate type are largely responsible for the epibenthic assemblages observed.

AB  - Simple Summary Heat stress drastically affects the productive and reproductive performance of animals in addition to causing welfare issues. Therefore, thermal comfort is an important consideration to avoid performance losses and other adverse effects of heat stress on animal physiology under various production systems. Moreover, it is becoming more important under the recent scenario of climate change. The present study was conducted to develop a thermal comfort index for buffaloes. Physiological parameters of buffaloes and environmental variables were recorded to develop the index models through typical correlation. The most accurate model was based on body surface temperature, rectal temperature and respiratory rate and can be used effectively to indicate the state of thermal comfort in buffaloes under hot and humid climate. Heat stress results in serious performance losses and adversely affects animal health and welfare under various production systems. This study was conducted to develop a thermal comfort model for lactating buffaloes under hot and humid climate. Twenty Nili-Ravi buffaloes were randomly enrolled for this one-year study. Physiological parameters including rectal temperature (RT), respiratory rate (RR), and body surface temperature (BST) and environmental variables such as wet bulb temperature (WBT), dew point temperature (DPT), and black globe temperature (BGT) were recorded twice a week on each Tuesday and Thursday (n = 1602 and 1560, respectively) at 8:00 am and 2:30 pm. Moreover, ambient temperature (AT, degrees C) and relative humidity (RH, %), at an interval of every 30 min were recorded. We used a typical correlation analysis to build the index models for thermal comfort. The results revealed that AT positively correlated with BGT, WBT, DPT, BST, RT, and RR, while RH negatively correlated with RT. Moreover, a physiological index model consisting of BST, RT and RR (P1 = 0.578 x BST + 0.047 x RT + 0.429 x RR) and an environmental index model (E1 = 0.881 x AT + 0.194 x RH + 0.455 x BGT - 0.347 x WBT + 0.032 x DPT) proved to be a more accurate index as a pair to reveal the state of thermal comfort in lactating buffaloes. Moreover, these models correlated well with physiological variables, indicating that this this pair of index models can be used to effectively evaluate the thermal comfort in buffaloes.

AB  - Simple Summary This study was carried out to control the plant Sarcopoterium spinosum in canakkale, Turkey. As a result of grazing, the number of grasses and legumes decreased and the number of shrubs increased. The number of species increased due to shrub control measures but decreased remarkably with grazing. (1) Background: The effects of prickly burnet (Sarcopoterium spinosum) control measures (pulling out, burning and cutting) and grazing on the botanical composition, grazeable dry matter (GDM) yield and nutritional values of rangeland were investigated on Imbros Island (Turkey) in 2010-2013. (2) Methods: The rangeland was grazed by Imbros sheep during the last year of the experiment. About 0.15 ha of rangeland was allocated to each sheep and five sheep were placed in each plot. Grazing was continuous throughout the year. (3) Results: Shrub levels decreased by 50-60% due to pulling out, burning and cutting in the first year and herbaceous species increased. Forbs increased more in the pulled and burnt plots and grasses increased more in the cut plots. In the third year, the shrub level increased to 60-65% and herbaceous species decreased. The decrease in herbaceous species was observed mostly in forbs. Plant cover was mostly (58%) composed of annual species. Development decreased plant cover ratios, but this decrease ceased in the burnt plot in the third year. Grazing also reduced plant cover. Crude protein (CP), NDF, ADF and digestible dry matter (DDM) content did not vary significantly over the experimental period. CP and DDM increased, NDF decreased and ADF did not change in the development plots. Overall, significant differences were not observed in GDM yield and nutritional values due to development efforts (pulling out, burning and cutting). (4) Conclusions: However, cutting is difficult over stony and rough terrain and pulling out creates erosion on sloping surfaces. Therefore, burning is recommended over the entire rangeland and burning or pulling out is recommended over smooth terrain for the temporary control of S. spinosum.

AB  - The widespread occurrence of the wild boar Sus scrofa, its controversial role in natural communities, and its close relationship with humans make this animal an important and convenient subject for studying the history and evolution of natural communities. The territory of Central Asia has been poorly represented in mammalian phylogeographic studies, namely in the case of wild boars and domestic pigs. In this study, we provide new information on wild boar genetic diversity in Central Asia in terms of mitochondrial and Y-chromosome markers and compare the set of haplotypes observed in Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan with those from other parts of the species' range. The wild boar population in Central Asia is characterized by high uniqueness of mitochondrial and Y-chromosome markers and high haplotype diversity (as compared to other Asian regions). A maternal lineage marker (mitochondrial-DNA control region) clearly places this species in the Asian clade, whereas a paternal lineage markers (AMELY + USP9) positions it closer to wild boars from the western clade. Thus, the molecular genetic data supported the existence of a regionally specific subspecies of the wild boar: S. s. nigripes Blanford, 1875. Median-joining network analysis showed that Central Asia may be a center of dispersal and formation of S. scrofa genetic lineages in North Asia.

AB  - Between 2000 and 2015, moose (Alces alces L.) populations within some areas of north-central British Columbia, Canada declined by 70%. Such declines are occurring in other regions within the range of moose. One cause for mortalities of cow and calf moose in British Columbia was apparent starvation, implying a potential connection to food supply. To investigate possible connections between moose declines and industrial forestry, we examined moose winter diets relative to browse availability in six Biogeoclimatic Ecosystem Classification subzones within north-central British Columbia. In the spring of 2017, we collected moose winter pellets. To assess diet, pellets were analyzed using microhistology, a common technique for quantifying the diets of ungulates. In the summer of 2018, we used a modified point-intercept method to survey browse plant availability at pellet collection sites. We related diet composition to plant availability through indices of selection (use of a forage species relative to availability) and values of importance (the proportion of a species in the diet as a function of its occurrence in the environment) of various browse items to moose. Twenty-eight species of potential browse plants were identified in our browse availability surveys. Only 12 of these plants were found in moose pellets, with four plants [subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa Hooker), willow (Salix spp. Linnaeus), paper birch (Betula papyrifera Marshall), and trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michaux)] comprising the majority (93.3%) of the diet. We used mixed-model analyses to examine differences between these top four winter diet items, in relation to: (i) diet composition; (ii) plant availability; (iii) selection by moose; and (iv) importance to moose. Subalpine fir (mean: 45.7%) was a significantly larger diet component in pellets than aspen (5.7%) and willow (19.5%), but there was no significant difference in the proportions of subalpine fir and birch (22.4%). Birch and willow were found in significantly higher proportions than aspen, but proportions of birch and willow in pellets did not differ. The availability of the top four diet items was not significantly different between species. Subalpine fir, aspen, birch, and willow were the most selected diet items, but selection was not significantly different between them. The importance values of subalpine fir, birch, and willow were not significantly different from one another, but all three were significantly greater than the importance value for aspen. Diet composition, availability, selection, and importance did not vary between subzones surveyed. The high selection for and importance of subalpine fir, birch, willow, and aspen by moose in winter demonstrate the need to ensure these browse species are maintained on moose ranges, especially where moose populations are declining. Where industrial forestry impacts the abundance and species composition of winter browses for moose, we encourage forest planners and managers to examine browse availability in relation to moose diet, so that the browse plants important to and selected for by moose can be integrated into forest management objectives.

AB  - The Early Upper Paleolithic period in the Levant is essential in the studies of the establishment of modern human communities outside Africa, and corresponding archaeological evidence may be used to shed light on human ecology, economy and demography. Specifically, cultural differences between two Early Upper Paleolithic entities, the Early Ahmarian and the Levantine Aurignacian, raise the question of differing adaptations. In this article we use archaeofaunal remains from the Early Upper Paleolithic sequence at Manot Cave (Western Galilee, Israel), to track human hunting patterns, carcass transport and processing within the Early Ahmarian (46-42 ka) and Levantine Aurignacian (38-34 ka) phases. We test two hypotheses: 1) the Ahmarian and Aurignacian represent adaptations to different environments; and 2) the two entities differ in mobility patterns and site use.
   Our multivariate taphonomic analysis showed subtle differences in depositional processes between the two phases and demonstrated a primarily anthropogenic complex. In both phases, human subsistence was based on two ungulate species, mountain gazelle (Gazella gazella) and Mesopotamian fallow deer (Dama mesopotamica), with some contribution from birds, tortoises and small mammals. Among the gazelles, it appears that female herds were targeted, and that hunting took place close to the cave. The results of the research show great similarity in environmental exploitation between the Ahmarian and Aurignacian phases concerning prey spectrum and choice, carcass transport and processing. These patterns occupy a middle position between the Middle Paleolithic and the late Epipaleolithic of the region. Despite this, there are also several significant differences between the phases such as increased exploitation of small game (especially birds) and faster accumulation and higher densities of material in the Aurignacian. This may indicate greater occupation intensity during the Aurignacian compared to the Ahmarian, and thus could explain the outstanding character of this entity in the Levant. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Termite infestation is one of the fundamental problems associated with the loss of urban trees and ecological services. However, no such study has been performed in Pakistan to investigate the termite occurrence and assess such damages to urban trees caused by termites. For Lahore, research and comparable data on urban tree damages are rare or missing. This study surveyed six different microhabitats, including Bagh-e-Jinnah, canal vegetation, Model Town Park, Jallo Forestry, RaceCourse Park, and FC College Vegetation employing the three belt transects (100 x 5 m) method. We geo-referenced termite-infested trees to investigate the termite occurrence on living and dead standing trees, termite diversity, and the assessment of tree damage by termites' attack. We recorded four termite species (Odontotermes obesus Rambur, Coptotermes heimi Wasmann, Heterotermes indicola Wasmann, and Microtermes obesi Holmgren) representing two families (Rhinotermitidae and Termitidae). However, the diversity indices revealed that 0. obesus (higher termite) and C. heimi (lower termite) were dominant with 46.60 and 36% of occurrence among observed trees, respectively. Kernel density function indicated that the Lahore Canal and Bagh-e-Jinnah plantation shared all four termites' infestation evenly compared to other study sites. We observed the maximum number of damaged trees by termites in canal vegetation with the most damaged exotic tree species Populus euramericana along the canal green belt. Additionally, we observed significant (P < 0.05) termite-tree interactions with exotic, living, and dead standing tree species and found termite colony size positively (R=0.985) correlated with the tree trunk diameter up to breast height (DBH). The average population of termites per unit volume of deadwood log was (0.39/cm(3)) within all plantation sites. In conclusion, this study provides simple, reckless, and inexpensive knowledge about the assessment of termite damage to trees, which may give a better idea in making decisions on tree selection and management in urban ecosystems.

AB  - Pesticide use is increasing worldwide, negatively affecting ecosystems, including beneficial insects. The widespread use of neonicotinoid insecticides raises concerns due to their unintended effects on non-target beneficial organisms. Even at sublethal levels, these chemicals can impair development, disrupt physiology, and affect reproduction in both sexes. The impact of larval exposure on key decomposers, that are important for sustaining ecological functions in farmland areas, remains poorly understood. Closing this knowledge gap is essential to fully assess the broader ecological consequences of neonicotinoids. Here, we examined the impacts of the neonicotinoid Imidacloprid on four beneficial dung-decomposing black scavenger fly species: Sepsis thoracica, S. punctum, S. fulgens, and S. cynipsea. Larval exposure to Imidacloprid reduced survival rates, delayed development, and decreased sex-specific body size, to varying degrees among species. While adult females exposed to contaminated dung mated and laid eggs, their first-clutch fecundity was lower compared to controls. Egg hatching success was unaffected regardless of the exposed sex, but total offspring numbers were reduced at the highest pesticide concentrations. Our findings demonstrate that Imidacloprid significantly disrupts larval development and adult reproduction in dung-decomposing insects. These results highlight the potential threats that seemingly benign pesticides pose to biodiversity for non-economic insect species. The consistency of effects across species underscores the broader threat of toxic agents to biodiversity and therefore likely to ecosystem stability.

AB  - It remains uncertain whether native plant diversity increases resistance to plant invasions at meaningful scales in nature due to contradictions between observational and experimental studies. In a field survey of 253 sites spanning 15 latitudinal degrees in China, we found that the relative abundance of the invader Alternanthera philoxeroides decreased with increasing native plant richness. Results from a 3-year field experiment and a 2-year mesocosm experiment further demonstrated that native diversity can suppress A. philoxeroides population growth (but not dominance) when natives precede the invader, or limit its population size when natives arrive after the invader. Insect herbivores and the soil biota were unlikely to influence diversity-based resistance in the field experiment, as their effects on both A. philoxeroides and native species did not change with native richness. Our results provide solid evidence that native plant diversity can provide resistance against plant invasion in natural ecosystems.

AB  - Understanding factors driving resource selection and habitat use of different species is an important component of management and conservation. Feral horses (Equus caballus) are free ranging across various vegetation types in the western United States, yet few studies have quantified their resource selection and seasonal use. We conducted a study to determine effects of vegetation community, distance to water, and topographic variables on seasonal resource selection in 2 feral horse populations in Great Basin sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) ecosystems of west-central Utah, USA: Conger Herd Management Area (HMA) and Frisco HMA. We deployed global positioning system (GPS) radio-collars on 38 female horses and GPS-transmitters braided and glued into the tail hair of 14 males, collecting locations every 2 hours for 1-4 years between 2016 and 2020. We calculated home range size and core use area of social groups (harems) and bachelor males using auto-correlated kernel density estimators for each biologically defined season (breeding, fall, and winter) per study year. We examined seasonal home range size and overlap of harem groups and bachelor males and compared movement speed of bachelors and harems among seasons. We determined seasonal resource selection in a use-availability framework using resource selection functions. We hypothesized that horses would select for areas of high herbaceous vegetation, that water would be a key variable in resource selection models like other equids, and home range size in winter would be largest because horses can eat snow for hydration and could therefore roam farther from surface water. Mean annual home range size was 103.12 +/- 37.38 km(2) (SD) for Conger harems and 117.47 +/- 32.75 km(2) for Frisco harems. At Conger there was no difference in home range size between harem groups and bachelor males, but home range size was smaller in winter than other seasons, whereas winter home range size at Frisco was larger than other seasons. Bachelor males moved at higher speeds than harems during all seasons, and harem groups from both populations had lower movement speeds in winter. Harem groups had distinct winter ranges with little overlap on breeding season ranges. In both populations, all horses selected for herbaceous vegetation types and avoided forest relative to shrubland throughout the year. Harems at Frisco were consistently located closer to water sources, whereas selection for water sources by Conger harems varied seasonally, with winter having the lowest selection. Harem groups at Conger had an average of 10.6% of their home ranges outside the HMA boundary and Frisco harems had up to 66.8% outside, likely because of the horseshoe shape of Frisco HMA in which shrub meadows (foraging areas) comprise the horseshoe center, which is outside the HMA. Our results highlight the importance of water sources, which were a key predictor of horse movement patterns in our study. We emphasize the utility of telemetry devices to understand resource selection of feral horses at a fine scale, enabling management to be more targeted and facilitate planning.

AB  - This study describes changes in the community structure of epipelagic copepods along the west coast of the Baja California Peninsula before and during El Nino 2015. We tested the hypothesis that the area was undergoing tropicalization based on changes in species composition, diversity, and latitudinal distribution as well as changes in the abundance of herbivore and carnivore species. The warming effect on zooplankton communities was more evident north of Punta Eugenia in 2015 with a few changes in the southern portion between 2014 and 2015, it was also coincident with a higher influence of tropical waters up to Ensenada and a decrease in zooplankton biovolume values, with values lower than 60%, also lower than those observed in 2014. No significant changes in the species richness of the whole region were found. However, the main signs of tropicalization associated with El Nino 2015 were an increase in local species richness, an increase in tropical species abundance with an expansion to the north of their geographical distribution, and a decrease in the abundance of omnivorous-herbivorous species. These changes in community structure were related to the increase in warm water flow towards the north during 2015, a deeper thermocline, a decrease in chlorophyll-a concentration, as well as a deeper maximum of chlorophyll-a concentrations. The presence of the tropical species Pleuromamma abdominalis and Subeucalanus subcrassus with high abundance in the northern region suggest they are biological indicators of tropicalization processes during El Nino events.

AB  - Illegal hunting for bushmeat in or near protected areas is a significant threat to biodiversity conservation. This study assessed knowledge by local people of the occurrence of topi (Damaliscus lunatus) in the Serengeti Ecosystem and linked it with the level of illegal hunting for bushmeat consumption. A total of 150 households from three villages were randomly selected and interviewed using semistructured questionnaires to gather the required information. The majority of local people (91.4%) were able to identify the topi species correctly, and 71.0% reported that topi were still available in their area. Moreover, the local people's knowledge of the occurrence of topi and their bushmeat consumption differed significantly between tribes and age classes. The majority of respondents (97.8%) had no hunting permit. These results indicate that illegal hunting for either subsistence or commercial purposes occurs in the area and is currently a major threat to topi survival. We recommend the establishment of bushmeat butcheries since many people prefer to eat bushmeat. Finally, we call for further research to specifically assess the magnitude of the decline of the topi population in the area.

AB  - Coastal ecosystems are essential for absorbing and bouncing back from the impacts of climate change, yet accelerating climate change is causing anthropogenically-derived stressors in these ecosystems to grow. The effects of stressors are more difficult to foresee when they act simultaneously, however, predicting these effects is critical for understanding ecological change. Spartina alterniflora (Spartina), a foundational saltmarsh plant key to coastal resilience, is subject to biological stress such as herbivory, as well as anthropogenic stress such as chemical pollution. Using saltmarsh mesocosms as a model system in a fully factorial experiment, we tested whether the effects of herbivory and two chemicals (oil and dispersant) were mediated or magnified in com-bination. Spartina responded to stressors asynchronously; ecophysiology responded negatively to oil and her-bivores in the first 2-3 weeks of the experiment, whereas biomass responded negatively to oil and herbivores cumulatively throughout the experiment. We generally found mixed multi-stressor effects, with slightly more antagonistic effects compared to either synergistic or additive effects, despite significant reductions in Spartina biomass and growth from both chemical and herbivore treatments. We also observed an indirect positive effect of oil on Spartina, via a direct negative effect on insect herbivores. Our findings suggest that multi-stressor effects in our model system, 1) are mixed but can be antagonistic more often than expected, a finding contrary to previous assumptions of primarily synergistic effects, 2) can vary in duration, 3) can be difficult to discern a priori, and 4) can lead to ecological surprises through indirect effects with implications for coastal resilience. This leads us to conclude that understanding the simultaneous effects of multiple stressors is critical for predicting foundation-species persistence, discerning ecosystem resilience, and managing and mitigating impacts on ecosystem services.

AB  - Practices that improve the quantity, composition, and persistence of ground cover can contribute to a range of ecosystem services that support agricultural production, regulate climate, reduce erosion and support nutrient cycling. In rangeland grazing systems, incorporating periods of rest and matching stocking rates to feed availability is commonly used with the goal of improving land condition and productivity at a property scale. Understanding and quantifying differences in ground cover associated with changes to grazing management can provide livestock producers with greater confidence in the outcomes associated with their management. It can also demonstrate their nature positive activities which may be valued in emerging markets. This study sought to quantify any changes in ground cover resulting from changed grazing management (strategically managing the timing, intensity and duration of grazing events to maintain or improve land condition) across seven mixed grazing (cattle, sheep and/or goats) study sites in the semi-arid rangelands of western New South Wales, Australia. Time-series estimates of ground cover derived from Landsat imagery for each study site were compared with biophysically similar regional benchmark areas as controls. Overall, ground cover was found to have increased significantly (2-7%) following change in grazing management at four of the seven study sites, relative to control benchmark areas. It was apparent different land units varied in their response to the management change, and that the preceding 12 months rainfall (such as wet, intermediate or dry rainfall years) did not have a consistently significant effect on the relative response. Results of this study highlight that improvements in ground cover and land condition may be achieved through changes to grazing management, but also that there are complexities in both achieving and measuring any change. This study demonstrates the practical application of remotely sensed cover data and dynamic regional comparison techniques to document environmental outcomes at the property scale from grazing management in low input, extensive rangeland grazing systems.
   Managing the timing, intensity and duration of livestock grazing is commonly used with the goal of improving land condition and productivity. Using time-series estimates of ground cover derived from satellite imagery, this study demonstrates that significant increases in ground cover can be achieved by strategically managing grazing in the semiarid rangelands of western NSW, Australia. The complexities of achieving and measuring changes in ground cover are highlighted and potential opportunities in using this remote sensing monitoring approach are discussed.This article belongs to the Collection 2023 ARS Conference.

AB  - Intraspecific variation in plants is expected to have profound impacts on the arthropod communities associated with them. Because sexual dimorphism in plants is expected to provide consistent variation among individuals of the same species, researchers have often studied the effect it has on associated arthropods. Nevertheless, most studies have focused on the effect of sexual dimorphism in a single or a few herbivores, thus overlooking the potential effects on the whole arthropod community. Our main objective was to evaluate effects of Buddleja cordata's plant-sex on its associated arthropod community. We surveyed 13 pairs of male and female plants every 2 months during a year (June 2010 to April 2011). Every sampling date, we measured plant traits (water content and leaf thickness), herbivory, and the arthropod community. We did not find differences in herbivory between plant sex or through time. However, we found differences in water content through time, with leaf water-content matching the environmental seasonality. For arthropod richness, we found 68 morphospecies associated with female and 72 with male plants, from which 53 were shared by both sexes. We did not observe differences in morphospecies richness; however, we found sex-associated differences in the diversity of all species and differences on the diversity of the most abundant species with an interesting temporal component. During peak flowering season, male plants showed higher values on both parameters, but during the peak fructification season female plants showed the higher values on both diversity parameters. Our research exemplifies the interaction between plant-phenology and plant-sex as drivers of arthropod communities' diversity, even when plant sexual-dimorphism is inconspicuous, and highlighting the importance of accounting for seasonal variation. We stress the need of conducting more studies that test this time-dependent framework in other dioecious systems, as it has the potential to reconcile previous contrasting observations reported in the literature.

AB  - Understanding landscape scale connectivity is an essential component in the management of invasive species since connectivity facilitates their invasion potential. Invasive wild pigs (Sus scrofa) are among the most prolific invaders on the planet, causing billions of dollars in agricultural and environmental damage annually. Newly introduced to Canada in the 1980s, we examined wild pig invasion potential across the northern prairies from western Canada into the currently wild pig-free northern U.S. states. We used GPS collar data collected in the Canadian prairies to quantify resource selection and incorporated results into an electric circuit theory framework to evaluate potential regional landscape connectivity. While available landcover types in this region were dominated by crops and grasslands, wild pigs were predominately located in deciduous forest, crops, and wetlands. Resource selection modelling indicated wild pigs selected deciduous forest and wetlands over other landcover types. These selection tendencies resulted in areas at greater risk of occupation in an intermixture dominated by crops interspersed with waterbodies and deciduous forest fragments, which facilitated movement. Given the pervasiveness of this intermixture across the northern prairies, there was a high potential for invasive wild pigs to move throughout much of the region with areas in southern Saskatchewan and Manitoba, northeastern Montana, North and South Dakota, and western portions of Minnesota being particularly vulnerable. Our work highlights a need for monitoring and science-based response strategies for likely southward spread of this invasive species to prevent or reduce potential crop damage, risks to native species, and disease transmission to humans, pets, livestock, and wildlife.

AB  - AimPlant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) play crucial roles in supporting plant growth and, therefore, in undisturbed ecosystems and agricultural systems. We aimed to understand how these microbial communities change under different land use and environmental conditions. This is an important prerequisite to utilising the positive impact PGPB may have for sustainable food production.Location537 sites across Aotearoa New Zealand.Time Period2013-2018.Major Taxa StudiedPlant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB).MethodsWe surveyed the PGPB in indigenous and exotic plantation forests, sheep and beef grasslands, dairy pastures and horticulture sites.ResultsPGPB community alpha-diversity increased with land use intensity, and the greatest portion of explainable variation in alpha-diversity was accounted for by soil nutrients, metal concentrations, and unexplained spatial patterns. Variation in PGPB community composition, on the other hand, was highest in the forest and horticulture sites and lowest in the grazed pastures. The variation was best accounted for by shared variation among land use, soil nutrients and soil metal concentrations. The relative abundance of nitrogen-fixing PGPB taxa decreased with land use intensity, largely driven by a decrease in Rhizobiales. In contrast, taxa in the order Bacillales, known for phosphate and potassium solubilisation, increased in relative abundance. Key environmental variables limiting the distributions of specific PGPB taxa included soil pH, several nutrients and the concentrations of cadmium and zinc.Main ConclusionsOverall, we showed that PGPB show distinct patterns in response to land use and soil environmental variables, and these results contribute towards an understanding of the interplay between how we use our soil, their physicochemical properties and the function of the microbial communities within them. This increased understanding of the distribution of PGPB is crucial for advancing our ability to optimise and take advantage of the benefits these bacteria bring to both natural and agricultural land.

AB  - Reduction of floristic diversity may trigger local competition between native wildlife, particularly ungulates, and livestock. In this study, we analysed spatial and temporal niche partitioning between the vulnerable, endemic Italian roe deer Capreolus capreolus italicus and free-ranging cattle livestock (cattle) in the Gargano National Park in Southern Italy. We carried out an intensive camera-trapping during the territorial phase (March-August) of the roe deer, in 2015, with a stratified sampling design. We placed camera traps in 60 randomly chosen locations, each one sampled for 20 consecutive days, within the borders of the National Park. Camera trap data were used to assess patterns of activity rhythms and overlaps between roe deer and free-ranging livestock, as well as interspecific spatial interactions through two-species occupancy models. Activity rhythms of roe deer and livestock showed a moderate-high overlap (68%), with roe deer mostly active at dawn and dusk and livestock mostly diurnal. The occupancy of the roe deer was the highest where livestock was not recorded and the lowest where it co-occurred with livestock. Thus, our results showed no temporal partitioning between roe deer and livestock. Conversely, differences in the use of space among those species occurred. Specifically, the roe deer seems to avoid the areas most frequented by livestock, probably because of the locally-reduced food availability.

AB  - Introduction This study evaluates the effectiveness of soil reconstruction and restoration in the Jiangcang coal mining area on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, where harsh environmental conditions pose significant challenges to ecological restoration.Methods Two phases of ecological restoration were implemented, with outcomes assessed based on vegetation coverage, species diversity, biomass, soil properties, and community similarity.Results The results demonstrate that soil reconstruction significantly improved soil fertility, vegetation coverage, and community stability without noticeable degradation over time. The use of sheep manure increased species diversity by introducing native seeds, addressing the shortage of suitable grass species in alpine areas. Comparatively, the second phase of restoration, which included soil reconstruction, has elevated the vegetation coverage to 80%, matching natural background levels, and has also demonstrated superior outcomes in terms of soil stability, nutrient content, and other aspects compared to traditional methods. While aboveground biomass showed rapid recovery, belowground biomass lagged, indicating a need for longer-term restoration. Restored slopes exhibited higher similarity to natural alpine meadows compared to platforms, suggesting the dominance of the artificially seeded species on the platform areas hinders the reproduction of other species, which is unfavorable for the evolution of vegetation diversity.Discussion This study emphasizes the effectiveness of soil reconstruction, organic amendment, and other restoration measures, providing important experience and reference for mine ecological restoration in similar high-altitude mining areas.

AB  - Island ecosystems provide natural laboratories to assess the impacts of isolation on population persistence. However, most studies of persistence have focused on a single species, without comparisons to other organisms they interact with in the ecosystem. The case study of moose and gray wolves on Isle Royale allows for a direct contrast of genetic variation in isolated populations that have experienced dramatically differing population trajectories over the past decade. Whereas the Isle Royale wolf population recently declined nearly to extinction due to severe inbreeding depression, the moose population has thrived and continues to persist, despite having low genetic diversity and being isolated for similar to 120 years. Here, we examine the patterns of genomic variation underlying the continued persistence of the Isle Royale moose population. We document high levels of inbreeding in the population, roughly as high as the wolf population at the time of its decline. However, inbreeding in the moose population manifests in the form of intermediate-length runs of homozygosity suggestive of historical inbreeding and purging, contrasting with the long runs of homozygosity observed in the smaller wolf population. Using simulations, we confirm that substantial purging has likely occurred in the moose population. However, we also document notable increases in genetic load, which could eventually threaten population viability over the long term. Overall, our results demonstrate a complex relationship between inbreeding, genetic diversity, and population viability that highlights the use of genomic datasets and computational simulation tools for understanding the factors enabling persistence in isolated populations.

AB  - Although insect herbivorous communities in tropical forests are known to exhibit strong seasonality, few studies have systematically assessed temporal patterns of variation in community structure and plant-herbivore interactions in early successional arboreal communities. We assessed seasonal and interannual variation of the diversity and composition of herbivorous beetles and the tree-herbivore network in a recently established polyculture forest plantation, during the dry and the rainy seasons of 2012 and of 2013. Species richness was similar between years, while the ecological diversity was higher in 2012. Comparing seasons, no differences were found in 2012, whereas in 2013, the species richness and ecological diversity were higher during the dry season. The species composition differed radically across years and seasons. Moreover, a quantitative nested pattern was consistently found across both temporal scales, more influenced by species densities. We found temporal changes in the species strength, whereas connectance and interaction evenness remained stable. Rapid temporal changes in the structural complexity of recently established polyculture plantations and the availability and quality of the trophic resources they offer may act as drivers of beetle diversity patterns, promoting rapid variation in herbivore composition and some interacting attributes. Nonetheless, network structure, connectance, and interaction evenness remained similar, suggesting that reorganizations in the distribution of species may determine the maintenance of the patterns of interaction. Further work assessing long-term temporal dynamics of herbivore beetle assemblages are needed to more robustly relate diversity and interaction patterns to biotic and abiotic factors and their implications in management programs.

AB  - Complex agroforestry systems can host similar biodiversity levels to adjacent continuous forests and can offer important ecosystem services for wildlife. Species inhabiting adjacent forests, as well as species that prefer agroforestry systems, can benefit from this habitat matrix. It is necessary, however, to understand the species-specific adaptability to such a complex matrix. Indonesia is a biodiversity hotspot and hosts many endemic species that are threatened with extinction. Its human population relies heavily on agriculture, meaning that finding a balance between crop productivity and biodiversity is key for the long-term sustainability of local communities and wildlife. We aim to determine the influence of the presence of shade trees and distance to the forest on the detection rates of wildlife in coffee home gardens. In West Java, Indonesia, we monitored 23 gardens between April 2018 and March 2021 via camera traps, totalling 3856 days of monitoring in shade-grown and 3338 days in sun-exposed gardens. We also collected data in the nearby montane rainforest, totalling 1183 days of monitoring. We used Generalized Additive Models to estimate the influence of shade cover and distance to the forest on the detection rates of wildlife. The Sunda leopard cat Prionailurus javanensis was found more frequently in shade-grown gardens and used both the forest and agroforest matrix. Wild boars Sus scrofa mostly occurred in gardens adjacent to the forest, while barred buttonquails Turnix suscitator were associated with gardens far (>1 km) from the forest. Several species (civets Viverricula indica and Paradoxus musangus javanicus, Horsfield's treeshrew Tupaia javanica, Javan ferret badger Melogale orientalis, Javan mongoose Herpestes javanicus) were not influenced by shade cover and distance to the forest, suggesting they are well adapted to the agroforestry system. Still, species of high conservation importance, such as Javan leopard Panthera pardus melas, Sunda porcupine Hystrix javanica, and grizzled langur Presbytis comata, were present in the forest but not in the agroforest, suggesting that the replacement of the forest by the agroforestry matrix is still detrimental. Nevertheless, it is important to maintain the complexity of the agroforestry system and connectivity with the neighbouring continuous forest to favour the long-term sustainability of this environment and the conservation of endemic species.

AB  - There are underlying patterns involved in predation, particularly for an adaptable species like leopard. One of them is size of the prey. The selection of a prey by a carnivore is typically determined by the trade-off between energy spent and gained. Here size becomes even more consequential when conflict is involved, but most studies typically map all species as a single entity at a single spatial scale. This study aimed at understanding the multiscale nature of the conflict based on the size livestock attacked by leopards (large stock - cattle and small stock - goat and sheep). The methodology encompassed targeted sampling which included the collection of the GPS locations of the attack sites. Spatial layers of 14 environmental variables that represented three spatial scales i.e. proximate (cache-distance), local (daily-movement), and landscape (home-range) scale were then created through remotely sensed data. After that Generalized additive models were utilized for analysis, with Delta AIC used for model selection and evaluation was performed via AUC and TSS statistic. Our results indicate a spatial distinction in predation strategies. In the final model the statistically significant variables for large stock included a higher proportion of cover, and a lower proportion of settlements at the home-range scale, very low human population density at daily-movement scale, and NDVI representing moderately dense vegetation and terrain ruggedness index representing flat terrain at cache-distance scale. Similarly, for small stock the variables included a higher proportion of agricultural land and NDVI values representing open terrain. The effective degrees of freedom was higher than 2 for most of the variables, indicating non-linear relationships. We inferred that the leopards' targeted large stock in more secluded dry deciduous forests farther from human settlements, where they may be found grazing alone. In contrast, smaller stock, being easier to catch, are killed more frequently in rugged terrain across a wider scrub landscape with scantier cover. Consequently, this selective selection based on size might have its basis in the perceived risk of being chased off by people and the reward in terms of the size of the acquired meal.

AB  - Wild pigs (Sus scrofa) are a widespread exotic, invasive species that pose ecological, agricultural, and human health risks in their invaded range. Wildlife managers must manage wild pig abundance and range expansion to mitigate these risks. The diversity of stakeholders involved in the issue of wild pig management complicates efforts to manage the species, and, to be successful, wildlife professionals must consider the human dimensions associated with wild pig management. The prevalence of privately owned lands in Texas, USA necessitates cooperation to enact effective management policies. In this study, we investigate the impact of hunter motivations on wild pig harvest quantity. Motivations driving wild pig hunting are diverse. While the majority of wild pig hunters in Texas are motivated by trophy value, meat-motivated hunters harvest more wild pigs per day afield. Wildlife managers should develop plans that include various management techniques to control wild pig population growth and damage. Education and outreach will continue to be important for involving private landowners in effective wild pig management.

AB  - Simple Summary Freshwater ecosystems are embedded in terrestrial ecosystems to form an integral whole. In the context of global climate change, freshwater ecosystems may be irreversibly negatively affected; thus, aquatic organisms dependent on freshwater ecosystems are severely affected. However, terrestrial life may also experience unexpected crises due to the collapse of freshwater ecosystems, and we know very little about the relationship between terrestrial life and freshwater ecosystems. Therefore, we conducted our research on the Tibetan Plateau, an area with a dense distribution of lakes. We analyzed the relationship between the number of Tibetan antelopes (an ungulate mammal distributed in the region) and the number of lakes, and the distribution of the terrain and vegetation around the lake. Our results indicated that a greater abundance of Tibetan antelopes was associated with larger lakes, flatter terrain, and proximity to lakes, which may all be factors that affect the survival of this species. Our study suggests that lakes may provide a better habitat for ungulates in such a fragile ecosystem, including a different predation risk and more food resources, and this also provides a new research idea for the study of multi-species coexistence on the Tibetan Plateau.Abstract The influence of freshwater ecosystems on terrestrial taxa in high-altitude regions with challenging access, such as the Tibetan Plateau, remains inadequately understood. This knowledge gap is particularly significant due to the fragility of these ecosystems, characterized by low primary productivity. Ungulates, in particular, may exhibit high sensitivity to even minor alterations in plant availability, potentially stemming from global climate change. Consequently, the investigation of these ecosystems may offer valuable insights into addressing future challenges posed by climate change. Here, to fill this knowledge gap, we explore the relationship between lakes and Tibetan antelopes in an even more vulnerable region, the Tibetan Plateau. We found that the Tibetan antelope population was higher in areas with larger lakes, and where the terrain near the lakes was flatter. At the same time, vegetation cover and plant diversity were higher near the lake compared to areas farther away from the lake. This phenomenon can be elucidated by the fact that lakes offer Tibetan antelopes a richer food supply and reduced predation risk. Our study provides new perspectives for researchers to explore the cross-ecosystem impacts of climate change.

AB  - Depending on the habitats they live in, temperate ungulates have adapted to different degrees to seasonally changing forage and weather conditions, and to specific escape strategies from predators. Alpine chamois, a mountain ungulate, and red deer, originally adapted to open plains, would therefore be expected to differ in their physiological responses to potential stressors. Based on 742 chamois and 1557 red deer fecal samples collected year-round every 2 weeks for 4 years at the same locations within a strictly protected area in the Swiss Alps, we analyzed glucocorticoid metabolite (FGM) concentrations for both species. Results from linear mixed effects models revealed no physiological stress response to changing visitor numbers, but instead to drought conditions for both species during summer. In winter, FGM concentrations increased with increasing snow height in both species, but this response was modulated by temperature in red deer. Chamois showed a stronger stress response to increasing snow height during November and December than between January and March, while FGM concentrations increased with decreasing temperature throughout winter. An increase in FGM concentrations with decreasing forage digestibility during winter was found only for red deer. The results are thus partly in contradiction to expectations based on feeding type and adaptations to different habitats between the two species. The lack of a response to forage digestibility in chamois may reflect either better adaptation to difficult feeding conditions in subalpine forests, or, by contrast, strong constraints imposed by forage quality. The similar responses of both species to weather conditions in winter suggest that climatic factors at the elevations examined here are sufficiently harsh to be limiting to temperate ungulates regardless of their specific adaptations to this environment.

AB  - Micropropagation of epiphytic bromeliads associated to translocation may act as an important tool for conservation, restauration or mitigation initiatives. Vriesea incurvata is an epiphytic tank-forming bromeliad endemic to the Atlantic Forest, being an important species in gallery forest environments. Seeds of V. incurvata were germinated in vitro , and plants were acclimatized and translocated to each of two microhabitats (gallery forest and forest interior) of an Atlantic Forest fragment in South Brazil that harbors few individuals of the species. The 152 plants (76 per microhabitat) were monitored for survival and development, and abiotic data were recorded. There was increased development of morphometric parameters of the plants in the gallery forest, and survival rate ensured an 800% increase in the original population of V. incurvata in the study area. Plant survival and development parameters were positively related to light and relative air humidity. In gallery forest, plants flowered and set fruit, indicating their relationship with pollinators, since V. incurvata provides food for fauna. Further, the establishment of the individuals increased the availability of water in the canopy by accumulation in the rosettes, as well as the complexity of the canopy structure, providing a site for the occurrence of detritivorous, predatory and herbivorous arthropods. Thus, based on the method applied to V. incurvata , inserting epiphytic species into forest environments can be an efficient tool for artificial habitat regeneration, incrementing functional diversity and improving environmental quality.

AB  - Understanding how land use change impacts bat diet is vital to bat conservation efforts. Little is known about trophic level shifts that occur within bat diets due to variations in the extent of agriculture. Here, we measured delta 13C and delta 15N stable isotopic compositions from a modern, post-bomb (after 1950 CE) bat guano core over a 65-year period to answer the following research questions: 1) What vegetation changes are revealed by the delta 13C and delta 15N stable isotope compositions? 2) What changes in bat diet occurred in the southeastern Appalachian region? Using this data we also suggest bat conservation recommendations. Based on stratigraphic changes in isotopic values, we determined three distinct phases when bat diet shifted between predatory and herbivorous insect prey. After comparing the stable isotopic compositions to cropland data, we found that changes in the trophic level of bat diet are coeval with changes in agricultural land use. We attribute increased consumption of predatory insects to phases with increased C4 plants (i.e., crops such as maize). We show that increased agricultural diversity (i.e., crops with high C3 to C4 plant mixtures), add structural complexity to a landscape, providing greater food availability and refugia for a diversity of insects. Overall, we found that C3 to C4 crop diversity, acted as the mechanism driving bat diet variation between 1952 and 2018 CE. Our recommendations to improve bat conservation include increasing agricultural diversity and increasing vegetative field boundaries in agricultural areas. From this study, we demonstrate that applying paleoecological methods can inform bat conservation efforts.

AB  - Background: Due to the effects of climate change and overgrazing in recent decades, alternative stable states in the alpine Kobresia meadow degradation process have coexisted in the same geographical and climatic environment, with variations occurring among microsites.
   Methods: We used a space-for-time substitution approach to explore the synergies of microsite variation according to its numerical characteristics and the proportion of each stable state at various stages of succession in alpine Kobresia meadows on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.
   Results: (1) The highest average aboveground biomass in summer was 196.220.3gm(-2), with significantly higher levels of biomass in <= 3.65 sheep unit ha(-1) than in other levels of grazing intensity, while the parameters showed no significant differences among grazing intensity levels in >3.65 sheep unit ha(-1). (2) The importance of plant functional groups, aboveground biomass, and niche breadth of Poaceae and Cyperaceae significantly decreased as the grazing intensity increased. (3) The effects of >= 0 degrees C accumulated temperature, total precipitation, altitude, longitude, and latitude cumulatively contributed less than 20% of the variation in the distribution of functional group characteristics across microsites.
   Conclusions: (1) Overgrazing decreases primary production in alpine Kobresia meadows, but ecosystem responses regulate plant community structure and botanical components so as to partially counteract grazing disturbance. (2) Overgrazing changed the proportion of microsites, which in turn led to regime shift in the plant community and subsequent synergies between the microsites of plant communities and their stable states.

AB  - Spatial capture-recapture models have been widely used to estimate densities of species where individuals can be uniquely identified, but alternatives have been developed for estimation of densities for unmarked populations. In this study we used camera-trap records from 2018 to estimate densities of a species that does not always have individually identifiable marks, Baird's tapir Tapirus bairdii, in the Sierra Madre de Chiapas, southern Mexico. We compared the performance of the spatial capture-recapture model with spatial mark-resight and random encounter models. The density of Baird's tapir did not differ significantly between the three models. The estimate of density was highest using the random encounter model (26/100 km(2), 95% CI 12-41) and lowest using the capture-recapture model (8/100 km(2), 95% CI 4-16). The estimate from the spatial mark-resight model was 10/100 km(2) (95% CI 8-14), which had the lowest coefficient of variation, indicating a higher precision than with the other models. Using a second set of camera-trap data, collected in 2015-2016, we created occupancy models and extrapolated density to areas with potential occupancy of Baird's tapir, to generate a population estimate for the whole Sierra Madre de Chiapas. Our findings indicate the need to strengthen, and possibly expand, the protected areas of southern Mexico and to develop an action plan to ensure the conservation of Baird's tapir.

AB  - Recovering deer populations are causing conflict across Europe, especially in the vicinity of protected areas where densities are generally higher. Consequently, a variety of management approaches, such as the provision of winter feeding, have been deployed to keep deer from foraging in undesired areas in an attempt to mitigate conflicts. However, as large ungulates play a key role in nutrient recycling and redistribution, management actions that affect their space use and introduce additional nutrients into a system may translate into changes in the biogeochemistry of protected areas. Yet, little is known about the implications of such deer-management strategies on nutrient patterns. Here, we tested the effects of intensive supplementary feeding in combination with winter enclosures on nutrient distribution in a strictly protected area in Central Europe, the Bavarian Forest National Park. We found significant effects of the current management approach on plant nutrients with elevated nutrient concentrations not only within, but, importantly, extending up to several hundred meters around the enclosures/feeding stations. The increased nutrient concentrations could have cascading consequences for soil microbial activity, plant community composition and other herbivores. Our results illustrate that management actions designed to solve a specific problem (mitigating human-wildlife conflict), may alter local landscape chemistry and influence broader ecosystem functions. Ultimately, this may compromise conservation success, highlighting the need to critically evaluate all potential consequences of common management approaches such as supplementary feeding.

AB  - Hunting triggers behavioral responses in wildlife that may have important consequences for conservation and wildlife management. We studied movement and habitat selection in 51 global positioning system-collared red deer (Cervus elaphus) in response to 63 large-scale (x = 18.8 km2) drive hunts conducted in 2015-2022 on a military training area in southern Germany. The drive hunts were characterized by a low density of beaters and dogs to avoid rapid and long-distance displacement of red deer. We determined if red deer spatial responses to drive hunts differed in various forest covers, between sexes, and in relation to the individual position prior to the hunt. On the hunting days, red deer increased their hourly displacement rates and shifted their preference for forest versus open habitats from early morning to late morning hours. Individuals initially located within the boundaries of the hunted areas exhibited longer maximum net displacements, had a greater probability of leaving their home ranges, and spent longer times outside of their home ranges than individuals outside the hunted areas. All these parameters were greater in the more forested site than in the less forested site. Males displayed shorter net displacements than females. Red deer moved away (i.e., fled) from their initial positions for variable periods, either only during the hunt or until the next day. The probability of prolonged flight was greater in the more forested site and more likely if the individuals were deeper in the forest in the less forested site. The prolonged flight behavior was desired from the hunters' perspective because red deer displaying this type of response were less likely to leave the hunted area during the hunt. Prolonged flight was associated with greater costs for the red deer, such as greater movement distances after the hunt and longer times outside of home ranges. Wildlife managers should consider that drive hunts may cause prolonged behavioral responses in game that occur both inside and outside the hunted areas. These responses depend on habitat characteristics and may be stronger in more forested landscapes.
   We studied movement and habitat selection in red deer in response to drive hunts at 2 sites on a military training area in southern Germany. On the days of the drive hunts, red deer displayed 2 types of response: either they fled quickly and returned soon after the hunt, or they moved away slower and continued to flee until the next day. The prolonged flight was more common in the more forested site, suggesting that a mosaic of forested and open habitat may help alleviate the long-term disturbance effect of drive hunts in red deer. image

AB  - Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA) are very important in regulating the process of soil nitrification. However, little is known how responses of AOB and AOA communities to yak excreta application in wetland soils. We investigated AOB and AOA community composition using excreta application treatments to examine how nitrification response to yak excreta application by regulating the ammonia-oxidizing microorganism communities in meadow marsh soil (MMS) and marsh soil (MS). The microcosm experiments of excreta application were established in MMS and MS. The microcosms were subject to dung application (DA), urine application (UA) and control (CK). Molecular methods were applied to determine the compositions of AOA and AOB. Chao, ACE, Shannon and Simpson indices were applied to measure species richness and diversity. Potential nitrification rate (PNR) was higher in MMS than in MS. DA significantly increased PNR in MMS, whereas DA decreased PNR in MS. The urease activity was lower in MMS than in MS, whereas catalase activity was opposite. DA increased urease and catalase activities significantly in MMS and MS. Excreta application decreased the alpha diversity of AOB in MMS whereas the trend was opposite in MS, and it was higher in MMS than in MS. The canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) demonstrated that the urease and catalase activities were the important factors to change the AOB community structure in MS. Structural equation modelling (SEM) showed PNR was indirectly influenced by total phosphorus (TP) through mediation of the ACE index and Simpson index of AOB. Yak excreta application can alter soil environmental conditions resulted in changes in AOB community composition. However, the response of AOA to yak excreta application was much weaker than that of AOB in both MMS and MS.

AB  - Despite its remoteness, the vegetation of Subantarctic Macquarie Island is amongst the most thoroughly surveyed and monitored in Australia. Eradication of invasive European rabbits was achieved in 2011, after a decline in introduced rabbit populations in the eighties and nineties and a resurgence in the early twenty-first century. The impacts of introduced rabbits and climate change on the vegetation of Macquarie Island are well-documented from long-term plots situated in some, but not all, of the vegetation types. Satellite data are sporadic, with substantial could-free coverage rare. The island has been well-photographed over many years, and several series of long-term photo-monitoring sites have been established over the past few decades. We compared insights on vegetation change derived from repeat landscape photography three years after myxoma virus was established, rabbit population resurgence and rabbits eradication, with plant species cover data from a set of long-term monitoring sites, and with spectral vegetation indices derived from satellite imagery covering the transition from high rabbit numbers to no rabbits. The repeat photography confirmed many well-documented vegetation trends, as well as providing an indication of previously unreported trends: stability of Acaena herbfield despite reduced disturbance; increase in cover of Pleurophyllum hookeri; increase in short grassland vegetation; and constancy in cover of Azorella macquariensis. Although subject to errors related to differences in sample size and resolution, the rephotography data gave the best information on spatial and temporal patterns of overall vegetation change. The plot data, where comparable, were not fully consistent with the rephotography data and are expensive to collect, requiring scientific expertise in the field and much time, while the sporadically available remote sensing data were effective in monitoring the revegetation/devegetation of ground and the recovery of Poa foliosa but we were unable to detect other changes.

AB  - Species interactions drive ecosystem processes and are a major focus of global change research. Among the most consequential interactions expected to shift with climate change are those between insect herbivores and plants, both of which are highly sensitive to temperature. Insect herbivores and their host plants display varying levels of synchrony that could be disrupted or enhanced by climate change, yet empirical data on changes in synchrony are lacking. Using evidence of herbivory on herbarium specimens collected from the northeastern United States and France from 1900 to 2015, we provide evidence that plant species with temperature-sensitive phenologies experience higher levels of insect damage in warmer years, while less temperature-sensitive, co-occurring species do not. While herbivory might be mediated by interactions between warming and phenology through multiple pathways, we suggest that warming might lengthen growing seasons for phenologically sensitive plant species, exposing their leaves to herbivores for longer periods of time in warm years. We propose that elevated herbivory in warm years may represent a previously underappreciated cost to phenological tracking of climate change over longer timescales.

AB  - Parasitoids are an important group of insects because their species number is among the highest. Multiple studies have addressed the relationships between forest successional age and insect diversity by focusing on herbivorous organisms, but changes in diversity of parasitoids are still poorly known. This work analyses the diversity of parasitoids in tropical forests representing three successional stages. A total of 30 traps were placed, ten in each forest successional stages. We estimated true diversity of Ichneumonidae species and guilds and explored the relationship between their diversity and the abundance of plant species using an Indicator Species Analysis; the relationship between parasitoid species and plant richness and abundance was tested using a Redundancy Analysis. A total of 1522 individuals and 168 morpho-species were captured in four months. Species richness showed no differences; however, parasitoid abundance was higher in young forest, while intermediate forest had the highest true diversity values (1D) with 71.6 effective species. According to insect guilds, richness, abundance, and diversity were similar in the three vegetation successional stages. This finding may be explained based on the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, which postulates that moderate disturbance levels favor the highest diversity. In conclusion, successional age matters, i.e., diversity is the highest in intermediate stages, while the old forests harbors guilds unique to that successional stage, such as parasitoids of melitophagous larvae of bees. Other successional stages were characterized by a single species of parasitoid, belonging to the genera Eiphosoma and Anomalon, which may indicate altered and preserved forests, respectively.

AB  - Due to human-induced climate and landscape changes, distribution and abundance of many ungulate species have increased worldwide. Especially in areas where natural predators are absent, hunting is the essential management tool for regulating ungulate populations. Therefore, understanding the factors associated with harvest rates is the first step toward an adaptive management approach. Weather influences hunter and ungulate behavior and thus presumably harvest, but how and which meteorological parameters are linked to harvest numbers have rarely been evaluated. We used nearly 65,000 "sit and wait" and driven hunt harvests of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) in Bavaria, Germany, and weather data from 2008 to 2017 to test for factors affecting roe deer harvests (i.e., temperature, rain hours, wind speed, sunshine duration, snow depth, workdays vs. weekends, month) using zero-inflated negative binomial mixed-effect models. Our results reveal that, besides workdays, high temperatures and prolonged rain resulted in fewer harvested animals, whereas sunshine duration in summer and snow height in snow-rich areas partially favored harvests during sitting hunts in summer and winter, respectively. The influence of wind speed varied over the course of the year. In summer and autumn, wind speed commonly had a negative effect, positively affecting harvests in winter in some regions. Daily harvest numbers decreased during the summer and autumn hunting periods (May till mid-October), while they increased during the winter period (mid-October till mid-January). Interestingly, harvest success during driven hunts, which are planned well in advance and therefore take place largely independent of weather conditions, was similarly affected by the weather. This result suggests that the inferred weather influence is not only due to the hunters' decisions but also due to deer behavior. Since many ungulate populations may further benefit from climate change, building an understanding of the relationship between hunting success and weather will aid adaptive ungulate management.

AB  - The techniques of agriculture and animal husbandry at Tell Humeida, a Middle Uruk Period (Late Chalcolithic) site on the middle Syrian Euphrates, were studied using stable isotopes of bone collagen of domestic and wild mammals and from cereal and ruderal plant seeds. Two archaeological campaigns in 2009 and 2011 yielded a small collection of bones, most of which were taxonomically indeterminable. The work had to be interrupted due to the political conflict. The faunal study comprised collagen peptide fingerprinting for taxonomic identification, followed by isotopic analysis. Multiple C-14 dating were performed to date the infill to around 3600 cal BC. An isotopic analysis of the sparse plant remains suggested that irrigation and manuring were common practices. Sheep and equids predominated in the faunal assemblage. Sheep grazed on manured soils, and their diet could include millet or another C4 plant, of which, however, no carpological remains were found. The diet of equids differed from that of sheep but also that of other wild ungulates (cervids/gazelles). Their isotopic signatures indicated that they grazed in humid areas, near the watercourse. These finds indicated a settlement that was closely linked to the availability of water, which made it possible to grow crops in an almost desert-like area, and the rearing of sheep.

AB  - The dry climate of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau causes the rapid loss of moisture in composting piles, which affects dynamics of the composting process and the maturity of the compost product. In this study, regular water replenishment was used to solve the problem of rapid water loss during composting on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Multiple combinations of initial water content (60% and 70%) and water replenishment frequency (no water supplementation, water supplementation every 7 days, and supplementation every 3.5 days) were set to determine a reasonable water replenishment strategy to promote compost maturity on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The changes in the bacterial diversity and community structure of the compost were also studied. The results indicated that regular water supplementation during composting can adjust the physicochemical environment of compost, increase bacterial richness and diversity, improve bacterial community structure, and significantly promote compost maturity. A moisture content of 60% can promote fermentation, increase the maximum temperature of the composting pile, and increase the abundance of thermophilic bacteria, such as Firmicutes and Planifilum, better than an initial moisture content of 70%. Among all water replenishment treatments, an initial moisture content of 60% and water supplementation every 3.5 days was the best combination.

AB  - At-grade fauna passages are much less resources demanding to construct compared to wildlife overpasses or underpasses at infrastructure barriers. Because smaller and intermediate-sized roads are much more common than major roads in most landscapes, at-grade passages have a high potential for cost-efficient barrier mitigation for wildlife. However, at-grade passages have besides risk for vehicle collision involvement, a higher disturbance potential, compared to most over- and underpasses, considering foremost its multiuse with vehicle traffic. We tested if the crossing probability in common Scandinavian ungulates; wildboar (Sus scrofa), roedeer (Capreolus capreolus) and fallow deer (Dama dama), was impacted due to different types of crossing structure, while accounting for availability to alternative crossing sites and environmental factors. We found no differences in crossing probability in wild boar (851 visits), roedeer (1,556 visits) and fallow deer (941 visits) when comparing wildlife visits at 4 at-grade fauna passages and the combined result from 8 wildlife-designed over-/underpasses. This indicates that fauna passage at-grade (with average daily traffic volume of 3,000-8,000) can show similar functionality, in terms of comparable proportions of usage out of all visits, compared to wildlife designed overpasses or underpasses. In addition, when separating among over-, underpasses and at-grade passages, we found no differences in crossing probability in roe deer and fallow deer. Wildboar showed no difference in crossing probability between overpass and at-grade passage, but higher crossing probability at underpass than at-grade. This suggests that establishing several wildlife passages at-grade instead of only a few over- or underpasses designed for wildlife at different grade may be an alternative to reduce infrastructure barriers also along fenced intermediate-sized roads.

AB  - Species contribute differently to the structure and stability of networks of interacting species. However, species contributions to the importance of other species is usually neglected, thus limiting our understanding of species dynamics beyond the general network structure. We combined knowledge on diversity effects on focal species and network ecology to analyze the influence of plants and herbivores on big-leaf mahogany's (Swietenia macrophylla) importance in the plant-herbivore network. To this end, we built interaction networks using information from a large-scale tree diversity experiment and performed computer simulations of species removal with redistribution of interactions. We compared the importance of big-leaf mahogany in the observed networks to simulated networks where we removed: (a) tree species with similar beetle assemblages to mahogany, (b) the most interconnected (core) tree species and (c) the core beetle species. Removal of the core and similar tree species increased the importance of mahogany, whereas eliminating core beetle species decreased it. Interestingly, the effect of core tree species on mahogany's importance was mediated by core beetles (R-2 = 0.46). Neither tree nor core beetle species' effects were contingent on tree species richness or abundance. These results indicate that highly connected tree and herbivore species jointly determine the role of mahogany in the plant-herbivore network. Likewise, these results provide insight into the effect of tree species composition and highly interactive herbivores in shaping the role of species in the herbivore network.

AB  - Artificial light at night (ALAN) is a recognized threat not only to urban areas but also to more remote habitats including forests. Advancements in LED technology offer potential for streetlight infrastructure with minimized disruptive impact on ecosystems. Light dimming ranges among the most promising ALAN-mitigation measures. Despite being essential for understanding ALAN effects on ecosystems, little is known about how dimming may affect bottom-up interactions, such as those between plants and herbivores. We conducted a forest-located experiment on potted European beech saplings (Fagus sylvatica L.) that lasted 43 nights. We studied the impact of different LED streetlight intensities i.e. 70 lx (100% light intensity), 35 lx (50% light intensity), 21 lx (30% light intensity) and a dark control on leaf morphological and chemical traits, insect herbivory and the links between light-induced changes in leaf traits and herbivory. The 100% and 50% light intensity treatments caused an increase in average leaf area but reduced specific leaf area. ALAN also induced changes in the specialised leaf metabolome, mainly affecting flavonols. Responses of individual metabolites to different ALAN intensities were highly variable, with many metabolites already responding to 30% light intensity. Insect herbivory was only reduced under 100% light intensity. The reduction in herbivory correlated with ALAN-related changes in phytochemistry. Synthesis and applications: Our findings indicate that reducing LED light intensities (dimming) is a promising step towards sustainable outdoor lighting to mitigate ALAN effects on tree-herbivore interactions. However, the effects of dimming on leaf physiology, phytochemistry and herbivory were variable, with detectable effects on phytochemistry even at high dimming levels. The varying light responses across trophic levels highlight the challenge of optimizing light parameters in order to minimize ALAN impacts on species interactions. To address this challenge, our study advocates for increased collaboration between ecologists and lighting engineers.

AB  - Simple Summary Gut microbiota play a significant role in the diet digestion and health of the host. Many zoos provide research sites for biological scientists to reintroduce animals, especially those facing extinction. Therefore, to prevent the extinction of wild animals, captive wild animals have become one of the ways to protect threatened taxa. Monitoring the structure and function of the gut microbiota of captive animals can help elucidate whether animals have adapted to their artificial environment, which is one of the key issues in wildlife conservation. This study investigated the gut microbiota of blue sheep and red deer at different growth stages and inter-species. The result shows gut microbiota of blue sheep and red deer will change to some extent in different growth stages, but the dominant flora remains stable. In blue sheep and red deer, the gut microbiota differ significantly between species. In addition, several potentially pathogenic microbial communities were identified based on the current findings. The study highlights key gut microbiota across species and ages. Blue sheep and red deer, second-class key protected animals in China, are sympatric species with a high degree of overlap of food resources in the Helan Mountains, China. Previous studies with blue sheep and red deer in nature have shown that their physiology is closely related to their gut microbiota. However, growth stages and changes occurring in these species in captivity are still unknown. Thus, 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to explore diversity, composition and function of the gut microbiota in these two animal species. The diversity and structure of the gut microbiota in captive blue sheep and red deer changed at different growth stages, but the dominant microbiota phyla in the gut microbiota remained stable, which was composed of the phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Verrucomicrobia. Moreover, gut microbiota diversity in juvenile blue sheep and red deer was low, with the potential for further colonization. Functional predictions showed differences such as red deer transcription being enriched in adults, and blue sheep adults having a higher cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis than juveniles. Microbial changes between blue sheep and red deer at different growth stages and between species mainly depend on the abundance of the microbiota, rather than the increase and absence of the bacterial taxa.

AB  - Caring for newborn offspring hampers resource acquisition of mammalian females, curbing their ability to meet the high energy expenditure of early lactation. Newborns are particularly vulnerable, and, among the large herbivores, ungulates have evolved a continuum of neonatal antipredator tactics, ranging from immobile hider (such as roe deer fawns or impala calves) to highly mobile follower offspring (such as reindeer calves or chamois kids). How these tactics constrain female movements around parturition is unknown, particularly within the current context of increasing habitat fragmentation and earlier plant phenology caused by global warming. Here, using a comparative analysis across 54 populations of 23 species of large herbivores from 5 ungulate families (Bovidae, Cervidae, Equidae, Antilocapridae and Giraffidae), we show that mothers adjust their movements to variation in resource productivity and heterogeneity according to their offspring's neonatal tactic. Mothers with hider offspring are unable to exploit environments where the variability of resources occurs at a broad scale, which might alter resource allocation compared with mothers with follower offspring. Our findings reveal that the overlooked neonatal tactic plays a key role for predicting how species are coping with environmental variation.

AB  - Demographic heterogeneity influences how populations respond to density dependent intraspecific competition and trophic interactions. Distinct stages across an organism's development, or ontogeny, are an important example of demographic heterogeneity. In consumer populations, ontogenetic stage structure has been shown to produce categorical differences in population dynamics, community dynamics and even species coexistence compared to models lacking explicit ontogeny. The study of consumer-resource interactions must also consider the ontogenetic stage structure of the resource itself, particularly plants, given their fundamental role at the basis of terrestrial food webs. We incorporate distinct ontogenetic stages of plants into an adaptable multi-stage consumer-resource modeling framework that facilitates studying how stage specific consumers shape trophic dynamics at low trophic levels. We describe the role of density dependent demographic rates in mediating the dynamics of stage-structured plant populations. We then investigate how these demographic rates interact with consumer pressure to influence stability and coexistence in multiple stage-specific consumer-resource interactions. Results detail how density dependent effects across distinct ontogenetic stages in plant development produce non-additivity in the drivers of dynamic stability both in single populations and in consumer-resource settings, challenging the ubiquity of certain traditional ecological dynamic paradigms. We also find categorical differences in the population variability induced by herbivores consuming separate plant stages. Consumer-resource models, such as plant-herbivore interactions, often average out demographic heterogeneity in populations. Here, we show that explicitly including plant demographic heterogeneity through ontogeny yields distinct dynamic expectations for both plants and herbivores compared to traditional consumer-resource formulations. Our results indicate that efforts to understand the demographic effect of herbivores on plant populations may need to also consider the effects of plant demographics on herbivores and the reciprocal relationship between them.

AB  - Plankton communities are subjected to multiple global change drivers; however, it is unknown how the interplay between them deviates from predictions based on single-driver studies, in particular when trophic interactions are explicitly considered. We investigated how simultaneous manipulation of temperature, pH, nutrient availability and solar radiation quality affects the carbon transfer from phytoplankton to herbivorous protists and their potential consequences for ecosystem functioning. Our results showed that multiple interacting global- change drivers reduced the photosynthetic (gross primary production-to-electron transport rates ratios, from 0.2 to 0.6-0.8) and resource use efficiencies (from 9 to 1 mu g chlorophyll a (Chl a ) mu mol nitrogen-1) and prompted uncoupling between microzooplankton grazing (m) and phytoplankton growth (mu) rates (mu > m ). The altered trophic interaction could be due to enhanced intra-guild predation or to microzooplankton growing at suboptimal temperatures compared to their prey. Because phytoplankton-specific loss rates to consumers grazing are the most significant uncertainty in marine biogeochemical models, we stress the need for experimental approaches quantifying it accurately to avoid bias in predicting the impacts of global change on marine ecosystems.

AB  - Aims: The functional traits of twigs and leaves are closely related to the ability of plants to cope with heterogeneous environments. The analysis of the characteristics of twigs and leaves and leaf thermal dissipation in riparian plants is of great significance for exploring the light energy allocation and ecological adaptation strategies of plant leaves in heterogeneous habitats. However, there are few studies on the correlation between the twig-leaf characteristics of riparian plants and their heat dissipation in light heterogeneous environments. Methods: In this study, the riparian plant Hippophae rhamnoides in Taohe National Wetland Park was the research object. According to the differences in the canopy light environment of the H. rhamnoides population, three habitat gradients were set: I, the full sight zone; II, the moderate shade zone; and III, the canopy cover zone. We studied the relationship between the twig-leaf characteristics of H. rhamnoides and leaf thermal dissipation in a heterogeneous light environment. Important Findings: The results are as follows: from the full sight zone to the canopy cover zone, the population characteristics and the twig, leaf, and photosynthetic fluorescence physiological characteristics of H. rhamnoides demonstrated significant changes (p < 0.05). In the full sight zone, H. rhamnoides tended to have thick leaves with a smaller SLA on short and thick twigs, and the light energy absorbed by the leaves accounted for a higher proportion of thermal dissipation. In the moderate shade zone, H. rhamnoides tended to grow many thin leaves with high SLA on long and thick twigs, and the proportion of light energy absorbed by the leaves for heat dissipation was lower than that in the full sight zone. In the canopy cover zone, H. rhamnoides tended to grow a few large and thick leaves with a low SLA on slender and long twigs, and the proportion of light energy absorbed by the leaves for heat dissipation was the lowest. There was a significant correlation between the twig-leaf and leaf heat dissipation of H. rhamnoides in the three habitats (p < 0.05). The co-variation of plant branches and leaves and the timely adjustment of thermal dissipation in photoheterogeneous habitats reflect the phenotypic plasticity mechanism and self-protection strategy of riparian plants in adapting to heterogeneous environments.

AB  - The burial of a cadaver results in reduced arthropod activity and disruptions in colonisation patterns. Here, the distribution and diversity of mite taxa was studied across decomposition stages of shallowly buried pig carcasses (Sus scrofa domesticus). In total 300 mites (88 species) were collected from three pig shallow graves compared to 129 mites (46 species) from control (bare) soil samples at the same depth. A successional pattern of Acari higher taxa and families was observed, and species richness and biodiversity fluctuated throughout decomposition, whereas active decay showed the greatest biodiversity. Mesostigmata mites were the most abundant in 'cadaver soils' with a significant difference in the abundance of Parasitidae mites, whereas Oribatida mites (true soil mites) were the most abundant in control soils. Certain mite species were significantly associated with decay stages: Cornigamasus lunaris with 'bloated', Gamasodes spiniger with 'active', Eugamasus sp. and Lorryia reticulata with 'advanced', and Macrocheles matrius and Ramusella clavipectinata in 'dry'. Scheloribates laevigatus was a marker of bare soil at a shallow depth and Vulgoramasus remberti of buried decomposition, not specific to any decay stage. Analysis of mite assemblages associated with head, torso and posterior body showed that Parasitus evertsi and M. matrius are attracted to beneath the thighs, whereas L. reticulata to beneath the head. This study highlights the value of mites as indicator species of decomposition and its stages, confirming (1) a succession of Acari on buried remains and (2) species specificity to body regions.

AB  - Trophic cascades in ecology are vital for restoration and conservation management of ecosystems. However, their contribution to belowground microbial diversity remains poorly understood. We examined the microbial contributions of aboveground organisms, at different trophic levels to the soil microbiome, within a rewilded arid environment. We selected five trophic organisms which interacted with or inhabited the soil: Acacia ligulata rhizosphere (primary producer), ants (primary consumer), two omnivorous mammal species (secondary consumers), a carnivorous mammal species (tertiary consumer), and collected soil from the rewilding area and a control (not rewilded) area. Next generation sequencing of 16S and 18S rRNA genes was used to identify bacteria, fungi and micro-eukaryotes, significantly different between the rewilded soil and control soil, and also varying in presence and composition among the five trophic organisms. We identified 49 bacterial taxa, significantly different in abundance in the rewilded soil, compared to the control soil. These taxa also occurred in one of the secondary consumers and the tertiary consumer. Fungal and micro-eukaryotic sequences were very low in soil samples, with no differentiation between rewilded and control areas. We found potential for top-down influences on the soil from rewilding, with the rewilded mammals hosting different functional groups of consumer protists and arthropod pathogens. Rewilded secondary consumers hosted saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal fungi, and the tertiary consumer hosted dominant generalist fungi. Our results identified changes in composition of key dryland soil taxa from rewilding, through direct and indirect interactions with the soil, underlining the value of trophic rewilding to improve restoration success of soil in drylands.

AB  - There is increasing focus on reforestation, but the efforts still often include limited subsets of species despite evidence that tree diversity promote biodiversity and ecological resilience. In addition to these benefits, greater inclusion of rare native species in reforestation efforts would also help conserve these species in an uncertain future. Here, we investigate the population ecology and dynamics of the only remaining historical population of the shade-adapted under- and mid-story tree European yew Taxus baccata in Denmark to inform its potential usage in reforestation. The species has been widely extirpated from European landscapes, and while much used in horticulture, is hardly used in reforestation, so there is limited experience with its requirements and performance. We collected data on all individuals in 2015 and compared them with results from a previous census in 1999. Furthermore, we used boosted regression trees (BRT) modelling to investigate the ecological drivers of the distributions of its different life stages. Our results show a stable T. baccata population, with much regeneration in areas of more open-canopy conditions that also support high survival between life-stages. The BRT results show that moss-dominated microhabitats under moderately shaded conditions are important for T. baccata seedling establishment, while higher light availability is important for survival from sapling to adult life-stages. For use in reforestation, we recommend providing moderately shaded microhabitats to allow the seedlings and small saplings to escape competition while also acting as protection from herbivores. Through their long-lived nature, low stature and evergreen foliage, T. baccata would increase the structural complexity of young woodlands, likely enhancing their value for biodiversity, their ecological resilience, as well as their amenity value. Inclusion of T. baccata in reforestation efforts would also aid its spontaneous recolonization of woodland areas, helping it to build larger, more widespread populations with greater resilience to future pressures.

AB  - Conventional agriculture has negative impacts on the ecosystems while ecological intensification can ameliorate these effects by enhancing ecological processes. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are plant root symbionts that improve access to soil nutrients affecting plant growth and biotic interactions. Agricultural managements differentially affect AMF communities, but how these changes feedback on aboveground plant interactions remains poorly studied. Lettuce (Lactuca sativa) is a common crop severely attacked by Liriomyza huidobrensis (Diptera: Agromizydae), a polyphagous leafminer that has developed resistance to various pesticides, for which managing plant defenses and tolerance represents a feasible option to regulate populations. The aim of this study was to investigate if AMF communities from ecological and conventional management produce differential effects on mycorrhizal interaction, tissue phosphorus content and growth of lettuce plants and on L. huidobrensis oviposition preference. In greenhouse, we compared the effects of soils from farms with conventional and ecological managements from central Argentina on lettuce plants, and exposed them to L. huidobrensis mated females. Mycorrhizal colonization was higher with AMF from ecological than conventional treatments, although plant biomass was lower in treatments with AMF than with sterile soils (Strl), or with soil microorganisms without AMF (MO), in both managements. Phosphorus content was significantly higher in plants with MO and AMF in comparison to Strl, with no difference between managements. Plants grown with AMF from ecological management soils were less attacked by leafminers. Also, the insect preferred to oviposit on plants with higher aerial biomass, and this preference increased in plants with lower P content.

AB  - -Grassland ecosystems are key biodiversity reservoirs, especially for the soil fauna. Among them, nematodes have been widely used as bioindicators to assess soil conditions and health in grasslands. However, their interactions with plant functional types, particularly in hot and dry climates like the Mediterranean region, remain poorly understood. The development of management strategies to optimise the resilience and productivity of grassland requires abetter understanding of these biotic relationships. To address this, nematode communities were examined in grassland monocultures of three plant functional groups (grasses, legumes, forbs) in the Mediterranean. In France, Slovenia, Spain, Jordan and Lebanon, grasslands differing in soil properties and climate were investigated in autumn and spring in consecutive seasons. The genus composition of nematode assemblages was assessed, and their ecological indices and metabolic footprints were related to site characteristics and plant functional type. The Renkonen and S & ouml;rensen Index revealed that nematode communities differed greatly among regions. The western Mediterranean grasslands were dominated by bacterial feeders like Rhabditis and Eucephalobus, resulting in a low Channel Index and high Enrichment Index. The eastern Mediterranean sites showed higher proportions of fungal and plant feeders like Aphelenchus and Geocenamus and a higher Channel Index but lower Enrichment Index. Due to prolonged drought, the Spanish soils were infested by plant feeders such as Scutylenchus and Pratylenchus. The forage plant had only a minor impact, with legumes enhancing certain bacterial-feeding genera and grasses fostering some plant-parasitic nematodes. Overall, regional factors shape the nematode community more than forage plant cover. The dry conditions in the eastern Mediterranean, as well as the drought in Spain, increased herbivores and decreased top-down control, which is relevant in the light of future climate change.

AB  - Plant pathogens have potential to change the relative importance of bottom-up and top-down regulation in forest ecosystems and may determine whether trophic cascades are present in local food chains. While evidence for such effects from field studies in forest ecosystems remains sparse, this would be valuable for the management of invasive plant pathogens. Hymenoscyphus fraxineus is an invasive pathogenic fungus that causes massive dieback across Europe, mainly of the common ash Fraxinus excelsior. Here, we investigated by a correlative approach how infestation by H. fraxineus affects the association between herbivory of ash leaves and densities of herbivores (herbivorous Hemiptera, Psocoptera, herbivorous Coleoptera, caterpillars and Symphyta) and predators (Araneae, Formicidae, and Dermaptera) in young ash plantations. Our results indicate that infestation with the pathogenic fungus changed community-wide regulatory mechanisms in arthropod food webs of young ash plantations. Bottom-up and top-down regulation was relatively balanced in plantations with low infestation levels, but with pronounced top-down control of herbivory by spiders in autumn. In highly infested plantations, by contrast, spiders were bottom-up limited as they aggregated in herbivore-rich patches and had no significant effect on herbivory. There was a top-down effect of herbivores on ash leaves in high infested plantations, but not in low infested plantations. These results suggest that the invasive fungus affects ecosystem functioning through a reduction of functional complementarity and intensification of negative intraguild interactions among predators. This consequently resulted in strong bottom-up limitation of predators and their reduced ability to suppress herbivores and herbivory.

AB  - Prescribed fires often stimulate short-term productivity of grasslands that influences use by large, grazing herbivores. But studies examining burning effects on large herbivore population dynamics while simultaneously considering other environmental factors that might also influence population dynamics are lacking. We examined the influences of burned area, precipitation during the growing season, and possible distributional shifts from a nearby public hunt on maximum intrinsic rate of population growth (r(max)) and environmental carrying capacity (K). We examined the influences of these predictors in a Roosevelt elk (Cervus elaphus roosevelti) population studied across 43 years where abundances ranged from 4 to 322 animals and prescribed fires ranged from 14 to 891 ha of burned area in Redwood National and State Parks, California, USA. The highest count across surveys conducted in a year was our index of elk (females, juveniles, subadult males) abundance. We estimated Ricker type models in a hierarchical, state-space formulation that separated observer error from process variation. We found a slight influence from burned area on both r(max) and K but a stronger influence from precipitation during the growing season. The lack of a substantial effect from burned area on elk population parameters might be from a variety of factors such as spatial and temporal variation in intensity of prescribed fires and weak density dependence. Nonetheless, one positive benefit to elk population processes was that the patchwork of burning retarded encroachment of woody plants into forage habitat and, thus, maintained a constant area of forage habitat across 43 years.

AB  - The relevance of wild hosts in the maintenance and transmission of animal tuberculosis may increase as the prevalence in livestock decreases. However, studies on wild mammals in low bovine tuberculosis prevalence scenarios are scarce. The Basque Country is an understudied region from the Atlantic Iberian Peninsula with low bovine tuberculosis prevalence. In this 10-year survey, we searched for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC) infection in wildlife and studied the spatial and temporal distribution of the spoligotypes circulating among these wild species and cohabiting livestock. For these purposes, lymph nodes from 1472 wild mammals were cultured and isolates spoligotyped. Information on domestic tuberculosis cases was obtained from the Spanish Database of Animal Mycobacteriosis. Infection was confirmed in ten wild boar (1.12%; 95% CI 0.61-2.05) and four red deer (2.40%; 95% CI 0.94-6.00). MTC was not isolated from badgers or other wild species. The general spoligotype diversity in the region was high. Five distinct spoligotypes belonging to M. bovis (SB0121, SB0134, SB0881, SB2354, SB1086) and one to M. caprae (SB0415) were detected in wildlife. Wild ungulates harboured most of the M. bovis spoligotypes that were commonly found in cattle, being SB0121 and SB0134 geographically associated between wild boar and cattle. M. caprae SB0415 was also found in both wild species as well as in cattle and goats. Despite the absence of MTC-infected badgers and the overall low prevalence observed in wildlife, potential epidemiological links between cattle and wild boar have been revealed. No competent hosts should be ignored when developing global control strategies aimed at eradicating tuberculosis.

AB  - Many ecological processes are profoundly influenced by abiotic factors, such as temperature and snow. However, despite strong evidence linking shifts in these ecological processes to corresponding shifts in abiotic factors driven by climate change, the mechanisms connecting population size to season-specific climate drivers are little understood. Using a 21-year dataset and a Bayesian state space model, we identified biologically informed seasonal climate covariates that influenced densities of snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus), a cold-adapted boreal herbivore. We found that snow and temperature had strong but conflicting season-dependent effects. Reduced snow duration in spring and fall and warmer summers were associated with lowered hare density, whereas warmer winters were associated with increased density. When modeled simultaneously and under two climate change scenarios, the negative effects of reduced fall and spring snow duration and warmer summers overwhelm the positive effect of warmer winters, producing projected population declines. Ultimately, the contrasting population-level impacts of climate change across seasons emphasize the critical need to examine the entire annual climate cycle to understand potential long-term population consequences of climate change.

AB  - Global biodiversity is facing unprecedented pressures, calling into question the effectiveness of existing governance systems aimed at halting extinctions. Renewed hope arose with the recent Conference of the Parties (COP) to the Convention on Biological Diversity (COP15 December 2022) and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (COP19 November 2022). Yet, barriers remain that hamper biodiversity conservation. Identifying and overcoming these barriers is crucial for success. We considered previous lessons learned to show that current barriers to conservation are centered on a multidimensional array of mismatches among legal (law), ecological (science), and sociocultural (human) dimensions across the short, medium, and long term. Focusing on highly migratory marine megafauna (whales, sharks, and turtles), we used the Rubik's cube as a metaphor to conceptualize the multidimensional mismatches and devised a pathway for solutions that is highly dependent on strict alignment across all dimensions. We recommend the continuous cycling across all dimension interfaces to align the use (and update) of regulations and processes in law, improve data and experimentation methods in science, and develop education and engagement actions in the human dimension. This timely alignment across all dimensions is key to achieving biodiversity targets and avoiding further extinctions.
   Lecciones del cubo Rubik para solucionar la crisis de biodiversidad La biodiversidad mundial enfrenta una presi & oacute;n sin precedentes, lo que cuestiona la efectividad de los sistemas de gesti & oacute;n dirigidos a detener las extinciones. En la reciente Conferencia de las Partes (COP) ante el Convenio sobre la Diversidad Biol & oacute;gica (COP15, diciembre 2022) y la Convenci & oacute;n sobre el Comercio Internacional de Especies Amenazadas (COP19, noviembre 2022) surgi & oacute; una esperanza renovada; sin embargo, todav & iacute;a existen barreras que dificultan la conservaci & oacute;n de la biodiversidad. Es importante identificar y sobrepasar estas barreras para tener & eacute;xito. Consideramos los aprendizajes previos que muestran que las barreras actuales para la conservaci & oacute;n est & aacute;n centradas en una colecci & oacute;n multidimensional de desfases entre las dimensiones legal (ley), ecol & oacute;gica (ciencia) y sociocultural (humana) a corto, mediano y largo plazo. Nos enfocamos en la megafauna marina con alta migraci & oacute;n (ballenas, tiburones y tortugas) y usamos el cubo Rubik como met & aacute;fora para conceptualizar los desfases multidimensionales y dise & ntilde;ar una v & iacute;a para soluciones que sea en gran parte dependiente de la alineaci & oacute;n estricta en todas las dimensiones.

AB  - The Neolithization process introduced remarkable ecological impacts, especially in Mediterranean mountain areas. We generated a comprehensive sedimentary ancient DNA record from the central Pyrenees, spanning 12,200 to 1300 years before present, revealing the earliest continuous presence of sheep (6500 years before present) and cattle (5900 years before present) in alpine southern Europe. This evidence suggests pastoralism nearly concurred with the Neolithic in the Iberian lowlands, challenging prior assumptions of only sporadic occurrence and confirming Neolithic pastoralist use of mountain ecosystems. A notable plant community shift arose at 6000 years before present, with deciduous forests transitioning into diverse open grasslands. This change became pronounced at 4200 years before present, aligning with continuous presence of domesticates and a regional cooling climate, suggesting a synergistic relationship between past climate change and human-induced plant community alteration. These findings highlight complex interactions between climate, human activities, and landscape dynamics during the Neolithic in Mediterranean mountains.

AB  - Ongoing climate change and long-term overgrazing are the main causes of grassland degradation worldwide. Phosphorus (P) is typically a limiting nutrient in degraded grassland soils, and its dynamics may play a crucial role in the responses of carbon (C) feedback to grazing. Yet how multiple P processes respond to a multi-level of grazing and its impact on soil organic carbon (SOC), which is critical for sustainable grassland development in the face of climate change, remains inadequately understood. Here, we investigated P dynamics at the ecosystem level in a 7-year-long multi-level grazing field experiment and analyzed their relation to SOC stock. The results showed that, due to the greater P demand for compensatory plant growth, grazing by sheep increased the aboveground plants' P supply (by 70 % at most) while decreasing their relative P limitation. The increase in P in aboveground tissue was associated with changes in plant root-shoot P allocation and P resorption, and the mobilization of moderately labile organic P in soil. Affected by the altered P supply under grazing, corresponding changes to root C stock and soil total P were two major factors impacting SOC. Compensatory growth-induced P demand and P supply processes responded differently to grazing intensity, resulting in differential effects on SOC. Unlike the light and heavy grazing levels, which reduced the SOC stock, moderate grazing was capable of maintaining maximal vegetation biomass, total plant biomass P, and SOC stock, mainly by promoting biologically- and geochemically-driven plant-soil P turnover. Our findings have important implications for addressing future soil C losses and mitigating higher atmospheric CO2 threats, as well as maintaining high productivity in temperate grasslands.

AB  - Coral reef environments are currently experiencing a global crisis. For restoration and conservation of such environments, substratum suitable for coral recruitment is important. Herbivorous fishes are likely to facilitate the survival and growth of coral reefs by removing sediment and epilithic algae on corals in the course of their feeding behavior. However, this facilitative function can be greatly impaired by anthropogenic stressors such as overfishing, which decreases the biomass of fishes, and by excessive sediment deposition due to land development, which might decrease the frequency of feeding. To examine these hypotheses, we conducted observations and experiments at 4 reefs with different degrees of anthropogenic stress in subtropical Japan. Our findings were as follows: (1) Underwater visual censuses, sediment trap surveys, and an analysis of fishery statistics revealed that biomass, population density, and species richness of herbivorous fishes were generally lower in reefs with high densities of fishermen and high sedimentation rates. (2) Caging experiments showed that, compared to control plots, caged plots inaccessible to herbivorous fishes had greater accumulation of sediment and epilithic algae. (3) Sediment removal experiments found that, compared to control plots, experimental plots with the sediment removed were more heavily grazed by some functional groups of herbivorous fishes (grazers). These results suggest that excessive deposition of sediment and overfishing depress the facilitative function of herbivorous fishes, which can further exacerbate the deposition of sediment.

AB  - Logging activities degrade forest habitats across large areas of the tropics, but the impacts on trophic interactions that underpin forest ecosystems are poorly understood. DNA metabarcoding provides an invaluable tool to investigate such interactions, allowing analysis at a far greater scale and resolution than has previously been possible. We analysed the diet of the insectivorous fawn leaf-nosed bat Hipposideros cervinus across a forest disturbance gradient in Borneo, using a dataset of ecological interactions from an unprecedented number of bat-derived faecal samples. Bats predominantly consumed insects from the orders Lepidoptera, Diptera, Blattodea, and Coleoptera, and the taxonomic composition of their diet remained relatively consistent across sites regardless of logging disturbance. There was little difference in the richness of prey consumed per-bat in each logging treatment, indicating potential resilience of this species to habitat degradation. In fact, bats consumed a high richness of prey items, and intensive sampling is needed to reliably compare feeding ecology over multiple sites. Multiple bioinformatic parameters were used, to assess how they altered our perception of sampling completeness. While parameter choice altered estimates of completeness, a very high sampling effort was always required to detect the entire prey community.

AB  - Background Population parameters such as reproductive success are critical for sustainably managing ungulate populations, however obtaining these data is often difficult, expensive, and invasive. Movement-based methods that leverage Global Positioning System (GPS) relocation data to identify parturition offer an alternative to more invasive techniques such as vaginal implant transmitters, but thus far have only been applied to relocation data with a relatively fine (one fix every < 8 h) temporal resolution. We employed a machine learning method to classify parturition/calf survival in cow elk in southeastern Kentucky, USA, using 13-h GPS relocation data and three simple movement metrics, training a random forest on cows that successfully reared their calf to a week old. Results We developed a decision rule based upon a predicted probability threshold across individual cow time series, accurately classifying 89.5% (51/57) of cows with a known reproductive status. When used to infer status of cows whose reproductive outcome was unknown, we classified 48.6% (21/38) as successful, compared to 85.1% (40/47) of known-status cows. Conclusions While our approach was limited primarily by fix acquisition success, we demonstrated that coarse collar fix rates did not limit inference if appropriate movement metrics are chosen. Movement-based methods for determining parturition in ungulates may allow wildlife managers to extract more vital rate information from GPS collars even if technology and related data quality are constrained by cost.

AB  - Macro and megafauna were studied in the Avile acute accent s Canyon System (ACS), southern Bay of Biscay (Cantabrian Sea), during several oceanographic cruises carried out from 2009 to 2017. The biodiversity of ACS is summarized and its description is herein updated after sampling surveys of several programmes (ECOMARG, INDEMARES, SponGES, INTEMARES) conducted by the Spanish Institute of Oceanography (IEO).This study has updated previous knowledge in the canyon area from past national and international projects, their reports and publications as well as data collected in the context of regional projects designed to gain new insight into the diversity of marine invertebrates and fishes from the ACS. Samples were taken using a range of sampling gears (Rock dredge, Beam trawl, Trawl gear GOC-73, Suprabenthic sledge, Box corer and Remoted operated vehicle), from 55 to 2291 m in depth. A total of 1015 species were identified at the ACS: 98 Porifera, 153 Cnidaria, 14 Brachiopoda, 22 Bryozoa, 97 Mollusca, 151 Annelida, 315 Arthropoda, 74 Echinodermata and 91 Chordata. New records for the Bay of Biscay fauna include 13 Porifera species, 17 Cnidaria, 7 Mollusca, Arthopoda, 3 Echinodermata and 4 Chordata. Also the bathymetric range of some species has been extended. As a result of the research projects carried out in the area in the last fifteen years, important information is now available which suggests that the ACS houses a large number of species with a high ecological value, that represents a biodiversity hotspot in terms of the presence of sponge aggregations and coral reefs in certain regions, and that it sustains important fisheries due to the abundance of comercial species. Given the relevance of the species and habitats occurring in the ACS, there is a need to implement a conservation and management plan of the area in order to maintain habitats in good state of preservation.

AB  - Grasslands are globally significant ecosystems held in an ecological balance by herbivory, with a natural tendency towards shrub encroachment, creating a tension between two alternative successional trajectories. The influence of grazing pressure on soil properties is not yet accurately predicted across ecosystems, nor its interaction with encroachment, with quite variable effects found. We studied the combined effect of grazing and encroachment on soil ecophysiological processes by collecting soil samples from paired locations with and without shrub presence across a managed high-altitude pastureland of 14,000 ha. By tracking 26 sheep herds with GPS collars over multiple years, we created a spatially explicit map of grazing intensity over the landscape, permitting quantification of grazing impacts on soil properties on a continuous scale. Grazing changed soil nutrient status, increasing total soil nitrogen (TN) by up to 0.77 % over the gradient, and available phosphorus (Pavail) by up to 12 times. Grazing increased soil organic carbon (SOC) content by up to 4.5 % across the gradient, and encroachment increased SOC by 1.2 %. SOC increases under these two conditions likely represent two cooccurring paths soil carbon accumulation since particulate organic carbon (POC) was increased by 44 % under shrubs, while the effect of grazing was unclear. Grazing and encroachment impacts on the soil microbial community diverged, since microbial biomass carbon (Cmic) increased by up to 86 % with grazing intensity with a simultaneous decrease in microbial basal respiration and metabolic quotient (qCO2), however neither were affected by encroachment. Overall, encroachment and grazing were seen to be complementary for soil protection and provision of ecosystem services, though their effects on certain parameters were contrasting. This knowledge may be useful for adaptive management in high nature value agroecological landscapes, and can improve largescale projections of SOC stocks and other soil properties incorporating varying degrees of grazing intensity and the influence of encroachment.

AB  - Giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera provides the foundation for immense biodiversity on the coast of California, USA. Kelp forests can change seawater retention time, altering water chemistry, including pH and dissolved oxygen (DO), as well as the magnitude and predictability of variability in the same properties. Environmental heterogeneity across space and time could drive organismal performance and processes such as transgenerational plasticity (TGP), where parental experience modifies the offspring phenotype, potentially conferring tolerance to future environmental stress. We monitored environmental variability by deploying temperature, pH, and DO sensors inside and outside a temperate kelp forest in the Santa Barbara Channel (SBC) throughout the gametogenesis period of a key herbivore, the purple urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. Over the 6 mo period, pH and temperature were slightly elevated inside the kelp forest, accompanied by more predictable, low-frequency variability relative to outside. Adult S. purpuratus were conditioned inside and outside the kelp spanning gametogenesis. The urchins were spawned and their larvae were raised under high (1053 mu atm) and low pCO2 (435 mu atm) at 15 degrees C in the laboratory to assess their physiological response to the maternal and developmental environments. Larvae raised under high pCO2 were more susceptible to acute thermal stress; however, within each larval treatment, progeny from outside-conditioned mothers had a 0.4 degrees C higher lethal temperature (LT50). Our results indicate that heterogeneity in abiotic factors associated with kelp can have transgenerational effects in the field, and interactions between factors, including temperature and pH, will impact purple urchins as local variability associated with marine heatwaves and upwelling evolves with climate change.

AB  - Structural changes in savanna trees vary spatially and temporally because of both biotic and abiotic drivers, as well as the complex interactions between them. Given this complexity, it is essential to monitor and quantify woody structural changes in savannas efficiently. We implemented a non-destructive approach based on Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) and Quantitative Structure Models (QSMs) that offers the unique advantage of investigating changes in complex tree parameters, such as volume and branch length parameters that have not been previously reported for savanna trees. Leaf-off multi-scan TLS point clouds were acquired during the dry season, using a Riegl VZ1000 TLS, in September 2015 and October 2019 at the Skukuza flux tower in Kruger National Park, South Africa. These three-dimensional (3D) data covered an area of 15.2 ha with an average point density of 4270 points/m2 (0.015 degrees) and 1600 points/m2 (0.025 degrees) for the 2015 and 2019 clouds, respectively. Individual tree segmentation was applied on the two clouds using the comparative shortest-path algorithm in LiDAR 360(v5.4) software. We reconstructed optimized QSMs and assessed tree structural parameters such as Diameter at Breast Height (DBH), tree height, crown area, volume, and branch length at individual tree level. The DBH, tree height, crown area, and trunk volume showed significant positive correlations (R-2 > 0.80) between scanning periods regardless of the difference in the number of points of the matched trees. The opposite was observed for total and branch volume, total number of branches, and 1st-order branch length. As the difference in the point densities increased, the difference in the computed parameters also increased (R2 < 0.63) for a high relative difference. A total of 45% of the trees present in 2015 were identified in 2019 as damaged/felled (75 trees), and the volume lost was estimated to be 83.4 m(3). The results of our study showed that volume reconstruction algorithms such as TreeQSMs and high-resolution TLS datasets can be used successfully to quantify changes in the structure of savanna trees. The results of this study are key in understanding savanna ecology given its complex and dynamic nature and accurately quantifying the gains and losses that could arise from fire, drought, herbivory, and other abiotic and biotic disturbances.

AB  - BackgroundGrassland degradation decreases the capacity of soil carbon sequestration, while the supplementation of exogenous organic matter enhances the soil priming effect (PE) and affects the carbon cycle in the soil. The excrements of Tibetan sheep (Ovis aries) and plateau pika (Ochotona curzoniae) play an important role in soil carbon cycling. Therefore, they were used to enrich alpine meadow soils degraded to different levels after incubation at 20 degrees C for up to 45 days. The PE was analyzed using the natural 13C isotope tracer method in relation to the alpine meadow soil properties.ResultsThe supplementation of the two kinds of excrement significantly increased soil PE accumulation and soil carbon sequestration. Of the two, Tibetan sheep excrement achieved a better effect. Compared with non-degraded alpine meadow soil, severely degraded alpine meadow soil had significantly different PE, but the PE of lightly and moderately degraded meadow soil was not significantly different from each other. Structural equation modelling shows that total nitrogen (TN), soil organic carbon (SOC), beta-1,4-N-acetylaminoglucosidase (NAG), beta-1,4-glucosidase (beta G), pH, and microbial biomass carbon (MBC) are the main factors affecting PE. In particular, TN directly negatively affected PE, SOC and the NO3--N:NH4+-N ratio indirectly affected PE by affecting soil enzyme activity and MBC.ConclusionsThis study demonstrates that the supplement of animal excrements can improve the extracellular enzyme activity and nitrogen content in soils, which is conducive to PE and net carbon balance. Supplementation of both Tibetan sheep and plateau pika excrements can effectively enhance soil pH, further increase microbial biomass and extracellular enzyme activity, and improve soil fertility and carbon sequestration ability of seriously degraded alpine meadow soil. The NO3--N:NH4+-N ratio and enzyme activity in plateau pika excrement were higher than those in Tibetan sheep excrement, which promote the soil PE in alpine meadows. The findings of this study provide theoretical evidence for the rational utilization of the excrements in the alpine meadow with different levels of degradation.

AB  - Species richness and biomass of insects has declined on average across 140 forest sites sampled over a decade in Germany, with larger, more abundant, and carnivorous species found to be more susceptible to decline.
   Insects are declining, but the underlying drivers and differences in responses between species are still largely unclear. Despite the importance of forests, insect trends therein have received little attention. Using 10 years of standardized data (120,996 individuals; 1,805 species) from 140 sites in Germany, we show that declines occurred in most sites and species across trophic groups. In particular, declines (quantified as the correlation between year and the respective community response) were more consistent in sites with many non-native trees or a large amount of timber harvested before the onset of sampling. Correlations at the species level depended on species' life-history. Larger species, more abundant species, and species of higher trophic level declined most, while herbivores increased. This suggests potential shifts in food webs possibly affecting ecosystem functioning. A targeted management, including promoting more natural tree species composition and partially reduced harvesting, can contribute to mitigating declines.

AB  - Urbanization profoundly alters natural landscapes, leading to changes in species assemblages and ecological interactions. Despite increasing interest in understanding the effects of urbanization on species interactions, there is still a gap in knowledge regarding the structure of plant-herbivore networks in urban environments. Previous studies have indicated that anthropogenic impacts can alter the topology of plant-herbivore networks, making them more generalized in disturbed environments. Here, we investigate the topology of a plant-herbivore network in urban fragments of neotropical savanna in Brazil. As specialist species (i.e., those with few interactions) tend to be more sensitive to urbanization than generalist species (i.e., those with many interactions), we hypothesized that the urban savanna network would exhibit low specialization and modularity but high nestedness. We also tested if different attributes of insects (abundance, feeding guild, developmental stage, and taxon) and plants (abundance, height, and coverage) affect the diversity of their interactions at the species level. Contrary to our expectations, the network exhibited higher specialization and modularity than expected by null models, indicating urban environments may foster levels of specialization comparable to observed in previous studies for wild savannas. Regarding the species-level descriptors, we found that different characteristics of insect and plant species affect the diversity and specialization of their interactions. Our results showed that adult insects have higher degree and centrality in shaping the network, possibly attributed to their increased mobility and capacity to link various segments of the network. Similarly, chewing insects and thrips (Thysanoptera), known for their generalist interactions with plants, had higher number of interactions and were central within the network. Furthermore, larger plant species had a higher degree and greater betweenness centrality, while plant species with greater cover had lower specialization compared to herbs. This indicates that plant species with greater structural complexity accumulate more generalized interactions. Our results also show that more abundant species, both insects and plants, had a higher number of interactions and greater centrality in the network. Our study provides insights into the structure of plant-herbivore networks in urban savanna fragments, contributing to our understanding of species interactions in urban environments and their response to anthropogenic pressures.

AB  - Environmental enrichment is a promising method to increase fish ecological fitness in hatchery release and to improve fish welfare in the aquaculture industry. However, little is known about the effects of physical and social enrichment on fish behavioral development and the relevant regulatory mechanisms. To address this knowledge gap, a typical aquaculture fish, black rockfish Sebastes schlegelii, was exposed to contrasting environments (i.e., physically enriched environment vs. barren environment, and socially low-density environment vs. high-density environment) for six weeks. Subsequently, the adaptability-related behaviors and social interactions during the captive period were determined, and stress-related physiological parameters and neurogenesis-related gene markers were measured. In general, the fish from an enriched environment expressed significantly higher sheltering propensity and anti-predator ability while less risk-taking frequency than the fish from a barren environment. And meanwhile, the fish from a low-density environment presented significantly less risk-taking behavior and more anti-predator responses than high-density fish. A structurally barren environment significantly increased fish aggressive frequency and locomotor activity compared with an enriched environment, whereas the social environment did not affect fish social interactions. For physiological status, the hypothalamuspituitary-interrenal (HPI) axis and corticosteroid receptor system activities of barren fish were significantly higher than those of enriched fish, and meanwhile, the high-density fish also presented significantly higher physiological stress than low-density fish. For neurogenesis processes, an enriched environment did not affect fish brain cell proliferation but increased telencephalon neuronal differentiation ratio and immature neuron number. In contrast, a low-density environment significantly stimulated cell proliferating activity in telencephalon but did not affect brain neuronal differentiation activity. These novel results verified the conspicuous effects of physical and social environments on the adaptability-related behaviors in aquaculture fish, and finally, we proposed a novel regulatory pathway for fish behavioral plasticity, i.e., environmental stimuli - social interactions - HPI axis - corticosteroid receptor system - neurogenesis - adaptability-related behaviors. These results may lay the foundations for restoring fishery resources and for improving fish welfare, add novel knowledge to fish biology and environmental enrichment framework, and help deeply understand the mechanisms of environmental effects on marine animal behaviors.

AB  - Seasonal changes in horn growth and testicular activity in wild bovid are mainly modulated by the photoperiod. Thyroid hormones are required for the transition from the rutting season to the end of the breeding season in domestic ruminants, but their role on modulation the seasonal horn growth in wild bovid is not clear. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that thyroid hormones are required for photoperiodically driven changes in horn growth and testicular activity of the mouflon as a model of wild ruminants. Plasma concentrations of thyroxine were reduced via treatment with propylthiouracil (PTU) under different photoperiodic conditions (natural photoperiod and artificial long days-LDP) from 1 November to 31 December. Plasma testosterone, plasma thyroxine, and horn growth were measured throughout the experimental period (November-March). The overall horn growth during the experiment was higher (p < 0.05) in LDP group than controls, PTU and PTU-LDP groups. The proportion of motile sperm, viable sperm, and sperm with an intact acrosome were reduced (p < 0.05) in PTU group in comparison with control. PTU-LDP showed the greatest progressive motility, straight-line velocity, beat-cross frequency, and linearity of sperm (p < 0.05). Morphological abnormalities were lower (p < 0.05) in LDP group than control. In conclusion, the stimulatory effect of the long-day photoperiod on horn growth requires adequate levels of thyroxine, which is also required for the transition from the rutting season to the end of the breeding season in mouflon.

AB  - The occurrence of bark stripping associated with increased deer densities can severely damage forests. Identifying trends in bark stripping is crucial for forest management, but such data are often difficult to obtain through field surveys. Therefore, this study aimed to develop an efficient monitoring method using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that can detect the occurrence of bark stripping and enable long-term monitoring. The area around the Ochiai Pass in Higashi-Iya Ochiai, Miyoshi City, Tokushima Prefecture, Japan, was selected as the study area for the survey of Abies homolepis, which was found to be significantly bark-stripped by deer in the field. The location and root diameter of A. homolepis were measured, and the percentages of bark stripping and tree growth were visually determined. Simultaneously, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and visible light orthomosaic images were produced using a UAV. A canopy polygon of A. homolepis was created, and the average value of the NDVI within the polygon was calculated. Where the bark stripping rate at the root edge was greater than 75%, the number of "partially dead" and "dead" trees increased significantly, indicating that bark stripping by deer was the primary cause of the death of A. homolepis in Ochiai Pass. In addition, the mean value of the NDVI was significantly lower, with a bark stripping rate of 75% or higher, indicating that the NDVI of the canopy of A. homolepis can be used to estimate individuals with a high bark stripping rate at the root tips, that is, those with a high probability of mortality. Furthermore, by extrapolating the results of the tree-by-tree survey to the nontarget A. homolepis, we detected 46 (8%) A. homolepis with an average NDVI value of 0.8 or less (i.e., those with a bark stripping ratio of 75% or higher and a high probability of mortality). Therefore, the utilization of remote sensing technology via UAVs, as demonstrated in this study, proves to be a potent means for monitoring the incidence of bark stripping.

AB  - Rice is widely consumed as a staple food, being cultivated worldwide. However, in West Africa, production is not enough to satisfy demand. Rice often suffers intensive damage by herbivorous arthropods that affect quality and quantity of the grain. Birds and bats have been shown to suppress arthropod pests, potentially enhancing rice productivity and food security. However, the degree to which these taxa provide nature-based solutions for mitigating pest-induced rice losses is poorly known, especially in West Africa. Here, we used experimental exclosures to investigate whether birds and bats reduce plant damage and boost rice yield by suppressing arthropod abundance. In a rural area in northern Guinea-Bissau, we established 14 sets of paired control and experimental exclosures parcels, precluding access of birds and bats to rice plants. We then quantified how the absence of birds and bats influenced arthropod communities, plant damage, and rice yield over a full rice production cycle (six months). Arthropod numbers in exclosures (10.1 +/- 9.1 ind./plot) were nearly double those in control plots (5.8 +/- 3.0 ind./plot), a result mostly due to a lower spider abundance in the controls. The percentage of leaf and grain damage showed no difference between exclosure and control. Using Structural Equation Models, we uncovered that the exclusion of birds and bats boosted arthropod abundance but had only marginal effects on rice damage and no detectable effect on yield. The exclusion of flying vertebrates led to a marked increase in spider abundance, suggesting an effect of mesopredator release, which in turn likely helped maintaining pest abundance low and potentially contributing to the small overall effect on rice damage and yield. Enhancing the abundance of birds and bats is an interesting option to suppress agricultural pests, but our results highlight the need for a better understanding of ecological interactions in agricultural landscapes in West Africa. We stress the need for more research to inform evidence-based policies using nature-based solutions that foster the natural consumption of pests by vertebrates, as a means to improve food security.

AB  - Leaf litter inputs can influence the structure and function of both terrestrial and adjacent aquatic ecosystems. Dioecy and herbivory are two factors that together have received little attention, yet have the potential to affect the quantity, quality, and timing of riparian litterfall, litter chemistry, and litter decomposition processes. Here, we explore litter chemistry differences for the dioecious Sitka willow (Salix sitchensis Sanson ex. Bong), which is establishing on primary successional habitats at Mount St. Helens (WA, USA) and is heavily infested with a stem-boring weevil (Cryptorhynchus lapathi). Weevil-attacked branches produced summer senesced litter that had significantly higher %N, lower C:N ratios, and lower condensed tannins than litter from branches that were unattacked by the weevil and senesced naturally in the autumn. Weevils more often attack female willows; however, these common litter chemicals did not significantly differ between males and females within the weevil-attacked and -unattacked groups. High-resolution mass spectrometry was used to isolate compounds in litter from 10 Sitka willow individuals with approximately 1500-1600 individual compounds isolated from each sample. There were differences between weevil-attacked litter and green leaf samples, but at this level, there was no clustering of male and female samples. However, further exploration of the isolated compounds determined a suite of compounds present only in either males or females. These findings suggest some variation in more complex litter chemistry between the sexes, and that significant differences in weevil-attacked litter chemistry, coupled with the shift in seasonality of litter inputs to streams, could significantly affect in-stream ecological processes, such as decomposition and detritivore activity.

AB  - The successful establishment of an exotic species is based on its resource-based habitat, and thus depends on its encountering the interaction partners and environmental conditions it requires to complete its life cycle. We examine factors that define the resource-based habitat of the European common blue butterfly (Polyommatus icarus Rottemburg, [1775] (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae)) recently introduced in Quebec, testing the role of exotic host plants and of short vegetation structure. Field studies surveyed adult butterfly abundance in lightly managed urban sites and related it to host plant cover and vegetation structure. Oviposition behavior was also recorded and linked to individual plant traits, namely height, species and anatomical structures. Results show that adult butterflies maintain the same host plant associations as in the native range, suggesting a role for naturalized plants in facilitating the establishment of this exotic herbivore. However, relative oviposition rate was not higher on the most strongly associated host plant (birdsfoot trefoil, Lotus corniculatus, Fabaceae) suggesting no clear behavioral preference for this plant. Butterflies also showed the same association with short vegetation documented in the native range, although the basis for this preference remains unclear. P. icarus uses different biotopes in its invaded range (lightly managed urban sites) than in its native range (unimproved grasslands), and our results show the role of host plants and of short vegetation structure in defining the resource-based habitat that can predict its future expansion. Our results raise interesting questions about why this butterfly uses cities more in its invaded than its native range. The role of cities in insect conservation is increasingly recognized; we show how, paradoxically, a butterfly whose native biotopes are declining has found suitable conditions to thrive in far-removed urban centers.

AB  - Mummified remains have long attracted interest as a potential source of ancient DNA. However, mummification is a rare process that requires an anhydrous environment to rapidly dehydrate and preserve tissue before complete decomposition occurs. We present the whole-genome sequences (3.94 X) of an approximately 1600-year-old naturally mummified sheep recovered from Chehrabad, a salt mine in northwestern Iran. Comparative analyses of published ancient sequences revealed the remarkable DNA integrity of this mummy. Hallmarks of postmortem damage, fragmentation and hydrolytic deamination are substantially reduced, likely owing to the high salinity of this taphonomic environment. Metagenomic analyses reflect the profound influence of high-salt content on decomposition; its microbial profile is predominated by halophilic archaea and bacteria, possibly contributing to the remarkable preservation of the sample. Applying population genomic analyses, we find clustering of this sheep with Southwest Asian modern breeds, suggesting ancestry continuity. Genotyping of a locus influencing the woolly phenotype showed the presence of an ancestral 'hairy' allele, consistent with hair fibre imaging. This, along with derived alleles associated with the fat-tail phenotype, provides genetic evidence that Sasanian-period Iranians maintained specialized sheep flocks for different uses, with the 'hairy', 'fat-tailed'-genotyped sheep likely kept by the rural community of Chehrabad's miners.

AB  - The ability to freely move across the landscape to track the emergence of nutritious spring green-up (termed 'green-wave surfing') is key to the foraging strategy of migratory ungulates. Across the vast landscapes traversed by many migratory herds, habitats are being altered by development with unknown consequences for surfing. Using a unique long-term tracking dataset, we found that when energy development occurs within mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) migration corridors, migrating animals become decoupled from the green wave. During the early phases of a coalbed natural gas development, deer synchronized their movements with peak green-up. But faced with increasing disturbance as development expanded, deer altered their movements by holding up at the edge of the gas field and letting the green wave pass them by. Development often modified only a small portion of the migration corridor but had far-reaching effects on behaviour before and after migrating deer encountered it, thus reducing surfing along the entire route by 38.65% over the 14-year study period. Our study suggests that industrial development within migratory corridors can change the behaviour of migrating ungulates and diminish the benefits of migration. Such disruptions to migratory behaviour present a common mechanism whereby corridors become unprofitable and could ultimately be lost on highly developed landscapes.
   Analysing a long-term tracking dataset of migrating mule deer, the authors show that the expansion of natural gas energy infrastructure over 14 years along a migratory corridor changes deer behaviour and reduces by more than 38% their ability to keep pace with spring vegetation green-up.

AB  - Understanding the factors that drive the evolution of sociality is one of the central issues in behavioural ecology. In ungulates, open habitats, such as alpine meadows, are thought to have promoted the evolution of various gregarious societies from solitary territorial lifestyles. However, the transition from a solitary territorial lifestyle to a gregarious society and the ultimate factors underlying this change remain unclear. The Japanese serow is a primal solitary ungulate. Females in forest-dwelling populations have solitary territorial lifestyles, but the social relationships among females in open-land dwelling populations have not been explored. We evaluated the spatial organisation and social interactions among female Japanese serows in an area with alpine meadows and subalpine forests and examined the effects of alpine meadows on female social relationships through within-population comparisons. We confirmed the presence of both spatially solitary animals (little home range overlap with other individuals) and spatial groups (large home range overlap with two to three individuals), having exclusive territories. Females with more alpine meadows in their home range formed group territories, whereas those with more subalpine forests formed solitary territories. Accordingly, we show, for the first time, that open habitats promote the formation of female spatial groups in a primal solitary ungulate. We suggest that homogenous food distribution and abundant food supply in alpine meadows promote spatial group formation and that the mitigation of exclusive relationships and home range overlapping is a transitional phase for the development of gregarious societies. Significance statement We found spatial group formations among females in a primal solitary ungulate, the Japanese serow, which were promoted by open habitats, such as alpine meadows. Our findings provide evidence for an evolutionary pattern in ungulates, whereby open habitat structures promote the evolution from solitary, territorial lifestyles, to gregarious societies. This indicates that the mitigation of exclusive relationships (i.e. territoriality) and the overlapping of home ranges among females is a transitional phase for the development of gregarious societies. Homogenous food distribution and an abundant food supply in the alpine meadows appear to promote the formation of spatial groups, suggesting that food abundance and distribution are among the important ultimate factors that potentially contribute to the evolution of gregarious societies.

AB  - We aimed to assess how bats are affected by habitat transformation by comparing bat assemblages in four habitat types: primary forest, secondary forest, cocoa plantations and human habitations in the Dja Biosphere Reserve of southern Cameroon. Bats were sampled in the four habitat types using mist nets. During 126 nights, a total of 413 bats were captured, belonging to four families, 16 genera and 24 species. Ninety three individuals (17 species) were captured in the primary forest, followed by plantations (105 individuals, 14 species), human habitations (159 individuals, 10 species), and secondary forest (55 individuals, eight species). Megaloglossus woermanni was recorded in all the four habitats, and was the most abundant species (105 individuals). The analysis of bat assemblage between habitat types showed a statistically significant difference in species composition. The distribution of the six most abundant species (Epomops franqueti, Megaloglossus woermanni, Rousettus aegyptiacus, Dohyrina cyclops, Hipposideros cf. caffer and Hipposideros cf. ruber) was influenced by habitat types. Our results suggest that the decrease in species richness observed in disturbed habitats may be due to habitat perturbations of primary forest habitats. Therefore, it is important to examine the effects of habitat conversion at species level, as responses are often species-specific.

AB  - Predators can affect ecosystems through non-consumptive effects (NCE) on their prey, which can lead to cascading effects on the vegetation. In mammalian communities, such cascading effects on whole ecosystems have mainly been demonstrated in protected areas, but the extent to which such effects may occur in more human-dominated landscapes remains disputable. With the recolonisation of wolves Canis lupus in Europe, understanding the potential for such cascading processes becomes crucial for understanding the ecological consequences of wolf recovery and making appropriate management recommendations. Here, we investigate the evidence for non-consumptive effects of wolves on their wild ungulate prey and cascading effects on the vegetation in European landscapes. We reviewed empirical studies reporting wild ungulate responses to wolves involving spatio-temporal behaviour at large and fine spatial scales, activity patterns, vigilance, grouping, physiological effects, and effects on the vegetation. We reveal that non-consumptive effects of wolves in Europe have been studied in few regions and with focus on regions with low human impact, are highly context-dependent, and might often be overruled by human-related factors. Hence, we highlight the need for a description of human influence in NCE studies. We discuss challenges in NCE research and the potential for advances in future research on NCE of wolves in a human-dominated landscape. We emphasise the need for wildlife management to restore ecosystem complexity and processes, to allow non-consumptive predator effects to occur.

AB  - The burgeoning population of livestock within protected areas exacerbates the transmission risk of parasitic diseases among vulnerable wild ungulates. This study, conducted in the Bani Wildlife Sanctuary nestled in the western Himalayas, focused on the peak periods of livestock grazing (June-October) in 2021 and 2022 to assess the prevalence of gastrointestinal parasites in domestic sheep and goats. A comprehensive examination involved the collection of 230 faecal samples (125 from goats and 105 from sheep) from various locations within the sanctuary, followed by analysis using established sedimentation and floatation techniques. Our findings revealed the presence of 10 distinct parasite taxa, encompassing one coccidian cyst, one cestode, two trematodes, and six nematodes. Comparative analysis with documented parasites infecting wild ungulates underscores the considerable potential for cross -transmission via the faecal-oral route. Notably, the prevalence of gastrointestinal parasite taxa stood at 83.72% in goats and 74.35% in sheep, indicating their heightened susceptibility and potential contribution to pasture infectivity, surpassing that of wild ungulates. These findings suggest a significantly elevated risk of gastrointestinal parasitic transmission from domestic animals to their wild counterparts. Consistent with comparable studies, evidence suggests a correlation between parasite infection in livestock and sympatric wild ungulates, suggesting the perpetuation of these infections within the shared ecosystem. To mitigate this risk, we advocate for the regulation of anthelmintic treatment for domestic livestock and the implementation of grazing zonation strategies to curtail parasite transmission.

AB  - African wild dogs utilise a den for similar to 10-12 weeks after birthing, during which home ranges are contracted and usually in areas away from roads and water sources, with low prey and predator abundances, high terrain ruggedness and vegetation cover. Our study in Save Valley Conservancy (SVC) investigated which ecological and environmental factors determine the selection of denning areas and behaviours. Camera trap data collected from four den grids and three random den grids were analysed using binomial generalised linear and occupancy models. Denning wild dogs preferred areas with higher kudu and impala presence and areas closer to roads and water sources. Wild dogs may den in areas we perceive as riskier in an attempt to reduce energy expenditure when hunting. The detection of wild dogs strongly decreased with higher lion presence, while increasing with steeper slopes, higher vegetation cover and leopard presence. Given lion habitat preferences, SVC wild dogs could be using areas which reduce their exposure to lions, while solitary leopards do not necessarily pose a risk to wild dog packs. Our study highlights that the denning behaviours of wild dogs may be inconsistent both within and among populations, and that comprehensive research approaches be taken to understand their denning behaviours, assisting the development of appropriate management/conservation strategies.

AB  - The Malayan tapir (Tapirus indicus) is an endangered species in Southeast Asia (SEA). Over the years, there has only been a few reports on its population genetic structure and evolutionary history in SEA. In particular, while the captive Malayan tapir population in Thailand has received fairly more research in recent years, there has not been any wide-scale population genetic study in the Malay Peninsula since the last decade. In this study, we report on the genetic diversity and attempt to make inferences on the phylogeography of the Malayan tapir in the Malay Peninsula, using the mitochondrial DNA control region, including also data from previous studies. We identified 12 novel haplotypes and two distinct Malayan tapir clades with a divergence time of 14.6 million years ago (mya) in the Peninsular Malaysia (i.e. southern Malay Peninsula) samples, as opposed to only one clade found in the Thai (i.e. Thailand western border and northern Malay Peninsula) captive individuals, with an almost two-fold higher nucleotide diversity compared to the latter. The co-occurrence of the two lineages in southern Malay Peninsula suggested past historical events of population isolation, migration and admixture as a result of episodic glacial periods and paleoenvironmental changes in SEA. Only one haplotype shared between the populations of the two regions suggested further gene flow restriction at the narrow corridor of the Malay Peninsula as of present day.

AB  - Tropical rainforests around the world are rapidly being converted into cash crop agricultural systems. The associated massive losses of plant and animal species lead to changes in arthropod food webs and the energy fluxes therein. These changes are poorly understood, in particular in the extremely biodiverse canopies of tropical ecosystems. Using canopy fogging followed by stable isotope and energy flux analyses, we show that land-use conversion from rainforest to rubber and oil palm plantations not only causes a drastic reduction in energy fluxes of up to 75%, but also shifts fluxes among trophic groups. While rainforest featured high levels of both herbivory and algae-microbivory, and a balanced ratio of herbivory to predation, relative fluxes were shifted towards predation in rubber and towards herbivory in oil palm plantations, indicating profound shifts in ecosystem functioning. Our results highlight that the ongoing loss of animal biodiversity and biomass in tropical canopies degrades animal-driven functions and restructures canopy food webs.

AB  - Vaginal implant transmitters (VITs) are a popular tool in ungulate parturition studies and have been used in moose (Alces alces), but their potential impact on animal performance has not been thoroughly assessed. We looked at potential short-term impacts of VIT use on maternal condition through assessments of neonate calf mass, early calf survival, and parturition date. We also assessed long-term impacts of VIT use on future reproduction and the inflammatory response after prolonged VIT retention through qualifying discharge at VIT removal and measures of acute phase proteins haptoglobin and ceruloplasmin. We captured 54 neonates and assessed over 900 potential parturition events of 278 adult moose over multiple years and we did not detect any evidence of a negative impact of VIT use on neonate calf mass, parturition date, or future reproduction. We did find elevated haptoglobin and ceruloplasmin levels in non-pregnant individuals that had unintentional VIT retention past parturition, but this was not universal across all cases. We found a potential negative impact of VIT use on early calf survival which was likely driven by biased sampling. A bias can exist (i.e., left truncation) if sampling is mixed between cows that had a VIT (and, therefore, a known parturition time) and those without a VIT that were sampled opportunistically. Future evaluations need to overcome this bias when assessing early calf survival. With that caveat, we did not detect clear negative impacts of VIT use on moose and recommend late winter to early spring VIT insertion in pregnant females to minimize retention time.

AB  - Species of the genus Bison, along with many other vertebrate taxa, represented an important part of Pleistocene megafauna. Following the Quaternary extinction event, however, only the American bison (Bison bison) and the European bison or wisent (Bison bonasus) survived to present times. The phylogeny of Bison species from the Late Pliocene to the end of the Middle Pleistocene is still uncertain. In comparison, the availability of genetic data has greatly improved our knowledge of Late Pleistocene and Holocene bison. In recent years, the phylogenetic approach has provided new details and insights into the evolution and phylogeny of the genus, such as i) Bison bison evolved from central North American bison populations and, contrary to earlier assumptions, was not the result of mixing with Beringian bison; ii) in Europe, the Late Pleistocene ancestors of Bison bonasus occupied the same areas as coeval Bison priscus; iii) admixture events between the genera Bos and Bison led to the introgression of Bos mitochondrial DNA into extant Bison bonasus, but the exact evolution of the latter remains unknown.

AB  - Background: An accurate assessment of the carbon budget is a crucial part of projecting future climate change and its impact on ecosystems. Grasslands foster multiple ecological functions including support for wild animals and livestocks. Herbivores intake forage biomass carbon, then digest and metabolize, and finally retain some carbon. The carbon processes have not been well quantified, resulting in uncertainties in the estimation of regional carbon budgets for grassland ecosystems.
   Methods: An animal metabolic carbon flux model was developed for herbivores in the Three-Rivers Headwaters region of China. The forage intake and metabolic carbon rates were estimated through metabolic body weight and daily digested measures for the main herbivore species.
   Results: The carbon intake was 5.52TgCyear(-1) (45%) from partial aboveground biomass (12.2TgCyear(-1)), in which 39.31% was released into the atmosphere by respiration CO2, 43.77% was returned to the ecosystem as feces and urine, and 16.96% was retained in herbivores for population regeneration or for human well-being.
   Conclusions: This study, as the first research on this topic, quantified the carbon flux of herbivores and found livestock accounts for a major part of consumed carbon on grasslands, which is important for understanding regional carbon budgets to mitigate and adapt to climate change over grasslands worldwide.

AB  - PurposeThe effects of trees on soil nematode communities are related to nutrient cycles in forest ecosystems. We conducted greenhouse pot experiments to determine the effects of a single tree species for each of coniferous and broad-leaved tree on soil nematodes.MethodsSoils were collected from a coniferous plantation and broad-leaved forests. Seedlings of a coniferous tree (Cryptomeria japonica) and a broad-leaved tree (Quercus serrata) were planted in soils derived from each species. After 11 months, seedling biomass, soil properties, and ectomycorrhizal fungal colonization of Q. serrata were measured. Soil nematodes were morphologically identified to the genus/family level and differentiated by community and trophic composition.ResultsC. japonica root biomass was significantly higher than that of Q. serrata regardless of the soil and nematode community structures were significantly different between the species. The fungal: bacterial ratio and density of fungivorous nematodes were significantly higher in broad-leaved soils. Herbivorous nematodes increased significantly in C. japonica seedlings grown in broad-leaved soils. Structural equation modeling indicated that soil origin and tree species directly regulated nematode trophic compositions.ConclusionOur findings suggest that tree species modify soil micro-food webs by affecting microbial abundance and nematode trophic composition. Specifically, C. japonica, with a larger root biomass, increased the number of herbivorous nematodes, whereas Q. serrata, with ectomycorrhizal fungal symbiosis, increased the number of fungivorous nematodes. Thus, tree species are tightly involved in shaping nematode communities in forest ecosystems through root traits and mycorrhizal types.

AB  - Fishes are conspicuous and threatened components of reef ecosystems. Understanding the role of the variables that shape their assemblages is important to buffer species, fishery stocks, and habitats from anthropogenic threats. So, the influence of depth and topographic complexity on trophic guilds and body size of reef fishes was assessed by underwater visual censuses (UVCs) conducted in biogenic reefs, rocky reefs, and rhodolith beds interspersed with algae, invertebrates, and sand. The study area lies in the southern continental shelf of Espirito Santo state, Brazil, a region that has lacked thorough UVC surveys of biogenic reefs and rhodolith habitats. A total of 105 species belonging to 42 fish families were registered. Among the eight trophic guilds registered, mobile invertebrate feeders and herbivores were the most representative in terms of density and biomass. Biogenic and rocky reefs showed higher biomass, density and richness than rhodolith habitats due to greater topographic complexity, which promotes more food resources and shelter. The five habitats hosted distinct fish assemblages (guilds and taxonomic diversity) probably because of the varying ability of resources they provide. Nevertheless, all habitats were dominated by species of low trophic level. Large fish, especially macrocarnivores, were mostly found in the deepest zones. This pattern is associated with ecological preferences but could also be strengthened by overfishing on shallower sites, decreasing the abundance of top predators and influencing their depth distribution. Our results provide a baseline for future studies, presenting subsidies for the management of human activities and the conservation of marine ecosystems in southeastern Brazil.

AB  - A thorough understanding of environmental variables determining the abundance of species is fundamental for effective planning for conservation and management of wildlife and their habitat, especially in managed natural systems. Most protected areas in Africa afforded minimal conservation efforts are poorly assessed and increasingly faced with threats, making effective conservation of wildlife species within challenging. We used road transect surveys to investigate the environmental and anthropogenic variables that determine the abundance of two sympatric antelope (Gerenuk gazelle, [Litocranius walleri] and Grant's gazelle, [Nanger granti]) in Lake Natron partially protected ecosystem in northern Tanzania to improve conservation of these species. Fitting the data with a Quasi-Poisson GLM, we found habitat type, landscape elevation, season and tree cuts were the most important predictors of species abundance for both species. Gerenuk and Grant's gazelle were more abundant in grassland and both tended to avoid degraded patches and areas closer to previous hunting sites, suggesting that habitat loss and hunting is having a top down impacts on the abundance and distribution of these species. Further, both species tended to avoid areas with water points especially during the dry season and foraged more on lowland sites perhaps to avoid being targeted by hunters. Our findings strongly suggest that maintaining habitat quality by minimising human activities such as tree cuts and hunting may improve conservation of antelopes in this fragile ecosystem.

AB  - In semiarid regions, the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) is a major small mammal species occupying perennial grassland habitats that include old-fields, native bunchgrass-sagebrush, and some agricultural settings. We investigated population changes in deer mouse populations in perennial grasslands, both natural and old-field, from 1982 to 2003 in southern British Columbia, Canada. Hypotheses (H) predicted that P. maniculatus populations will have (H-1) multiannual fluctuations in abundance driven by population increases from extended breeding in summer and winter; (H-2) relaxed spring reorganization events in some years leading to higher overall recruitment and survival; and (H-3) interspecific competition with montane voles that causes deer mice to be lower in density when voles are higher. P. maniculatus populations in old-field and grass-sagebrush sites had clearly defined periods of high "peak" mean numbers (32-52/ha) and other times of low mean numbers (20-22/ha). Based on mean annual peak density in autumn, deer mouse populations exhibited fluctuations of 3-4 years in both habitats, but this pattern was not always present. The greater numbers of P. maniculatus in high than low years was directly related to population increases from extended breeding seasons and an increased number of lactating females, thereby supporting H-1. Spring breeding season declines occurred but were similar or less in high than low years of mean abundance and were relaxed in comparison to forest populations of deer mice in other studies. Thus, H-2 was supported for recruitment with high numbers of young-of-the-year breeding and total number of juvenile recruits but for survival was equivocal. Total summer survival was consistently higher in high than low population years but juvenile productivity in all years was poor. Mean abundance of P. maniculatus and M. montanus in old-field sites were highly correlated, and hence H-3 was not supported. This latter result is the first, to our knowledge, of P. maniculatus coexisting in a similar pattern of population fluctuations with a Microtus species in a mainland grassland habitat. Higher than average precipitation in the year preceding a peak population of deer mice may have enhanced herbaceous vegetation and contributed to population increases in both habitats. We conclude that the old-field habitat associated with this agricultural setting provides optimum habitat for P. maniculatus and facilitates multiannual population fluctuations in this species.

AB  - Background Black-boned sheep is a precious genetic resource with black quality traits cultivated by the Pumi people in Tongdian Town, Lanping County, Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture, Northwest Yunnan, China. It has been included in the "National Breed List of Livestock and Poultry Genetic Resources." The local communities have a deep understanding of black-boned sheep. The traditional knowledge of black-boned sheep is essential to their conservation and sustainable development. In spite of this, there was no information on traditional knowledge associated with black-boned sheep so far. The aim of this study wasaimed to document traditional knowledge and culture, to elucidate information about forage plants, and to investigate the conservation strategy of black-boned sheep. Method Four field surveys were conducted from July 2019 to May 2021. A total of seven villages and the Pumi Culture Museum in Lanping County are being investigated. A semi-structured interview method was used to interview 67 key informants. During the investigation, we also participated in the grazing activities of black-boned sheep, observed the appearance characteristics and the herd structure of the black-boned sheep, and demonstrated traditional knowledge regarding black-boned sheep, including grazing methods, forage plants, and related customs and habits. Results We assumed that a majority of people in the current study sites were able to could distinguish black-boned sheep from their relatives by their black bones, blue-green gums, and blue-purple anus. The local people manage their black-boned sheep based on the number of sheep by sex, age, and role in a flock in the different breeding environments. Different grazing strategies have been adopted in different seasons. Through ethnobotanical investigations, 91 species of forage plants in 30 families were identified, including herbaceous, shrubs, lianas, and trees. Among all the plant species consumed by the black-boned sheep, Rosaceae species make up the greatest number, with 16, followed by Asteraceae, with 9, and 8 species of Fabaceae and Poaceae. Considering the abundance of forage plants and the preference for black-boned sheep, Prinsepia utilis and the plants of Rubus, Berberis, and Yushania occupy dominant positions. Plants used for foraging are divided into two categories: wild and cultivated. Due to the lack of forage plants in fall and winter, the local people mainly cultivate crops to feed their black-boned sheep. In addition, the black-boned sheep is an influential cultural species in the local community and plays a prominent role in the cultural identity of the Pumi people. Conclusion Sheep play an essential role in the inheritance of the spiritual culture and material culture of the Pumi ethnic group. The formation of the black-boned sheep is inseparable from the worship of sheep by the Pumi people. With a long-term grazing process, the locals have developed a variety of traditional knowledge related to black-boned sheep. This is the experience that locals have accumulated when managing forests and grasslands. Therefore, both the government and individuals should learn from the local people when it comes to protecting black-boned sheep. No one knows black-boned sheep better than them. The foremost evidence of this is the rich traditional knowledge of breeding black-boned sheep presented by key informants.

AB  - Human activity and land use change impact every landscape on Earth, driving declines in many animal species while benefiting others. Species ecological and life history traits may predict success in human-dominated landscapes such that only species with "winning" combinations of traits will persist in disturbed environments. However, this link between species traits and successful coexistence with humans remains obscured by the complexity of anthropogenic disturbances and variability among study systems. We compiled detection data for 24 mammal species from 61 populations across North America to quantify the effects of (1) the direct presence of people and (2) the human footprint (landscape modification) on mammal occurrence and activity levels. Thirty-three percent of mammal species exhibited a net negative response (i.e., reduced occurrence or activity) to increasing human presence and/or footprint across populations, whereas 58% of species were positively associated with increasing disturbance. However, apparent benefits of human presence and footprint tended to decrease or disappear at higher disturbance levels, indicative of thresholds in mammal species' capacity to tolerate disturbance or exploit human-dominated landscapes. Species ecological and life history traits were strong predictors of their responses to human footprint, with increasing footprint favoring smaller, less carnivorous, faster-reproducing species. The positive and negative effects of human presence were distributed more randomly with respect to species trait values, with apparent winners and losers across a range of body sizes and dietary guilds. Differential responses by some species to human presence and human footprint highlight the importance of considering these two forms of human disturbance separately when estimating anthropogenic impacts on wildlife. Our approach provides insights into the complex mechanisms through which human activities shape mammal communities globally, revealing the drivers of the loss of larger predators in human-modified landscapes.

AB  - Natural disturbances can produce a mosaic of seagrass patches of different ages, which may affect the response to herbivory. These pressures can have consequences for plant performance. To assess how seagrass patch age affects the response to herbivory, we simulated the effect of herbivory by clipping leaves of Halodule wrightii in patches of 2, 4 and 6 years. All clipped plants showed ability to compensate herbivory by increasing leaf growth rate (on average 4.5 -fold). The oldest patches showed resistance response by increasing phenolic compounds (1.2 -fold). Contrastingly, the concentration of phenolics decreased in the youngest patches (0.26 -fold), although they had a similar leaf carbon content to controls. These results suggest that younger plants facing herbivory pressure reallocate their phenolic compounds towards primary metabolism. Results confirm the H. wrightii tolerance to herbivory damage and provides evidence of age -dependent compensatory responses, which may have consequences for seagrass colonization and growth in perturbed habitats.

AB  - Introduction: Evidence suggests that herbivores, such as peccaries, shape vegetation structure and diversity through predation, trampling, dispersal, and rooting behavior. Objective: To evaluate the impact of peccaries (Dycotiles tajacu) on the understory vegetation of the tropical rainforest in the Nogal-La Selva Local Biological Corridor, Costa Rica, comparing a site with the absence of peccaries to another with the presence of these animals. Methodology: From June to November 2021, 20 experimental exclusions and 20 free access plots, each measuring 2 m(2) were used to quantify herbivory, the number of leaf blades, damaged leaves, healthy leaves, sapling height, and fallen biomass at both sites. Results: A higher sapling density was found in the Nogal Reserve, but a lower sapling diversity, while in La Selva there was a higher sapling diversity, but a lower density of seedlings. Herbivory and sapling height in La Selva exceeded those in Nogal. The exclusion of peccaries reduced seedling damage but did not affect the dynamics of fallen biomass. Conclusion: For the design, implementation, and evaluation of the effectiveness of biological corridors, it is crucial to consider plant -animal interactions to enhance the flow of ecological processes through functional and structural connectivity, analyzed from interactions such as those presented in this paper.

AB  - 1. Biodiversity is threatened by global changes, but related research has focused primarily on species or functional group diversity, neglecting their interaction networks. The latter are particularly sensitive to global changes and essential for biodiversity maintenance. Furthermore, multiple global change factors are typically examined separately, rather than in concert which is more realistic in nature.2. To explore the responses of arthropod networks to multiple global changes, we conducted a field experiment in temperate grassland in northeast China, in which nitrogen (N) deposition, drought, snowmelt timing and their interactions were manipulated. We constructed and assessed networks of arthropod functional groups, and explored their responses to changes in plant communities and the abiotic environments.3. Nitrogen addition decreased arthropod network complexity because increased foliar N and simplified plant community strengthened trophic chains along a single pathway, weakening the net effect of other pathways. However, experimental drought decreased network complexity by filtering out plant species and changing micro-habitats. While delayed snowmelt significantly increased arthropod abundance only in early spring, its interaction with N addition or with drought had various impacts on arthropod functional groups. Our results suggest that the interaction of arthropod consumers with plant species richness and with plant nutrients finally reduced the robustness, connectedness and function of entire species/functional group networks in response to global change factors.4. In conclusion, species loss and increasing plant nutrient concentrations are key factors simplifying networks under multiple global changes, and such simplification is likely to be strengthened if coupled with changes in micro-habitats. Our study highlighted that the effects of multiple global change factors should be studied in concert, even though they occur in different seasons, so that their effects on ecological networks can be perceived as a panorama.

AB  - The area around the Sanam Chai Khet Forestry Research and Training Station (SCKFRTS) has been declared a degraded forest. The remaining wildlife in the area is affected by habitat loss, conversion of natural areas to agricultural areas, human settlements, fragmentation, and human disturbance, resulting in the loss of species, populations, and genetic resources. However, there are no studies on wildlife diversity in this region. Therefore, we investigated the diversity, abundance, and activity period of mammals in the SCKFRTS region to provide guidelines for efficient conservation management. We conducted a study of the diversity, abundance, and activity period of wildlife species using camera trapping in the SCKFRTS, from July 2023 to May 2024, for 11 months, with 46 camera trap locations, totaling 1,668 trap nights. The results revealed 3 classes, 11 orders, and 22 species of wildlife species. The wildlife diversity index was 2.03. The highest species diversity index was observed for wild elephants ( 0.36) , followed by that for red junglefowl ( 0.24) and large-spotted civets ( 0.20) . The relative abundance index of all the recorded species was 15.95%. Wild elephants were the most abundant ( 7.31%) species. Species that were active at night included the large-spotted civet, small Indian civet, and longtailed giant rat. Cathemeral species included the golden jackal, northern red muntjac, and wild elephant. Strongly diurnal species included the small Indian mongoose, northern pig-tailed macaque, and Indochinese ground squirrel. These findings indicate that various natural wildlife inhabits the area. Therefore, the impact of activities conducted in this area on wildlife should be considered. Management should be conducted as a model for conservation in the area, and the ecology of important wildlife in the area should be monitored.

AB  - In North America, winters are becoming more variable such that warm and cold extremes are increasingly common. Refugia (in time or space) can reduce the exposure animals experience to extreme temperatures. However, animals must be able to adjust their behavior to capitalize on refugia. Our goal was to identify the behavioral mechanisms that grant access to refugia in time and space, focusing on a northern ungulate (white-tailed deer, Odocoileus virginianus) as a model. We drew upon an extensive camera trap network in Wisconsin, USA, over two winters that experienced both warm and cold extremes. To understand the use of temporal refugia, we modeled deer activity (at daily resolution) during night, dawn, day, and dusk as a function of weather predictors. To understand the use of spatial refugia, we modeled deer activity at camera locations (at daily resolution) as a function of landscape characteristics, weather conditions, and landscape-weather interactions. During anomalously cold temperatures, deer became more diurnal; conversely, on anomalously warm days, deer were more nocturnal. Deer were more active in conifer-dominated landscapes on cold days. Conversely, during warm extremes, deer increased activity in deciduous-dominated landscapes. Finally, deer showed multiple modes of behavioral flexibility (activity in time as well as space) and demonstrated stronger responses to temperature anomalies later in the winter, suggesting that the effects of extreme events are dependent upon their seasonal timing. Behavioral shifts presumably reduce exposure to extremes and may render species more resilient to increasingly variable winter climates.
   On-the-fly adjustments to behavior are the first line of defense against short-term climatic extremes. During winter cold waves, deer changed their behavior in time (becoming more active during daylight hours) and space (showing greater activity in conifer-dominated landscapes), adjustments that presumably reduce their exposure to extremely cold temperatures. Conversely, during winter warm waves, deer were more night-active and more likely to use deciduous-dominated landscapes, which provide less buffering against cold temperatures.

AB  - With the rapid pace of global warming, there is an urgent need to understand survival responses to climate, particularly for large mammals that are already experiencing population declines associated with anthropogenic pressures such as poaching and habitat loss. We tested hypotheses about the interactive effects of local climatic anomalies (variations around a long-term mean) and proximity to edge of protected area boundaries on seasonal adult and juvenile survival in a population of 2,385 individually identified giraffes monitored over 8 years in the Tarangire Ecosystem of northern Tanzania. Temperature anomalies were positively correlated with seasonal survival of adult giraffes, suggesting these megaherbivores are adapted to hot conditions. Higher seasonal rainfall anomalies were negatively correlated with both juvenile and adult survival, and greater vegetation greenness was associated with lower adult survival. During seasons of anomalously high rainfall and vegetation greenness, higher parasite and disease abundance, poorer-quality nutrition in forage, and higher predation risk may all play a role in lowering giraffe survival. Furthermore, climate-associated reduction in survival was most pronounced during the short rainy season for adult giraffes living closer to the edge of protected areas, indicating that the influence of climate anomalies may be exacerbated by anthropogenic edge effects such as poaching or livestock keeping. Precipitation in East Africa is projected to increase substantially, with a greater proportion of rain falling during heavy events in the short rainy season, which may threaten persistence of giraffes in one of Earth's most important landscapes for large mammals.

AB  - Human-environment interactions are a focus of interdisciplinary research in the high Andes, recently invigorated by sediment-core data from Lake Junin (Chinchaycocha). On the basis of these records, recent articles have argued that humans arrived in the Junin basin 13 thousand calibrated years ago (kya), set large-scale fires, and hunted Pleistocene megafauna to extinction. Declines in montane tree pollen beginning similar to 4 kya have been attributed to deforestation, camelid domestication, and agriculture on the high Andean puna. In this paper, we critically examine these arguments and contrast them with a compilation of archaeological data from the Lake Junin basin including 113 radiocarbon dates (12 unpublished), settlement patterns, camelid osteometry, macrobotanical remains, Inca period sites, and ethnographic and ethnohistoric descriptions of herding and farming. These data suggest that the earliest archaeological evidence for human occupation is not until similar to 11 kya, and there is no clear evidence for interaction with Pleistocene megafauna. Although the Junin basin is often cited as a center for camelid domestication in the middle Holocene, this claim remains tenuous, since osteometry struggles to distinguish wild and domestic camelids. Finally, ethnohistoric and ethnographic information offer no support for the argument that the basin was a "manufactured landscape" in the late Holocene. Moving forward, we recommend more careful consideration of (1) the mismatch of temporal resolution in paleoecological and archaeological chronologies, (2) the potential spatial mismatch in the catchment area of palaeoecological proxies and archaeological datasets, and (3) ambiguity in Sporormiella as a proxy for fauna and charcoal as a proxy for human activity. We suggest that future work on paleoecological proxies from 0.7 to 0.3 kya could be harnessed to build a comparative baseline, since these centuries saw large populations of humans and domesticated camelids near the lake. Our goal is to promote more robust reconstructions of human-environment interactions in the Lake Junin basin and elsewhere.

AB  - The potential for climate change to affect animal behaviour is widely recognized, yet its possible consequences on ag-gressiveness are still unclear. If warming and drought limit the availability of food resources, climate change may elicit an increase of intraspecific conflicts stemming from resource competition. By measuring aggressivity indices in a group-living, herbivorous mammal (the Apennine chamois Rupicapra pyrenaica ornata) in two sites differing in habitat quality, and coupling them with estimates of plant productivity, we investigated whether harsh climatic conditions ac-cumulated during the growing season influenced agonistic contests at feeding via vegetation-mediated effects, and their interaction with the site-specific habitat quality. We focused on females, which exhibit intra-group contest com-petition to access nutritious food patches. Accounting for confounding variables, we found that (1) the aggression rate between foraging individuals increased with the warming accumulated over previous weeks; (2) the probability to de-liver more aggressive behaviour patterns toward contestants increased with decreasing rainfall recorded in previous weeks; (3) the effects of cumulative warming and drought on aggressivity indices occurred at time windows spanning 15-30 days, matching those found on vegetation productivity; (4) the effects of unfavourable climatic conditions via vegetation growth on aggressivity were independent of the site-specific habitat quality. Simulations conducted on our model species predict a similar to 50 % increase in aggression rate following the warming projected over the next 60 years. Where primary productivity will be impacted by warming and drought, our findings suggest that the anticipated climate change scenarios may trigger bottom-up consequences on intraspecific animal conflicts. This study opens the doors for a better understanding of the multifactorial origin of aggression in group-living foragers, emphasising how the escalation of agonistic contests could emerge as a novel response of animal societies to ongoing global warming.

AB  - Nyungwe National Park (NNP) is one of Rwanda's largest remaining tropical forests. Due to the increasing threats from human activities, the park's biodiversity has been severely affected. In 1999, elephants were removed from the park due to these threats. This study, therefore, intends to analyze the human-driven extinction of elephants in Nyungwe National Park, Rwanda from 1965 to 1999. The results revealed that the human activities that lead to the extinction of elephants in Nyungwe include: Poaching for ivory trade at 75%, poaching for bushmeat at 20,6%, poaching for traditional medicine at 2,7% and poaching for decoration at the late 0,8%. The illegal human-driven activities that led to elephant extinction were Poaching, Gold Mining and Logging/tree harvesting. These activities were promoted by Poaching for Ivory Trading, Poaching for Bushmeat, Poverty and Human-elephants conflicts. All of these degraded elephant habitats in various locations such as Kamiranzovu, Gasare, Bigugu and eventually resulted in the extinction of elephants in NNP. Conservation efforts that exist today in Nyungwe National Park need to be reinforced mainly for threatened species so that they may not become extinct from Nyungwe as well and reintroduction of elephants in Nyungwe is needed for sustainable conservation of Nyungwe's biodiversity and tourism product development. In addition to this, an assessment of habitat quality in areas formerly occupied by elephants in Nyungwe is also needed as a prerequisite for elephant re-introduction planning and implementation.

AB  - Lantana camara L. (Verbenaceae) is recognised as a problematic invasive alien plant species in many parts of the world. To eradicate or control this global invader, we need to understand the drivers of its spread and impacts and the potential for native recovery after the invader has been removed. Here, we tested for species associations between L. camara and native plant species and large herbivores in Queen Elizabeth National Park, Uganda. We inventoried 40,100-m2 2 nested plots spread over a 1 x 1-km grid cell in the park's savanna landscape, with 11 plots located in uninvaded areas. Most of the plots (30 of 40) had been affected by fire. Lantana camara covered 29 (73%) plots, 11 (38%) of which were in open grassland. Of the large herbivores that frequented areas free of L. camara, , the Ugandan kob Adenota kob thomasi Sclater tended to avoid the areas invaded. The floristic composition of invaded areas differed significantly from that of noninvaded areas, with several palatable species rare or absent from L. camara-invaded areas. Practical implication: : These observations indicate the presence of potential recovery constraints that will need to be overcome after L. camara has been removed. Sustained efforts will be needed to suppress the invader and subsequently enrich and bolster native recovery.

AB  - Hurricane Harvey (Harvey) struck the Texas coast 25-27 August, 2017, and produced massive flooding of the Galveston Bay tributaries. The slow release of floodwaters from the Barker and Addicks Reservoirs, west of Houston, produced a 48-day flood across metro-Houston through via Buffalo Bayou, through the San Jacinto Estuary (SJE), before flowing into Galveston Bay. To quantify the thickness and mass of sediment which was delivered to Galveston Bay as well as the mass of mercury (Hg), a series of 56 pushcores were collected from across Galveston Bay, including the San Jacinto Estuary, Trinity Bay, Galveston Bay, East Galveston Bay, Clear Lake, and Dickinson Bayou. X-radiographs of each core was used to quantify the thickness of the flood layer and average water content of the cores was used to estimate bulk density of the cores in the estimation the flood deposit mass. Using average Hg concentrations from each core, combined with the bulk densities, Hg mass calculations were made for the sub-bays and the entire bay system. Within Galveston Bay and the SJE, Harvey deposited 131.34 x 10(6) t of sediment, representing 31 years of average annual sediment load to the bay. The combined Galveston Bay and SJE Harvey deposit contains 5.09 t of Hg. This Hg was primarily sourced from legacy Hg which had been archived in lower Buffalo Bayou and the SJE due to elevated land subsidence and as a result of historical releases from industrial wastewater, primariy from Patrick Bayou, a small tributary of lower Buffalo Bayou. Harvey flooding eroded nearly the entire upper 0.5 cm of lower SJE, resulting in the erosion of 16.4 x 10(6) t of sediment, containing at least 3.43 t of Hg, from the SJE and Patrick Bayou, dispersing it within Galveston Bay. The floodwater during peak discharge rapidly exited Galveston Bay into the Gulf of Mexico. In contrast, the slow release from the Barker and Addicks Reservoirs resulted in prolonged hydraulic trapping of both floodwaters and suspended sediment within Trinity and upper Galveston Bay. The prolonged hydraulic trapping contributed to the broad dispersal of Hg across Galveston Bay and also increased the potential exposure of marine organisms to the elevated concentrations of Hg within the suspended sediment. With the increase in slow-moving storms and the archiving of legacy contaminants within urbanized estuaries, especially where there is elevated land subsidence, suggests that the impact and dispersal of legacy contaminants within Galveston Bay by Harvey is a harbinger of things to come for other urbanized estuaries throughout the world.

AB  - Elucidating patterns of adult survival rates is key to understanding population dynamics of large mammals. We used data from 7 separate studies of mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus) conducted from 2002 through 2022 in western Washington, USA, to quantify survival rates in relation to key biotic and abiotic factors using known fate models implemented in program MARK. We monitored 324 (206 females, 118 males) radio-marked mountain goats for 178,339 days. A substantial number of mountain goats in our sample (n = 217) had been translocated from the Olympic Peninsula to the Cascade Mountains on Washington's mainland, providing an added opportunity to examine translocation effects. We adopted a sequential modeling approach, first building a set of models to examine fundamental survival patterns by age, sex, season, study area, and translocated status. We used variables retained from the top model in a second set to investigate relationships between annual survival and local weather covariates hypothesized by previous studies to influence mountain goat behavior, habitat selection, and vital rates. Survival among adult females in spring was slightly lower than other sex and age categories, but seasonal patterns were otherwise not evident. There were significant negative relationships between survival and winter snow depth, an index of the previous year's drought, and mean daily temperature during the previous May, and a positive relationship with previous year's precipitation. Weather effects were similar among resident and translocated animals. By the end of the study period, weather effects had evidently contributed to reductions in mountain goat survival to a level low enough that population stability was unlikely. Because the frequency of droughts and warm spring temperatures are expected to increase with climate change, mountain goat populations in Washington will likely be increasingly challenged as the atmosphere warms.

AB  - Eutrophication and lake depth are of key importance in structuring lake ecosystems. To elucidate the effect of contrasting nutrient concentrations and water levels on the microbial community in fully mixed shallow lakes, we manipulated water depth and nutrients in a lake mesocosm experiment in north temperate Estonia and followed the microbial community dynamics over a 6-month period. The experiment was carried out in Lake Vortsjarv-a large, shallow eutrophic lake. We used two nutrient levels crossed with two water depths, each represented by four replicates. We found treatment effects on the microbial food web structure, with nutrients having a positive and water depth a negative effect on the biomasses of bacterial and heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF) (RM-ANOVA, p < 0.05). Nutrients affected positively and depth negatively the mean size of individual HNF and ciliate cells (RM-ANOVA; p < 0.05). The interactions of depth and nutrients affected positively the biomass of bacterivorous and bacteri-herbivorous ciliates and negatively the biomass of predaceous ciliates (RM-ANOVA; p < 0.05). Bacterivorous ciliates had lowest biomass in shallow and nutrient-rich mesocosms, whilst predaceous ciliates had highest biomass here, influencing trophic interactions in the microbial loop. Overall, increased nutrient concentrations and decreased water level resulted in an enhanced bacterial biomass and a decrease in their main grazers. These differences appeared to reflect distinctive regulation mechanisms inside the protozoan community and in the trophic interactions in the microbial loop community.

AB  - The one-host cattle fever tick, Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) annulatus (Say), and southern cattle fever tick, Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus (Canestrini), are important ectoparasitic pests of cattle, Bos taurus L., mostly for transmitting the causal agents of bovine babesiosis. Bovine babesiosis inflicted substantial cattle production losses in the United States before the vectors were eliminated by 1943, with the exception of a Permanent Quarantine Zone in South Texas, a buffer along the Mexico border where the invasive ixodids remain. As suitable hosts, infested white-tailed deer and nilgai antelope populations disperse R. annulatus and R. microplus, which increases the risk for emergence of bovine babesiosis in the United States. A R. microplus incursion first detected in 2016 on the South Texas coastal plain wildlife corridor involved infestations on cattle, nilgai antelope, white-tailed deer, and vegetation. Efforts at passive sampling of Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) spp. on hosts are concentrated in the Permanent Quarantine Zone. Hence, a knowledge gap exists on the full extent of the recent incursions. Area-wide, systematic, active sampling and supportive research, involving the Permanent Quarantine Zone, Temporary Quarantine Zone, most of the coastal plain, and other parts of Texas outside of the quarantine zones, are needed to bridge the knowledge gap. Herein, we provide research perspectives and rationale to develop and implement systematic active sampling that will provide an increasingly accurate assessment of Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) spp. distribution in Texas. We suggest that this is essential to advance integrated vector-borne animal disease eradication approaches for keeping cattle free of bovine babesiosis.

AB  - To better understand winter foraging patterns of Odocoileus virginianus ( White- tailed Deer) in the context of global change, we assessed foraging trends using microhistological analysis of fecal pellets from 2006-2018 across a network of monitoring plots in 39 relict Tsuga canadensis (Eastern Hemlock) stands in the western Upper Peninsula of Michigan. We found that deciduous browse comprised the majority of the diet, but conifer species were also eaten. During severe winters, Eastern Hemlock and Abies balsamea (Balsam Fir) were more prevalent in the diet, whereas in mild winters, Thuja occidentalis (Northern White Cedar) was more prevalent. Because Northern White Cedar comprises only a small amount of the forest community in these stands, deer were likely traveling beyond these winter yarding areas to forage. The relationship between conifer consumption and winter severity highlights the importance of energy conservation for winter survival of White- tailed Deer. More extreme winter weather is predicted with climate change, potentially prolonging confinement and limited forage availability, which is liable to alter energy budgets of deer, thus potentially altering population dynamics.

AB  - Little is known about modification of nutrient fluxes through elephant-induced woodland change. We assessed litter quality, soil N attributes, and N transformations in five 20 x 20 m plots each established on sites of low, medium, and high elephant utilization categorized using dung-count surveys in three mopane woodland patches in Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe. Litter standing crop significantly declined but litter N, lignin, lignin:N, condensed tannins, and total phenols increased with increasing elephant utilization, peaking at intermediate levels of elephant utilization. Medium elephant utilization sites had more than twice the nitrate pools in low and high elephant utilization sites (p < 0.001). Ammonium concentration at low elephant utilization was lower by 65% and 92% than at high and medium elephant utilization, respectively. Soil moisture, infiltration rates, N mineralization, and nitrification decreased with increasing elephant utilization. Nitrogen mineralization and nitrification were up to four times greater in low than in medium and high elephant utilization sites. Ammonium, N mineralization, and nitrification were positively correlated to litter N but negatively correlated to condensed tannins. These results indicate that elephant-induced woodland change plays an important role in carbon and nutrient fluxes potentially increasing resources heterogeneity and reinforcing the patch dynamics of savanna.

AB  - Purpose The woolly beech aphid thrives on European beech leaves, which has complex direct and indirect impacts on above- and belowground processes. A mechanistic understanding of insect-mediated changes in organic carbon (OC) availability for microbial life and its implications for element cycling is still lacking. This study aims at disentangling aphid-induced effects on phyllosphere and rhizosphere bacterial communities, as well as investigating feedbacks to OC transfer from the canopy to the mineral soil. Methods Following 2.5 months of infestation, we tracked the fate of OC ((CO2)-C-13 pulse-labelling) in several compartments of beech sapling - soil mesocosms over 5 days. In ecosystem solutions, water extracts and soil/plant compartments we determined OC and N and solid delta C-13. Bacterial community structure (16S rRNA gene targeted amplicon sequencing and quantitative PCR) and metabolite profiles (LC-qTOF-MS) were analysed. Results We found significantly higher aphid-mediated inputs of OC within throughfall. Honeydew-derived C on infested leaves was inconsequential for total phyllosphere bacterial abundances, but verifiably affected the community structure. In all soil compartments, cold-water extractable OC pools declined significantly by frequent inputs of readily available OC. This pattern might relate to reductions in rhizodepositions and altered microbial processing by accelerated soil C-mineralization. As a result, the abundance of metabolites changed significantly in different ecosystem solutions. Conclusions Our findings attest that insect infestations induce distinct direct and indirect effects on plant-insect-microbiome interactions leading to marked alterations in C dynamics. This integrated approach improves our understanding on microbial dynamics and biogeochemistry and evaluates the role of insects for ecosystem processes.

AB  - Sea urchins are keystone herbivores in coral reefs that can prevent coral-algae phase shifts and promote coral resilience in the Caribbean. However, knowledge of sea urchin populations in the Indo- Pacific region is less extensive and their role in marine ecosystems remains uncertain. To fill this knowledge gap, this study examined the spatial distribution and species-habitat association of sea urchins in Peninsular Malaysia as a first step in exploring their potential for promoting reef resilience. Firstly, geographical information on the population characteristics of sea urchins in Peninsular Malaysia (Sunda Shelf and Malacca Strait Marine Ecoregions) was gathered. Using literature, questionnaire, and field surveys, ten species of sea urchins from six families were identified in the species record for Peninsular Malaysia. Prionocidaris bispinosa represents the first record for Malaysia, documented in the intertidal seagrass meadow at Tanjung Kupang, Johor. Combining density data from literature and field surveys, sea urchin density for Peninsular Malaysia was estimated to be 46.94 +/- 66 individuals/100 m2. Secondly, the species-habitat association of Diadema setosum and Echinothrix calamaris were determined in belt-transect surveys (n=57), with transects laid parallel to shore at Pulau Rawa, Johor. Multivariate regression analysis identified D. setosum to be more associated with live coral cover and coral growth form, while E. calamaris distribution was driven by habitat rugosity, water depth and live coral cover. These findings suggest contrasting species-habitat associations for the two co-existing species. Given the limited information about sea urchins in Malaysia, this study appears to be the first in-depth study of its kind in the country, deepening our knowledge of sea urchin distribution and the importance of habitat in shaping that distribution. This baseline data serves as valuable information in the planning and management of natural habitats for biodiversity and conservation in Malaysia's marine ecosystem.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Development from abandoned land to farmland after vegetation reestablishment for reclamation is an important salinization rehabilitation process in dryland ecosystems. While subsequent soil abiotic changes have been reported, few studies have focused on how reclamation affects the soil biota. Understanding the response of soil biota to reclamation is useful for evaluating the effect of agricultural management. We investigated soil physiochemical properties, the composition and structure of nematode communities, and nematode metabolic footprints in control and reclaimed farmland. The results showed that soil properties were significantly altered by reclamation. In particular, reclamation significantly increased pH, organic carbon, total nitrogen, and microbial biomass carbon. Conversely, electrical conductivity was significantly decreased. Shannon and Simpson indices were affected by reclamation. Reclamation significantly increased the Shannon index in the 10-20 cm soil layer. Reclamation significantly increased the Simpson index in the 0-10 cm soil layer, while the opposite was observed in the 10-20 cm soil layer. High basal index and fungal-based channel were found in the control. Total nematode abundance increased due to reclamation, which included fungivores, herbivores, and omnivores-predators. More nematodes could store more biomass carbon in the reclaimed farmland. Reclamation had an effect on the structure and function of soil food web, and increased the metabolic footprints of various trophic groups of nematodes. Nematode faunal analysis revealed that exogenous substances input led to the high level of communities structure, and the soil food web matured in the reclaimed farmland. The nematode communities were affected by reclamation. Furthermore, pH, EC, SOC, TN, and MBC were key driving factors affecting the nematode communities. Therefore, reclamation could effectively enhance the structure and function of soil food web through bottom-up effects in the cotton fields in Xinjiang, China.

AB  - In temperate and northern ecosystems where there are pronounced seasonal patterns in weather and available energy, there are corresponding patterns of body condition among white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). Body condition of white-tailed deer can affect survival and reproduction, which has large repercussions for state-level natural resource agencies that allocate hunting permits. In this study, we investigated how variation in winter weather, spring phenology, habitat composition, and browse quantity affected white-tailed deer body condition across a large spatial scale. Several body condition indicators (e.g., carcass mass, heart fat, antler size) were measured by hunters for 795 deer during September-December 2016-2018 in Wisconsin, USA. Winter severity in the previous year was an unreliable predictor of fall body condition of deer when winters were considered mild or moderate. The timing of spring green-up had a consistent effect on the body condition of all age and sex classes of deer. Earlier spring green-up resulted in heavier fawns and larger antlers among adult males. Region and spring green-up interacted to affect the heart fat of adult females. Earlier springs resulted in adult females in northern and central Wisconsin having a higher probability of heavy heart fat, whereas spring green-up had no effect on adult female heart fat in southern Wisconsin. Effects of habitat differed by age and sex class of deer, and by the body condition metric being evaluated, indicating that there are important physiological differences among age and sex classes of deer that are affected by the environment. Our study demonstrates that the hunting public can contribute large-scale, cost-effective, and quality data to deer monitoring and research projects. It is important that natural resource agencies be able to identify and recruit highly engaged members of the hunting public to ensure project success. The timing of spring green-up can have lasting effects on deer health that can be consistently observed the following fall, which is in contrast to the effects of winter severity that did not appear to persist when previous winters were mild or moderate. We encourage managers in northern or temperate regions to consider measures of spring green-up timing in conjunction with traditional winter severity when making deer population management decisions, such as antlerless tag allocation.

AB  - While green turtles (Chelonia mydas) were once abundant throughout the Caribbean, over exploitation has dramatically reduced their numbers. We conducted a 168-day simulated grazing experiment to determine how loss of this once-abundant mega-herbivore could have affected the productivity and community composition of Thalassia testudinum-dominated seagrass beds in Bocas del Toro, Panama. Simulated grazing reduced both percent cover and productivity of T. testudinum. High runoff and local pollution from industrial farming may limit light availability and reduce seagrass photosynthetic performance to replace biomass lost to simulated grazing. Other seagrass species and algae failed to colonize space opened by reductions in T. testudinum percent cover. Many plots subjected to simulated grazing were also bioturbated by stingrays. Relevance of these findings to balancing sea turtle and seagrass conservation efforts are discussed.

AB  - Plant phenotypic and reproductive plasticity is strongly influenced by long-term grazing activities. It is important to understand the life history of dominant plant species, such as Kobresia humilis of alpine meadow, for the stability and sustainable grazing administration meadow on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). We compared the effects of different grazing treatments (grazing yak, Y; grazing Tibetan sheep, S; and grazing Tibetan sheep and yak, S+Y) on the reproductive and phenotypic plasticity of K. humilis in an alpine meadows on the northeastern margin of the Qilian Mountains in China. The results showed that different grazing treatments had significantly effects on the K. humilis phenotype and reproductive plasticity. The Y treatment significantly reduced the plant height, crown width and K. humilis biomass, but increased the density, which was 1.27 and 1.53 times higher than that in the S+Y and S treatments, respectively. Further, the S+Y treatment significantly increased the crown width, biomass, and future life expectancy of K. humilis. Whereas the S treatment increased the height of K. humilis significantly, which was 1.57 and 1.10 times higher than that in the Y and S+Y treatments, respectively. Both Y and S treatments significantly increased the sexual reproduction efficacy of K. humilis but reduced the storage efficacy. The storage efficacy at S+Y treatment was highest among these treatments. Further, grazing treatments did not change the resource allocation strategy of K. humilis, while the sexual reproductive efficacy was significantly higher than the vegetative reproduction efficacy. The storage efficacy was significantly higher than the growth efficacy among the different grazing treatments. The increase of Cyperaceae indicates the degradation of Cyperaceae-Poaceae meadows. This study showed that grazing Tibetan sheep is a more sustainable grazing method in cold season pastures of alpine meadows on the QTP.

AB  - Context. Research on large, terrestrial mammals often requires physical captures to attach tags or collars, collect morphological data, and collect biological samples. Choice of capture method should minimise pain and distress to the animal, minimise risk to personnel, and consider whether the method can achieve study objectives without biasing results. Aims. We studied how capture via helicopter net-gunning affected survival, post-capture movement patterns, and space use of exotic nilgai (Boselaphus tragocamelus) in southern Texas, USA. Methods. We estimated daily survival rates for 101 collared nilgai over 28 days, following 125 captures. We calculated mean daily movement rates and net-squared displacement for 21 recaptured nilgai for 60 days, starting 30 days before capture. Key results. The survival probability of 125 nilgai individuals was 0.97 (95% CI = 0.92-0.99) over the 28 days following capture, with the lowest daily survival for the day after capture ((x) over bar = 0.99; 95% CI = 0.96-1.00). We observed an increase of-65% in the mean daily movement rate of 134 m/h on the first 2 days since capture, followed by a period of reduced movement out to the 5th day before returning to pre-capture levels. Analysis of net-squared displacement for 21 nilgai showed that 17 resumed pre-capture space-use patterns within a week, whereas four individuals did not return to the pre-capture range for >= 1 month. Conclusions. Capture-related mortality rates for nilgai using helicopter net-gunning in our study (3%) were similar or lower than those reported for similar species captured using the same method. While we were able to detect a period of elevated movement rates, followed by a recovery period of diminished movement as a result of capture, nilgai appeared to return to typical behaviour-6 days post-capture. Most nilgai in our study also resumed typical space-use patterns within a week of capture; however, our results suggest high individual variability in their response. Implications. We recommend using net-gunning from a helicopter as a method for capturing nilgai when conditions and where vegetation and topography allow. We suggest censoring data for a minimum of 7 days following capture for analyses related to survival and movement rates. For analyses relating to space use, we suggest inspecting net-squared displacement or some similar displacement analysis for each animal separately to account for individual variation in response and exclude data accordingly.

AB  - Human appropriation of net primary productivity (HANPP) integrates ecological and socioeconomic perspectives on land use by quantifying the amount of net primary production (NPP) appropriated by society through biomass harvest from the ecosystem. The main objective of this study was to determine the spatial patterns of HANPP related to lamb and wool production from sheep farms across the province of Santa Cruz. The HANPP was obtained by dividing the sum of the biomass used in livestock products (lamb and wool) by the NPP. In addition, we examined the spatial relationship between HANPP and potential plant biodiversity and net carbon balance at the farm level under livestock land use across our study region. At the regional level, livestock production accounted for an average of 11.35% of appropriated NPP, and HANPP ranged from 0.75 to 50%. The map of HANPP across Santa Cruz showed low values in the vegetation transition (ecotone) between Nothofagus antarctica forests and grasslands in the west, in the south, and in wetlands where the most productive rangelands dominate. High values were observed in the northwest and central areas of the province. There were differences in HANPP across vegetation types with mean values that varied from 3.93% in grasslands on the Humid Magellanic Steppe to 12.33% in the Central Plateau. Simple linear regression analysis for HANPP evaluated in Southern Patagonia showed a negative linear relationship (p < 0.05) with vascular plant biodiversity and net carbon balance at the farm level. The method used to map HANPP related to livestock provisioning ecosystem services (ES) in the present study (lamb and wool), may be integrated into decision support systems. In this context, low HANPP values (<9%) promote sustainability-oriented economies within the region. Furthermore, keeping plant biodiversity and net carbon balance at the farm level could bring Patagonian export commodities recognition in international markets.

AB  - Plant communities change during the process of converting bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon [L.] Pers.) pasture monocultures to diverse native grasslands. Our hypothesis was that suppression of bermudagrass and grazing of seeded post native grassland affected composition of arthropod communities in small plots. Our objectives were to use sweep nets and pitfall traps to collect insects and study their diversity and abundance as affected by four bermudagrass suppression methods and two post-management grazing regimes during 2 years following treatment applications at a Cross Timbers Ecoregion site in northcentral Texas. The first year after suppression of bermudagrass, plant diversity was greatest in plots treated with glyphosate, effectively removing exotic grass and allowing establishment of diverse native vegetation. This resulted in greater insect diversity but less abundance compared to treatments in which bermudagrass was not effectively removed. In plots where residual imazapyr prevented establishment of native seedlings, insect diversity and abundance were less. Short-duration, intensive grazing by cattle increased insect diversity 18% the first year. The second year after suppression of bermudagrass, treatments affected insect abundance only when grazing had not occurred. As in the first year, insects were more abundant in check plots dominated by bermudagrass; however, abundance in imazapyr-treated plots was comparable to glyphosate-treated plots because the residual effects of imazapyr were less after 20 months and weeds volunteered in those plots and attracted canopy-dwelling insects. Results support the use of glyphosate to remove bermudagrass if greater arthropod diversity is desired. Results also indicated that short-term grazing post-seeding promoted greater plant and subsequent insect diversity, but only during establishment of native grassland species.

AB  - Baird ' s tapir has been documented to cause little crop damage. However, the damage they do cause has led farmers to hunt them to prevent them from entering their fields. This study aims to identify damage caused by Baird ' s tapir in crops in rural communities surrounding the Calakmul Biosphere Reserve, as well to analyze variables influencing crop damage. Ecological and agricultural variables, as well as those related to crop protection measures, were examined. In order to measure the ecological variables, habitat and availability of wild fruit were characterized along transects. Agricultural variables and crop protection measures were measured through a questionnaire. In all study communities, tapirs were found to damage crops (an average of 14% of all crops among the 4 communities). The variables "number of farmers who cultivate beans" and "number of farmers applying other protective measures"were positively correlated with "percentage of crop damage". Generalized linear models showed that "number of farmers who cultivate beans" was the variable that best explained crop damage by the tapir. This study addresses the interaction between farmers and tapirs, providing information that could help explain crop damage caused by this mammal surrounding the Calakmul Biosphere Reserve.

AB  - Sichuan sika deer Cervus nippon sichuanicus is a threatened subspecies of sika deer. Winter is the critical season affecting the survival of Sichuan sika deer. To get strategic information about the relationship between Sichuan sika deer and the environment in the winter, we conducted our study on habitat use of Sichuan sika deer in the Tiebu Nature Reserve from January to February in 2019 and 2020. The results showed that Sichuan sika deer preferred shrub vegetation and southern slope. Compared to control plots, lower elevation, longer distance to forest edge, higher herb cover and concealing condition appeared in used plots. The results of the logistic regression models showed that herb cover and elevation were the key factors. It was indicated that diet, safety and temperature were the main factors affecting the habitat use of Sichuan sika deer in winter.

AB  - In any natural area, the seasonally changing needs and interactions of each individual species from the microbiota to plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates are largely unknown. Completing individual management plans and actions for every species is patently unachievable. Accepting this complexity and uncertainty, we submit that returning the formative interactions of water, fire, and predation/herbivory are the keys to sustaining habitats for all species, even those for which we have absolutely no data. We also contend that management of the interactions of natural processes that support an entire flora and fauna can be resolved with guidance from "tuning" plant species. Tuning plant species are those most affected when natural processes are altered. Analogous to tuning a violin for the best sound or an engine to run smoothly, tuning plant species guide the adjustment of processes. Tuning plants can teach us how the interactions of natural processes work in ecological systems and give direction for management practices.

AB  - Spatial heterogeneity is described as patchiness, with patches constituting local aggregations of low variability in one or more ecosystem properties. Rangelands are heterogeneous natural ecosystems in which spatial heterogeneity can be attributed to inherent variability due to soils, topography, and hydrology, or disturbances such as fire and grazing. But little research has directly compared the relative contributions of inherent heterogeneity and disturbance to spatial variability. Here, variance partitioning is used to parse the relative contributions of inherent heterogeneity described in soil maps, and disturbance-driven heterogeneity imposed by patch burns, in grazed mixed-grass prairie of the US Northern Great Plains. Results support the hypothesis that disturbance-driven heterogeneity overrides inherent heterogeneity. Specifically, on pastures without patch burns, aboveground plant biomass depended on inherent variability in soil and topographic position; on patch-burned pastures, aboveground plant biomass was driven by time-since-fire and plant successional stages. Variability in forage nutritive composition and the spatial distribution of grazers were also driven by patchiness when imposed by spatially-discrete fire, while the role of inherent heterogeneity was weak for both. These results provide evidence for a default, often weak bottom-up control of spatial heterogeneity in the absence of spatially-discrete disturbance that can be overridden by top-down disturbance effects.

AB  - Wild pigs (Sus scrofa) affect native flora and fauna in the areas they invade, including ground-nesting birds. While results from camera-based studies have suggested that wild pigs could spatiotemporally impact resource selection of wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo), there has yet to be published a foundational mechanism proposed to support such impact. Additionally, while the autumn and winter seasons serve as an important period for improving body condition for spring breeders like wild turkeys, there exists a knowledge gap in the literature with respect to potential impacts of wild pigs on wild turkeys during this non-breeding period. We proposed a novel methodology for exploring the spatiotemporal relationship between wild pigs and wild turkeys through the co-employment of a camera survey to estimate wild pig activity and GPS units to monitor wild turkey space use. Our study monitored 12 wild turkeys across a 9000-ha study area in east-central Alabama during the autumn and winter seasons. We hypothesized that wild turkeys would exhibit reduced use and altered movement rates in areas with greater wild pig activity. Our results suggested that wild turkeys displayed slower rates of movement and had lower predicted probabilities of daytime use and roost site selection in areas of greater wild pig activity. Our study was limited to one season, but paired with previous camera-based studies, we propose that wild pigs could serve as a perceived disturbance risk to wild turkeys, leading to avoidance of areas with greater wild pig activity. We also believe wild pigs could compete with wild turkeys for hard mast, which could explain the negative relationship between wild pig activity and predicted probabilities of daytime use among female wild turkeys in hardwood and riparian areas. Our study showcases the potential value in pairing multiple spatiotemporal data types (e.g., GPS-data and camera-based estimates) in future interspecific wildlife research.

AB  - Long-term strategies are needed for the ecological restoration of land invaded by perennial weed species comprising of two parts: (1) control of the invasive species and (2) restoration of native vegetation meeting agricultural/conservation objectives. We investigated this within a statistically-rigorous, 28-year experiment at a site where Pteridium aquilinum had invaded an acid-grass/heathland. Where P. aquilinum-control treatments were applied for 20 years (1993-2012) very good P. aquilinum control was achieved by cutting (once or twice yearly) or repeat applications of the herbicide asulam. Vegetation restoration treatments (+/- sheep-grazing, seed addition) were also included and an acid-grass/grass heath was stablished. All three P. aquilinum-control treatments were very effective. In 2013 all P. aquilinum-control treatments were stopped and P. aquilinum recovery was monitored along with changes in the understory flora. All P. aquilinum performance variables remained significantly lower than untreated controls but P. aquilinum recovery varied between P. aquilinum-control treatments; slowest in the asulam treatment, intermediate where cut twice yearly and fastest where cut once yearly. P. aquilinum recovery was also faster in ungrazed plots, especially when cut once yearly. The underlying plant community remained relatively stable albeit with a reduction in species diversity. These good results were obtained from a large number of interventions and it is recommended that an adaptive management approach be used with (1) the aim of reducing frond density to <= 2 fronds m-2, (2) continued monitoring, and (3) re-applying control treatments when frond density exceeds this value. We also found that sheep grazing at low densities slowed P. aquilinum recovery, especially in the spray and cut twice yearly treatments almost certainly by trampling. However it is suggested that this needs further investigation using a range of different species of greater body-weights and at increased densities.

AB  - Global change is manifesting new and potent pressures that may determine the relative influence of top-down and bottom-up forces on the productivity of plants that undergird coastal ecosystems. Here, I present a meta-analysis conducted to assess how herbivory, nitrogen enrichment, and elevated salinity influence plant productivity according to the salinity regimes of coastal ecosystems. An examination of 99 studies representing 288 effect sizes across 76 different plant species revealed that elevated salinity negatively affected productivity across all environments, but particularly in freshwater ecosystems. Nitrogen enrichment, on the other hand, positively affected productivity. In agreement with the plant stress hypothesis, herbivory had the greatest negative impact in saline habitats. This trend, however, appears to reverse with nitrogen enrichment, with maximum losses to herbivory occurring in brackish habitats. These findings demonstrate that multiple stressors can yield complex, and sometimes opposite outcomes to those arising from individual stressors. This study also suggests that trophic interactions will likely shift as coastal ecosystems continue to experience nutrient enrichment and sea level rise.

AB  - The Amazon rainforest is a critical ecosystem renowned for its biodiversity and substantial contributions to the global climate system. Among the various processes occurring within this environment, the emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) plays diverse roles, including functioning as plant defense mechanisms against herbivores and pathogens, facilitating ecological interactions, and providing potential applications for chemotaxonomy. This study examined the VOCs profiles of forest species in Central Amazonia to assess their chemotyping potential. Samples were collected from permanent plots at the Tropical Silviculture Experimental Station (Amazonas, Brazil), and a thermal desorption gas chromatography-mass spectrometry system was used to detect the compounds. A total of 28 volatile were identified, encompassing monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, aldehydes, alcohols, isoprenes, acids, and heterocyclic aromatics. The Burseraceae family presented the greatest diversity of compounds, with compounds such as alpha-pinene, beta-pinene, d-limonene, alpha-copaene, and alpha-bergamotene, whereas the Sapotaceae family displayed lower variability, represented primarily by benzaldehyde and hexanal. VOCs profiles demonstrate significant potential as an alternative tool in chemotaxonomy, contributing to a deeper understanding of the chemical diversity and ecological importance of Amazonian species. Future research will be conducted to better explore the ecological interactions of volatile compounds and their implications.

AB  - European bison are susceptible to a range of pathogens which may influence their health, and hence, to ensure their protection, it is essential to provide effective monitoring of potential exposure. This study presents the first molecular confirmation of Sarcocystis cruzi infection in European bison based on PCR amplification of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (cox1) gene. A sample of heart tissue taken from one fifteen-year-old European bison cow was examined by light microscopy for the presence of heart sarcocysts. The genomic DNA isolated from any identified sarcocysts was subjected to PCR to amplify cox1 gene sequences, and the obtained amplicons were sequenced by Sanger dideoxy sequencing. Two partial cox1 sequences were obtained; they were identified as S. cruzi and deposited in the GenBankTM database under the accession numbers MW490605 and MW490606. BLAST analysis found them to demonstrate the closest similarity to S. levinei (MH255771-MH255779 and KU247874-KU247884), sharing an identity of 93.14-93.8 %. This is the first report to identify sarcocysts isolated from heart tissue of infected European bison living in the Bialowieza forest to species level using cox1 analysis. Our findings confirm that the European bison is a natural intermediate host for S. cruzi. As such, coordinators of future conservation programmes should consider the impact of these diseases on reintroduced animals.

AB  - Studies of community assembly often explore the role of niche selection in limiting the diversity of functional traits (underdispersion) or increasing the diversity of functional traits (overdispersion) within local communities. While these patterns have primarily been explored with morphological functional traits related to environmental tolerances and resource acquisition, plant metabolomics may provide an additional functional dimension of community assembly to expand our understanding of how niche selection changes along environmental gradients. Here, we examine how the functional diversity of leaf secondary metabolites and traditional morphological plant traits changes along local environmental gradients in three temperate forest ecosystems across North America. Specifically, we asked whether co-occurring tree species exhibit local-scale over- or underdispersion of metabolomic and morphological traits, and whether differences in trait dispersion among local communities are associated with environmental gradients of soil resources and topography. Across tree species, we find that most metabolomic traits are not correlated with morphological traits, adding a unique dimension to functional trait space. Within forest plots, metabolomic traits tended to be overdispersed while morphological traits tended to be underdispersed. Additionally, local environmental gradients had site-specific effects on metabolomic and morphological trait dispersion patterns. Taken together, these results show that different suites of traits can result in contrasting patterns of functional diversity along environmental gradients and suggest that multiple community assembly mechanisms operate simultaneously to structure functional diversity in temperate forest ecosystems.

AB  - Sustainable forest management is proposed as a solution for many ecological and socio-economic trade-offs associated with different forest uses. In Patagonia, silvopastoral systems were proposed to balance provisioning ecosystem services and other natural values. However, the design of these practices needs a better understanding of livestock production. The objective of this study was to determine changes in the understory forage value and livestock occurrence in Nothofagus antarctica forests of Tierra del Fuego (Argentina) growing under a natural dynamic and in stands with impacts generated by harvesting, fires and silvopastoral uses. We sampled 145 areas determining forest structure, understory forage value (cover, biomass, forage quality) and livestock occurrence (wild and domestic stocking rate), including different forest conditions: (i) six phases of the natural forest cycle (even- and uneven-aged stands), (ii) four types of management and conversion alternatives (different thinning intensities, clear-cuts, and fires), and (iii) three associated environments (forest edges and grasslands). Main results showed that understory cover and biomass did not differ along the natural forest phases, but varied across management alternatives and associated environments. The magnitude of these changes was directly related to the impact degree. Forage quality did not change across the factors and levels. Livestock occurrence is related to the observed changes in the understory; however, a different behaviour was observed between wild and domestic herbivores. The different analyses highlighted the similarities in forage value and livestock occurrence among the different natural forest phases, and showed how the stands with different impacts differed from the control stands. The outputs could be used to improve forest management strategies in the framework of silvopastoral systems at landscape level.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Silvopastoral systems can modulate the thermoregulatory behavior of buffaloes decreasing the heat stress and improving the animal welfare in the tropics. The objective of this study was to compare the behavior of heifer buffaloes in a silvopastoral systems with Leucahena leucocephala trees and a conventional system without trees under two heat stress condition (intense heat stress and moderate heat stress) in Cuba. The results show that despite intense heat stress conditions, the animals spent more time feeding in the silvopastoral system than in the conventional system. Besides, the silvopastoral system reduced the use of water in the wallowing areas. We conclude that pastures with trees increase fodder offer while improve grazing behavior and animal welfare for buffalo farming in tropical conditions.
   In the wake of climate change and global warming, the production systems of water buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis) are receiving increasing attention in the tropics, where the silvopastoral systems can improve animal welfare and production conditions. The objective of this study was to characterize the behavior of heifer buffaloes in a silvopastoral system (SPS) with Leucaena leucocephala (600 trees/ha) and in a conventional system (CVS), under intense heat stress and moderate heat stress in Cuba. We observed nine animals, with an average weight of 167.9 kg at the beginning of the study, during the daylight period, from 6:00 to 18:00 h, at 10 min intervals, for 12 days. Activities recorded were grazing, ingestion of tree leaves, rumination, water intake, walking, lying, standing, sheltering in the shade of trees, and wallowing. Sheltering in the shade of trees and wallowing were collectively considered as thermoregulatory behavior (TB). TB was different in both systems and conditions of heat stress (p < 0.05), with 4.06 in CVS and 3.81 h in SPS in the intense heat stress period, while it was 2.91 and 1.08 h for SPS and CVS, respectively, during the moderate heat stress period. The wallowing activity showed statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) in the intense heat stress season with 1.18 and 2.35 h for SPS and CVS, respectively. Time spent on feeding behavior was highest in the SPS system (p < 0.05). Longer times of thermoregulatory and feeding behavior indicate the importance of trees in animal welfare for this species in tropical conditions, thus supporting avoided deforestation and the replanting of trees in existing production systems and landscapes.

AB  - Premise of research. Herbivore damage is generally higher in the sun than in the shade. The influence of shade tolerance on herbivory has been mainly related to the fact that light-demanding plant species show lower defense investments-and hence higher herbivory-than shade-tolerant species. The pattern of increased herbivory with increasing light availability may take different forms, depending on the drivers of herbivore damage across the light gradient: (1) herbivory pressure alone, (2) herbivory pressure together with plant resistance associated with shade tolerance, or (3) the two drivers seen in scenario 2 added to a differential effect of light availability on plant resistance depending on shade tolerance. Elucidating the specific patterns behind the general pattern of increased herbivory with increasing light availability may contribute to understanding and aid prediction of herbivory patterns in forest communities under natural or anthropogenic disturbance.Methodology. In a field study with 15 tree species distributed across the light gradient in a temperate rainforest (1.6%-26.2% canopy openness), we evaluated the relationship between canopy openness and seedling herbivory, with 755 seedlings surveyed for herbivore damage. Specifically, we evaluated the consistency between the observed herbivory-canopy openness relationship and the three scenarios described above.Pivotal results. We found steeper slopes for the herbivory-canopy openness relationship in tree species with lower shade tolerance; that is, we verified scenario 3.Conclusions. Shade tolerance determined the slope of the herbivory-canopy openness relationship across the light gradient. This finding expands our understanding of the recognized influence of shade tolerance on the interplay between herbivory and the light environment.

AB  - Protected areas face immense pressure for their resources and the space that they occupy. To protect them and their wildlife, management approaches such as ranger patrols and measures to counter wildlife trafficking across the broader landscape have been implemented, despite integration of both approaches remains limited. This study aimed to evaluate such implementation in one of Asia's most significant protected area landscapes. This was done by analysing 1) an adaptive ranger patrolling strategy to reduce tiger (Panthera tigris) and ungulate prey poaching rates; 2) a government-civil society partnership to reduce tiger trafficking in adjoining rural and urban areas; and 3) tiger and prey population trends in response to these interventions. From 2015 to 2019, five ranger teams conducted 457 anti-poaching foot patrols, covering 10,963 km and removing 780 snares commonly encountered in accessible lowland. Over the years, snare occupancy did not change but detection was found to increase. From 2010 to 2019, law enforcement responded to 26 tiger trafficking cases with earlier cases mainly prosecuted using administrative sanctions. After 2013, most received penal sanctions with significant increases in fines levied. Camera trapping from 2010 to 2020 revealed a likely stable tiger population with high turnover of individual tigers. Only one male captured on all three sampling occasions and one adult female captured on two occasions. From 2010 to 2020, three tiger prey species (muntjac (Muntiacus muntjak), serow (Capricornis sumatraensis), and pig-tailed macaque (Macaca nemestrina)) remained widespread during the study, whereas wild boar (Sus scrofa) and sambar deer (Rusa unicolor) remain localised. Despite effective snare removals and arrests, the threat of poaching persists, suggesting that patrolling in at-risk areas needs to be coupled with new, persuasive, and more targeted approaches, while ensuring sustainable funding for these interventions.

AB  - Bush encroachment is the invasion of whole landscapes by indigenous and alien woody species. An imbalance in the ratio of grasses to bushes is a consequence of bush encroachment due to competition for moisture, nutrients and sunlight. This imbalance results in a decrease in grass cover, plant biodiversity and grazing capacity, leading to severe economic losses. Several methods exist to reduce high woody plant densities, including mechanical, manual, biological or chemical control. In this study, we assessed the structural and compositional attributes of the grass layer and compared these to the woody vegetation structure for herbicide-controlled rangelands and the no chemical control. The main objective was to evaluate the potential of chemical control to restore an open savanna system dominated by perennial grasses. Woody-dominated vegetation resulting from long-term overgrazing was assessed and compared to chemically controlled sites. Results revealed that chemical control treatment increased forage production and maintained woody-patch conservation. After the treatment, the sites were characterised by more productive and desirable woody species. The re-encroachment of woody species at all bush-controlled sites is possible. A follow-up control programme to manage and mitigate encroachment needs to be implemented when mitigating bush encroachment.

AB  - Chinese indicine cattle harbor a much higher genetic diversity compared with other domestic cattle, but their genome architecture remains uninvestigated. Using PacBio HiFi sequencing data from 10 Chinese indicine cattle across southern China, we assembled 20 high-quality partially phased genomes and integrated them into a multiassembly graph containing 148.5 Mb (5.6%) of novel sequence. We identified 156,009 high-confidence nonredundant structural variants (SVs) and 206 SV hotspots spanning similar to 195 Mb of gene-rich sequence. We detected 34,249 archaic introgressed fragments in Chinese indicine cattle covering 1.93 Gb (73.3%) of the genome. We inferred an average of 3.8%, 3.2%, 1.4%, and 0.5% of introgressed sequence originating, respectively, from banteng-like, kouprey-like, gayal-like, and gaur-like Bos species, as well as 0.6% of unknown origin. Introgression from multiple donors might have contributed to the genetic diversity of Chinese indicine cattle. Altogether, this study highlights the contribution of interspecies introgression to the genomic architecture of an important livestock population and shows how exotic genomic elements can contribute to the genetic variation available for selection.

AB  - The Banni area in Kutch region of western India is a typical salt desert area. The usual methods of farming and husbandry are not successful here. The local farming community has developed a unique system of raising buffalo for Banni breed animals that is cost effective which is low cost, climate -smart and sustainable. The livestock production system has evolved over generations and incorporates scientific considerations. The behavior of 55 Banni buffaloes was observed with a thermal imaging device and interpreted based on farmers' experiences. The nighttime behavior of these buffalo is unique. The animals were trained to follow the "leader-follower" hierarchy when moving around the pasture. The night grazing movements of the herd are controlled by the "leader buffaloes" without herders. The animals walk back and forth during the night along a known path. Concentrate feed mixed with jaggery, water and motherly instinct seem to be the main motivators for the buffalo to return from grazing - a type of Pavlovian conditioning behavior. The present study provides an alternative approach for developing simple, cost effective, welfare-oriented strategies for management using the behavioral aspects of animals.

AB  - Drone use has significantly grown in recent years, and there is a knowledge gap on how the noise produced by these systems may affect animals. We investigated how 18 species of megafauna reacted to drone sound pressure levels at different frequencies. The sound pressure level on the low frequency generated by the drone did not change the studied species' behavior, except for the Asian elephant. All other studied species showed higher noise sensitivity at medium and high frequencies. The Asian elephant was the most sensitive species to drone noise, mainly at low frequencies. Felines supported the highest sound pressure level before showing behavioral reactions. Our results suggest that drone sound pressure levels in different frequencies cause behavioral changes that differ among species, which is relevant to assessing drone disturbances in ex situ environments. The findings presented here can help to reduce drone impact for target species and serve as an experimental study for future drone use guidelines.

AB  - The capture of neonate ungulates allows for the collection of valuable ecological data, including estimates of litter size. However, varied methods used to capture neonate ungulates can result in sampling biases. Our objective was to determine if opportunistic captures of neonate ungulates (i.e., locating neonates by visually scanning for adult females displaying postpartum behaviors) bias relative estimates of litter size and investigate potential causes if a bias does exist. We analyzed data from 161 litters of mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) sampled using three different capture methods during 2019-2021 in Utah, USA. Estimates of litter size derived from opportunistic captures were smaller than estimates derived from movement-based captures or captures completed with the aid of vaginal implant transmitters (VITs). Age at capture was inversely related to estimates of litter size and likely influenced the detection bias associated with opportunistic captures. Neonates captured opportunistically were not older than neonates captured using movement-based methods, but were older than neonates captured with the aid of VITs. Distance between neonates from the same litter did not influence estimates of litter size. Researchers should be aware of the biases associated with different capture methods and use caution when interpreting data among multiple capture methods. Estimates of litter size derived from opportunistic captures should not be compared to estimates of litter size derived from alternative capture methods without accounting for the detection bias we observed.

AB  - Impalas are unusual among bovids because they have remained morphologically similar over millions of years-a phenomenon referred to as evolutionary stasis. Here, we sequenced 119 whole genomes from the two extant subspecies of impala, the common (Aepyceros melampus melampus) and black-faced (A. m. petersi) impala. We investigated the evolutionary forces working within the species to explore how they might be associated with its evolutionary stasis as a taxon. Despite being one of the most abundant bovid species, we found low genetic diversity overall, and a phylogeographic signal of spatial expansion from southern to eastern Africa. Contrary to expectations under a scenario of evolutionary stasis, we found pronounced genetic structure between and within the two subspecies with indications of ancient, but not recent, gene flow. Black-faced impala and eastern African common impala populations had more runs of homozygosity than common impala in southern Africa, and, using a proxy for genetic load, we found that natural selection is working less efficiently in these populations compared to the southern African populations. Together with the fossil record, our results are consistent with a fixed-optimum model of evolutionary stasis, in which impalas in the southern African core of the range are able to stay near their evolutionary fitness optimum as a generalist ecotone species, whereas eastern African impalas may struggle to do so due to the effects of genetic drift and reduced adaptation to the local habitat, leading to recurrent local extinction in eastern Africa and re-colonisation from the South.

AB  - AimsPlant community dynamics are influenced by interspecific interactions. Previous studies have shown that soil organisms play a key role in such interactions, but few studies have quantified soil fauna contributions.MethodsWe investigated the effects of root lesion (RLN) and bacterial feeding (BFN) nematodes on the interaction between seedlings of nitrogen-(N)-fixing tree species of Acacia and non-fixing Banksia from early and late successional stages of a temperate forest in a pot experiment.ResultsNematodes had consistent, albeit minor, negative effects on both N-fixers and non-fixers in the early successional stage scenario. By contrast, BFNs increased biomass production of both species in late-stage monocultures and in Banksia in mixed cultures. Moreover, RLNs negatively affected late-stage Banksia in monocultures but promoted its biomass production when grown with Acacia. Reduced 15N concentration in Banksia indicates that the switch was driven by transfer of N from Acacia facilitated by RLN.ConclusionsSoil nematodes thus moderate interspecific interactions differently in early and late successional stages.

AB  - The Mongolian gazelle Procapra gutturosa is a wild ungulate ubiquitous across the largest remaining temperate grasslands of Mongolia, Russia and China. The species is nomadic and ranges over long distances, resulting in widely fluctuating abundance in any given location. Therefore, a comprehensive and range-wide survey is required to accurately estimate its global population size, but challenges are posed by the expansive geographical distribution and the political boundaries across the species' vast range. To obtain an estimate of the total population, we compiled data from recent range-wide surveys. During 2019-2020, we estimated the population size in Mongolia by conducting line transect distance surveys and total counts, and by deriving numerical predictions for unsurveyed areas through data analysis. The gazelle's population in Russia was surveyed in 2020 across its summer range using simultaneous counts, transect surveys and expert knowledge. The distance sampling surveys in Mongolia revealed that slightly more than half of the gazelles along the transects were detected. Our assessment of the gazelle population, although probably an underestimate, suggests there are c. 2.14 million individuals in Mongolia and c. 30,000 in Russia. These results confirm that the Mongolian gazelle is the most abundant nomadic ungulate in the open plains across its range. However, to obtain more accurate estimates across all range states and effectively monitor the gazelle's population status, it is essential to implement standardized survey protocols that correct for imperfect detection. At present, the management of the Mongolian gazelle is inadequate, as there is a lack of regular monitoring to identify any adverse population changes that could necessitate conservation interventions.

AB  - Simple Summary The population of Przewalski's gazelle (Procapra przewalskii) has increased over the past decades, but it is still threatened by a variety of environmental factors and human disturbance. Most of the suitable habitats for Przewalski's gazelle are limited to the vicinity of Qinghai Lake. Moreover, most of the suitable habitat for Przewalski's gazelle is not included in the scope of the reserve. Thus, conservation translocation may be an effective way of protecting Przewalski's gazelle.Abstract Although the population of Przewalski's gazelle (Procapra przewalskii) has increased, this species is still threatened by a variety of risk factors, such as habitat loss and fragmentation, grassland fencing, grazing conflict, the segmentation of different populations, and declines in population genetic diversity. In order to determine the potential suitable habitat of Przewalski's gazelle and find a new suitable location for its conservation translocation, we used the MaxEnt model to predict the suitable habitats in Qinghai Province, Gansu Province, and the Ordos Plateau in Inner Mongolia and other regions with historical distribution records. On the basis of the MaxEnt model's prediction of the potential suitable habitat of Przewalski's gazelle, we used GAP analysis to determine the existing protection gaps and provide a new reference for the future protection of Przewalski's gazelle. We found that altitude, temperature, vegetation type, and distance from roads were the main environmental factors affecting the geographical distribution of Przewalski's gazelle. Most of the suitable habitat of Przewalski's gazelle is confined around Qinghai Lake. GAP analysis revealed that most of the suitable habitats of Przewalski's gazelle are not included in the established reserves, and Qinghai Lake National Nature Reserve only covers a small area around Qinghai Lake. The whole reserve only accounts for 7.11% of the area of the suitable habitat for Przewalski's gazelle and 15.79% of the area of the highly suitable habitat for Przewalski's gazelle. We suggest that conservation translocation for Przewalski's gazelle should be put on the agenda. It is necessary to consider reintroducing these gazelles into their potential suitable habitats as a feasible way of establishing new populations and saving this species.

AB  - In this global extinction crisis, we must act urgently to prevent the loss of species. The public plays a key role in ensuring the future of our biodiversity, by impacting funding decisions, creating behaviour change, and pushing change in corporations to prevent species loss. The Threatened Species Bake Off competition is a social media initiative created by the Australian Government in 2017 to raise awareness of nationally listed threatened species. In this study, we assessed the trends of the competition by collating entries via Instagram and Twitter in its first 5 years. Representations of 356 unique species were baked, 261 of which were listed as nationally threatened species. Birds and mammals were the most popular groups represented. Frogs, reptiles, fishes, and invertebrates were reasonably well represented; however, plants were drastically underrepresented in the competition. This is evidence of taxonomic bias towards the charismatic animals, and a problematic lack of representation of other threatened species that play essential roles in our ecosystems. Although the Bake Off is an innovative conservation messaging approach, it reinforces awareness of the same groups that traditional messaging techniques encouraged (i.e., charismatic megafauna). Public engagement in this competition reflects current conservation messaging, including media and education focus on charismatic animals, demonstrating engrained biases. Future competitions should address this by highlighting less popular but equally important threatened species, especially plants.

AB  - In the long-term absence of disturbance, ecosystems often enter a decline or retrogressive phase which leads to reductions in primary productivity, plant biomass, nutrient cycling and foliar quality. However, the consequences of ecosystem retrogression for higher trophic levels such as herbivores and predators, are less clear. Using a post-fire forested island-chronosequence across which retrogression occurs, we provide evidence that nutrient availability strongly controls invertebrate herbivore biomass when predators are few, but that there is a switch from bottom-up to top-down control when predators are common. This trophic flip in herbivore control probably arises because invertebrate predators respond to alternative energy channels from the adjacent aquatic matrix, which were independent of terrestrial plant biomass. Our results suggest that effects of nutrient limitation resulting from ecosystem retrogression on trophic cascades are modified by nutrient-independent variation in predator abundance, and this calls for a more holistic approach to trophic ecology to better understand herbivore effects on plant communities.

AB  - Large carnivore restoration programs are often promoted as capable of providing ecosystem services. However, these programs rarely measure effects of successful restoration on other economically and ecologically important species. In South Florida, while the endangered Florida panther Puma concolor coryi population has increased in recent years due to conservation efforts, the population of its main prey, the white-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus, has declined in some regions. The extent to which panther predation has affected deer populations has been difficult to assess because several other factors have changed during this period, including hydrology and hunting regulations. We collected known-fate survival data on 241 GPS-collared adult deer (156 females and 85 males) from 2015 to 2018 in the Florida Panther National Wildlife Refuge and the Big Cypress National Preserve in Florida, USA, to assess effects of panther predation on the deer population, while also evaluating the impacts of hunting and hydrology. Predation was the primary cause of death (110 of 134 mortalities), and 87% of predation events were attributed to panthers, a much greater rate than reported by studies conducted before the panther genetic restoration effort initiated in 1995. One deer was legally harvested, and two were likely killed by poachers. Increasing water depth decreased female survival but had little impact on male survival, and drowning was never a cause of mortality. Females had greater survival probability than males, except during fawning season. From 2015 to 2018, annual survival rates increased from 0.61 (0.52-0.70) to 0.86 (0.79-0.91) for females, and from 0.45 (95% CI: 0.33-0.58) to 0.79 (0.69-0.86) for males. Synthesis and applications. High predation rates, coupled with previous evidence of low recruitment of deer in South Florida, suggest that it will be challenging to meet society's competing demands for large predator restoration and sustainable deer harvest. Deer hunting in the area must remain tightly controlled, for now, if it is to be sustainable, and managers should seek to mitigate effects of high waters and improve deer habitat quality to increase deer population viability. Future work should closely monitor the deer population to assess if management actions can increase vital rates and abundance in the context of high predation rates.

AB  - Interspecific competition has strong effects within carnivore guilds, and African wild dogs are strongly limited by intraguild predation by lions and food loss to spotted hyenas. The densities of these dominant competitors correlate tightly with prey density, and prey depletion due to snaring is contributing to declines of apex carnivores across Africa. As a consequence of snaring, subordinate competitors like the African wild dog and cheetah are simultaneously experiencing a costly reduction in prey and a beneficial reduction of competitors. The net effect is difficult to predict. Here, we describe a previously unrecognized tipping point in the effect of prey density on wild dog density. Above this tipping point, wild dog density increases as prey density decreases, because the benefits of competitive release outweigh the costs of prey depletion. Below this tipping point, wild dog density decreases as prey density decreases, because the costs of prey depletion outweigh the benefits of competitive release. Conservation strategies for wild dogs must recognize this tipping point. As prey depletion due to snaring becomes severe, it limits wild dogs (mesocarnivores), just as it does lions and spotted hyenas (apex carnivores). Recent analyses based on time trends have argued that climate change is likely to cause wild dog populations to collapse. We suggest that prey depletion provides a mechanistically direct explanation of patterns in wild dog dynamics that have been attributed to climate change, and that the effects of prey depletion are likely to go unrecognized in the absence of data on trends in prey density.

AB  - In an era of global change, historical natural history data can improve our understanding of ecological phenomena, particularly when evaluated with contemporary Indigenous and place-based knowledge. The Yala lambda i (Goose Island) Archipelago is a group of islands in Heiltsuk (Hailaqv) territory on the Central Coast of British Columbia, Canada. Not only has this region been important to the Heiltsuk for millennia but also it is both a federally and internationally recognized important bird area. In this study, we compare data collected by Charles J. Guiguet, a biologist who documented bird communities at Yala lambda i in the summer of 1948, to three different contemporary surveys and to citizen-science data. We find that the relative abundances of forest bird species (i.e., birds that use the terrestrial island ecosystems) in 1948 differed to those observed in systematic surveys in 2011. While Orange-crowned Warblers, Dark-eyed Juncos, and Red Crossbills comprised 55% of detections by Guiguet in 1948, the three most abundant species in 2011 were Bald Eagles, Varied Thrushes, and Pacific Wrens, and these accounted for only 25% of detections. Although we could not make a quantitative comparison, we provide summaries of each species observed in surveys or reported on eBird. We also incorporate Heiltsuk place-based knowledge to enrich our discussion of the variability in bird communities over time, from how changes in mammal communities and human use may have shaped vegetation dynamics to how large-scale natural phenomena impacted topography. To understand which birds are present and how their communities are changing over time, we recommend continued monitoring of the bird communities at Yala lambda i.

AB  - To design a good conservation strategy for herbivorous Anseriformes wintering in Poyang Lake, knowledge of habitat suitability is essential. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the habitat suitability of herbivorous Anseriformes of China's Poyang Lake. Landsat images with a resolution of 30 m downloaded from the United States Geological Survey, and other ancillary data were used. The ENVI 5.3 software and ArcGIS 10.2 software were used for preprocessing, classifying the satellite image, and mapping habitat suitability. The study reveals that land cover types were divided into vegetation, mudflats, water, and sand. Similarly, the study area's habitats were also divided into unsuitable, fair, good, and best grades. However, the distribution of the habitat suitability for each grade reveals significant spatial variations. For instance, vegetation indicated the areas with the best habitat grade, followed by mudflats, and these areas cover (47.93%, 2015 and 55.78%, 2019) the majority of the study area. The unsuitable grades cover the smallest areas (0.48%) of the lake. Similarly, this study results showed a slight change in habitat suitability areas. Therefore, this study highlighted that Poyang Lake has valuable importance for the conservation of herbivorous Anseriformes. Extending the years of study and including some ecological variables from different stopovers could improve the results.

AB  - The Chinkara gazelle (Gazella bennettii), an endangered species, faces a serious threat from anthropogenic activities and climate change. In Balochistan, climate change and drought have created extremely challenging circumstances for its survival. The population status of many species cannot be determined due to a lack of data. If the current situation persists, there is a high risk of extinction for this species in its natural habitat. The purpose of this study was to examine the population dynamics and distribution patterns of Chinkara gazelle in the Khuzdar and Lasbela districts of Balochistan, Pakistan. The study covered an area of approximately 45,123.97 km2 and involved a double-observer survey at six sites from 2019 to 2022, using the BBRecapture package in the R programming language. The study detected a decreasing population trend in the Chinkara population over a four-year period. A population of 700, 683, 613 and 583 individuals were observed in 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively. Rocky shrub land consistently recorded the highest number of chinkara sightings among various habitats. This study provides valuable information about the Chinkara gazelle significantly to our understanding of the species and will be used to develop local-level conservation initiatives.

AB  - Mexican gray wolf (Canis lupus baileyi) reintroduction began in 1998 in Arizona, USA, with 11 individuals initially; wolves from this population dispersed into New Mexico, USA, the following year. Numbers of wolves have steadily increased (& GE;241 individuals in Dec 2022) and the size of the recovery area has expanded in both states. Understanding kill rates is fundamental to the recovery and management of Mexican wolves to properly maintain a healthy and sustainable population of wolves and their prey species. We used global positioning system (GPS) cluster analysis to locate kill sites and estimate kill rates on native ungulate prey taken in the recovery area by 10 Mexican wolf groups during winter (15 Feb-15 Mar) and 8 wolf groups during summer (15 Jun-15 Jul) in 2015-2017. Elk (Cervus canadensis) composed 94% of the native ungulates documented at Mexican wolf kill sites (n = 139); the remaining 6% were mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus; n = 9). Two-thirds of all wolf-killed native ungulates were elk calves. We estimated kill rates as ungulate biomass killed/wolf/day. From combined results for all years, we estimated that each Mexican wolf killed on average 9.0 & PLUSMN; 5.4 kg (& PLUSMN;95% CI) of ungulate biomass per day during winter and 7.8 & PLUSMN; 6.2 kg during the summer. Our estimates of kill rates could be overestimated if Mexican wolves obtained a substantial amount of their biomass from scavenging, particularly during 4 months of hunting seasons (Sep-Dec) not captured in winter and summer. Using data from the first 2 years of the study (2015, 2016), we developed a logistic regression model to predict probability of an elk kill occurring at a GPS cluster as a function of hours spent by a collared wolf at that GPS cluster and size of the wolf group. Applying this model to the final year of the study (2017) resulted in similar numbers of predicted (n = 16.1 and 27.2 in winter and summer, respectively) and observed numbers (n = 15 and 26) of elk kills. Additionally, the demographic composition of the 2017 elk kills closely matched that of the previous 2 years. The results of this study indicate similar predation patterns of Mexican wolves to those of wolves in northern locations and can help wildlife managers plan for potential effects from a larger population of wolves across a broad area in Arizona and New Mexico.

AB  - Background and Research Aim African forest elephants (Loxodonta cyclotis) are critically endangered yet research on factors influencing their resource use is limited in Central Africa. We assessed the influence of fruit availability, land use types, and anthropogenic activity on forest elephant presence and relative abundance in the southwest part of the Campo-Ma'an Technical Operational Unit (CMTOU) to better understand elephant habitat use in human dominated systems and inform elephant management strategies. Methods We used 17 camera trap stations and surveyed 17 line transects to monitor forest elephant presence and relative abundance as a function of fruit availability, tree species richness, and land use types. Our study area spanned a gradient of human disturbance and included a National Park (NP), Forest Management Unit (FMU), and Community Land (CL). Results Forest elephants were more likely to occur in areas with increased fruit availability and tree species richness. Also, the likelihood of their presence was higher in CL than in FMU and NP. Elephant relative abundance was negatively affected by human activities such as hunting and logging. The relationship between elephant relative abundance and fruit availability was stronger in CL and NP as compared to the FMU. Elephant relative abundance was higher during the rainy season. Conclusion Forest elephant habitat use was positively affected by fruit availability across land use types, and negatively affected by human activities in the southwest part of the CMTOU. Implications for Conservation Continued monitoring of elephant responses to food availability in CMTOU is warranted to track changes in elephant habitat use. Knowledge of the distribution of fruiting trees consumed by forest elephants may allow managers to predict hotspots of habitat use, and to therefore develop effective management strategies.

AB  - Insect herbivory can be an important selective pressure and contribute substantially to local plant richness. As herbivory is the result of numerous ecological and evolutionary processes, such as complex insect population dynamics and evolution of plant antiherbivore defenses, it has been difficult to predict variation in herbivory across meaningful spatial scales. In the present work, we characterize patterns of herbivory on plants in a species-rich and abundant tropical genus (Piper) across forests spanning 44 degrees of latitude in the Neotropics. We modeled the effects of geography, climate, resource availability, and Piper species richness on the median, dispersion, and skew of generalist and specialist herbivory. By examining these multiple components of the distribution of herbivory, we were able to determine factors that increase biologically meaningful herbivory at the upper ends of the distribution (indicated by skew and dispersion). We observed a roughly twofold increase in median herbivory in humid relative to seasonal forests, which aligns with the hypothesis that precipitation seasonality plays a critical role in shaping interaction diversity within tropical ecosystems. Site level variables such as latitude, seasonality, and maximum Piper richness explained the positive skew in herbivory at the local scale (plot level) better for assemblages of Piper congeners than for a single species. Predictors that varied between local communities, such as resource availability and diversity, best explained the distribution of herbivory within sites, dampening broad patterns across latitude and climate and demonstrating why generalizations about gradients in herbivory have been elusive. The estimated population means, dispersion, and skew of herbivory responded differently to abiotic and biotic factors, illustrating the need for careful studies to explore distributions of herbivory and their effects on forest diversity.

AB  - Tropical savannas are characterized by high primary productivity and high fire frequency, such that much of the carbon captured by vegetation is rapidly returned to the atmosphere. Hence, there have been suggestions that management-driven reductions in savanna fire frequency and/or severity could significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and sequester carbon in tree biomass. However, a key knowledge gap is the extent to which savanna tree biomass will respond to modest shifts in fire regimes due to plausible, large-scale management interventions. Here, we: (1) characterize relationships between the frequency and severity of fires and key demographic rates of savanna trees, based on long-term observations in vegetation monitoring plots across northern Australia; (2) use these relationships to develop a process-explicit demographic model describing the effects of fire on savanna tree populations; and (3) use the demographic model to address the question: to what extent is it feasible, through the strategic application of prescribed burning, to increase tree biomass in Australian tropical savannas? Our long-term tree monitoring dataset included observations of 12,344 tagged trees in 236 plots, monitored for between 3 and 24 years. Analysis of this dataset showed that frequent high-severity fires significantly reduced savanna tree recruitment, survival, and growth. Our demographic model suggested that: (1) despite the negative effects of frequent high-severity fires on demographic rates, savanna tree biomass appears to be suppressed by only a relatively small amount by contemporary fire regimes, characterized by a mix of low- to high-severity fires; and (2) plausible, management-driven reductions in the frequency of high-severity fires are likely to lead to increases in tree biomass of about 11.0 t DM ha(-1) (95% CI: -1.2-20.8) over a century. Accounting for this increase in carbon storage could generate significant carbon credits, worth, on average, three times those generated annually by current greenhouse gas (methane and nitrous oxide) abatement projects, and has the potential to significantly increase the economic viability of fire/carbon projects, thereby promoting ecologically sustainable management of tropical savannas in Australia and elsewhere. This growing industry has the potential to bring much-needed economic activity to savanna landscapes, without compromising important natural and cultural values.

AB  - Common Carp Cyprinus carpio and Bigmouth Buffalo Ictiobus cyprinellus are widespread across the Midwest, where they can achieve high population densities in shallow lakes. Despite their contrasting statuses as invasive and native fishes, these species are commonly managed together due to their capacity to have deleterious effects on water quality. However, intra-annual sampling variability is poorly understood for both species, making it difficult to track population changes. We compared boat electrofishing CPUE and proportional size distribution (PSD) of Common Carp and Bigmouth Buffalo during May-October 2018-2020 in seven shallow northwestern Iowa lakes. We also estimated sampling effort necessary to reach targets of fish captured (100) and precision (relative standard error < 25%) and to detect 25% and 50% differences in CPUE between samples. Common Carp CPUE peaked in June (29 fish/h), declined across the summer, and was lowest in October (9 fish/h). Bigmouth Buffalo CPUE exhibited bimodal peaks in May (16 fish/h) and October (12 fish/h), with low catches during August (2 fish/h). Common Carp size structure was largest during October (PSD of preferred-size fish [PSD-P] = 92) and smallest in July (PSD-P = 58). Bigmouth Buffalo size structure was smaller in June (PSD-P = 20) than in all other months (PSD-P = 34). Our targets for number of fish captured and precision were typically reached within twenty-five 15-min electrofishing transects for Common Carp during periods of high catch rates but were not reached after 100 transects for Bigmouth Buffalo in most cases. Our results suggest that timing of sampling is important for reliably and efficiently assessing Common Carp and Bigmouth Buffalo populations. We recommend the sampling of Common Carp with electrofishing during June and the sampling of Bigmouth Buffalo during May in Midwestern shallow lakes to maximize catch rates while minimizing the influence of seasonal sampling variability.

AB  - Optimizing protocols to assess and monitor mammal communities is essential to meet the current biodiversity targets of halting species loss. Camera-traps are the most effective tool for multispecies monitoring, yet their deployment strategy is debated, with two main strategies adopted: trail- and random-based camera deployment. To date, few studies have compared these two strategies and reached contrasting recommendations. Here, by simultaneously deploying 60 camera-traps for each placement strategy in a National Park in central Italy, we aimed to assess differences in species richness and composition, photographic rate, detection/occupancy probabilities, also in responses to environmental and anthropogenic variables, and temporal activity. Site species richness was greater on than off-trails, with elusive carnivores mainly detected on trails. Community composition was different, with a smaller proportion of ungulates on trails, and lower detections of carnivores off-trails. Photographic rate, detection, and occupancy probabilities were higher on trails for almost all mammals. Occupancy responses to environmental variables did not match, possibly due to the different behavioral strategy adopted by mammals (trails for movement, off-trails for resting and foraging). Thus, a mixed approach with cameras located both on- and off-trails is recommended when studying habitat use. We also found a consistent negative response of occupancy and site-use intensity to human frequentation, with mammals avoiding both highly frequented trails and adjacent random sites. Temporal activity curves were similar between designs, suggesting that the choice of the sampling strategy would not bias the inference. However, nocturnal behavior was higher on trails for some species, indicating varying degrees of temporal avoidance of humans. With faster data accumulation, easier accessibility of sampling sites, and the ability to record human activity, on-trail cameras are more efficient than off-trail cameras for monitoring mammal communities.

AB  - ContextNatural selection favors species with strong fidelity to seasonal ranges where resources are predictable across space and time. Extreme disturbance events may negate the fitness benefits of faithfulness-with consequences for population distributions.ObjectivesWe hypothesized that extreme events fragment population distributions through two mechanisms: (1) reductions in fidelity or (2) elevated mortality. We tested the relative contributions of these mechanisms to population dynamics of mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus)-a long-lived mammal-with long-term, individual-based information before and after disturbance occurred.MethodsWe evaluated our hypotheses in response to disturbance during winter using a unique dataset of the movement and fate of adult females from a migratory population of mule deer over 8 years in western Wyoming, USA. First, we calculated fidelity of individuals between progressive winters and identified vacant space between population-level ranges to represent gaps in the population distribution. We then assessed: (1) how internal state and disturbance conditions affected fidelity, (2) how internal state, disturbance conditions, and fidelity affected survival, and (3) how survival and fidelity affected creation of gaps in population distribution.ResultsDisturbance weakened fidelity, but fidelity did not affect survival. Nutritional condition and age affected survival. Weakened fidelity did not change population distribution; rather, nutritional condition underpinned population dynamics, meaning that behavior alone may not prevent the creation of gaps in distribution following extreme disturbances.ConclusionsExtreme events may render behavioral plasticity incapable of mitigating mortality risk, and the environmental conditions that animals experience during the months, seasons, or even years before an event may regulate population-level organization in its aftermath.

AB  - Researchers have used both soil nematode data and soil quality index (SQI) data as indicators of soil quality. However, the relationship between soil nematodes and soil quality index is poorly understood. This study explored the relationship between soil nematode properties and soil quality in different land-use types in a subtropical karst region of Southwest China. We selected the following five typical land-use types that differ in the degree of soil disturbance: cropland (maize and soybean), sugarcane, mulberry, forage grass, and forest. SQI was calculated on the basis of bulk density (BD), soil pH, the ratio of soil organic carbon to total nitrogen (C:N), the contents of soil water (SWC), soil total nitrogen (TN), soil organic carbon content (SOC), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN), ammonium nitrogen (AN), nitrate nitrogen (NN), bacteria, fungi, actinomycetes (ACT), and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). We found that the abundance, Simpson dominance index, and metabolic footprint of soil nematodes were highest in the forest, followed by sugarcane, cropland (maize and soybean), forage grass, and mulberry. The SQI was highest in the forest and lowest in the cropland. There was no significant difference observed among the other three regions. In addition, the SQI was positively correlated with the total nematode biomass and abundances of total nematodes, fungivores, and herbivores, the abundances of total nematodes biomass and total nematode abundance, fungivores, and herbivores. A random forest model revealed that the dominant nematode genera (i.e., Coomansus and Acrobeloides) and the rare genera (i.e., Heterocephalobus) were closely associated with soil quality. Our results suggest that the soil nematodes (especially keystone genera) may mediate the effects of ecosystem disturbance on soil quality. These findings increase our understanding of the relationships between soil organisms and soil quality.

AB  - We aimed to explore how the invasion of the alien plant Solanum elaeagnifolium affects soil microbial and nematode communities in Mediterranean pines (Pinus brutia) and maquis (Quercus coccifera). In each habitat, we studied soil communities from the undisturbed core of both formations and from their disturbed peripheral areas that were either invaded or not by S. elaeagnifolium. Most studied variables were affected by habitat type, while the effect of S. elaeagnifolium was different in each habitat. Compared to maquis, the soil in pines had higher silt content and lower sand content and higher water content and organic content, supporting a much larger microbial biomass (PLFA) and an abundance of microbivorous nematodes. The invasion of S. elaeagnifolium in pines had a negative effect on organic content and microbial biomass, which was reflected in most bacterivorous and fungivorous nematode genera. Herbivores were not affected. In contrast, in maquis, organic content and microbial biomass responded positively to invasion, raising the few genera of enrichment opportunists and the Enrichment Index. Most microbivores were not affected, while herbivores, mostly Paratylenchus, increased. The plants colonizing the peripheral areas in maquis probably offered a qualitative food source to microbes and root herbivores, which in pines was not sufficient to affect the much larger microbial biomass.

AB  - Landscape-scale land use is important in driving species communities and interactions. However, despite increasing concerns regarding the ecological consequences of insect declines, our understanding of how the relative proportions of different land cover types influence insect herbivory in species-rich semi-natural habitats remains limited. This study assessed leaf, stem, and flower herbivory across 47 flowering forb species in 18 seminatural grassland sites in southern Sweden, where the surrounding landscape composition was quantified by the proportions of arable crops, forests, leys, and permanent grasslands. In addition to landscape effects, we examined the mediating roles of plant traits, plant diversity, and community composition to better understand how land use affects herbivory. Proportion of permanent grasslands and arable crops had the strongest influence on herbivory. The occurrence probabilities of leaf and stem herbivory increased as the proportion of permanent grasslands increased and the proportion of arable crops decreased. For herbivory intensity, leaf chewing damage exhibited the most significant response, following a trend similar to herbivory occurrence, while flower damage intensity increased with proportion of permanent grasslands but decreased with proportion of forest. These effects were less consistent at the species level, with varying magnitudes and directions of response. Plant community composition and traits, such as plant height and Specific Leaf Area (SLA), mediated landscape composition effects on leaf chewing herbivory, such that the proportion of arable crops were linked to higher SLA and taller plants, which in turn promoted leaf chewing herbivory. Our findings highlight the importance of preserving permanent grasslands at the landscape scale for maintaining insect herbivory levels on flowering forbs in local semi-natural grasslands, and call for the need to better understand the ecosystem consequences of reduced herbivory in agricultural landscapes.

AB  - Insect herbivore eco-immunology involves complex interactions between herbivore immunity and their natural enemies, and the responses of these interactions to environmental factors including plant anti-herbivore toxins. Plant toxins can affect herbivore immunity, leading to either immunoenhancement or immunosuppression, which in turn influences their vulnerability to parasitoids and pathogens. Herbivore immune responses differ among species regionally, reflecting adaptations to local environmental conditions and natural enemy pressures. Additionally, anthropogenic factors including like climate change, plant domestication, and invasive species are altering these eco-immunological dynamics. Such changes can ripple through food webs, affecting not only herbivores and their natural enemies but also broader community structures. By understanding these complex interactions, we can better predict ecosystem responses to environmental change.

AB  - Looking for an effective method to reduce risk of animal-train collisions, we tested the system of wildlife warning reflectors, a method usually used on roads. The research was conducted in central Poland, along a 2.1 km stretch of the E65 railway line near Warsaw, during eight months, in the years 2010-2011. For six months of a test period, the reflectors were uncovered (active) and, for the next two months of the control period, they were covered (non-active). Digital cameras were used to register animal reactions to trains 24-hours per day. We compared the probability of escape (escape = 1; no reaction = 0) from an oncoming train during test and control periods of the research, in different parts of a day (i.e. day vs. night) and compared escape time of roe deer between day and night and with reflectors covered and uncovered. Roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), red fox (Vulpes vulpes) and brown hare (Lepus europaeus) were observed most often (702 observations in total). The status of reflectors (covered/uncovered) did not influence the probability of animals' escape from an oncoming train. The only factors that affected the probability of escape were animal species and time of a day. Of the three species, roe deer was most likely to escape from an oncoming train (89% of probability at day and 52% during night, pooled data for covered and uncovered reflectors). Timing of roe deer escape from an oncoming train did not differ between day (6.4 seconds) and night, with either reflectors covered (7.5 seconds) or uncovered (4.6 seconds). The results indicated that wildlife warning reflectors were not effective to modify animal behaviour and to reduce risk of animal-train collisions.

AB  - Global change drivers that modify the quality and quantity of litter inputs to soil affect greenhouse gas fluxes, and thereby constitute a feedback to climate change. Carbon cycling in the Yukon-Kuskokwim (Y-K) River Delta, a subarctic wetland system, is influenced by landscape variations in litter quality and quantity generated by herbivores (migratory birds) that create 'grazing lawns' of short stature, nitrogen-rich vegetation. To identify the mechanisms by which these changes in litter inputs affect soil carbon balance, we independently manipulated qualities and quantities of litter representative of levels found in the Y-K Delta in a fully factorial microcosm experiment. We measured CO2 fluxes from these microcosms weekly. To help us identify how litter inputs influenced greenhouse gas fluxes, we sequenced soil fungal and bacterial communities, and measured soil microbial biomass carbon, dissolved carbon, inorganic nitrogen, and enzyme activity. We found that positive correlations between litter input quantity and CO2 flux were dependent upon litter type, due to differences in litter stoichiometry and changes to the structure of decomposer communities, especially the soil fungi. These community shifts were particularly pronounced when litter was added in the form of herbivore feces, and in litter input treatments that induced nitrogen limitation (i.e., senesced litter). The sensitivity of carbon cycling to litter quality and quantity in this system demonstrates that herbivores can strongly impact greenhouse gas fluxes through their influence on plant growth and tissue chemistry.

AB  - American chestnut (Castanea dentata (Marsh) Borkh.), once a co-dominant canopy species in eastern U.S. forests, has been functionally extinct for almost a century. Hybrid American-Chinese chestnuts, with the potential to be blight-resistant, present an opportunity to study its functional niche. The objective of this research was to identify silvicultural strategies related to light, herbivory, and competition for increasing the success of hybrid chestnut (BC3F3 generation) plantings in an Appalachian cove forest ecosystem in West Virginia (WV). Large and small circular canopy gaps were created to manipulate light with the prediction that seedlings would perform best in larger gaps. Within these gaps, landscape fabric was added to half of the seedlings to decrease vegetative competition and 30.5 cm tall tree shelters were placed around half of the seedlings to help mitigate rodent predation. After five years, results show an interaction between landscape fabric and gap size whereby landscape fabric had a positive effect on seedling height in large gaps but not in small gaps (p < 0.05). Survival was dependent on interactions between treatments with the highest seedling survival (80%) in small gaps with tree shelters and landscape fabric. Differences between treatments were less pronounced in large gaps where survival was much lower (45%). In conclusion, seedlings are likely to have the greatest long-term survival if they are planted in smaller gaps protected from vegetative competition and rodent predation.

AB  - Alpine meadows play a key role in maintaining biodiversity, soil nutrient retention, and herders' livelihoods in mountain regions. Livestock grazing-exclusion is common in grassland management to protect and promote the sustainable use of alpine meadows. However, there are few studies evaluating the effects of traditional light grazing practices in alpine regions and grazing-exclusion impacts on soil nutrient, especially under conditions of climate warming. In this study, we conducted a five-year grazing-exclusion and warming manipulation experiment to examine the effects of grazing-exclusion on soil nitrogen fractions, microbial communities, and enzyme activities under climate warming. Treatments consisted of light-intensity grazing, grazing-exclusion, and combined grazing-exclusion and warming. Our results showed that grazing-exclusion significantly decreased potential nitrogen mineralization at a 0-5 cm depth and at altitudes of 3850 m, 4000 m, 4150 m, and 4250 m. Combined grazing-exclusion and warming also significantly decreased potential nitrogen mineralization at a 0-5 cm depth and at relatively higher altitudes of 4000 m, 4150 m, and 4250 m. Grazing-exclusion, combined grazing-exclusion and warming all shifted microbial communities from bacteria toward fungi. Grazing-exclusion significantly decreased the relative abundances of phylum Chloroflexi (bacteria) and phylum Ascomycota (fungi), while combined grazing-exclusion and warming significantly increased the relative abundances of phylum Basidiomycota (fungi). The relative abundances of phylum Ascomycota (fungi) demonstrated a positive relationship with potential nitrogen mineralization, but the relative abundances of phylum Basidiomycota (fungi) had a negative relationship with potential nitrogen mineralization. The activities of dehydrogenase and protease in grazing-exclusion and combined grazing-exclusion and warming meadows were lower than those in grazed meadows. Our results demonstrated that in the context of climate change and global warming, grazingexclusion is unsuitable as a tool for the sustainable management of alpine meadows from soil nitrogen mineralization and fractions point of view. Of concern, climate warming could potentially amplify the adverse effects of grazing-exclusion and causes depletion of soil nutrients in the alpine meadow. This research suggests that a light-intensity grazing (0.5 yak ha(-1) year(-1)) is beneficial to increase soil enzyme activity and N mineralization in alpine meadows. Our results provide substantial evidence and a useful baseline and guidance for the sustainable grazing management of alpine meadows as environments change due to climate warming in the future.

AB  - Density dependence is often assumed in population dynamics, but its importance in small, isolated populations has been questioned. We evaluated the relative influence of density dependence, environmental conditions, and sporadic events (disease outbreaks and specialist predators) on annual population growth rate, annual female reproduction, and annual survival of juveniles and adult females in three populations of mountain ungulates. We analyzed long-term (30-47 years) individual-based data on two bighorn sheep populations and one mountain goat population in Alberta, Canada. The effect of cougar predation episodes and pneumonia epizootics on annual population growth rate was twice as strong as that of population density. While pneumonia reduced adult female and juvenile survival and predation episodes decreased all demographic rates, high density lowered only juvenile survival. Long-term studies are pivotal for understanding the dynamics of large herbivore populations, but they are rarely duplicated. Our analysis of three mountain ungulate populations with similar life history and ecological characteristics provides evidence that infrequent sporadic events can have a greater relative influence on annual population growth than density-dependent factors in isolated populations. This result contrasts with studies of larger, well-connected populations, highlighting the importance of considering sporadic events in the management and conservation of isolated populations.

AB  - Several features in the fruit of some neotropical trees likely evolved in response to the interaction with the mammalian megafauna extinct in the late Pleistocene. However, few studies have assessed the interactions between these plants and mammals in the absence of megafauna. We conducted a camera-trapping study in the Reserve of El Triunfo, Chiapas, Southern Mexico, to record the fauna consuming the fruit of the endemic tree Amphitecna montana which has megafauna traits. We surveyed the abundance and the spatial distribution of trees, saplings, and seedlings in 10 transects totalizing 0.1 ha, analyzed the chemical composition of their fruit, and assessed the impact of seed manipulation on germination success and seedling establishment. We recorded 12 species of medium-large mammals but the most frequent consumers of fruit were squirrels. The relationship among trees, saplings, and seedlings did not indicate the existence of a regeneration limitation. All the plant stages showed a clustered spatial pattern, which is in agreement with squirrels being the main seed dispersers. Free seeds were the more successful to germinate and establish as seedlings. Despite the current lack of megafauna in our study area, the A. montana population does not show signs of declining.

AB  - Elucidating the distribution of the grazing pressure requires an understanding of the grazing activities. In this study, we analyzed the grazing behavior of yaks in Three-River-Source Region (TRSR) and identified the main factors influencing the distribution of grazing intensity (GI) using trajectory data and remote sensing datasets. Our results revealed that a semi-resident transhumance strategy is employed in this region. The average grazing time (GT) of four GPS collars over the year was 11.84 h/day (N6), 11.01 h/day (N11), 9.25 h/day (N18), and 11.61 h/day (N24). GT was generally higher in warm seasons (summer and autumn) than in cold seasons (spring and winter). The average daily moving speed was found to be closely related to the pasture size of different herders and the seasons. Geodetector analysis identified the distance to camp (DOC) as the most important single factor influencing the distribution of GI, explaining up to 52% of the GI variations. However, relying solely on this factor may not accurately depict the actual GI distribution. When pairwise factors interacted, the explanatory power of the model increased, ranging from 34.55% to 63.26%. Our study highlights the importance of considering multiple factors when predicting grazing intensity, as grazing activities tend to cluster near settlements, but other factors may also be influential.

AB  - Fauna monitoring often relies on visual monitoring techniques such as camera trapping, which have biases leading to underestimates of vertebrate species diversity. Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding has emerged as a new source of biodiversity data that may improve biomonitoring; however, eDNA-based assessments of species richness remain relatively untested in terrestrial environments. We investigated the suitability of fallen log hollow sediment as a source of vertebrate eDNA, across two sites in southwestern Australia-one with a Mediterranean climate and the other semi-arid. We compared two different approaches (camera trapping and eDNA metabarcoding) for monitoring of vertebrate species, and investigated the effect of other factors (frequency of species, timing of visits, frequency of sampling, and body size) on vertebrate species detectability. Metabarcoding of hollow sediments resulted in the detection of higher species richness in comparison (29 taxa: six birds, three reptiles, and 20 mammals) to metabarcoding of soil at the entrance of the hollow (13 taxa: three birds, two reptiles, and eight mammals). We detected 31 taxa in total with eDNA metabarcoding and 47 with camera traps, with 14 taxa detected by both (12 mammals and two birds). By comparing camera trap data with eDNA read abundance, we were able to detect vertebrates through eDNA metabarcoding that had visited the area up to two months prior to sample collection. Larger animals were more likely to be detected, and so were vertebrates that were identified multiple times in the camera traps. These findings demonstrate the importance of substrate selection, frequency of sampling, and animal size, on eDNA-based monitoring. Future eDNA experimental design should consider all these factors as they affect detection of target taxa.

AB  - Most animals need to spend time being vigilant for predators, at the expense of other activities such as foraging. Group-living animals can benefit from the shared vigilance effort of other group members, with individuals reducing personal vigilance effort as group size increases. Behaviors like active scanning or head lifting are usually used to quantify vigilance but may not be accurate measures of this. We suggest that measuring an animal's blinking rate gives a meaningful measure of vigilance: increased blinking implies reduced vigilance, as the animal cannot detect predators when its eyes are closed. We describe an observational study of a captive population of red deer, where we measured the blinking rates of individual deer from groups of differing sizes (where mean group size ranged between 1 and 42.7 individuals). We demonstrate that as group size increases in red deer, individuals increase their blink rate, confirming the prediction that vigilance should decrease. Blinking is a simple non-invasive measure and offers a useful metric for assessing the welfare of animals experiencing an increase in perceived predation risk or other stressors.

AB  - Water buffaloes are increasingly being raised in similar way to dairy cows, in grazing systems frequently deprived of shade and water for immersion. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of different heat mitigation resources, 1) only shade and 2) shade plus water for immersion, on the behavioral repertoire and physiological characteristics of female grazing buffaloes in the subtropics during the hot season. Twenty buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis), including calves, heifers and non-lactating cows were allocated throughout the hot season (from December 2021 to April 2022) in a grazing system with two different heat mitigation resources (treatments): only shade (SH) and shade plus water for immersion (SHW). Diurnal behavioral repertoire was recorded every 15 days, individually and focally, at every 5 minutes for 12 hours per day. Heart rate (HR; beats/min), respiration rate (RR; breaths/min), rectal temperature (RT; degrees C) and panting score were also measured. Buffaloes reduced grazing time especially with THI above 75. Buffaloes at SHW spent more time grazing and lying than SH buffaloes (P < 0.05). Cows and heifers had higher ruminating (P < 0.05) and standing time (P < 0.05) compared with calves. Physiological variables did not differ (P > 0.05) between treatments (SH vs. SHW) and were positively correlated with air temperature and THI (P < 0.05). HR was higher for heifers (59.6) and calves (63.5) than for cows (53.3; P < 0.05). RT tended to be higher for heifers (38.4) and calves (38.3) than for cows (38.1; 0.05 < P < 0.10). However, respiration rate did not differ across buffalo categories (P > 0.05). Panting behavior was not reported throughout the observation days (panting score = 0). When both heat mitigation resources, shade and water for immersion were available, buffaloes preferred water for immersion to mitigate the effects of heat stress. Regardless animal category, buffaloes were able to maintain physiological variables within the normal range, indicating that providing shade and/or water for immersion, as environmental enrichment resources for thermoregulation, is suitable for heat stress mitigation in water buffaloes throughout the hot season in the subtropics.

AB  - Anthropogenic linear features allow wolves to travel faster and more efficiently, which is thought to increase wolf hunting efficiency of ungulates. Most previous studies have evaluated the role of linear features in wolfungulate dynamics by relying on indirect observations (e.g., GPS location data). Thus, there remains little direct observational data showing how wolves use linear features to hunt ungulates. Here, we present observational data (29 hunting sequences) of wolves using linear features to hunt ungulates. Linear features have largely been considered travel corridors that facilitate wolf movement and allow wolves to detect prey near (but not necessarily on) linear features. However, we clearly demonstrate wolves also use linear features as active hunting arenas where they detect, pursue, and kill prey that are also traveling directly on linear features. Our observations further suggest one of, if not the, primary way wolves detect ungulates on linear features is via olfactory cues.

We aimed to quantify the killing efficiency and animal welfare outcomes of lead-based and lead-free (copper-based) bullets for ground-based shooting of sambar deer (Cervus unicolor) in Victoria, south-eastern Australia. Methods. We used shooter-collected data from recreational diurnal hunting and professional nocturnal culling during 2020-2021. Shooters recorded rifle calibre, cartridge type, bullet mass, bullet type, shooting outcomes (miss, wound or kill), shooting distance, flight distance (the distance between where the animal was shot and where it died) as an assumed positive correlate of time to incapacitation, anatomical zones struck by bullets, and frequency of bullet exit wounds. We used flight distance as our response variable, assuming that it is positively correlated with time to incapacitation. To examine the role of several predictor variables (including bullet type) potentially influencing flight distance, the dataset was reduced to those deer killed with a single thoracic shot. Key results. Our data captured shooting events involving 276 deer, with 124 deer shot at with lead-based bullets and 152 with copper-based bullets. Most (87%) of the deer were killed with a single shot. The frequency of non-fatal wounding was <4% for both bullet types and there was no distinct difference in the probability of a single shot kill for deer shot with either bullet type. For those deer killed with a single thoracic shot (n = 198), there was no evidence that bullet energy or shooting distance influenced flight distance. After accounting for differences in terminal kinetic energy, the mean flight distance of deer shot with lead-free bullets (35 m) was 56% greater than that of deer shot with lead-based bullets (22 m). Conclusions. Lead-based and lead-free bullets produced similar animal welfare outcomes for shooting sambar deer. Implications. A transition to lead-free ammunition for shooting sambar deer would have minimal impact on efficiency or animal welfare outcomes.

AB  - Species interactions shape native plant communities, influencing both composition and ecosystem processes, with invasion by non-native species threatening these dynamic relationships, native species, and function. The consequences of invasive plants in particular may stretch across taxa to impact plant, insect, and soil microbial communities directly and indirectly, with consequences for ecological functioning. In northern mixed-grass prairies in the United States, invasion by two annual brome grasses, Bromus arvensis and B. tectorum, negatively impacts rangeland plants; however, the simultaneous effects on insects and soil microbes (bacteria and archaea), and the implications for ecological function, have received less attention. Here, using observational field studies conducted at two mixed-grass prairie sites in Montana and Wyoming, we assessed the relationships between plants, insects, and soil microbes across gradients of invasion by B. arvensis and B. tectorum. Overall, we found differences in plant and insect communities and functional groups with increasing invasion abundance for both brome species. However, associations between invasion and the soil microbial community were species specific, as we only saw these relationships under B. tectorum invasion, implying B. tectorum may have more substantial consequences for rangeland management. While invasion by annual bromes may cause changes in certain plant and insect functional groups, such as C4 perennial grasses and certain insect herbivores, soil microbial functional groups may be less impacted, especially under B. arvensis invasion. This work sheds light on the need to explore changes in natural communities across taxa and to all invasive species, as ecosystem effects are likely to be contingent upon both.

AB  - How animals, particularly livestock, adapt to various climates and environments over short evolutionary time is of fundamental biological interest. Further, understanding the genetic mechanisms of adaptation in indigenous livestock populations is important for designing appropriate breeding programs to cope with the impacts of changing climate. Here, we conducted a comprehensive genomic analysis of diversity, interspecies introgression, and climate-mediated selective signatures in a global sample of sheep and their wild relatives. By examining GOOK and 50K genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism data from 3,447 samples representing 111 domestic sheep populations and 403 samples from all their seven wild relatives (argali, Asiatic mouflon, European mouflon, urial, snow sheep, bighorn, and thinhorn sheep), coupled with 88 whole-genome sequences, we detected clear signals of common introgression from wild relatives into sympatric domestic populations, thereby increasing their genomic diversities. The introgressions provided beneficial genetic variants in native populations, which were significantly associated with local climatic adaptation. We observed common introgression signals of alleles in olfactory-related genes (e.g., ADCY3 and TRPV1) and the PADI gene family including in particular PADI2, which is associated with antibacterial innate immunity. Further analyses of whole-genome sequences showed that the introgressed alleles in a specific region of PADI2 (chr2: 248,302,667-248,306,614) correlate with resistance to pneumonia. We conclude that wild introgression enhanced climatic adaptation and resistance to pneumonia in sheep. This has enabled them to adapt to varying climatic and environmental conditions after domestication.

AB  - Invasions by non-native plant species are thought to be facilitated by factors like escape from specialized natural enemies and increased resource availability. However, the success of invasive plants also depends on interactions with native plants and soil organisms, including nematodes. Plants can experience both beneficial and harmful interactions with nematodes. Yet, research on how nematodes and nutrient levels interact to affect competition between invasive and native plants is lacking. We conducted a multi-species greenhouse experiment involving 10 invasive species and 20 native species to test the separate and combined effects of nutrient levels and nematodes on performance of individual invasive plant species, as well as their competition with native plant communities. High-nutrient conditions significantly enhanced the aboveground biomass (+119.4%), height (+26.9%), reproduction (+21.0%) and proportional aboveground biomass (+21.2%) of invasive plant species. Conversely, competition from native plant communities significantly reduced the mean aboveground biomass, height, and reproduction of the invasive species by 55.3%, 20.3% and 13.5%, respectively. For invasive plants grown without competition, the high-nutrient treatment significantly enhanced total biomass and root diameter, although it decreased the root mass fraction, independent of nematode presence. In addition, in the absence of competition, nematodes increased the specific root length of invasive plants by 3.6% under low-nutrient conditions but reduced it by 10.1% under high-nutrient conditions. These results indicate that nutrient enrichment, competition and biotic interactions with nematodes can all play critical roles in shaping the growth and adaptive strategies of invasive plant species.

AB  - Anthropogenic developments alter the environment and resources available to wildlife communities. In response to these real or perceived threats from this development, species may adjust their spatial occurrence. Additionally, wildlife species may adjust when in diel time (24-h light-dark cycle) they occupy sites on the landscape to adapt to changing conditions. However, many wildlife studies only focus on where a species does and does not occur, ignoring how species may shift their diel activity at sites to mitigate threats. We used a multi-state diel occupancy modeling framework to investigate how a community of mammals (mesocarnivores, urban-adapted omnivores, and herbivore/small mammals) respond to differing levels of anthropogenic development and forest cover across two climatic seasons. We collected camera trap data at 240 survey locations across the summer and winter of 2021-2022. We modeled multi-state diel occupancy for 14 mammal species with extent of development/forest and season hypothesized to influence diel occupancy and season hypothesized to influence the probability of detection. We found that all species displayed heterogeneity in both diel occupancy and detection either by extent of development/forest and or season. Within the mesocarnivore species group, coyote and red fox were less sensitive to development and had higher occupancy probability at these sites in general but used them more during the night, while more sensitive mesocarnivores including fisher and bobcat occupied the day state only when there was increasing forest cover. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating diel activity in habitat modeling to better understand the relationship between a species and its landscape, particularly in a region that is vulnerable to increased anthropogenic pressure.

AB  - With continual growth in recreational trail use, it is becoming increasingly complicated to balance demands for outdoor recreation opportunities with wildlife conservation. To better understand how mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) and Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus canadensis) respond to trail-based recreation, we deployed remote cameras in a paired study design to assess ungulate encounter rates relative to recreation traffic counts and distance from trails. Our methodology allowed us to estimate the magnitude of human activity on public land trails, which can be challenging, but is a key step in understanding recreational effects on animal utilization, especially if any interaction in trail proximity and human traffic rates exists. Paired cameras provided a comparison of animal encounter rates on- and off-trail at varying trail proximities, and the on-trail camera also yielded daily recreation traffic counts to assess how animals respond to varying traffic for each camera pair. Elk avoided busier trails and showed a strong positive response to distance from trails, while mule deer exhibited a positive response to higher traffic counts and no measurable effect of trail proximity. We identified a distance to trail threshold of 600-655 m, where elk utilization shifted from lower-than-expected utilization to higher-than-expected utilization, indicating that this elk population was redistributed to some degree within 57.5% of the study area's extent. Quantifying recreation traffic counts was key to understanding species' responses to recreation, highlighting the need for managers to consider both trail placement and human traffic regulation to mitigate recreation impacts.

AB  - Extensive grazing in mountain areas of the Basque Country happens in a mosaic of mainly open pastureland, woodland, plantations and scrubland. For these grazing areas' conservation, it is elemental to understand livestock's behaviour in those habitats. In this study, criteria for such practices are to be defined based on landscape analysis and livestock behaviour. The sampling was realized in Gorbeia Special Area of Conservation during the 2021 campaign. Livestock behaviour's spatial and temporal analysis was realized in different buffer ranges around open pasturelands, to patch level (vegetation type and slope-range) and for each month, by calculating Global Positioning System (GPS) fix density. Thus, Pyrenean oak woods were seen as the type of woodland that livestock preferred, especially in November, and followed by Corsican pine and Scottish pine woods. At the same time, there was a gradient from a higher to a lower fix density as distance from pasturelands' borders augmented in which woodland type, tree canopy cover fraction and livestock type had an effect. These results highlight the necessity to design silvopastoral management based on the potentiality of each grazing area and animal species, being necessary to open woodland areas for its promotion.

AB  - Non-native plants can affect communities through direct competition, and by providing refuge to seed predators, creating apparent competition with native plants. Ammophila arenaria (European beachgrass) has been introduced to coastal dune habitats throughout the western United States, where it forms dense monocultures, stabilizes dunes, and alters abiotic and biotic conditions. The dominance of European beachgrass is linked to declines of Lupinus tidestromii (Tidestrom's lupine), an herb endemic to coastal dune communities in central and northern California. Peromyscus sonoriensis (western deer mice), a native seed predator, use beachgrass as refuge from predators. Tidestrom's lupine near European beachgrass stands experience greater predation pressure from deer mice. At Point Reyes National Seashore, California, USA (PRNS), mechanical removal, manual pulling, and herbicide treatment have been used to reduce the density of European beachgrass near Tidestrom's lupine populations. We trapped deer mice at five sites in PRNS that experienced different management regimes and used spatially-explicit capture-recapture models to estimate deer mouse density as a function of site and habitat treatment. We found that deer mouse density was lowest in areas where European beachgrass was mechanically removed and in herbicide-treated foredunes, and highest in areas highly invaded by European beachgrass and Carpobrotus spp. (iceplant). Deer mouse density increased from 2021 to 2022 at every site except one that underwent extensive mechanical removal of European beachgrass from 2010-2011. This study shows enduring effects of European beachgrass removal on the density of a native seed predator and highlights the importance of habitat management for conservation of Tidestrom's lupine.

AB  - Dusky kob, is a Sciaenid finfish that has a global distribution and is indigenous to South Africa. Historically, the species was a prime target for fisheries, but is currently an emerging candidate for aquaculture due to declining wild populations. Aquaculture breeding pose challenges to conventional genetic selection methods, especially when species are new (essentially wild), and industries are small: Founder populations are limited, and sexual maturity is often late; mass spawning leads to large variances in broodstock contributions and pedigree records are difficult to keep; and production environments are often highly variable. To overcome such challenges, this study consolidated inferred pedigree and phenotypic data across three aquaculture facilities and was able to estimate robust heritability values for the correlated growth traits, wet weight (0.46 & PLUSMN; 0.29) and standard length (0.41 & PLUSMN; 0.27). We further suggest that conventional phenotypic selection be combined with marker assisted selection to improve potential genetic gains. To this aim a case-control association analysis was done using a candidate gene approach, prioritising, and validating genetic variants from a previously developed exome resource for dusky kob. Three genes with large effect sizes on phenotypes were identified: tankyrase [Haplotypic Odd Ratio (OR) = 22.98]; myoblast determination protein 1 (highest individual SNP OR = 5.28); and bone morphogenetic protein 2 (Haplotypic OR = 13.33). If a cooperative model for genetic improvement was to be implemented across farms, using a combinational approach, it could facilitate making genetic gains during the early phases of domestication.

AB  - 1. Animal habitat selection-central in both theoretical and applied ecology-may depend on behavioural motivations such as foraging, predator avoidance, and thermoregulation. Step-selection functions (SSFs) enable assessment of fine-scale habitat selection as a function of an animal's movement capacities and spatiotemporal variation in extrinsic conditions.2. If animal location data can be associated with behaviour, SSFs are an intuitive approach to quantify behaviour-specific habitat selection. Fitting SSFs separately for distinct behavioural states helped to uncover state-specific selection patterns. However, while the definition of the availability domain has been highlighted as the most critical aspect of SSFs, the influence of accounting for behaviour in the use-availability design has not been quantified yet.3. Using a predator-free population of high-arctic muskoxen Ovibos moschatus as a case study, we aimed to evaluate how (1) defining behaviour-specific availability domains, and/or (2) fitting separate behaviour-specific models impacts (a) model structure, (b) estimated selection coefficients and (c) model predictive performance as opposed to behaviour-unspecific approaches. To do so, we first applied hidden Markov models to infer different behavioural modes (resting, foraging, relocating) from hourly GPS positions (19 individuals, 153-1062 observation days/animal). Using SSFs, we then compared behaviour-specific versus behaviour-unspecific habitat selection in relation to terrain features, vegetation and snow conditions.4. Our results show that incorporating behaviour into the definition of the availability domain primarily impacts model structure (i.e. variable selection), whereas fitting separate behaviour-specific models mainly influences selection strength. Behaviour-specific availability domains improved predictive performance for foraging and relocating models (i.e. behaviours with medium to large spatial displacement), but decreased performance for resting models. Thus, even for a predator-free population subject to only negligible interspecific competition and human disturbance we found that accounting for behaviour in SSFs impacted model structure, selection coefficients and predictive performance.5. Our results indicate that for robust inference, both a behaviour-specific availability domain and behaviour-specific model fitting should be explored, especially for populations where strong spatiotemporal selection trade-offs are expected. This is particularly critical if wildlife habitat preferences are estimated to inform management and conservation initiatives.

AB  - In Southern Patagonia, grasslands are the principal food resource for sheep reared for meat and wool as the main provisioning ecosystem services (ES). The main objective of this study was to model lamb and wool production as provisioning ES at a regional scale using climatic, topographic, and vegetation variables from sheep farms across Santa Cruz province. At a regional level, animal yield ranged from 0.25 to 0.69 g lamb/m(2)/yr and 0.10 to 0.19 g greasy wool/m(2)/yr. We used multiple regression models to produce maps of lamb and wool provisioning ES across Santa Cruz province. The model for variation of lamb production explained 96% of the variance in the data and the most significant predictor variables were temperature seasonality, normalized vegetation index (NVDI, dimensionless), and desertification index. The most important variables for the model of greasy wool production were isothermality, temperature seasonality, and NVDI, which together explained 98% of the variance. The lowest CF values of both products (lamb and wool) were located in more productive grasslands. There were differences in lamb and wool production across vegetation types with the highest values being located in more productive grasslands (0.51 g lamb/m(2)/yr in Nothofagus antarctica forest and 0.15 g greasy wool/m(2)/yr in Magellanic grass steppe and N. antarctica). Lamb and greasy wool yields decreased with desertification gradient due to erosion processes. The main limitation of the model is related to the data availability at landscape level, which must be improved in future studies by accounting for soil type, fertility, and soil water content. The results of lamb and wool production found in the present work assist in characterizing the provisioning ES ecosystem of livestock products in Southern Patagonia. The successful management of livestock becomes an important challenge to the commercial and policy communities to satisfy society's need for food and wool products under sustainable grassland management.

AB  - Integrating host movement and pathogen data is a central issue in wildlife disease ecology that will allow for a better understanding of disease transmission. We examined how adult female mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) responded behaviorally to infection with chronic wasting disease (CWD). We compared movement and habitat use of CWD-infected deer (n = 18) to those that succumbed to starvation (and were CWD-negative by ELISA and IHC; n = 8) and others in which CWD was not detected (n = 111, including animals that survived the duration of the study) using GPS collar data from two distinct populations collared in central Wyoming, USA during 2018-2022. CWD and predation were the leading causes of mortality during our study (32/91 deaths attributed to CWD and 27/91 deaths attributed to predation). Deer infected with CWD moved slower and used lower elevation areas closer to rivers in the months preceding death compared with uninfected deer that did not succumb to starvation. Although CWD-infected deer and those that died of starvation moved at similar speeds during the final months of life, CWD-infected deer used areas closer to streams with less herbaceous biomass than starved deer. These behavioral differences may allow for the development of predictive models of disease status from movement data, which will be useful to supplement field and laboratory diagnostics or when mortalities cannot be quickly retrieved to assess cause-specific mortality. Furthermore, identifying individuals who are sick before predation events could help to assess the extent to which disease mortality is compensatory with predation. Finally, infected animals began to slow down around 4 months prior to death from CWD. Our approach for detecting the timing of infection-induced shifts in movement behavior may be useful in application to other disease systems to better understand the response of wildlife to infectious disease.

AB  - Reproduction is the most energetically expensive life stage with the demands of productivity representing a balance between physiological requirements and environmental conditions. Wild pigs (Sus scrofa) throughout most of North America are genetic hybrids of feral domestic pigs and wild boar and have the highest reproductive potential of any wild ungulate. The phenology of reproduction, extent of multiple reproductive events per year, how individual and extrinsic factors contribute to variability in productivity, and impact of genetic lineage on these parameters is not well understood in wild pigs. We quantified reproductive parameters in wild pigs relative to a suite of individual and environmental attributes across seasons and multiple years in South Carolina, USA, from March 2017 and May 2020. We hypothesized that individual attributes (mass, age class, number of teats, rump fat, relative genetic association to wild boar vs. domestic pigs) and extrinsic factors (mast availability) would influence probability of pregnancy and fetal litter size. Wild pigs produced offspring throughout all months with peaks in conception corresponding to a seasonal pulse in food availability. The likelihood of pregnancy was influenced by female mass and nutritional condition and was greatest during years with abundant resources. Similarly, litter size increased with female mass and age, implying larger and older females represent the most important group for population recruitment. In evaluating the relationship between reproductive output and ancestral associations to domestic pigs versus wild boar, the proportion of wild boar ancestry was not an important influence on productivity in our population. We determined juveniles reach a physiological threshold of sexual maturity at approximately 30 kg. Average litter size was comparable to other populations, and wild pigs maintain an average fetal litter size of 5.43 offspring despite 13.6% embryonic mortality. A thorough understanding of biotic and extrinsic factors influencing reproduction are important for realistic population models, which are necessary for identifying areas to focus management needs and implementation.

AB  - Charcoal analysis, applied in archaeological excavation of Vetricella site in the distal reach of the Pecora river (Tyrrhenian southern Tuscany, Italy), detected the exploitation, management, and ecology of forest land cover between mid-8th century AD and mid-13th century AD. Taking place in a central Mediterranean district adequately studied through palaeoenvironmental and archaeological research, the investigation determined times and modalities of Medieval human impact on forest ecosystem. The fuelwood supply areas were characterised by Quercus cerris forest, in the past much larger and extended than Mediterranean evergreen forest. The collection of fuelwood was based on the traditional method of coppice woodland management, including the release of decade-year-old standard trees for the production of larger timber assortment, useful for building activities (testified by the numerous post-holes). The silvicultural system, known as compound coppice, produced a forest landscape characterised by multi-storied stands ensuring production of fruit and spreading of acorns for feeding pigs. Changes in the forest ecosystem were particularly detectable from mid-10th century AD, when accessory pioneer woody species, resilient to cut clearance, spread. It was the Ottonian period of activities in sequence aimed at radically changing the site of Vetricella along with land use in the Pecora river valley. The resulting forest land cover management, depending on the political strategies adopted by Medieval authorities, marked the progression of a cultural landscape still characterizing central Tyrrhenian Italy.

AB  - Wildlife exclusion fencing has become a standard component of highway mitigation systems designed to reduce collisions with large mammals. Past work on the effectiveness of exclusion fencing has relied heavily on control-impact (i.e., space-for-time substitutions) and before-after study designs. These designs limit inference and may confound the effectiveness of mitigation with co-occurring process that also changes the rate of collisions. We used a replicated (n = 2 sites monitored for over 1000 km years combined) before-after-control-impact study design to assess fencing effectiveness along the Trans-Canada Highway in the Rocky Mountains of Canada. We found that collisions declined for common ungulates species (elk, mule deer, and white-tailed deer) by up to 96% but not for large carnivores. The weak response of carnivores is likely due to the combination of fence intrusions and low sample sizes. We calculated realized fencing effectiveness by applying the same change in collision rates observed at control (unfenced) sites as the expected change for adjacent fenced sections. Compared with the apparent fencing effectiveness (i.e., the difference in WVCs rates before and after fencing was installed), the realized estimates of fencing effectiveness declined by 6% at one site and increased by 10% at another site. When factoring in the cost of ungulate collisions to society, fencing provided a net economic gain within 1 year of construction. Over a 10-year period, fencing would provide a net economic gain of > $500,000 per km in reduced collisions. Our study highlights the benefits of long-term monitoring of road mitigation projects and provides evidence of fencing effectiveness for reducing wildlife-vehicle collisions involving large mammals.

AB  - This study is the first systematic assessment of large herbivore (LH) communities in Limpopo National Park (LNP) in Mozambique, an area where most LH species were extinct until the early 2000s. We investigate whether LH community parameters are linked with the availability of habitat types or the distance between sampling sites and the origin of LH resettlement. We placed camera traps in five habitat types in resettled and not-resettled areas to compare species richness, relative abundance index, grazers-browsers-mixed feeder and naive occupancy of 15 LH species. While the richness decreased along the distance gradient of LH resettlement, relative abundance index strongly responded to habitat features. The grazer-browser-mixed feeder ratio oscillated, while from resettled to not-resettled areas, the ratio increased. Most species show a wide distribution range. The associations of most LH community parameters with habitat types rather than distance to initial release, together with the species-specific and guild-specific response patterns of LH, suggest LNP to already be in an intermediate stage of restoration. Our results highlight the importance of post-release monitoring of reintroduced wildlife as a tool to assess the success of ecological restoration initiatives in transboundary conservation areas.

AB  - Wildlife translocations are an important conservation tool but can be challenging for the animals. For translocations to be successful, animals must adjust to their release landscape. Investigating how animals acclimate to their release landscapes can improve post-release monitoring and inform about the management needs of translocated populations. We investigated movements and resource selection dynamics of 106 elk (Cervus canadensis) during the first 6-8 years following their release to Missouri, USA in 2011-2013. We observed evidence of spatial acclimation as determined by cessation of changes in resource selection together with monthly range sizes and fidelity of individual elk. Females showed faster evidence of acclimation in their movements following release than males. Although range fidelity for both sexes stabilized within approximately seven months, range size stabilized within approximately three months for females and stabilization began within approximately 11 months for males. Selection for multiple resources by elk also largely stabilized within their first year following release. A simple refuge-forage trade-off alone did not explain acclimation in resource selection. Elk selected for high-quality food plots across the temporal extent of restoration regardless of time since release, whereas their selection for cover resources during summer increased after elk acclimated. Together, spatial acclimation generally lagged behind physiological responses observed in this system, adding to the increasing evidence that translocated animals display acclimation patterns across trait-specific time periods. Our approach demonstrates the utility of accounting for acclimation effects across multiple spatial response metrics for improving post-release monitoring, evaluation, and management of restored wildlife populations.

AB  - The increased availability of quality genomic data has greatly improved the scope and resolution of our understanding of the recent evolutionary history of wild species adapted to extreme environments and their susceptibility to anthropogenic impacts. The guanaco (Lama guanicoe), the largest wild ungulate in South America, is a good example. The guanaco is well adapted to a wide range of habitats, including the Sechura Desert, the high Andes Mountains to the north, and the extreme temperatures and conditions of Navarino Island to the south. Guanacos also have a long history of overexploitation by humans. To assess the evolutionary impact of these challenging habitats on the genomic diversity, we analyzed 38 genomes (similar to 10 to 16x) throughout their extensive latitudinal distribution from the Sechura and Atacama Desert to southward into Tierra del Fuego Island. These included analyses of patterns of unique differentiation in the north and geographic region further south with admixture among L. g. cacsilensis and L. g. guanicoe. Our findings provide new insights on the divergence of the subspecies similar to 800,000 yr BP and document two divergent demographic trajectories and to the initial expansion of guanaco into the more southern portions of the Atacama Desert. Patagonian guanacos have experienced contemporary reductions in effective population sizes, likely the consequence of anthropogenic impacts. The lowest levels of genetic diversity corresponded to their northern and western limits of distribution and some varying degrees of genetic differentiation. Adaptive genomic diversity was strongly linked with environmental variables and was linked with colonization toward the south followed by adaptation.

AB  - Climate change leads to an increased frequency of severe weather events as well as stressful growing conditions. Together these changes may impact the resilience of ecosystems. To keep track of such effects, conservation managers monitor the "ecological integrity" or coherence of ecosystem processes, such as the cycling of carbon and water. Networked phenocams can produce near-continuous observations of leaf function in the context of climate change, capturing declines due to disturbance or stress. Here we explore the application of phenocams to detect responses to disturbance and stress using 14 examples from the PhenoCam Network. We selected these previously published and new examples to include a variety of disturbances in the form of hurricanes, a windstorm, frost, insect defoliation, and stress due to drought. Frost and herbivory disturbances led to both reductions and extensions in the duration of the rising section of the greenness curve, while hurricanes generally led to reductions in the duration of the plateau section and entire leaf-on period. We found that changes of at least +/- 20% in the duration of the rising section in the seasonal greenness curve, +/- 20% in the duration of the plateau section following the seasonal greenness peak, and +/- 10% in the duration of the entire leaf-on period were a reliable signal of leaf functional declines due to disturbance or stress. If such declines become increasingly frequent and severe as a consequence of climate change, this could impact ecological integrity through interruptions to ecosystem processes. Comparing the duration of these periods in a given year to the average for other years with these thresholds resulted in average true detection rates of 86% and false-positive detection rates of 11% when sampling from probability density functions of 344 broadleaf and needleleaf PhenoCam site-years. Here we show that phenocams are powerful ecological integrity monitoring tools, which can be efficiently applied to quantify dynamic responses to disturbance or stress.

AB  - Quantifying changing climatic effects on ecosystem productivity and human spatiotemporal distributions during the Middle to Upper Palaeolithic transition in Iberia, the authors find evidence that the hiatus between Neanderthal and modern human cultural complexes in North Atlantic Iberia and the longer persistence of Neanderthals in southern latitudes had an ecological cause.
   What role did fluctuations play in biomass availability for secondary consumers in the disappearance of Neanderthals and the survival of modern humans? To answer this, we quantify the effects of stadial and interstadial conditions on ecosystem productivity and human spatiotemporal distribution patterns during the Middle to Upper Palaeolithic transition (50,000-30,000 calibrated years before the present) in Iberia. First, we used summed probability distribution, optimal linear estimation and Bayesian age modelling to reconstruct an updated timescale for the transition. Next, we executed a generalized dynamic vegetation model to estimate the net primary productivity. Finally, we developed a macroecological model validated with present-day observations to calculate herbivore abundance. The results indicate that, in the Eurosiberian region, the disappearance of Neanderthal groups was contemporaneous with a significant decrease in the available biomass for secondary consumers, and the arrival of the first Homo sapiens populations coincided with an increase in herbivore carrying capacity. During stadials, the Mediterranean region had the most stable conditions and the highest biomass of medium and medium-large herbivores. These outcomes support an ecological cause for the hiatus between the Mousterian and Aurignacian technocomplexes in Northern Iberia and the longer persistence of Neanderthals in southern latitudes.

AB  - Large mammalian herbivores influence grassland ecosystems through plant consumption, return of excreta and trampling, and by altering nutrient cycles and soil properties. These herbivore-mediated changes impact other animals in the habitat, particularly plant-dwelling arthropods. While plant-mediated effects of large mammalian herbivores on arthropod populations are well documented, direct effects, such as incidental ingestion of arthropods, remain understudied. Large mammalian herbivores incidentally ingest a variety of plant-dwelling arthropods; however, it remains unclear how this interaction is influenced by the dietary choices of different mammal species within the same habitat. Using a DNA metabarcoding analysis of fecal samples, we investigated the ingestion of plant-dwelling arthropods by sheep and cattle grazing in northeast Asian grasslands. Fecal samples were collected from replicated plots throughout the grazing season, including previously grazed and ungrazed plots. A COI marker was used to amplify arthropod DNA, followed by high-throughput sequencing. Results revealed that both sheep and cattle ingest a variety of plant-dwelling arthropods, including herbivores, parasitoids, and predators, with a high proportion of endophages (species developing in plant tissue). Significant differences were observed in ingestion between sheep and cattle-sheep (selective grazers) ingested a wider variety of plant-dwelling arthropods compared to cattle, whose diet consisted primarily of grasses, highlighting the impact of dietary choices on arthropod ingestion. Grazing regime influenced the ingestion of plant-dwelling arthropods in sheep, with differences observed between previously grazed and ungrazed plots. Our findings demonstrate that the ingestion of plant-dwelling arthropods by large mammalian herbivores is a dynamic and widespread phenomenon, varying across mammalian species and seasons.

AB  - With future human population growth concentrating in urban areas, cities are working to counterbalance ecological disturbances resulting from development by incorporating green space that supports greater biodiversity. An initial line of inquiry into designing wildlife-inclusive green space involves evaluating landscapes that are associated with the habitat use of urban species. In this study, we utilized occupancy modeling to estimate select terrestrial mammal presence in a fast-growing mid-sized midwestern city to determine possible taxa-specific associations with multiple land use and cover variables, specifically those associated with higher degrees of human activity. Using motion-triggered infrared trail cameras over eight seasons from winter 2017 to fall 2018, we applied a single-species, single -season stacked design to estimate occupancy for eight urban dwelling mammals. Taxa-specific models contained one of three possible detection variables (null, percent green space, or percent impervious surface) and combinations of three species-specific variables, natural and anthropogenic. We hypothesized that large species, coyote (Canis latrans) and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), would exhibit the most positive association to natural land cover and the most negative association to anthropogenic land cover. We also hypothesized that small and medium sized species, eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus), gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis), opossum (Didelphis virginiana), raccoon (Procyon lotor), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), and striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), would demonstrate a neutral association to land cover type, anthropogenic or natural. Our results indicated that the presence of anthropogenic features rather than any particular natural land cover may be driving wildlife distribution in our study area, as none of our species demonstrated a positive association to natural land cover (percent recreation, residential yards, vacant land, or woodland). Species with a wide range of body sizes, showed a negative association with residential yards, indicating that this type of green space may be an unnecessary or unsuitable subsidizing resource in our study area. With our results in mind, we recommend increasing the amount of natural or less manicured green space to offset the intensity of impervious surface as well as encouraging the establishment of native vegetation in existing and newly con-structed residential development to better connect urban green space and residential yards to larger adjoining tracts of natural landscapes. For our study area and other cities in similar phases of development, these suggestions may be essential first steps to reduce biodiversity loss and strengthen community ecology as urban areas continue to grow.

AB  - Despite many studies that have explored the effect of livestock grazing on plant communities, the response of species composition and diversity to livestock grazing in arid rangelands remains ambiguous. This study examined the effects of livestock grazing on plant communities in arid steppe rangelands of North Africa. Plant diversity of annual species, perennial species, and all species combined were measured and compared between grazed and grazing-excluded areas. We also examined the relative importance of species turnover and community nestedness. Moreover, the effects of livestock grazing on beta diversity at local among transects and landscape among sites scales were examined using the multiplicative diversity partitioning. Results revealed that livestock grazing significantly decreased the alpha diversity of all species combined and the diversity of annual plants. Livestock grazing induced a shift in plant community composition where most species composition variation (similar to 74%) was due to infrequent species replacement 'turnover' between the two management types rather than nestedness (similar to 26%). Results revealed also that among transects, beta diversity was higher in grazed steppes than in grazing-excluded steppes. Whereas, among sites, beta diversity was lower in grazed steppes compared to grazing-excluded steppes. These findings suggest that livestock grazing in arid steppe rangelands increases the variation in plant species composition at a local spatial scale and engenders vegetation homogeneity at a landscape spatial scale. Therefore, the implementation of appropriate management practices such as short-term grazing exclusion is mandatory to prevent these ecosystems from large-scale biotic homogenization.

AB  - According to the latest global assessment report on biodiversity and ecosystem services, nature and biodiversity have experienced a global decline, making the development of conservation policies urgent. Herein, we used a contingent valuation survey to estimate the economic value of a reintroduction program for the huemul ( Hip- pocamelus bisulcus ), an endangered charismatic species in Chile. Our novel approach exploits changes in the access to the site to disentangle nonuse value from use value. We use parametric and nonparametric models to estimate the willingness to pay for the program. Our findings consistently indicate that the conservation of the huemul is valued more when tourist access is restricted, as opposed to allowing visitors access to reintroduction areas. We also analyze the sensitivity of this main finding to different cut-off points of a certainty scale, showing that the results are robust. We hypothesize that people are willing to pay a "premium" to keep the conservation site "out of sight" from tourist activities. This could also be related to the belief that a reintroduction program would be more effective if access was not allowed. A cost -benefit analysis using the most conservative assumptions suggests that social benefit significantly outperforms cost.

AB  - Throughout the Caribbean, coral reefs are transitioning from rugose, coral-dominated communities to flat, soft coral-dominated habitats, triggering declines in biodiversity. To help mitigate these losses, artificial structures have been used to re-create substrate complexity and support reef inhabitants. This study used natural and artificial structures to investigate the factors influencing the use of habitat by reef fish. During 2018 and 2019, divers added artificial structures and monitored the fish assemblages associating with both the artificial structures and naturally occurring corals. Overall, there were more fish on natural structures than on artificial structures. While structure shape did not influence fish use, there was a non-significant trend for increased use of larger structures. Fish observations did not differ across a gradient of shallow, complex reefs to deeper, flatter reefs; however, analyses of feeding guilds revealed clearer patterns: herbivores and omnivores were positively associated with low rugosity reefs where macroalgal abundance was higher, whereas invertivores preferred more rugose reefs. These results suggest that as reefs lose structural complexity, fish communities may become dominated by herbivores and omnivores. It also appears that the addition of artificial structures of the type used here may not mitigate the effects of structure loss on reef fish assemblages.

AB  - With the rise of large herbivore populations in most northern hemisphere forests, browsing is becoming an increasingly important driver of forest regeneration dynamics. Among other processes affecting the regeneration, the concept of plant-herbivore feedback loops holds that browsed saplings are more subject to subsequent herbivory. This phenomenon is interpreted as a consequence of compensatory growth following browsing since fast growth is generally associated with higher digestibility and lower defense against herbivores. However, studies linking browsing-induced trait variations to subsequent attractiveness to herbivores are still lacking, especially in the forest context. In this study, we experimentally examine the existence of a feedback loop between oak (Quercus robur L.) and roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and investigate its underlying morphological and chemical traits. We simulated single and repeated roe deer browsing on nursery-grown oak saplings and measured the changes in sapling height growth, lateral branching, leaf traits and winter shoot traits over two years. We conducted winter feeding trials with tame roe deer one year after the first treatment to test the effect of simulated browsing on sapling attractiveness. Simulated browsing reduced sapling height growth but had no effect on branching. Simulated browsing had no effect on leaf traits after half a year, but decreased the phenolic content and increased the fiber content of winter shoots the following winter. Contrary to our predictions, roe deer preferentially browsed control saplings over saplings previously browsed. After two years, repeated browsing promoted fast carbon acquisition leaf traits (high chlorophyll, high specific leaf area and low fiber content), reduced leaf phenolic content and increased leaf digestibility. We showed that a reduction in 1-year-old oak sapling height growth following browsing, combined with increased structural defense at the expense of chemical defense in winter shoots the following winter, was correlated with reduced browsing pressure, thereby challenging the feedback loop hypothesis. However, we also demonstrated that repeated browsing promoted fast carbon acquisition leaf traits in 2.5-year-old saplings, which tend to support the existence of a feedback loop on older and more intensively browsed saplings. As such, our study provides empirical evidence that morphological and physiological trait responses to browsing influence oak sapling attractiveness, but that the direction and magnitude of this effect depend on the ontogenic stage of the sapling and on the number of browsing events.

AB  - Uncertain chronology and data scarcity have impeded realistic reconstructions of megafauna extinctions in the Late Pleistocene in several key regions of the Northern Hemisphere such as Beringia. This region was a refuge for several plants, animals during the extremely cold period of the Late Pleistocene in high Arctic latitudes. The woolly rhinoceros was one of the most widespread members of the megafauna in the Asiatic part of the region (West Beringia) between similar to 60 and 14 cal ka BP. This study is based on statistical analyses of 20 newly obtained and 110 previously published radiocarbon dates. We found three large "waves" in the woolly rhinoceros range changes separated between themselves by the cold climatic Heinrich events (H2 and H4). The chronology of the woolly rhinoceros was overlaid on data of environmental changes obtained basing on 504 generalized early published pollen spectra throughout the species range and, separately, outside the range - in the east of the West Beringia realm and in East Beringia. In general, milder environmental conditions of MIS3 (57-29 ka BP) were more favourable for the woolly rhinoceros than the harsh conditions of the Last Glacial Maximum (similar to 29-15 cal ka BP) in MIS2. We have concluded that the feed base was unlikely the main limiting factor in the distribution of woolly rhinoceros in Western Beringia, and other ecological factors (temperature/precipitation) determined the species range and its oscillation over the MIS3-MIS2 stages. Based on summarizing available data and this research, we have proposed that there were sets of different reasons that prevented the woolly rhinoceros migration to the east of Beringia in different periods of the Late Pleistocene. Abrupt woolly rhinoceros extinction in Beringia between 15 and 14 cal ka BP coincided with the Bolling warming and the Older Dryas cooling. The ecological situation just before the extinction, associated with climate warming, moisture increasing and shrub tundra expansion in West Beringia, was qualitatively different from previous cases of the species range degradations in the second half of the Late Pleistocene. This multi-proxy study of woolly rhinoceros chronology provide a new basis for further understanding of its population history, demography, and biology in Beringia before its extinction.

AB  - Grass buffers are commonly planted along crop borders to filter nutrient and pesticide runoff. These buffers also provide food and shelter for beneficial and herbivorous arthropods and can serve as corridors for their movement into neighboring crops. Mowing is a common maintenance practice to control woody plants in these buffers. Field experiments were conducted to determine whether mowing influences the movement of arthropods into neighboring soybean plantings (Glycine max L) and impacts their abundance in corn (Zea mays var. indentata) the following spring. Results showed that mowing had varying effects on the abundance of herbivores, saprovores, parasitoids, and predators, particularly in the grass buffers. Aerially active arthropods in the plant canopy were more adversely affected by mowing than surface-dwelling arthropods. Mowing significantly reduced grasshopper (Orthoptera: Acrididae) density in the buffers, but did not trigger their movement into adjoining soybean fields. Parasitoids, predators, and thrips (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) were dissimilarly affected by mowing, and their responses were influenced by grass type. Altogether, these findings indicate that mowing did not cause notable movement of arthropods from grass buffers into adjoining crops and had minimal effects on the community of beneficial arthropods the following spring. Also, there were no differences in the level of insect feeding injury in crop fields next to mowed and unmowed buffers.

AB  - UAV technology has transformed spatial data collection and high-spatial resolution analysis of diverse environments around the world. Its role within geosciences, ecology, engineering, and other sciences has been increasing withing the last decade. In ecological and geomorphological aspects, it offers a powerful tool for studying landforms, surface processes, vegetation, and animal behavior globally. Our study employs high-resolution UAV surveys to analyze Tapirus bairdii trail networks and their connection to the landscape in a Costa Rican highland paramo-forest national park. Using a DJI Phantom 4 V.2 UAV, we conducted a photogrammetric flight over 3.19 ha, producing datasets with a spatial resolution of 2.99 cm/pixel. These datasets facilitated geostatistical analysis of Tapirus bairdii trails, revealing their complexity and hotspots near lagoons. We investigated lagoon characteristics, finding that finer sediments spatially correspond with higher trail activity. This suggests that sediment types in lagoons influence Tapirus bairdii navigation, impacting trail network composition. Our findings highlight UAV technology's role in advancing ecological and geomorphological research in protected areas, providing insights into Tapirus bairdii behavior within highland ecosystems. Overall, to the date this is the first high-resolution UAV survey of Tapirus bairdii within these types of highland tropical environments.

AB  - Invasive wild pigs (Sus scrofa) are considered one of the most damaging species globally, and once they become established in an area, they are notoriously difficult to eliminate. As such, identifying the potential pathways of invasion, especially in places with emerging populations, is critical for preventing new or continued invasion. Wild pigs have been reported in Ontario, Canada, in recent years. We tested four nonexclusive hypotheses about the source of wild pigs in Ontario: (a) escapees from captive sources within Ontario; (b) invasion from neighboring jurisdictions; (c) existing wild populations within Ontario; and (d) translocation and illegal release. We found that sightings of Eurasian wild boar were closer to premises with wild boar than were random locations; wild boar sightings were an average of 16.3 km (SD = 25.4 km, min = 0.2 km, n = 20) from premises with wild boar. We also found that sightings of domestic pigs were closer to domestic pig farms than expected. Sightings of wild pigs in groups of more than four animals were rare. Our results suggest that wild pigs observed in Ontario are recent escapes from captivity, recognizing that there may be established groups of wild pigs that we have not yet detected. While not common, we also received reports indicating that in the past, wild pigs have been translocated and illegally released. Other North American jurisdictions that have been successful at eliminating wild pigs have removed existing populations and changed regulations to limit future invasion, such as prohibiting possession and transport of wild boar and prohibiting hunting of wild pigs.

AB  - Understanding the dynamics between native and invasive species in aquatic ecosystems is crucial for effective conservation and management. This study investigates the diet composition and niche overlap of the native paradise fish (Pseudosphromenus dayi) and the introduced three-spot gourami (Trichopodus trichopterus) in a coastal wetland in Kerala, India. Through a comprehensive diet analysis, the study aims to reveal trophic dynamics and potential competition between these coexisting species. A substantial diet overlap of 0.73 indicates significant resource sharing, particularly in detritus, plant matter, Chlorophyta, insect remains, Cyanophyta, and Crustacea, highlighting a pronounced interaction between the paradise fish and three-spot gourami. Abundant resources in the wetland likely alleviate interspecific competition, facilitating the coexistence of both species. The presence of microplastics in the gut of both species signals increased human intervention and plastic pollution in the watershed and wetland. These findings underscore the importance of considering dietary preferences and ecological behaviours in assessing interactions between native and invasive species. Effective management strategies are crucial to mitigate potential competition and maintain the ecological integrity of wetland habitats. Continuous monitoring of invasive freshwater fishes is recommended for early detection and the implementation of management plans to address potential threats.

AB  - Increases in sea surface temperature impact animal metabolism, which in turn could influence benthic structure and resulting algal-coral balance. We utilized a long-term coral reef dataset from the west coast of Hawai'i Island to investigate impacts of annual positive and negative sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTA) on benthic cover [algal turf, macroalgae, crustose coralline algae (CCA), and coral], herbivore density (sea urchins, grazers, browsers, and scrapers) and the relationship between benthic cover and herbivore density. Results showed significantly lower coral cover, but higher CCA cover with positive SSTA. Additionally, the density of sea urchins, grazers and browsers increased with increasing SSTA. Warming disrupted the normal relationship between herbivores and benthic cover on reefs, particularly for grazers where higher densities were coupled with lower algal turf cover only during negative SSTA. The direction of the relationship between benthic cover and herbivore type changed with positive SSTA, where increased algal turf cover was associated with increased herbivore density. Here, herbivores are likely responding accordingly to increases in food availability due to increased metabolism under warming. Despite herbivore populations increasing in density over the past two decades, algal turf cover remains on an upward trajectory. These results indicate that warming can alter herbivore-algal dynamics, where greater herbivore densities may be required to cause a reduction in algal turf cover. Protection of herbivores in addition to reducing nutrient input onto reefs will be essential in driving a reduction in algal turf cover on Hawaiian reefs.

AB  - Among the possible impacts of plant invaders on South African biodiversity, water supplies, and rangeland production, Lantana camara is ranked the highest in terms of its environmental impact. Globally, L. camara is regarded as one of the most ecologically and economically destructive invasive alien plants. The spread of L. camara affects the environment and threatens livestock productivity due to its toxicity to animals (especial cattle and sheep) in most semi-arid areas of South Africa. Lantana camara is known to have high concentrations of nutrients that are beneficial to livestock, but most previous research has concentrated on its toxicity. To enrich our knowledge on its nutritive value, further research has to evaluate its dietary impact on the growth and health of different ruminant livestock species, particularly goats. This review evaluates L. camara as a potential browse species for goats in southern Africa, and its adverse effects on goats and other ruminant livestock are also presented. The review describes L. camara and its distribution globally, its poisonous effect to livestock, and potential use as an alternative forage to browsing animals such as goats, which have proved resistant to its harmful traits. The high crude protein content, low fibre and adequate macro-minerals for small ruminants makes L. camara a good ruminant protein supplement in semi-arid areas. In addition to other biological control strategies, the prospects of using goats as a biological management tool is discussed. The research will contribute to the understanding of the control measures of L. camara while improving the productivity of small stock, especially goats. This means that a balanced understanding of its nutritional value as a source of protein and its negative impact on the environment should be considered in developing mitigation strategies to arrest its spread. We, therefore, recommend the use of goats in the control of L. camara; however, further studies are needed to limit its toxic effects, and thus improve its value.

AB  - AimAbundant species distribution models (SDMs) of deep-sea corals and sponges (DSCS) allow one to make community-level predictions about DSCS. Pairing that with the conservation information of Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems (VMEs) due to their sensitivity to seafloor trawling, one can assess the efficacy of established seafloor protections, known as Essential Fish Habitat and Conservation Areas (trawl closure areas), in the United States West Coast on a multi-taxon basis. From this, we seek to answer the following questions: (1) can accurate multi-taxon, trawl-sensitive DSCS distribution predictions be made for the US West Coast and (2) to what extent do current trawl protections overlap with multi-taxon distribution predictions and what are the conservation and management implications?LocationUnited States West Coast marine waters.MethodsA cluster analysis was run on 40 SDMs of DSCS, identifiable as VME indicators and assigned a VME indicator score based on criteria used by regional fisheries management organisations. SDMs of taxa in clusters were stacked and averaged to produce stacked SDM (S-SDM) prediction maps. All prediction maps were classified into five habitat suitability classes to facilitate interpretation. The total area within benthic ecoregion-bathymetric boundaries and the percentage overlap with the bottom trawl closure zone were computed for spatial contextualization and to determine protection coverage for S-SDMs, respectively.ResultsCluster analysis identified 10 groups that represent unique S-SDMs for the region. Taxa clustered together have previously been documented together in surveys but some novel associations are reported. Geographically, the predicted occurrences can range along the entire western continental margin, be highly restricted, or constrained by recognised biogeographic boundaries. VME indicator metrics ranged from low to moderate. When trawl coverage was computed relative to the suitability's prevalence in the modelling domain, trawl protection was shown to be large for the highest suitability classes for most of the S-SDMs.Main ConclusionsResults indicate the clustering approach has some strengths in identifying known and documented associations between DSCS taxa but some are problematic and produce low to moderate VME indicator scores for S-SDMs, undercutting the conservation information the metric should convey. Coupled with the small predicted areas of the highest suitability classes, the wholesale recommendation for this approach for management purposes is difficult. We discuss avenues for methodological improvements.

AB  - Climate change may diminish biodiversity; thus, it is urgent to predict how species' ranges may shift in the future by integrating multiple factors involving more taxa. Bats are particularly sensitive to climate change due to their high surface-to-volume ratio. However, few studies have considered geographic variables associated with roost availability and even fewer have linked the distributions of bats to their thermoregulation and energy regulation traits. We used species distribution models to predict the potential distributions of 12 bat species in China under current and future greenhouse gas emission scenarios (SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5) and examined factors that could affect species' range shifts, including climatic, geographic, habitat, and human activity variables and wing surface-to-mass ratio (S-MR). The results suggest that Ia io, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, and Rhinolophus rex should be given the highest priority for conservation in future climate conservation strategies. Most species were predicted to move northward, except for I. io and R. rex, which moved southward. Temperature seasonality, distance to forest, and distance to karst or cave were the main environmental factors affecting the potential distributions of bats. We found significant relationships between S-MR and geographic distribution, current potential distribution, and future potential distribution in the 2050s. Our work highlights the importance of analyzing range shifts of species with multifactorial approaches, especially for species traits related to thermoregulation and energy regulation, to provide targeted conservation strategies.

AB  - Social hierarchies are often found in group-living animals. The hierarchy position can influence reproductive success (RS), with a skew towards high-ranking individuals. The amount of aggression in social dominance varies greatly, both between species and between males and females within species. Using game theory we study this variation by taking into account the degree to which reproductive competition in a social group is mainly local to the group, emphasizing within-group relative RS, or global to a larger population, emphasizing an individual's absolute RS. Our model is similar to recent approaches in that reinforcement learning is used as a behavioural mechanism allowing social-hierarchy formation. We test two hypotheses. The first is that local competition should favour the evolution of mating or foraging interference, and thus of reproductive skew. Second, decreases in reproductive output caused by an individual's accumulated fighting damage, such as reduced parenting ability, will favour less intense aggression but should have little influence on reproductive skew. From individual-based simulations of the evolution of social dominance and interference, we find support for both hypotheses. We discuss to what extent our results can explain observed sex differences in reproductive skew and social dominance behaviour.

AB  - With climate change projected to increase the frequency and severity of episodic insect outbreak events, assessing potential consequences for soil microbial communities and nutrient dynamics is of importance for understanding forest resilience. The forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria) is an important defoliator of deciduous tree species in temperate and mixed forests of eastern North America with an invasion cycle every 10-12 years and outbreak events that can last 3-6 years. Following a defoliation episode on trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) from 2015 to 2017 in Abitibi-Temiscamingue, QC, Canada, we sought to test if defoliation resulted in changes to soil bacterial and fungal communities. We hypothesized an increase in soil microbial biomass due to increased caterpillar frass inputs and potential changes in community structure following the event. Soils were sampled in August 2018, May 2019 and July 2019 from sites that had been subjected to defoliation during the outbreak and from sites where no defoliation had been recorded. We assessed soil microbial biomass and fungal to total microbial activity ratio on all sampling dates, and Community Level Physiological Profiles (CLPPs) for 2018 only using a substrate-induced respiration method. Contrary to our hypothesis, we observed a significant 50% decrease in microbial biomass (mu g biomass-C g(-1) soil hour(-1)) in defoliated stands, suggesting tree carbon normally allocated towards root exudates was reallocated towards foliage regeneration. We noted a differentiated carbon-based substrate usage following defoliation, but no change in the fungal to total microbial activity ratio. The observed changes in the two years following the defoliation event suggest that defoliation episodes above-ground could trigger changes in soil chemistry below-ground with effects on soil microbial communities that may, in turn, feedback to influence forest plant dynamics.

AB  - Background: The aim of the present study was to measure the effect of forest islands and landscape features on wild boar distribution. To this end, a number of features were identified in both, the interior and the surrounding area of forest islands and wild boars use of agricultural space was measured using the pellet group method, in which wild boar feces were counted along 60 km of transects. Results: The use of agricultural areas by wild boars close to forest islands was influenced by the characteristics of the forest island interiors, including their length, the cover conditions, and the main tree species, which were pine, spruce, and alder. The use of agricultural areas far from the forest islands was influenced by stand age (negatively) and forest island width (positively). The intensity of agricultural area use was also influenced by the characteristics of the forest island surroundings, including the type of agricultural crop (rapeseed and cereals), the presence of other forest islands, and the presence of large forest patches, all of which were important factors. Conclusion: Knowledge of the characteristics of the interior of the forest islands as well as their surroundings that determine the use of the agricultural areas by wild boars can be utilized to select sites for intensifying hunting pressure or taking other actions to prevent damages to crops. This can lead to an increase in the effectiveness of wild boar population control and to a reduction in conflict between this species and humans.

AB  - Duikers (Cephalophinae, Bovidae) are a group of forest mammals playing crucial roles in forest ecosystems either as prey or as seed dispersers. However, their taxonomy and phylogenetic relationships are still debated, and geo-referenced samples are rare. We collected 17 fecal samples of duikers in Kahuzi-Biega National Park in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, which is part of the Eastern Afromontane Biodiversity hotspot. To identify the species, evaluate the intra-specific genetic variation, and the phylogenetic relationships to other duiker species we used the mitochondrial cytochrome b and control region sequences and compared them with published sequences of 19 species of duikers. In addition, we collected camera-trap images and skull measurements of duikers living in this area. Our results showed that some of the collected samples could not be taxonomically assigned to any other duiker species available on public databases but indeed formed a monophyletic group within the east African red duikers. The camera trap images and morphometric analysis provisionally identify them as black-fronted duikers (C. nigrifrons), presumably the subspecies C. nigrifrons kivuensis Lonnberg, 1919 that was described from the Kivu-Region 100 years ago. This preliminary study shows that this subspecies should be raised to species rank based on molecular data, and stresses that further surveys and phylogenetic studies of east African red duikers are needed for understanding the diversity and evolution of these elusive species.

AB  - Do freshwater ecosystems and their charismatic species attract sufficient public attention in global biodiversity conservation efforts? In this study, we analyzed web-based public interest, news reports, and academic research concerning freshwater cetaceans and their respective river basins. We compared these findings with those of other endangered flagship species (six species selected globally and three nationally in China) inhabiting terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Our results indicated that public interest in freshwater cetaceans remained stable over the past two decades, contributing 7% to the awareness of the basins they inhabit. Although the number of news reports and academic research on freshwater cetaceans increased significantly, by 705 and 52 respectively, the growth rate was notably slower compared to that of other endangered flagship species inhabiting terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Regions with higher attention to freshwater cetaceans were typically economically developed areas. Even in China where the freshwater cetacean conservation has recently achieved significant success, insufficient attention and local interest towards freshwater cetaceans were still underscored. Correlation analysis revealed that current news coverage and academic research were not effectively raising public interest in freshwater cetaceans. We strongly recommend launching nature education campaigns to enhance local awareness and interest in freshwater cetacean conservation, drawing insights from successful conservation efforts in other ecosystems. Effective collaboration between media and scientific agencies is essential to bridge the 'knowing-doing' gap, ensuring the dissemination of scientific findings to the public and academic institutions.

AB  - Considering regional impacts on downstream communities and ecosystems is challenging in impact assessments. We suggest that environmental and cultural flows have the potential to be applied to protect water more comprehensively in assessment but are currently underutilized. Environmental and cultural flows refer to adequate water quantity and quality for the environment and Indigenous rights. Through interviews and a scoping review of legislation and assessments, we address how these concepts are and could be embedded within Canadian impact assessments. To date, environmental flows have been considered in assessments involving dams, oil and gas, and mining, and the focus has been on fish and habitat, rather than Indigenous rights and cumulative withdrawals. We propose Regional Readiness through water councils, change, and consensus (three Cs) to prepare watershed actors to protect environment and cultural flows in impact assessments. The three Cs are: (1) Advisory councils dedicated to creating regional objectives and rules for ecosystem and rights-based needs, (2) Assessing hydrologic and water quality change with regional data and relationships to water, and (3) Building consensus on the cultural and ecological significance and sensitivity of water bodies. Development of this framework follows examples from Canadian water-related assessments and initiatives: Wolastoq Ecological Limits of Hydrological Alteration, Athabasca Chipewyan and Mikisew Cree assessments, Yinka Dene Water Management Policy, Grand Council Treaty #3 Nibi Declaration, Slave Watershed Environmental Effects Program, and Strategic Assessment of Wood Buffalo National Park. These cases demonstrate how the inclusion of environmental and cultural flows processes in assessment could enable greater water protection.

AB  - Background. The risk of large, severe bushfires is increasing in Australia, and little is known about their impact on threatened species. Aims. This study aimed to investigated the abundance, occupancy and metapopulation structure of the quokka (Setonix brachyurus) for 5 years following a large, severe bushfire in Western Australia. Methods. Data collected across spatiotemporally replicated transects were used to estimate probabilities of occupancy and abundance, and to evaluate the influence of covariates. Key results. Quokka abundance was reduced to 16% of pre-fire levels, with distances up to 74 km separating subpopulations. Recolonising quokkas occupied habitat in parts of the landscape that had retained some vertical vegetation structure and contained a sedge-dominated understorey, and where damage by feral pigs was low. This coincided with topographic refugia that consisted of deep, mesic riparian systems or perched wetland systems. After 5 years, abundance had increased to 46% of pre-fire levels, with distances of 5-30 km separating subpopulations. Conclusion. Quokka recovery rate is slower than expected, and the metapopulation remains vulnerable to further fragmentation arising from disturbances that affect habitat patch suitability and movement corridors. Implications. Proactive protection of refugia and spatiotemporal habitat connectivity within and surrounding the fire scar is critical for metapopulation recovery.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to compare quality, macro, and micro constituents of milk between Talesh buffalo, Talesh sheep, Talesh cow, Talesh-Mediterranean buffalo, Talesh goat and Saanen goat. Milk samples were collected during 2021. The main characteristics and constituents of milk including colour, odour, taste, freezing point, dry matter free of fat, acidity (lactic acid), density (in 15 & DEG;C), pH, fat and protein were determined according to the standard methods. Macro and micro elements of milk were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Data were subjected to the two-way ANOVA analysis to determine the significant differences between species/breeds. The acidity, density and fat in Talesh sheep's milk was higher than milk from other species/breeds (P<0.01). Also, the amount of protein in Talesh sheep's milk was significantly higher (P<0.05) than all animals tested with the exception of Talesh buffalo milk. The pH of Saanen goat's milk was higher than the pH of milk from all other species/ breeds (P<0.01), whereas the pH of milk from Talesh-Mediterranean buffalos was lowest (P<0.01). Talesh sheep's milk had the lowest freezing temperature (P<0.01). The results of the present study also demonstrated significant differences among species for most macro and micro elements including Al, Ba, Ca, Co, Cs, Fe, In, La, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, P, Pd, Pt, Re, Rn, S, Sc, Sr, Se, Ta, B, Li, and Zn (P<0.01). Significant differences were observed for As, Ce, He, Ir, Nb, Sb and Th in sheep's milk (P<0.05), and K and Rb (P<0.05) in Talesh goat's milk compared with other species/breeds. In conclusion, buffalo milk is richer in most nutrients compared with cow's and goat's milk and should perhaps be considered a stronger candidate to meet human nutritional needs in regions of the world where they can be properly managed.

AB  - When restoring degraded landscapes, approaches capable of striking a balance between improving environmental services and enhancing human wellbeing need to be considered. Agroforestry is an important option for restoring degraded land and associated ecosystem functions. Using survey, key informant interview and rapid carbon stock appraisal (RaCSA) methods, this study was conducted in five districts in West Java province to examine potential carbon stock in agroforestry systems practiced by smallholder farmers on degraded landscapes. Six agroforestry systems with differing carbon stocks were identified: gmelina (Gmelina arborea Roxb.) + cardamom (Amomum compactum); manglid (Magnolia champaca (L.) Baill. ex Pierre) + cardamom; caddam (Neolamarckiacadamba (Roxb.) Bosser) + cardamom; caddam + elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum Schumach.); mixed-tree + fishpond; and mixed-tree lots. Compared to other systems, mixed-tree lots had the highest carbon stock at 108.9 Mg ha(-1). Carbon stock variations related to species density and diversity. Farmers from research sites said these systems also prevent soil erosion and help to restore degraded land. Farmers' adoption of agroforestry can be enhanced by the implementation of supportive policies and measures, backed by scientific research.

AB  - The epiphytic and endophytic bacteria play an important role in the healthy growth of plants. Both plant species and growth environmental influence the bacterial population diversity, yet it is inconclusive whether it is the former or the latter that has a greater impact. To explore the communities of the epiphytic and endophytic microbes in Camellia oleifera, this study assessed three representative C. oleifera cultivars from three areas in Hunan, China by Illumina high-throughput sequencing. The results showed that the diversity and species richness of endophytic microbial community in leaves were significantly higher than those of microbial community in the epiphytic. The diversity and species richness of epiphytic and endophytic microbes are complex when the same cultivar was grown in different areas. The C. oleifera cultivars grown in Youxian had the highest diversity of epiphytic microbial community, but the lowest abundance, while the cultivars grown in Changsha had the highest diversity and species richness of endophytic microbes in leaves. It was concluded that the dominant phylum mainly included Proteobacteria, Actinobacteriota and Firmicutes through the analysis of the epiphytic and endophytic microbial communities of C. oleifera. The species and relative abundances of epiphytic and endophytic microbial community were extremely different at the genus level. The analysis of NMDS map and PERMANOVA shows that the species richness and diversity of microbial communities in epiphytes are greatly influenced by region. However, the community structure of endophytic microorganisms in leaves is influenced by region and cultivated varieties, but the influence of cultivars is more significant. Molecular ecological network analysis showed that the symbiotic interaction of epiphytic microbial community was more complex.

AB  - Land use intensification is known to imperil biodiversity and ecosystem stability, while the effects of land use conversion on the stability of multiple trophic levels at multiple spatial scales, particularly the linkages between plant diversity and the temporal stability of biomass at high trophic levels, remain to be elucidated. We conducted a 4-year field investigation to quantify the temporal stability of biomass for plants and herbivory, predatory, and omnivorous beetles at the species (population stability), community (alpha stability), and among communities (gamma stability) levels as natural grasslands convert to managed grasslands. We found local communities in natural grasslands exhibited greater asynchronous dynamics among species due to high plant diversity, but exhibited more stable population dynamics in managed grasslands, resulting in similar alpha stability and then gamma stability along the land use intensification gradients. Land use conversion decreased the alpha and gamma stability of predators by decreasing asynchronous dynamics among species and communities, respectively, and then decreased beetle alpha and gamma stability. Importantly, our results revealed that plant diversity enhanced the temporal stability of biomass at higher trophic level through the biodiversity cascading effects among trophic levels, but these effects were weakened as natural grasslands convert to managed grasslands. Our findings demonstrate that the negative effects of land use change on temporal stability relies on trophic levels but not spatial scales, and highlight that land use intensification decouples the links between plant diversity and the stability of biomass at higher trophic levels.

AB  - Minerals are important nutrients and are essential components of the diets of animals. Nutritional requirements or minimum concentrations of minerals for nutritional health are largely unknown for the majority of large, free-ranging herbivores. We investigated concentrations of 9 trace minerals in mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) inhabiting 3 distinct geographic areas-Cima Dome, New York Mountains, and the Mid Hills-in the eastern Mojave Desert, San Bernardino Co., California from 2008 to 2016. These areas differed in vegetative communities, topography, water availability, and fire histories. Telemetered mule deer demonstrated high fidelity to each of these areas, and movement by those individuals between study areas was not detected. During our investigation, overall differences occurred in mean concentrations of magnesium (P < 0.001), calcium (P = 0.022), phosphorus (P = 0.023), potassium (P = 0.042), and selenium (P < 0.001) among the 3 geographic areas. Among years, differences occurred in concentrations of the trace elements investigated in the New York Mountains with the exceptions of magnesium and potassium; at Cima Dome with the exceptions of iron, sodium, potassium, and selenium; and in the Mid Hills with the exceptions of magnesium and zinc. A positive upward trend existed between selenium concentration in the New York Mountains and the year of sample collection (P < 0.05), and a similar-albeit not significant-upward trend was discernible in the Mid Hills, but no such relationship was apparent at Cima Dome. These results emphasize the importance of investigating micronutrient status of mule deer on a local scale and temporally and add to the sparse information available on trace mineral concentrations in mule deer. Despite limited samples (<= 165), we make available for the first time reference values for mule deer inhabiting the Mojave Desert, to serve as a baseline against which to measure responses to future environmental perturbations or for comparison with deer occupying other disparate ecosystems, and further contribute to the derivation of reference values for mule deer in general.

AB  - Understanding the mechanism by which non-native fish species integrate into native communities is crucial for evaluating the possibility of their establishment success. The genus Pangasianodon, comprising Pangasianodon gigas and Pangasianodon hypophthalmus, has been introduced into reservoirs, which are non-native habitats, for fishery stock enhancement. P. gigas and P. hypophthalmus often successfully establish and co-occur in several Thai reservoirs, but there is little information on differences in food resource use between the two species. To investigate the trophic niche width of P. gigas and P. hypophthalmus in a Thai reservoir, we conducted stable carbon and nitrogen ratio (delta C-13 and delta N-15) analyses. We examined the degree of individual specialization in both species using the delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of muscle and liver tissues, which provides long- and short-term diet information. The isotopic niches did not overlap between P. gigas and P. hypophthalmus. The delta N-15 value of P. gigas was significantly higher than that of P. hypophthalmus, whereas the delta C-13 value did not significantly differ between the two species. The isotopic niche sizes were larger in P. hypophthalmus than in P. gigas. Individual specialization was observed in P. hypophthalmus but not in P. gigas, indicating that intraspecific variation in food resource use was larger in P. hypophthalmus compared to P. gigas. These findings suggest that trophic niche partitioning was one of the factors facilitating the establishment success of P. gigas and P. hypophthalmus in a reservoir, but the establishment process may differ between the two species.

AB  - Testing the extent to which ecological communities are structured by deterministic (niche-based) assembly processes, resulting in predictable species abundance and composition, is a fundamental goal of ecology. Here we use a 10-year dataset of 55,156 lianas comprising 86 species in an old-growth tropical forest in Panama to test whether community assembly is consistent with niche-based assembly processes. We find that species diversity and community composition was maintained because species conformed to four general requirements of coexistence theory: (1) species have negative conspecific frequency-dependent feedback that control their local population size; (2) species have a stronger negative effect on their own population than that of heterospecifics; (3) the equilibrium frequencies of species correspond to their relative abundance; and (4) species have positive invasibility. These results indicate that coexistence through deterministic niche-based processes controls local population sizes and prevents any one species from displacing others. Rare species persisted because particularly strong negative feedbacks maintained them at their relatively low equilibrium abundances, thus preventing them from going extinct. Furthermore, we show that it is necessary to use population demography to test coexistence theory because stem mortality alone does not reflect species demography. These findings have broad implications for species coexistence and diversity maintenance in tropical forests and possibly other ecosystems.

AB  - The Golden Eagle Aquila chrysaetos (hereafter GE) is one of Europe's largest avian top predators. The present study recognizes the habitat characteristics and food composition of the GE in Poland. The research was carried out in the Polish part of the Carpathian Mountains. The GEs built nests mainly on old coniferous trees and strongly preferred the Silver Fir Abies alba. On average, within a 5 km buffer around the nest, forests covered about 2/3 of the area, while open land with villages was at 31% and water was about 1%. Birds preferred areas with less forest cover than in the random points, but the nests were significantly further from the countryside than the distance measured for the drawn points distributed in the GEs' range in Poland. Their diet during the breeding season was assessed by analyzing pellets and food remains. The proportion of birds was 55.7%, mammals was 43.4%, and reptiles was 0.9%. The ten most common prey species included the Domestic Pigeon Columba livia, the Ural Owl Strix uralensis, the Tawny Owl Strix aluco, the Buzzard Buteo buteo, the Roe Deer Capreolus capreolus, the Martens Martes sp., and the Red Fox Vulpes vulpes, which composed 70% of food items. Our results showed that the GE is a top predator, as evidenced by the high share of other predators-both mammal and bird species-in its diet, which constituted about 34% of identified preys. The diet of the studied GE population showed geographical variation, suggesting local adaptations to available prey species. The share of Roe Deer increased from west to east, indicating a higher availability in the less urbanized eastern part of the country. An analysis of general food categories showed that, as latitude increased, the share of captured birds among prey of the GEs declined, while the percentage of forest prey increased. Pigeons were prey of the GEs mainly in the western part of their range. The GEs often captured species with nocturnal activity-owls and martens, which were identified in most of the GEs' territories. The proportion of mammals in the diet of the GE increased with an increase in the proportion of open areas, while the abundance of birds of prey and owls in the diet correlated with a higher proportion of forests. The greatest threat to Poland's GE population is the reduction in semi-open areas with low human activity and low human population densities.

AB  - Current theory holds that the intensity of biotic interactions decreases with increases in latitude and elevation; however, empirical data demonstrate great variation in the direction, strength, and shape of elevational changes in herbivory. The latitudinal position of mountains may be one important source of this variation, but the acute shortage of data from polar mountains hampers exploration of latitude effects on elevational changes in herbivory. Here, we reduce this knowledge gap by exploring six elevation gradients located in three Arctic mountain ranges to test the prediction that a decrease in herbivory occurs with increasing elevation from forest to alpine tundra. Across the 10 most abundant evergreen and deciduous woody plant species, relative losses of foliage to insect herbivores were 2.2-fold greater at the highest elevations (alpine tundra) than in mid-elevation birch woodlands or low-elevation coniferous forests. Plant quality for herbivores (quantified by specific leaf area) significantly decreased with elevation across all studied species, indicating that bottom-up factors were unlikely to shape the observed pattern in herbivory. An experiment with open-top chambers established at different elevations showed that even a slight increase in ambient temperature enhances herbivory in Arctic mountains. Therefore, we suggest that the discovered increase in herbivory with elevation is explained by higher temperatures at the soil surface in open habitats above the tree line compared with forests at lower elevations. This explanation is supported by the significant difference in elevational changes in herbivory between low and tall plants: herbivory on low shrubs increased fourfold from forest to alpine sites, while herbivory on trees and tall shrubs did not change with elevation. We suggest that an increase in herbivory with an increase in elevation is typical for high-latitude mountains, where inverse temperature gradients, especially at the soil surface, are common. Verification of this hypothesis requires further studies of elevational patterns in herbivory at high latitudes.

AB  - Indonesian coastal waters include several marine megafauna biodiversity hotspots. Several fish populations of ecological and socio-economic importance, such as elasmobranchs (sharks and rays), have experienced rapid decline due to unsustainable human activities, primarily overfishing. Small-scale fisheries (SSF) are currently exempt from governmental fisheries management measures despite contributing a significant proportion of a total catch. The Generalised Additive Models were used to investigate the effect of variations in oceanographic parameters of the Teluk Penyu fishing ground, south of central Java, on the magnitude of Mobulidae (Mobula spp.) catch based on its landings data over ten years (2009-2018) from one of Indonesia's largest ports, Cilacap, Central Java, Indonesia. Mobulidae catch from Teluk Penyu fishing ground was generally higher from June to November when the water exhibited relatively high sea surface salinity (sal >34.1 parts per thousand), chlorophyll (0.32-0.45 mg/m(3)), and nitrate (nit >0.0045 mg NO3/m(3)), water speed (>0.29 m/s) and eddy kinetic energy (>0.04 m(3)/s(2)) levels, and relatively low sea surface temperature (<28 degrees C), oxygen (<0.182 mg O-2/m(3)) and sea surface height (<0.9 m) levels than the other months of the year. This study reveals that satellite Earth Observation (EO) data provided a preliminary relationship between oceanographic conditions and the amount of catch for developing more effective management and conservation measures for endangered species like Mobulidae. Utilizing EO data may also be applied to help inform much-needed ecosystem-based management measures, including habitat protection and bycatch reduction for conserving endangered Mobulidae species in the Southeast Indian Ocean. The in-situ onboard ocean observation and temporal species-specific catch data will greatly complement the current work.

AB  - The re-introduction paradigm is that Arabian Oryx (Oryx leucoryx) herds adjust the size of their home ranges depending on the availability of vegetation, which is directly related to rainfall. In Israel, Arabian oryx were released in two hyper-arid sites: the Arava Valley and in the Paran wilderness, belonging to the Sudanese and the Saharo-Arabian biogeographic zones, respectively. While post-release survival was similar in both, reproductive success in the Paran wilderness reintroduction site was extremely low, resulting in an acute decline of the reintroduced population over time. The hypothesis that impaired nutrition might be associated with this finding was assessed with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)-aided chemistry of monthly sampled fecal pellets, used as remote sensing evidence of ingested diets, throughout a year. Fecal nitrogen (FN), used as an estimate of nutritional status, was consistently higher in the Arava. Grass was never the sole or even a major dietary component. The dietary contribution of tannin-rich browse was high and steady all year-round in the Arava and increased steadily in Paran from winter to summer, corresponding to the period of availability of Acacia raddiana pods in both regions. The oryx in Paran had a home-range that was ten-fold, compared to the Arava, suggesting less feed availability. Acacia browsing may mitigate the effects of temporal variance in primary production. Under such conditions, oryx should be preferably released in areas that support significant acacia stands.

AB  - Context. Understanding the diet of invasive species can inform the potential for their distribution into novel habitats. Fallow deer are well established in the grassy woodlands of central Tasmania, Australia, in environments generally considered to be their optimum habitat. They are also increasing their range. The potential range of fallow deer in Tasmania will depend on their ability to vary their diet to exploit new habitats. Diet flexibility will also determine the ecological impacts that fallow deer might have in novel habitats. Aims. We compared the diets of fallow deer in a lowland grassy woodland, where deer have been established for over 150 years, with diets of deer in highland woodlands and forest with less grass cover and higher rainfall, where deer have been established for a shorter time (<50 years). We expected that fallow deer in grassy woodlands would mainly eat grass and forbs, and we wanted to know to what extent the diet of deer differed between habitats. Methods A metagenomic analysis was performed on fallow deer faecal pellets collected at one lowland and three highland study areas. The method was chosen to maximise information on taxonomic composition of diet and identify plant species that might be affected by deer herbivory to the lowest possible taxonomic level. Key results. Fallow deer ate a wide variety of plant taxa. Diets varied among study areas. In the lowland study area, deer predominantly ate forbs and grasses. In the highland study area deer were more likely to browse on eucalypts and a variety of shrubs. Conclusions. Fallow deer in Tasmania have a broad dietary niche. Availability of specific plant taxa is unlikely to limit fallow deer expansion into most new habitats.Implications. Without stronger management strategies, deer are likely to further increase their range in Tasmania, including into areas with high conservation values. The potential impacts on these areas may be high.

AB  - Rangelands cover approximately one-third of the earth's land area, at least one billion people depend on these lands for their livelihoods, and most rangelands have been degraded by inappropriate land use practices. Overgrazing and suppression of fire have facilitated encroachment of woody plants in what formerly were more open grasslands. However, proper management of fire and grazing (pyric herbivory) can mitigate woody plant encroachment. Although the basic ecological dynamics of rangeland ecosystems are well known, the long-term effects on local vegetation dynamics of ranch-level management decisions, particularly those involving the use of prescribed fire to limit woody plant encroachment, are less well understood. As a proof of concept, we describe a spatially explicit agent-based model of pyric herbivory that integrates biophysical and managerial components to simulate shifts in canopy cover of woody plants, forage production, and cattle production resulting from ranchlevel management decisions to adjust grazing pressure and prescribed fire regimes. We followed the pattern-oriented modeling approach to evaluate the usefulness of our model in exploring the effects of different pyric herbivory management schemes on a hypothetical 4000-ha ranch in the semi-arid rangelands of the southern Great Plains of the USA. Model evaluation simulations generated the expected shifting landscape mosaics of woody plant canopy cover, forage biomass, and grazing pressure that typify pyric herbivory. The most noticeable trend emerging from model application simulations was the effect of the relative sensitivity of adaptive management rules to changing ranch conditions on the ecological condition (an index of potential forage productivity) of the ranch and on the sale weight of calves. At relatively lower stocking rates, there was a noticeable increase in both ecological condition and sale weight of calves as adaptive changes to stocking rates or burning thresholds decreased in sensitivity to changing ranch conditions. However, these trends were not noticeable at relatively higher stocking rates. These results, while ecologically interpretable, are not realistic within a real-world ranch management context and we do not intend for our model application simulations to serve as a basis for real-word management recommendations. Nonetheless, we suggest that these simulations provide a proof of concept regarding the usefulness of spatially explicit, agent-based models, which explicitly integrate biophysical and managerial system components, in exploring the management of pyric herbivory.

AB  - High herbivore abundances on trees surrounded by distantly related neighbors (phylogenetic isolation) might in part be due to local adaptation of herbivores to host trees, but this has not been tested. We studied if free-feeding and semi-concealed (shelter-building) Lepidoptera can be adapted to leaf traits of individual trees, and if this is affected by phylogenetic isolation. We performed a reciprocal transplant experiment on free-feeding and semi-concealed lepidopteran caterpillars collected from oak trees (Quercus petraea) in a mixed forest in Poland. Within a set of trees with early and a set with late budburst, we selected oak trees that varied from being surrounded by other oak trees (low phylogenetic isolation) to oaks surrounded by pine trees (high phylogenetic isolation), and collected canopy branches to obtain caterpillars. We then fed half of the caterpillars leaves from the tree they were collected from (home tree) and others on the leaves of another tree in the set (away trees) in the laboratory. We measured caterpillar mass over a five-day interval to calculate growth rate and determined aspects of leaf chemistry of each tree. Five species of Lepidoptera (Acrobasis repandana, Eudemis profundana, Operopthera brumata, Phycita roborella, Zeiraphera isertana) yielded sufficient sample sizes for statistical analyses. Overall, we found faster growth on home trees, which could be attributed to one species, E. profundana. There was no effect of phylogenetic isolation. Our results indicate that local adaptation to leaf traits of individual trees is rare in these lepidopterans, and we found no evidence that local adaptation would be more pronounced on trees that are more phylogenetically isolated from their neighbors. Therefore, the effects phylogenetic isolation on herbivory are not likely to be mediated by local adaptation to individual trees.

AB  - Human recreational activities increase the stress levels of wildlife and lead to changes in the use of space such as avoidance of disturbed areas. Hiking is one of the most popular outdoor activities that frequently impact wildlife, and the number of tourists on hiking trails is consistently increasing. Therefore, the question arises as to how the presence of people on trails affects the use of space by wildlife. We tested the hypothesis that large numbers of hikers during the tourist season will deter wildlife from approaching trails. We used a pellet-group counting method to investigate how the number of tourists affects the two most common deer species (red deer and roe deer) near hiking trails in the mountain forests of the Bieszczady Mountains in Poland. Data was collected near hiking trails and forest roads as a control in the winter off-season and in spring after the start of the tourist season. For both species, a significant influence was found based on time of year, type of trail, and distance to the trail. However, spatial use and avoidance of trails differed. Red deer avoided trails up to a distance of 50 m during tourist season, while roe deer strongly avoided trails in winter. We conclude that cervids avoid tourist trails and that some factors, such as the number of people per day on these trails, may increase avoidance. The results suggest that a further increase in hiking in the mountains could lead to increased avoidance and thus a reduction in suitable habitat for cervids in mountain forests. Our results may help forest owners and managers to identify zones of human impact and keep human traffic away from important wildlife habitats.

AB  - For centuries, humans have intentionally moved species around the world, and such actions have rarely been laudable from conservation perspectives. The notion that introduced populations of cold-adapted species hold conservation value despite their non-native status remains controversial. Many such populations exist as a legacy of humans moving wildlife to novel environments with little true consideration of species conservation. Herein, we identify cases in which individuals from inadvertent climate refugia (ICR) are returned to formerly occupied ranges or used to augment declining native populations. While conservation benefits have been infrequently realized, the global distribution of ICR offers a potentially untapped resource. Lessening biodiversity loss under increasing climate challenges will likely require assisted migration of many species and necessitate novel valuation of extant introduced populations-such as those within ICR. While ecological costs of translocated species are widely known, we highlight how species moved generations ago to ICR offer a reservoir for reintroductions and a buffer against rapidly changing climates.

AB  - Uncovering drivers of community assembly is a key aspect of learning how biological communities function. Drivers of community similarity can be especially useful in this task as they affect assemblage-level changes that lead to differences in species diversity between habitats. Concepts of beta-diversity originally developed for use in free-living communities have been widely applied to parasite communities to gain insight into how infection risk changes with local conditions by comparing parasite communities across abiotic and biotic gradients. Factors shaping beta-diversity in communities of immature parasites, such as larvae, are largely unknown. This is a key knowledge gap as larvae are frequently the infective life-stage and understanding variation in these larval communities is thus key for disease prevention. Our goal was to uncover links between beta-diversity of parasite communities at different life stages; therefore, we used gastrointestinal nematodes infecting African buffalo in Kruger National Park, South Africa, to investigate within-host and extra-host drivers of adult and larval parasite community similarity. We employed a cross-sectional approach using PERMANOVA that examined each worm community at a single time point to assess independent drivers of beta-diversity in larvae and adults as well as a longitudinal approach with path analysis where adult and larval communities from the same host were compared to better link drivers of beta-diversity between these two life stages. Using the cross-sectional approach, we generally found that intrinsic, within-host traits had significant effects on beta-diversity of adult nematode communities, while extrinsic, extra-host variables had significant effects on beta-diversity of larval nematode communities. However, the longitudinal approach provided evidence that intrinsic, within-host factors affected the larval community indirectly via the adult community. Our results provide key data for the comparison of community-level processes where adult and immature stages inhabit vastly different habitats (i.e. within-host vs. abiotic environment). In the context of parasitism, this helps elucidate host infection risk via larval stages and the drivers that shape persistence of adult parasite assemblages, both of which are useful for predicting and preventing infectious disease.

AB  - The Canton of Geneva is currently working on defining and mapping its green infrastructure (GI), in order to implement its biodiversity protection directives by 2030. Ecological connectivity is considered in the definition of the GI, as it is a key factor in managing the species extinction risk. It is considered a vital aspect of the landscape, because it can indicate how landscape facilitates or influences wildlife movement. In order to assess connectivity, animal movement data is essential as it provides precise behavioral information on the movements of organisms. Unfortunately, this kind of data is often missing or available only at local scales. Ecologists therefore must deal with a lack of data when trying to supply useful spatially explicit ecological models for conservation planning. To help managers in their efforts to define the GI, an alternative is to rely on local expert knowledge. We have thus applied a structured analytical framework to parameterize an ecological connectivity model combining expert opinion with three of the most used methods to assess ecological connectivity: graph theory, circuit theory and cumulative costs algorithm. By considering a selection of focal species representative of the different ecological requirements and movement behaviour of the regional wildlife, maps of priority areas for the promotion of ecological connectivity were obtained for red deer, roe deer, brown hare and common toad. We estimated the principal cross-border corridors at the scale of the Greater Geneva region, between France and Switzerland. Three transboundary high priority areas were highlighted in our maps. The localization of these areas is principally characterized by natural habitats such as forests, grasslands and freshwater ecosystems, but depends also on the agricultural areas. The principal natural barrier to animal movement is Lake Geneva, and the principal human barriers to movement are human settlements and highways that impede the regional displacements for all of the species. Considering the highways, the barrier effect could be diminished thanks to the recent construction of wildlife overpasses. We have seen that a close collaboration between local experts and ecological modelers is necessary when interpreting the conservation value of land potentially capable of promoting wildlife ecological connectivity. When implementing the GI, it will be useful to combine our models with field campaigns to measure the real functionality of the estimated priority areas, in order to guarantee the success of conservation actions.

AB  - Balancing development and conservation is one of the major challenges for modern societies. Negative human-wildlife interactions, especially crop raiding by wildlife, greatly undermine this objective. Jilin Province in Northeast China encompasses ecosystems of high biodiversity value but endures serious losses in crop yields due to wild boars (Sus scrofa). Mitigation measures have been hindered by knowledge gaps in wild boar damage patterns. Our objective was to investigate how wild boar damage responded to human-dominated landscapes, evaluating landscape patterns of damage at multiple ecological scales, thus providing a provincial map of damage risk to assist with damage mitigation. We used 1,144 coordinates of wild boar damage from 2009 to 2013 to train multi-scale risk models with the maximum entropy algorithm. Damage risk was highest on gentle slopes and in heterogenous landscapes composed of fragmented plantations and cropland, with high edge density among small discontinuous patches, and with dense settlements in countryside areas with sporadic road networks. Scale had a substantial effect on relationships between damage and landscapes. We recommend mitigating the conflict risk by improving the compensation system and reducing the damage frequency through repelling, electric fencing, and dissuasive feeding.

AB  - Global temperatures are increasing, affecting timing and availability of vegetation along with relationships between plants and their consumers. We examined the effect of population density, herd body condition in the previous year, elevation, plant productivity and phenology, snow, and winter onset on juvenile body mass in 63 semi-domesticated populations of Rangifer tarandus throughout Norway using spatiotemporal generalized additive models (GAMs) and varying coefficient models (VCMs). Optimal climate windows were calculated at both the regional and national level using a novel nonlinear climate window algorithm optimized for prediction. Spatial and temporal variation in effects of population and environmental predictors were considered using a model including covariates decomposed into spatial, temporal, and residual components. The performance of this decomposed model was compared to spatiotemporal GAMs and VCMs. The decomposed model provided the best fit and lowest prediction errors. A positive effect of herd body condition in the previous year explained most of the deviance in calf body mass, followed by a more complex effect of population density. A negative effect of timing of spring and positive effect of winter onset on juvenile body mass suggested that a snow free season was positive for juvenile body mass growth. Our findings suggest early spring onset and later winter permanent snow cover as reinforcers of early-life conditions which support more robust reindeer populations. Our methodological improvements for climate window analyses and effect size measures for decomposed variables provide important contributions to account for, measure, and interpret nonlinear relationships between climate and animal populations at large scales.

AB  - Establishing advance oak reproduction in the understory of mature oak forests before an overstory removal is critical to regenerate mixed-oak forests (Quercus spp.). Many studies have been conducted at the stand scale; however, studies at landscape scale can be particularly useful to guide silvicultural management investments. We developed a model of advance reproduction abundance at landscape scale using inventory, climate, topography, and soils data from ninety-seven mixed-oak forests located in Pennsylvania, USA. A negative binomial model was used to predict the abundance of oak seedlings between 15.2 and 91.4 cm in height and with a root collar diameter of 0.64 to 1.9 cm (established oak seedlings). This model had a Nagelkerke's pseudo R-2 of 58%. Deviance partitioning methods indicate that climate and overstory influence explain similar proportions of total deviance, but climate contributes a higher proportion of nonoverlapping information (22% versus 18%). Overstory basal area of two common oak species were positively associated with seedling abundance, whereas biotic stressors were negatively correlated. Biotic stressors showed considerable overlap with information provided by climate and overstory influences. The results of this study provide a reference to guide silvicultural management at a landscape scale. Study Implications: We model advance oak reproduction abundance from inventory, climate, topography, and soils data from ninety-seven mixed-oak forests located in Pennsylvania, USA, and quantify the relative contribution of each component at a landscape scale. Our study found that at this scale, climate and overstory characteristics explain similar proportions of total deviance in the models whereas biotic stressors, such as deer impact and vegetation interference, showed considerable overlap with information provided by climate and overstory influences. This suggests that climate and overstory characteristics could be used to guide or prioritize investments in silvicultural treatments at a large scale.

AB  - Land use changes occurring during the last decades have caused new challenges in forest management of Mediterranean ecosystems, such as overpopulation of wild ungulates. This is causing serious impacts on forest regeneration, particularly increased seedling mortality of dominant tree species. This study aims to unravel whether oak seedlings could be facilitated by non-palatable shrubs under herbivory and drought stress to improve assisted oak regeneration. For this purpose, we planted one- and two-year-old seedlings of an evergreen oak (Quercus ilex L.) in a Mediterranean open shrubland, considering three factors: herbivore exposure (with or without herbivores), seedling age (one- vs. two-year-old seedlings), and shrub cover (seedlings planted under non-palatable shrubs Cistus ladanifer or in open microsites). We evaluated seedling survival and performance monthly along the growing season (February-September), and measured physiological traits in May, just prior to the drought season. Our results revealed that herbivores, mostly wild boar (Sus scrofa), were the main cause of mortality from February to late May, while drought was responsible of mortality from early June to September. Almost all seedlings died within the first year of plantation after a severe long summer. Leaf predawn water potential and leaf stomatal conductance of one-year-old seedlings were lower under shrubs than in open microsites, a negative effect of shrubs that was not evident in the two-year-old seedlings. Plant photosynthetic performance of two-year old seedlings was higher under shrubs than in open microsites. Interestingly, the net effect of shrubs as facilitators (measured monthly through chlorophyll content) was greater in areas with no herbivores, probably due to the strong difference in herbaceous plant cover between open areas and under shrubs. Our results suggest that facilitation of Q. ilex seedlings by C. ladanifer shrub is weak under herbivory pressure and strongly depends on seedling age as shrubs seem to mostly compete for water with one-year-old seedlings and alleviate photoinhibition in two-year-old seedlings. This study reveals the possible use of twoyear-old seedlings under very specific conditions, but some important inconveniences may arise as they are more stressed in the open microsites (ungulate induced mortality was similar for one and two-year old oak seedlings) and require more resources (e.g., time, energy and water) before plantation than one-year-old seedlings. We conclude that the age of plant material must be taken into account when planning oak restoration practices that can potentially benefit from the facilitative effects of shrubs under moderate biotic and abiotic stress.

AB  - Winter annual plants play an important role in arid and semiarid ecosystems because of their rapid response to resource pulses, which drive primary production that provides resources for herbivores and pollinators. Understanding the factors that control annual plant growth is key to predicting how arid and semiarid ecosystems will respond to changes in climate and resource availability from anthropogenic activities. We used a long-term nutrient enrichment experiment that spanned precipitation and urbanization gradients in central Arizona, USA, to examine the effects of climate, surface soil properties, soil nutrient availability and shrub cover on winter annual plant growth. At a landscape scale, aboveground net primary production (ANPP) of winter annual plants had a positive, nonlinear relationship to the amount of precipitation received from October through March of the current growing season. We found evidence for sequential resource limitation of ANPP initially from water then nitrogen and phosphorus. The resource limitation cascade was modified by surface soil properties and location relative to shrubs (under or between shrubs), highlighting the effect of small-scale factors on large-scale processes. Specifically, gravel cover had a negative effect on ANPP, and the effect of shrub cover on ANPP depended on nitrogen and current season rainfall. Our study emphasizes how small-scale factors, such as gravel cover, nutrient availability and presence of shrubs, can interact with large-scale drivers, such as seasonal precipitation, to affect interannual variation in winter annual plant production in the northern Sonoran Desert.

AB  - Classical swine fever (CSF) has been widespread among wild boars in Japan since the first outbreak in September 2018 after 26 years of absence. Although oral vaccination against CSF has been implemented, CSF infections are ongoing in the wild boar population. Therefore, increasing the effectiveness of oral vaccination in wild boars by distributing the vaccine in an environment where wild boars are likely to ingest the vaccine is necessary. This study aimed to investigate the landscape elements that facilitate the uptake of oral vaccines by wild boars. We used data from the oral vaccine campaign in Gunma and Tochigi prefectures in eastern Japan and analyzed the vaccine uptake rate and landscape structure at the vaccine distribution sites in two seasons. The uptake rate of the oral vaccine was significantly higher in the first season (Gunma: 41.5%, Tochigi: 37.1%) than in the second season (Gunma: 28.5%, Tochigi: 25.7%). We also found that broadleaf forest and bamboo woodland were negatively associated with vaccine uptake in Gumma Prefecture in the first and second seasons, respectively. These results indicate that vaccine uptake may be influenced by seasonal changes in wild boar food resources. Moreover, the results suggest that the uptake of oral vaccination may increase in environments with high landscape diversity, i.e., forest edge environments, which contain mainly forest elements and a small amount of cultivated land and city areas, whereas it may decrease in environments with mainly cultivated land and city areas and less forest elements due to the influence of human activities.

AB  - Urbanization of natural landscapes and increasing human populations have brought people and our companion animals into closer contact with wildlife, even within protected areas. To provide guidance for human-wildlife coexistence, it is therefore critical to understand the effects of anthropogenic disturbances and how well native wildlife species survive in human-dominated landscapes. We investigated the spatio-temporal responses of 10 vertebrate taxa, with an emphasis on the Endangered Eld's deer Rucervus eldii thamin, to anthropogenic disturbances in Shwesettaw Wildlife Sanctuary, Myanmar. We quantified anthropogenic disturbances as distance from human settlements, distance from a highway, and the presence of people and free-ranging dogs Canis familiaris. Anthropogenic disturbances had stronger negative impacts on the detection of native wildlife species than on occupancy. Eld's deer avoided areas close to human settlements and showed low diel activity overlap with both people and dogs, although we found a positive association with human presence at the camera-trap sites. Five species exhibited lower diel activity overlap with people in the rainy season when human activity is the highest in our study area. All studied wildlife species shifted to nocturnal activity or did not show any clear activity pattern during the cool-dry season when the presence of dogs increased. The ecological and conservation impacts of dogs are underestimated in South-east Asia, particularly in Myanmar, and this case study highlights the impacts of dogs on the temporal use of habitat by wildlife and the need for better practices in the management of dogs within protected areas.

AB  - Habitat destruction and fragmentation are major factors in the destruction of genetic diversity and affect the movement behavior of the Roe deer population in the remaining habitats. Here, we study the population and landscape genetics of Capreolus capreolus (roe deer) in northern and northwestern Iran using twelve polymorphism microsatellite markers. From 111 total specimens, 63 had successful extraction (6 feces, 35 tissues, 9 bones, and 13 antlers). We considered 30 microsatellite polymorphic loci, of which only 12 were amplified for our further analysis. For genetic diversity analysis, the Weir-Cockerham method was applied to measure the inbreeding coefficient (FIS) and fixation index (FST) for each locus as well as for each population. For landscape genetics, the susceptibility patterns of genetic variations were assessed using three hypotheses including isolation by distance (IBD), isolation by environment (IBE), isolation by resistance (IBR), and individual landscape genetic analysis. A habitat suitability map as an indicator of landscape resistance was constructed from several species distribution models (SDMs) algorithms including Generalized Boosting Models (GBM), Maximum Entropy (Maxent), Random Forest (RF), Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) and artificial neural networks (ANN) and an ensemble model. Our estimated FIs index showed that the Golestan, Arasbaran, and Guilan populations had the highest and lowest genetic diversity among roe deer populations. According to the Fst criterion, our results showed that Golestan and East Azarbaijan (Arasbaran) had the highest and Mazandaran had the lowest genetic distance patterns. Our results do not suggest that there is high genetic differentiation for roe deer in the region, with high levels of gene flow between study areas. We found that geographic distance has no significant relationship with genetic distance and that there is no significant relationship between the ecological niche non-similarity matrix and the genetic distance matrix. The most influential factors affecting gene flow in roe deer were aspect and elevation variables. The analysis suggests that the landscape has no significant influence on the structuring of the studied population and shows little genetic differentiation.

AB  - Loss of plant functional group diversity has significant repercussions for ecosystem productivity globally. However, our understanding of how this loss of specific functional groups, particularly those providing non-food resources, influences herbivores and, consequently, ecosystem productivity remains limited. To elucidate these, we conducted a series of experiments consisting of (1) a two-factor field experiment, where we manipulated the forb abundance and caterpillar presence to assess their interactive effects on plant productivity and caterpillar performance, (2) a field complementary shelter addition experiment, designed to isolate and evaluate the effects of microclimatic changes resulting from forb removal, and (3) a confirmatory microcosm experiment to validate the field findings under controlled by monitoring the herbivory patterns. Our results show that forb removal significantly decreased the aboveground plant biomass (APB) by 41.3%, but did not affect the APB of sedges. The presence of caterpillars significantly decreased total APB by 16.7% and APB of sedges by 34.8%, but these effects disappeared with forbs removed. Specifically, forb removal significantly increased caterpillar mortality rates by 319% and decreased caterpillar body size by 27.2%, which in turn diminished the herbivory pressure on sedges. Changes in caterpillar performance were correlated with maximum and average soil surface temperatures influenced by forb removal and the addition of shelters. Further investigation by the confirmatory microcosm experiment indicated that the absence of forbs decreased the feeding time of caterpillars and deprived caterpillars of refuge from the midday heat and intense sunlight, ultimately resulting in lower body size and higher larval mortality. Our findings suggest that forb removal disrupts trophic interactions, with potential cascading effects on herbivore populations, plant community structure, and ecosystem productivity. These results underscore the importance of plant functional diversity in maintaining ecosystem stability, especially under changing environmental conditions.

AB  - Human-mediated introductions and subsequent establishment and spread of nonnative species have the potential to create a founder effect in such populations, which typically results in low genetic diversity and potential for inbreeding. However, several exotic invasive species exhibit a "genetic paradox" in which they thrive and adapt to novel environments while also avoiding complications from low genetic diversity. Axis deer (Axis axis) were introduced into Texas, Hawaii, South America, Australia, and Croatia during the 19th and 20th centuries and successfully established large populations from a few founding individuals. Mitochondrial (Cytochrome-b, Cytb; displacement loop, D-loop) and nuclear (10 microsatellites) markers were used to assess genetic diversity within and between axis deer populations in Texas and Hawaii and then compared to other introduced (Australia and Croatia) and native (India) populations. Overall, mtDNA divergence was 0.54% (Cytb) and 1.55% (D-loop) indicating high mitochondrial similarity within the species. Further, each invasive population was composed of only one or two mtDNA haplotypes. Microsatellite allele diversity also was low within and between populations in Texas and Hawaii resulting in monomorphic loci and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium violations in both populations. The low genetic diversity in native Indian axis deer and within and between invasive populations suggests that the introduced populations experienced founder effects following introduction, and yet overcame this potential handicap by undergoing successful establishment and expansion. Axis deer appear to be another successful invasive species characterized by the genetic paradox where they exhibit genetic profiles that suggest inbreeding effects should be imminent, yet display no signs of inbreeding and are highly successful adapting to novel environments.

AB  - Land-use changes transforming forested landscapes to avocado orchards affect abiotic conditions and ecological processes. As a consequence, such changes can also affect leaf functional traits expression of co-occurring trees in orchards and related plant-insect interactions. Here, we evaluated changes in chemical soil properties and the effects of micro-climatic variables on leaf functional traits and herbivory in Quercus castanea and Q. obtusata in fragments occurring in a mosaic with avocado orchards. We differentiate three cases: forest cover > orchards, forest cover = orchards and forest cover < orchards in Michoacan state, Mexico. In each case, at least 17 individuals of each oak species were selected to analyze leaf functional traits and herbivory. Soil samples were collected to analyze chemical properties. Soils of areas with higher proportion of forest had higher concentrations of NH4+ and K+, whereas soils with higher proportion of orchards displayed higher concentrations of Mg2+, NO3- and SO42-. Leaf thickness, fresh mass and water content were higher in areas with higher forest cover and were influenced by Mg2+, NO3-, SO42- and local climatic variables. Leaf dry weight, specific leaf area, leaf area and chlorophyll content, as well as herbivory were higher in areas with higher proportions of orchards and were affected by PO43-, total P, K+, NH4+, and by local climatic variables. These results highlight the responses and links of plant functional traits associated with soil properties and local climatic variables and their possible consequences of biotic interactions in a landscape mosaic with different covers of avocado orchards and temperate forests.

AB  - A negative dependence of the digestibility of grassland vegetation on the amount of grasses in the feed consumed, which is in turn associated with an increased content of silicon compounds in grasses, is found. Using the example of four species of herbivores (Przewalski's horse, American bison, Bactrian camel, and saiga), which differ in the specifics of digestion, the selectivity of their nutrition was studied in relation to two groups of plants differing in digestibility-grasses and forbs. Saigas, like other obviously highly selective consumers of easily digestible food, strictly select forbs with a low silicon content and high digestibility. With the dominance of low-digestible grasses on the grassland and their forced consumption, the saiga population is not viable. Horses and bison, like other representatives of equines and large ruminants, due to the characteristics of the digestive system, are able to assimilate low-digestible grass feeds successfully and are highly specialized in feeding on grasses. The exclusion of forbs from the diet of horses and bison is associated with the increased toxicity of this group of plants. Camels do not discriminate in the choice of grasses and forbs of different nutritional value and currently actively use fallow areas (on former arable land) dominated by weedy plants, which are avoided by other herbivores. Different specialization in the choice of forage plants when different species of animals graze together causes their division in the use of grassland feed resources, eliminates competition between them, and acts as a necessary factor in preserving the species diversity of grassland vegetation.

AB  - Seasonal variations in climatic conditions induce spatio-seasonal changes of ecological indicators, such as ecosystem services and biodiversity. However, current conservation planning mostly focus on annual or longterm characteristics of ecological indicators, with limited considerations of their seasonal variations. It remains unclear whether integrating seasonal variation into conservation planning can provide extra benefits. This study examines the Tana River Basin, a typical basin significantly affected by seasonal variations, to integrate these variations into ecological network construction and assess its benefits for conservation. Results demonstrated that integrating seasonal variation indeed improve protection efficiency. Compared to the annual perspective, considering seasonal stability can increase the soil conservation by 82.79 %, water yield by 14.55 % and net primary productivity by 16.78 %, respectively. Meantime, it enables the adjustments of conservation planning based on the seasonal ecological resistance. For instance, compared to long rainy season, the long dry season decreased ecological corridor areas by 33.87 % and increased barrier points by 428.92 %. Accordingly, ecological sources covering an area of 20,758 km2 within the basin were identified in the upper and lower reaches. Ecological corridors were classified into primary and seasonal (Level I and II) corridors to clarify the different priorities. A number of 52 and 22 of hierarchical ecological pinch points and hierarchical barrier points were also identified, respectively. Finally, a "two zones, two axes, five nodes, and multiple corridors" ecological conservation pattern and targeted suggestions for different seasons were proposed. These results provide prioritization information for ecological conservation, supporting for sustainable development of the Tana River Basin.

AB  - Understanding the diversity and functioning of Arctic sea ice ecosystems is vital to evaluate and predict the impact of current and future climate change. In the microscopic communities inhabiting the brine channels inside sea ice, nematodes often dominate numerically and act as bacterivores and herbivores. Despite nematodes great abundances and known ecological roles, molecular tools have not been applied to investigate their species diversity in sea ice. In an attempt to begin establishing a molecular baseline for species diversity of sea ice nematodes, we Sanger sequenced 74 specimens from four locations around Svalbard (European Arctic), using the 18S rRNA barcode. Currently available nucleotide reference databases are both underpopulated with representative marine nematode taxa and contain a substantial number of misidentified organisms. Together, these limitations inhibited the ability to identify marine specimens collected in this study with certainty. Nevertheless, our molecular data indicate the presence of two genera in sea ice on Svalbard-Theristus and Halomonhystera. While it is possible that the latter represents a novel ice nematode species, future studies, including morphometric analysis, are needed to verify our molecular findings. We leverage the assignment of molecular information to robustly identify nematodes and provide the first insight into the diversity of sea ice nematodes in the European Arctic. We advocate for an intensified cooperation between molecular and morphological taxonomists to expedite the establishment of baseline surveys that are required to predict biological consequences of the diminishing sea ice habitat in the future.

AB  - Purpose of Review Forest research has shown for a long time that microorganisms influence tree-insect interactions, but the complexity of microbial communities, as well as the holobiont nature of both trees and insect herbivores, has only recently been taken fully into account by forest entomologists and ecologists. In this article, we review recent findings on the effects of tree-insect-microbiome interactions on the health of tree individuals and discuss whether and how knowledge about tree and insect microbiomes could be integrated into forest health management strategies. We then examine the effects tree-insect-microbiome interactions on forest biodiversity and regeneration, highlighting gaps in our knowledge at the ecosystem scale. Recent Findings Multiple studies show that herbivore damage in forest ecosystems is clearly influenced by tripartite interactions between trees, insects and their microbiomes. Recent research on the plant microbiome indicates that microbiomes of planted trees could be managed at several stages of production, from seed orchards to mature forests, to improve the resistance of forest plantations to insect pests. Therefore, the tree microbiome could potentially be fully integrated into forest health management strategies. To achieve this aim, future studies will have to combine, as has long been done in forest research, holistic goals with reductionist approaches. Efforts should be made to improve our understanding of how microbial fluxes between trees and insects determine the health of forest ecosystems, and to decipher the underlying mechanisms, through the development of experimental systems in which microbial communities can be manipulated. Knowledge about tree-insect-microbiome interactions should then be integrated into spatial models of forest dynamics to move from small-scale mechanisms to forest ecosystem-scale predictions.

AB  - Aims Although monodominance has attracted the attention of ecologists for many decades, few studies have devoted attention to how abiotic factors could influence the occurrence of monodominant forest patches at the biome scale. Here, we assessed whether the occurrence of monodominant forest patches of Moquiniastrum polymorphum (Less.) G. Sancho (Asteraceae), an early-successional tree species with wind-dispersed seeds, could be predicted using optimum germination temperature and past deforestation. We also verified under what edaphic and climatic conditions the species could reach monodominance. Location The Atlantic Forest, Brazil. Methods We estimated optimum germination temperature across the species' geographic range as a function of annual mean temperature based on the results of germination tests available in the literature. Past deforestation (a proxy for suitable habitat for the species' dispersal and establishment) around monodominant forest patches was estimated by calculating the forest cover in 1985. We also modeled the upper limit of dominance (relative abundance) as a function of climatic and edaphic variables considered important for the species' establishment. Results The results showed that the probability of occurrence of monodominant forest patches is statistically null in places where germination can take more than 10 days and the landscape had more than 20% forest cover. Relative density values for the monodominant condition (> 60%) occurred only in warmer regions with infertile soils and median precipitation conditions (ca. 1,075-1,700 mm per year) in the Atlantic Forest. Conclusion We conclude that only under optimal conditions of germination and dispersal (i.e., regeneration niche) does monodominance occur. This highlights germination traits as an important mechanism for regulating monodominance. In addition, the approach used to predict regions with optimum germination temperature has further implications for understanding species abundance and distribution more generally.

AB  - The paper is focused on changes in biodiversity, the environment, and human activity in the Uvs Nuur Basin during the last three millennia based on biological and geochemical proxies from the lake Bayan Nuur. Regions with high biodiversity and relatively low anthropogenic pressures are typically the most vulnerable to both climate change and human activities. One such area is the Uvs Nuur Basin located on the north of the Great Lake Depression of Mongolia. The main objective of this study is to assess changes in the past biodiversity of the lake's microflora and microfauna, and surrounding vegetation biodiversity in the Uvs Nuur Basin, and to determine the main drivers of diversity change. Based on the analysis of pollen and chironomids we conclude that the most humid and afforested phase was between 1400 and 1800 CE. We assume that the Little Ice Age in the Uvs Nuur Basin was humid with mean annual precipitation ca. 305 mm/year and mean July temperature about 13 degrees C. Conversely, the warmest and most arid period was between 650 and 1350 CE with mean annual precipitation ca. 280 mm/year and mean July temperature of about 16 degrees C, attributed to the Medieval Warm Period. The biodiversity of terrestrial plants, chironomids, and Cladocera positive react to changes in annual precipitation and July temperature, whereas diatoms do not correlate directly to the climatic factors. The diversity and the evenness of plants are strongly correlated with the change in the leading biomes. The calculated species turnover suggests no significant changes in plant and Cladocera taxa composition, but significant changes in diatom and chironomid communities. This may be explained by the instability of lake ecology due to the fluctuation of the salinity and acidity of the water. An additional aim was to assess if dung fungi in lacustrine sediments reflect changes in human population density around the lake. We found that neither historical sources of human presence nor the influx of coprophilous fungi are correlated with the inferred climate changes. Coprophilous fungi can be used as individual or additional sources of assessment for the peopling and human-related herbivore density including overgrazing of the studied area.

AB  - Throughout the Himalaya, mountain ungulates are threatened by hunting for meat and body parts, habitat loss, and competition with livestock. Accurate population estimates are important for conservation management but most of the available methods to estimate ungulate densities are difficult to implement in mountainous terrain. Here, we tested the efficacy of the recent extension of the point transect method, using camera traps for estimating density of two mountain ungulates: the group-living Himalayan blue sheep or bharal Pseudois nayaur and the solitary Himalayan musk deer Moschus leucogaster. We deployed camera traps in 2017-2018 for the bharal (summer: 21 locations; winter: 25) in the trans-Himalayan region (3,000-5,000 m) and in 2018-2019 for the musk deer (summer: 30 locations; winter: 28) in subalpine habitats (2,500-3,500 m) in the Upper Bhagirathi basin, Uttarakhand, India. Using distance sampling with camera traps, we estimated the bharal population to be 0.51 +/- SE 0.1 individuals/km(2) (CV = 0.31) in summer and 0.64 +/- SE 0.2 individuals/km(2) (CV = 0.37) in winter. For musk deer, the estimated density was 0.4 +/- SE 0.1 individuals/km(2) (CV = 0.34) in summer and 0.1 +/- SE 0.05 individuals/km(2) (CV = 0.48) in winter. The high variability in these estimates is probably a result of the topography of the landscape and the biology of the species. We discuss the potential application of distance sampling with camera traps to estimate the density of mountain ungulates in remote and rugged terrain, and the limitations of this method.

AB  - As the population size of free-living European bison in Poland has increased significantly over the last few years, conservation and management should be reconsidered to face new challenges, which aim to protect the whole population, not just individuals. The aim of our study was to analyse prevalence and identify risk factors for infections with viruses affecting reproduction (BVDV, BoHV-1, and BoHV-4), causing respiratory diseases (BRV3, BAdV-3, and BRSV), and emerging vector-borne viruses (BTV and SBV). Over 600 serum samples used in serology and 270 lung tissue samples, and 284 nasal swabs used in virological tests were collected from 24 free-living and captive European bison herds between 2016 and 2023. The seroprevalences varied between low (0.3-6.1% for BVDV, BoHV-1, and BoHV-4), medium (15.9% for BRSV and 22.1% for BTV) and high (43.3% for BRV3, 59.5% for BAdV-3, and 69.5% for SBV). Interspecies' and intraspecies' risk of endemic viral infections was observed to be density-dependent, while the effect of anthropogenic factors on the spread of infections in free-living European bison has not been demonstrated. BTV is no longer circulating, while SBV has become endemic. The higher exposure to viruses in the European bison eliminated on the basis of a veterinary decision indicates the importance of an expert supervision for disease control and prevention.

AB  - The swift proliferation of forests converted into monoculture plantations has profound impacts on soil nutrients, microbial communities, and many ecological processes and functions. Nematodes are soil microfauna that play a pivotal role in biogeochemical cycling and in soil food web, whereas the response of soil nematode communities and energy flows to forest conversion remains unknown. Here, we assessed the community composition and the energy flows of the nematode food webs as a function of soil chemistry after conversion from natural forests (Forest) to four plantations (8 -year -old): Amygdalus persica (Peach), Myrica rubra (Berry), Camellia oleifera (Oil), and Cunninghamia lanceolata (Fir). After forest conversion, soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) contents decreased by 65 % and 55 %, respectively. Forest conversion strongly reduced the abundance (particularly large -bodied omnivorous -predatory nematodes), diversity, maturity, and stability of the soil nematode community. The shifts in composition and structure of nematode communities after forest conversion are reflected in changes in the abundance of predominant genera and trophic taxa, especially bacterivorous, fungivorous, and omnivorous -predatory nematodes. Acrobeloides notably increased, whereas Plectus, Prismatolaimus , Tylencholaimus, and Tripyla decreased. Accordingly, the abundances of r -strategy nematodes ( cp value = 1 -2) increased, but that of the K -strategists ( cp value = 3 -5) declined. Additionally, the energy flow across the soil nematode food web was reduced by 36 % and flow uniformity declined by 24 % after forest conversion. These changes in nematode diversity and abundance were triggered by diminishing soil C and N contents, thereby affecting the energy flows via the nematode food webs. Thus, forest conversion affects soil biotas and multifunctions from the perspective of nematode food web structure and energy flows, and underlines the interconnections between ecosystem and energy dynamics across multi-trophic levels, which is crucial for sustainable forest management.

AB  - Seahorse populations are facing significant declines worldwide, often associated to illegal trade and habitat loss or fragmentation. Emergent habitat shifts towards invasive seaweeds, facilitated by global warming, can also be at play, having still unknown effects on seahorse ecology. Particularly, indirect impacts on seahorse populations via altered predation success remains largely unexplored. Here, we conducted mesocosm experiments to investigate differences in the prey capture success of the long-snouted seahorse (Hippocampus guttulatus) among native habitats (i.e. seagrass meadows and unvegetated sediments) and non-native Caulerpa prolifera meadows when offered different preys (amphipods and shrimps), at low or high prey availability, and under low or high habitat complexity. Great plasticity of H. guttulatus to all habitats was revealed, as habitat type did not significantly affect the capture success. Instead, capture success depends on prey identity and availability regardless of the habitat type, as well as on habitat complexity. Seahorse capture success was higher under high prey availability, as well as when predating on amphipods that were offered together with shrimps. High habitat complexity of both vegetated habitats enhanced by double the capture success, whereas an opposite effect of similar magnitude was found for more complex unvegetated habitats. This indicates that vegetation complexity, regardless their native or invasive nature, reduces prey awareness to predator, whereas small structures in unvegetated habitats provide refuge for preys but not seahorse camouflage. We found no evidence that shifts from native habitats to invasive C. prolifera negatively impact H. guttulatus capture success, but further research on other aspects of its feeding ecology is still necessary.

AB  - Our goal was to understand the mechanisms behind the impact of nutrient enrichment at intermediate distances from aquaculture on the interactions of a subtidal macroalgae community with its main grazer, the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus. We assessed the diversity and cover of the macroalgal community, the abundance and biometrics of the sea urchins, the carbon and nitrogen elemental and isotopic compositions, and their metabolome in two stations, at an intermediate distance (station A) and away (station B) from a fish cage facility in the Aegean Sea (Greece), during the warm and cold seasons. The nutrient input at station A favored a shift to a macroalgal assemblage dominated by turf-forming species, depleted of native-erected species and with a higher abundance of invasive algae. A stable isotope analysis showed fish-farm-associated nitrogen enrichment of the macroalgae and trophic transfer to P. lividus. A decrease in metabolites related to grazing, reproduction, and energy reserves was found in P. lividus at station A. Furthermore, the metabolomic analysis was able to pinpoint stress in P. lividus at an intermediate distance from aquaculture. The chosen combination of traditional ecology with omics technology could be used to uncover not only the sublethal effects of nutrient loading but also the pathways for species interactions.

AB  - We examined hypotheses of spatial association arising from exclusion or indirect competitive interactions, using 13 years of gridded mammal census data from Kruger National Park, South Africa. As interactions occur at different scales, we explored the data at 1, 5, 10, and 15 km(2). We proposed four hypotheses structuring the mammal community: H1, predator exclusion of herbivores by carnivores (apparent direct competition); H2-H4: indirect competition produced by each of three types of herbivore diet specialization: H2, ruminants and non-ruminants; H3, grazers and browsers, and H4, a four-way division of small and large grazers and browsers. We used the software CoOccur to implement a robust test for evidence of our hypotheses against null models of community assemblage. At 5, 10, and 15 km(2) scales, the results supported a competition/exclusion mechanism in the majority of years for hypotheses H1, H3, and H4, and facilitation in H2. At the finest spatial scale (1 km2), we saw patterns resembling a mixture of competitive, neutral and facilitative process. These results suggest strong, large-scale effects of interspecific interactions on distributions of African megafauna, which may not operate at a more local (1 km(2)) scale, underscoring the importance of scale and mechanism in the guild structure of communities.

AB  - Ungulates exhibit various and persistent behavioral responses to anthropogenic disturbance. However, information about natural behavior of sika deer with regard to their flight response is lacking. To clarify the effects of internal and external factors on the flight response of sika deer, it is crucial to initially evaluate this response in areas with low anthropogenic disturbance. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the flight distance (FD) of sika deer in response to human presence on a forest road and clarify the influences of both internal and external factors on FD. Although there was no significant difference in the number of deer observed per 1 km between the fawn-rearing and rutting seasons, the numbers of males and females significantly varied seasonally, with more females observed in the fawn-rearing and more males in rutting season. FD was significantly influenced by herd composition, herd size, deer positioning, and terrain ruggedness index, indicating that females with fawn, larger herds, and deer in uphill or areas with high terrain ruggedness index tended to flee farther distances. Consequently, given the influences of internal and external factors on FD, as demonstrated in the present study, continuous monitoring of FD could provide valuable insights into wildlife management.

AB  - 1. Conspecific plant density and heterospecific frequency are key drivers of herbivore damage. However, most studies have investigated their effects separately and for single (rather than multiple) focal plant species.
   2. We conducted an experiment involving three tree species, namely: Cordia dodecandra (Boraginaceae), Manilkara zapota (Zapotaceae), and Piscidia piscipula (Fabaceae). We manipulated understory densities of M. zapota and C. dodecandra (focal species) and their frequency relative to P. piscipula. Three months after planting, we surveyed insect leaf chewer and sucking damage on the former two. Because these species are attacked by different herbivores, we predicted a negative effect of heterospecific frequency on herbivory.
   3. Density and frequency varied in the direction and function of their effects on herbivory depending on the plant species and attacking herbivore. As expected, Piscidia piscipula frequency had a negative linear effect on M. zapota leaf-chewer damage, whereas conspecific density did not affect chewer damage on this species. In contrast, density and frequency had non-linear effects on C. dodecandra chewer damage, namely positive (hump-shaped) and negative (U-shaped) relationships, respectively. In addition, density and frequency had positive linear effects on C. dondecandra damage by leafhoppers.
   4. These findings call for more work jointly assessing plant inter-specific variation in density- and frequency-dependent variation in herbivory and its underlying drivers.

AB  - Ungulates groom to remove ectoparasites but grooming may interfere with foraging, vigilance, and rumination, and it is possible that these effects differ among migratory tactics due to differences in parasite infestations. We compared the effects of grooming for winter ticks (Dermacentor albipictus) on winter foraging behavior by migrating and resident elk (Cervus canadensis) in the partially migratory population at the Ya Ha Tinda, adjacent to Banff National Park, Canada. We used hair loss on the dorsal shoulder area ("withers") measured from photographic images as an index of tick infestation of individual elk. We conducted 594 focal observations on 48 radio-collared and 18 uncollared individuals that were uniquely identifiable from ear-tags (N = 66) in 2019 to assess whether grooming for ticks in winter reduced time spent foraging, ruminating, or being vigilant. Because rubbing or hair loss from radio-collars may influence tick infestations and behavior, we controlled for whether elk were collared or uncollared in our analyses. Neck hair loss was 3-5% greater in collared elk than uncollared elk, but neither withers hair loss nor time spent grooming differed. Grooming occurred during 42% of the observations but grooming comprised only similar to 1% of observation time. Nevertheless, 40% of all grooming was observed during resting, and grooming interrupted vigilance behavior similar to 8 times more than foraging. We found no differences among elk following different migratory tactics in time spent grooming or in other behaviors, but one of the two groups of migrant elk had higher withers hair loss. Our results suggest winter ticks may have slight effects on elk relative to other ungulates, particularly moose (Alces alces), in North America.

AB  - Developing innovative monitoring systems for biodiversity outcomes in protected areas (PAs) are important to enable effective adaptive management. Here we show how to quantitatively detect and monitor temporal and spatial patterns in environmental heterogeneity, an important indicator of ecological integrity and biodiversity patterns. We used a 28-year time series (1991-2018) generated from freely available Landsat satellite imagery and Rao's quadratic index to calculate relative heterogeneity and trends in heterogeneity for 41 PAs across South Africa. We selected PAs where mega-herbivore assemblages were similar and where management objectives were broadly aligned with South African legislation to protect biodiversity. There was a three-fold difference in heterogeneity among PAs, mainly linked to variation in topography and rainfall. Heterogeneity decreased in 12 (29%), increased in three (7%) and remained stable in 26 (64%) PA's. These trends were not explained by overall heterogeneity, PA size, or rainfall - i.e., PAs that were smaller, drier, and more homogenous were not more likely to show decreasing trends than PAs that were larger, wetter, and generally more heterogenous. Rather trends in heterogeneity are likely the result of interactions between regional process (e.g., rainfall) and local factors such fire regimes, megaherbivore densities, and park management. The framework presented here can be extended to include every PA nationally, or even globally, and the data product fully automated. This presents an opportunity for conservation management to incorporate this important biodiversity indicator in PA monitoring programs as well as other large-scale ecological monitoring initiatives.

AB  - Overabundant ungulate populations are frequently hard to control in woodlands and protected areas, such as El Palmar National Park, where controlled shooting failed to reduce the relative abundance of axis deer (Axis axis) over a decade. We compared the effectiveness of spotlight hunting to cull axis deer with daytime and nighttime controlled shooting over bait stations. We tested whether harvest composition differed among methods by multiple regression and fitted functional response models to culling and sighting data. The trial included 18 sessions and 49 hunter groups, each supervised by a park ranger, who traveled a randomly allocated, fixed itinerary in a slow-moving vehicle, sighted and shot the deer, and retrieved and measured the carcass. Spotlighting culled 2.8-6.2 times more deer per hunting party-session and a significantly greater fraction of subadult or adult deer than daytime and overnight shooting. Relatively more females were culled by spotlighting (58.5%) than by daytime (43.5%) and overnight (47.3%) sessions. Pregnancy rates were 2.4-3.8 times greater by spotlighting (34.0%) than in overnight (14.1%) or daytime (9.0%) sessions. The deer harvested by spotlighting or overnight shooting were significantly heavier than those culled by daytime sessions. A Type II functional response fitted the data better than other competing models. Inter-method differences in harvest size and composition most likely explain the historical inability of daytime shooting to curb deer numbers despite intensified efforts. Spotlighting conducted by supervised, organized hunters was effective for targeted deer control and removed deer with greater reproductive value than shooting over bait stations.

AB  - Population restoration is an inherently costly conservation practice typically reliant on animal translocations. There are many approaches to translocation and consideration is paid to understanding how various translocation models influence restoration success. Translocation strategies are often designed to meet site-specific objectives, minimize cost, and maximize success. We investigated genetic diversity retention associated with the low-founder, multi-release, single admixed stock translocation model of the Missouri elk (Cervus canadensis) restoration in 2011-2013. We further estimated effective population size and projected future losses in genetic diversity if the restored Missouri elk herd is maintained at the population size objective with no immigration from neighboring states. We observed relatively high levels of genetic diversity retention as evidenced by minimal losses in allelic richness and expected heterozygosity. Our projections indicated 90% genetic diversity retention within the Missouri population for roughly 130 years. Where number of progeny or source stocks are limited by resource or disease considerations, use of a relatively low-founder, single admixed source may enable retention of genetic variation, while minimizing costs.

AB  - The Middle Pleistocene was a period of dynamic changes in Europe. During MIS 11, a number of modern mammal taxa appeared and environmental conditions remained warm and favourable for a relatively long time. The Medzhybizh 1 locality of Ukraine dated to this very period comprises alluvial deposits with rich animal remains, which allow not only to reconstruct the fauna composition, but also to highlight the environmental conditions that dominated at this locality. A revision of the fauna of Medzhybizh 1 locality based on remains of all vertebrate groups revealed a taxonomically diverse fish community (16 species of 11 genera) dominated by cyprinids common for lacustrine or riverine assemblages. Amphibians are represented by 11 species, while the number of reptile and bird remains are less significant. Mammals are the most represented group at the locality, including small mammals (30 species), carnivorans (2 species), and ungulates (5 taxa), the latter dominated by C. elaphus. The taxonomic composition of terrestrial groups indicates temperate climate with boreal-type forests and meadows similar to cold steppe, as well as low wet areas and riparian habitats inhabited by amphibians, reptiles, insectivores, beavers, and various voles. The fish assemblage indicates a partially overgrown but well -aerated water body (lake or slow-flowing river) with sandy-silty bottom. Lithic artefacts found at the Medzhybizh 1 locality contribute to a better understanding of relationships between ancient hominins and faunas during the Middle Pleistocene of Eastern Europe.

AB  - The island of Taiwan represents an ideal context for studying the effects of climatic oscillations and topographic variation on large herbivores due to its varied tropical to sub-tropical climate zones at different elevational ranges. We explored the phylogenetics of Formosan sambar deer (Rusa unicolor swinhoii) using the control region of the mitochondrial genome. We detected 18 haplotypes among 454 sequences across the island and grouped them into six regions based on SAMOVA, with 68.78% variance among regions. A Bayesian phylogenetic dendrogram revealed two spatially segregated genetic clades. Neutrality tests and Bayesian skyline plots uncovered different demographic expansion histories for the two clades. We further tested divergence times and chronology to propose potential phylogenetic scenarios, which were examined using approximate Bayesian computation. Finally, we present a credible hypothesis for a glacial refugium in the northern part of the Central Mountain Range. Subsequent secondary contact between the two clades during interglacial periods has led to the extant genetic structure of Formosan sambar deer.

AB  - Climate change can severely impact species that depend on temporary resources by inducing phenological mismatches between consumer and resource seasonal timing. In the winter moth, warmer winters caused eggs to hatch before their food source, young oak leaves, became available. This phenological mismatch changed the selection on the temperature sensitivity of egg development rate. However, we know little about the fine-scale fitness consequences of phenological mismatch at the individual level and how this mismatch affects population dynamics in the winter moth. To determine the fitness consequences of mistimed egg hatching relative to timing of oak budburst, we quantified survival and pupation weight in a feeding experiment. We found that mismatch greatly increased mortality rates of freshly hatched caterpillars, as well as affecting caterpillar growth and development time. We then investigated whether these individual fitness consequences have population-level impacts by estimating the effect of phenological mismatch on population dynamics, using our long-term data (1994-2021) on relative winter moth population densities at four locations in The Netherlands. We found a significant effect of mismatch on population density with higher population growth rates in years with a smaller phenological mismatch. Our results indicate that climate change-induced phenological mismatch can incur severe individual fitness consequences that can impact population density in the wild.

AB  - Amidst the rapid degradation of the environment, protected areas act as a buffer for sensitive species against drivers of change. The Kruger National Park, in the Zambezian Lowveld Freshwater Ecoregion, encompasses two critical transboundary river basins, which are threatened by overexploitation, climate change and nonnative invasive species. We complete an assessment of the abundance, distribution, spread and potential impacts of the invasive redclaw crayfish on community assemblages throughout the five main rivers of the Kruger National Park and compare them to other invasive populations in Southern Africa. Redclaw crayfish have established populations in the Crocodile River and the Sabie-Sand River and are spreading at a rate of 7-8 km/year downstream and 3 km/year upstream. Abundance is lower than the more established invasions, but based on other trajectories, we can expect a tenfold increase in the next 5 years. No impact of crayfish presence or abundance was detected on fish or macroinvertebrate community assemblages. This suggests that as crayfish abundance is still relatively low, there may be a window of opportunity for targeted management. Management options in the rivers of the Kruger National Park are fraught with practical issues due to dangerous megafauna, but further understanding of the role of environmental flows on the establishment capacity of redclaw crayfish may hold some potential. Preventing new incursions into the protected area from watersheds originating outside of the park will need strategic multiorganisational collaboration.

AB  - This paper presents the results of a study on the isotopic ecology of guanacos in central western Argentina. We examine the historical population ecology of guanacos using stable isotope analysis of bone collagen from pre-Hispanic and modern guanaco populations (n = 129), considering variability in two ecoregions: the Monte hot desert and the Andean-Patagonian cold desert. Our study addresses the consistency of guanaco diets over time, evaluating palaeoecology to provide information for conservation of this taxon. We found significant differences in isotopic niche size between modern and archaeological guanacos. When analyzed by ecoregion, there were significant differences in niche size through time, indicating that guanacos had distinctive dietary habits and occupied different ecological niches across the ecoregions. Comparing Standard Ellipse Areas (SEA) through time and across space, we observed that the archaeological SEA for guanacos is smaller than its modern counterpart in the Andean-Patagonia ecoregion. Conversely, in Monte, the archaeological SEA is larger than the one established for modern samples. The contrast between pre-Hispanic and modern populations highlight the impact of human activity and conservation efforts on the distribution and ecology of guanacos. These findings have important implications for understanding guanaco ecology with consequences for conservation policies.

AB  - Diadema antillarum is a keystone herbivore that controls algal cover on coral reefs, as reductions in this species has been associated with significant increases in algal cover. However, most of the evidence that supports this model comes from observational studies where processes have been inferred from descriptions of temporal and spatial relationships. Within this context, a manipulative experiment was conducted to test the effects of D. antillarum densities and rugosity on benthic assemblages. The experiment consisted of fencing 1m(2) experimental plots (metal fence corrals) of high and low rugosity where different densities (0, 1, 5 and 10 individuals/m(2)) of D. antillarum were enclosed per plot. Inside these plots, three permanent and random 100cm(2) photoquadrats were taken during eight sampling times (six months) to estimate temporal change in benthic cover. Multivariate and univariate analyses indicated that: 1) presence of D. antillarum significantly decreased turf algae (from 90% to 4%) and Dictyota (from 25% to 0%) cover and increased clean substrate (from 0% to 72%) at both sites; 2) herbivory rates for low rugosity were different from high rugosity herbivory rates; 3) densities of 1 D. antillarum individual/m(2) did not change algal cover; 4) a minimum of 5 D. antillarum individuals/m(2) were required to maintain low algal cover on low and high rugosity experimental units. Based on these results we suggest that D. antillarum can effectively enhance coral reef health by decreasing algal cover and creating clean substrate. For restoration efforts, optimal densities of 5 D. antillarum individuals/m(2) should be considered when restocking individuals to coral reefs.

AB  - Coral reef decline has accelerated in the last two decades resulting in substantial research into the phenomenon of 'phase shifts' or 'regime shifts'. However, the conclusions drawn from this research have been varied. Some of this variability may stem from methodological approaches, although the extent to which these factors have shaped our understanding remain largely unexplored. To examine this, we conducted a systematic review of the literature. In doing so, we revealed marked variability in the approaches used for studying phase shifts. Notably, very few studies clearly defined what they meant by phase shifts. Therefore, we developed a clarified definition of phase shifts, which specifically defined persistence and dominance. The applicability of this definition was tested on multi-decadal benthic composition data on the Great Barrier Reef. The number of shifts depended critically on the definition selected, suggesting that this may be a primary reason underpinning the variability in past results.

AB  - Juniperus macropoda is the only tree species of a cold desert ecosystem that is experiencing high anthropogenic pressure and has a poor regeneration status due to harsh environmental conditions. Due to the limited distribution of Juniperus macropoda in this region, the species have remained largely unexplored in terms of understanding the distribution pattern along the elevation and soil fertility gradients. Therefore, the current research was carried out along the elevational gradient, starting from the base line at 3000 m above sea level (m asl) asl with an elevational plot distance of 180 m. The study revealed that the average density of J. macropoda declined gradually from the first elevation range, i.e., 3000-3180 m asl onward, and extended up to the elevation range of 3900-4080 m asl. However, the average seedling and sapling densities were highest at mid-elevation and extended up to an elevation range of 4080-4260 m asl. The J. macropoda population formed a reverse J-shaped structure only up to 3540-3720 m asl. The maximum total biomass and carbon density were recorded in the lowest elevational range, and decreased subsequently. The primary soil nutrients under study decreased sharply along the elevational gradient. Seedling, sapling and tree distributions had a significantly positive relationship (p < 0.05) with available N, P, K, SOC, silt and clay contents and were negatively correlated (p < 0.05) with sand contents. The outcome of the study will form the basis for devising a plan for the management and conservation of J. macropoda forests.

AB  - On an evolutionary time scale, competition for food drives species formation by genetic adaptations to the environment and subsequent niche separation. On a short-term scale, animals use different strategies to meet their nutritional requirements, which ultimately influence their fitness. Understanding these adaptations in herbivores is especially important in temperate climates where animals have adapted both physiologically and behaviorally to seasonal variations in order to meet their nutritional requirements. The aim of this project was to investigate temporal variation in chemical composition of rumen content between two coexisting species of large herbivores, the native roe deer (Capreolus capreolus L.) and the introduced fallow deer (Dama dama L.), as well as a potential effect of competition on niche separation (interspecific differences in rumen nutrient composition). We analyzed 345 rumen samples collected from animals at one 95 km(2) estate, Koberg, in southwestern Sweden. Based on samples from all seasons, temporal variation in nutrient composition and interspecific differences between the two deer species were investigated under two contrasting fallow deer population densities. Results revealed that nutrient composition varied between species and across seasons. Roe deer had a higher proportion of rumen protein compared to fallow deer, with the highest proportions in spring. In contrast, fallow deer had a higher proportion of rumen hemicellulose compared to roe deer in spring, while no differences in nutrient composition between species could be found in fall. Overall, there were greater differences between the two species when fallow deer density was high and competition likely more pronounced than when fallow deer density was low. The results from this study can be used to understand interspecific competition and how it fosters niche separation between coexisting large herbivores.

AB  - The early stage of seedling establishment is critical to successful ecological restoration and reforestation, and it is partially influenced by herbivory. Aerial vertebrate predators, including birds and bats, can affect plant growth by controlling phytophagous insects. This study explored the effects of excluding birds and bats on the arthropod community during the initial stages of reforestation plots planted with Dipterocarpus alatus in deciduous dipterocarp forest using an exclusion experiment. We hypothesized that birds and bats negatively affect the density and biomass of large-sized arthropods (>= 1 cm), which are their potential prey, and that excluding these predators may affect seedling growth and leaf damage. The density and biomass of large arthropods significantly increased in the permanent exclosures compared to the control group. No significant difference between the nocturnal and diurnal exclosures was observed. Top-down effects on the biomass of large-sized phytophagous and predatory arthropods were pronounced during the dry season, coinciding with the presence of migratory insectivorous birds. Mesopredator release primarily driven by ants compensated for the absence of birds and bats, preventing immediate increases in herbivory or impacts on seedling growth. These findings highlight the importance of ecological redundancy among predator communities in maintaining herbivory control. Promoting diverse habitats that support both invertebrate and vertebrate predators may enhance the long-term resilience and effectiveness of pest control in ecological restoration efforts.

AB  - Density-independent and density-dependent population regulation has long been a subject of investigation. We examined density-dependent and density-independent factors on growth rates of pronghorn (Antilocapra americana (Ord, 1815)) using a retrospective analysis of population survey data. Across Idaho, we found that as the proportion of the subpopulation harvested the previous year increased, growth rates increased. Similarly, as fawn recruitment increased, growth rates increased. We also found when the growth rate in the previous year increased, the growth rate the subsequent year decreased. When subpopulations were examined independently, we found that in a low-elevation desert subpopulation, growth rates were influenced by growth the previous year. In an agricultural-dominated site, growth rates were influenced by fawn recruitment in the current year and maximum temperature the previous fall. Growth rates in a mid-elevation shrub-steppe site were influenced by drought severity prior to parturition and the growth rates from the previous year. Growth rates in two mountain valley subpopulations were influenced by measures of vegetative greenness. At the statewide scale, while managers may strive for increased numbers of pronghorn, density dependence will limit the ability for a region-wide numerical response. On the localized scale, drivers of growth were temporally and spatially explicit, and biologists must consider site-specific actions.

AB  - The state of Goias and the Federal District together cover an area of about 346 thousand km2, including the diversified Cerrado vegetation, also known as the Brazilian Savanna, a biodiversity hotspot with many endangered and endemic species. Much of the Cerrado has been converted to agriculture, but little is known of its earthworms, and the impacts of land use management and agricultural practices on their density and diversity. In the present paper we review the known earthworm species in Goias and the Federal District based on historical and museum records, and update information on their distribution and populations in different counties and land use systems with data from recent samplings. Five additional species are reported here for the first time, raising the total to 12 species currently known from Goias, from the families Benhamiidae (1), Glossoscolecidae (1), Megascolecidae (3), Ocnerodrilidae (2) and Rhinodrilidae (5). In the Federal District, an additional 10 species are reported, bringing the total to 23 earthworm species, belonging to the families Benhamiidae (4), Eudrilidae (1), Glossoscolecidae (2), Ocnerodrilidae (1), Lumbricidae (2), Megascolecidae (1) and Rhinodrilidae (12). Native species in Goias (6) were found in areas with lesser disturbance, such as in native forest and flooded areas/river banks, a phenomenon also observed in the Federal District. On the other hand, the exotic and peregrine species found in Goias (6) and in the Federal District (9) dominated in disturbed sites, such as perennial crops, agroforestry, annual crops, urban areas, secondary forests, pastures and agropastoral systems, among others. Given the many new species found and the extension of Goias and the Federal District, further effort is needed to adequately characterize the earthworm fauna of the region, from where many other species are expected.

AB  - Road construction is expanding worldwide, exacerbating both direct mortality by road-kills and habitat fragmentation, especially for mobile vertebrates such as bats. Understanding how road density affects bat communities in mosaic landscapes of various compositions and configurations is therefore critical. We acoustically sampled bat communities in 172 landscapes of southern France to: (i) disentangle the relative and interacting effects of road density and forest fragmentation by farmland on the activity of bat communities; (ii) investigate how road density affects different aspects of bat diversity (taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic) and species activity according to their life-history traits; and (iii) assess whether road density effects on bats change with the level of forest fragmentation. Forest amount and patchiness were more important than road density for all components of bat diversity, except for functional evenness. Bat diversity peaked in landscapes with intermediate levels of forest fragmentation, while road density had negative effects on functional and phylogenetic diversity. The effect of road density on the activity of R. ferrumequinum, R. hipposideros, N. leisleri and P. pipistrellus was only negative in landscapes with either a low forest amount or a low number of forest patches. By better understanding interactions between forest fragmentation and road density, our study will contribute to a more adequate landscape planning that will improve the resilience of bat communities to both road expansion and forest fragmentation. Moreover, the complex landscape-level interactions between habitat fragmentation and matrix quality on bats advocate for the use of a more holistic view in future fragmentation studies.

AB  - Today, the identification of tree species has become essential in order to protect biodiversity and ecological equilibrium and fulfil medicinal purposes. It is beneficial for large parts of society, foresters, farmers, biologists, conservationists, and landscape architects. The process of identifying tree species by conventional methods is time-consuming and prone to human error. So, a method based on automatic tree species identification is required to reduce human error as well as time. This can be achieved by using artificial intelligence and image processing techniques. This paper deals with machine learning approaches, a subset of artificial intelligence, where different supervised classifiers such as support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbour (kNN), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), and eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) are used to identify different tree species such as banana, coconut, mango, oil palm, and papaya. To implement each machine learning model, features are extracted from training images using the histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) descriptor. These feature vectors are fed as inputs to the classifiers so that the generated model can identify the unlabelled tree species. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the HOG descriptor in identifying tree species, two additional feature descriptors, gray-level co-occurrence matrix and linear binary pattern, are used. The performance of each model is assessed using the confusion matrix. The overall accuracy obtained for the classifiers SVM, kNN, DT, RF, and XGBoost using the HOG is 97.05%, 92.05%, 75.00%, 95.00%, and 97.94%, respectively. XGBoost gives higher accuracy because it combines the estimates of individual classifiers.

AB  - Citizen science (CS) initiatives can transform how some ecological data are collected. Herbivory is a fundamental ecological interaction, but herbivory rates in many natural systems are unknown due in part to lack of personnel for monitoring efforts. This limits our ability to understand broad ecological patterns relevant to herbivory. Fortunately, accurate and reliable visual estimation techniques for assessing herbivory could be amenable to CS approaches. In 2008, I developed a CS training initiative (the Million Leaf Project, MLP) to measure herbivory based on a seven-category visual assessment of leaf area removed (LAR). From 2010 to 2018, 394 citizen scientists assessed damage on 175,421 leaves to test the hypothesis that herbivory varies between understory and canopy leaves in a Peruvian tropical forest. In support of this hypothesis, the longitudinal CS data reveal that understory leaves consistently experience more herbivory than do canopy leaves on average (18.3% vs. 12.3%, P < 0.001), a difference that was consistent regardless of CS observer age. Furthermore, data integrity was high, even though younger participants showed some leaf selection bias. The MLP is based on a simple technique, intended to broaden public participation in ecological science, and applicable to any ecological system in which herbivory or leaf damage occurs.

AB  - Objective Internal tagging for telemetry studies requires invasive surgery procedures, necessitating sufficient sedation to support animal welfare. Challenges with existing chemical sedatives have resulted in technological alternatives, including electrosedation, with these newer methods less extensively studied. Our primary objective was to understand long-term survival, body-condition effects, and incision healing after surgical implantation of an imitation telemetry transmitter under three different sedation techniques.Methods We collected Silver Carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix and buffalo Ictiobus spp. from the Missouri River watershed in 2022 and 2023, during each of the four seasons. One of three sedation techniques was applied: electric fish handling gloves, tricaine methanesulfonate (MS-222), and eugenol. Additionally, we observed a group of fish that were unsedated but subjected to handling similar to that experienced during surgery. Fish were monitored to determine the effects of treatment, individual characteristics, surgery characteristics, and time-varying environmental factors on survival, body condition, and incision healing over 69- to 85-d holding periods.Results Long-term survival was higher for buffalo (86%) than Silver Carp (57%), with the fewest mortalities during the winter trial and most in summer, but sedation treatment did not affect survival. Smaller fish had a greater risk of mortality but better incision healing. Incision healing scores improved in warmer temperatures.Conclusions Difference in seasonal effects on survival and healing indicate a need to consider trade-offs when scheduling tagging for projects. However, a lack of difference in survival among treatments, including the group that was handled but did not undergo surgery, suggests no advantage of one sedative over another, but handling impacts may require more consideration.
   Surgically implanted telemetry transmitters provide valuable data for conservation biology, necessitating effective fish sedation methods. We show similar outcomes from three sedation methods but identify seasonal trade-offs and handling stress as considerations for other studies.

AB  - The structure and functioning of ecosystems are largely determined by the interactions between species within a biological community. Among these interactions, species exhibiting similar vertical and spatial prey preferences can be identified, thereby belonging to the same trophic guild. Our study explored some trophic characteristics of a diverse megafaunal community (cetaceans, tunas, seabirds) in the Bay of Biscay (BoB). Using stable isotope analysis (SIA), we explored the dietary habits and niche overlap among predators. The degree of isotopic niche overlap was generally low, but with certain species exhibiting large and narrow isotopic niche areas (long-finned pilot whales and Balearic shearwaters, respectively). Our results revealed a diversity of dietary preferences leading to the identification of three distinct trophic guilds based on prey functional groups and spatial preferences: cephalopod feeders (e.g. long-finned pilot whales, Cuvier's beaked whales, striped dolphins), crustacean feeders (e.g. fin whales, albacores), and piscivores (e.g. common dolphins, harbour porpoises, bottlenose dolphins, Atlantic bluefin tunas, Balearic shearwaters). Our findings showed resource partitioning and niche differentiation among the megafaunal community, highlighting the complexity of BoB's marine ecosystem. The insights derived from this study hold important implications for ecosystem management and the implementation of conservation initiatives.

AB  - Interspecific interactions are important drivers of population dynamics and species distribution. These relationships can increase niche partitioning between sympatric species, which can differentiate space and time use or modify their feeding strategies. Roe deer Capreolus capreolus and red deer Cervus elaphus are two of the most widespread ungulate species in Europe and show spatial and dietary overlap. However, limited information is available on their interspecific relationships, especially in mountainous areas. In this study we used 5 years of camera trapping data collected in the Stelvio National Park (Central Italian Alps) to investigate spatial and temporal interactions between roe deer and red deer. Analyses were based on 2060 and 9030 roe deer and red deer detections, respectively, collected from July to September, from 2019 to 2023, using 50 camera traps randomly distributed over a 10,000-ha study area. Spatial interactions were assessed by fitting a single-season, single-species occupancy model to calculate the probability of roe deer detection and occupancy as a function of relative red deer abundance and site-specific environmental covariates. Temporal interactions were obtained by comparing the diel activity patterns of the two species. Results showed no significant effect of red deer relative abundance on the probability of presence of roe deer. Spatial analysis suggested a higher probability of roe deer presence in forested habitats, at lower elevations, and in areas with gentler slopes. Diel activity patterns of roe deer were consistent across sites with higher and lower red deer relative abundance, with moderate to high interspecific overlap, suggesting moderate temporal partitioning and no major support for temporal avoidance of the latter by the former. The high degree of overlap between the two species may be the result of area-specific ecological conditions, such as the widespread distribution of red deer during the summer period, as well as of the adoption of strategies that favor coexistence.

AB  - Glyphosate-based herbicides are the most widely used herbicides in the world, including in Canadian forestry. In general, glyphosate-based herbicides are considered relatively non-toxic to wildlife species due, in part, to rapid breakdown of the chemical in the environment. However, recent work has shown that glyphosate can persist for at least one year after application at low concentrations leading to concern over the persistence of trace levels in the environment. Using two independent studies we characterize the short- (18 days) and long-term (1 year) persistence of glyphosate in vegetation which are commonly, but differentially, browsed by WhiteiTailed Deer (Odocoileus virginianus), Moose (Alces alces), and Black Bear (Ursus americanus), or used as traditional medicines by Indigenous people and compare the residues to exposure thresholds. In the short-term study, glyphosate concentrations within the application block exceeded the general and maximum residue level (MRL) for fresh fruit set by Health Canada (0.1 ppm) for up to 18 days after application. In the long-term study, glyphosate concentrations were above the MRL one week after application and below the MRL one month and one year after application. Under the assumptions that all vegetation contained glyphosate at the highest observed concentration, animals only consume vegetation from herbicide treated areas, and animals consume the physiological maximum level of vegetation daily, Moose, White-Tailed Deer, and Black Bears could exceed the Acceptable Daily Intake for glyphosate (0.3 mg/kg/day) for up to 18 days after application. Subsequently, given dissipation of residues in vegetative matrices as observed in this study, we consider it highly unlikely that the species considered herein could consume enough vegetation throughout their lives to pose a risk to their health. Overall, our two independent studies demonstrate that trace levels of glyphosate persist in vegetation for up to one year after application, however, observed concentrations are unlikely to pose risk to wildlife. We caution that operational practices as typically imposed in Canadian forestry are very important and effective in minimizing risk.

AB  - A common strategy to counteract global biodiversity loss is sustainable management of protected areas. However, as protection of nature sometimes conflicts with human livelihoods and involves stakeholders with different interests, conservation conflict is globally on the rise. These conflicts can hamper sustainable development, social equity and effective biodiversity conservation. Understanding perceptions of different stakeholders and mapping discourses is key in this respect. In this study, we investigated conservation conflict in the Pendjari National Park in Benin, West Africa. The conservation conflict was fueled in part by a shift from state-led collaborative management to a public-private partnership. Pendjari is the largest remaining savannah ecosystem in West Africa and home to several threatened megafauna species. Using Q methodology, we identified two distinct discourses among stakeholders. The first discourse, supported mainly by formally educated people with non-agricultural jobs, focuses on the limitation of anthropogenic activities in favor of biodiversity conservation. The second discourse is mostly supported by people with a lower education level and a direct dependency on the land. They agree there is a need for conservation but even more so for viable alternatives to ensure people's livelihoods. The identification of these discourses and their underlying drivers can be included into future decision-making processes and management of the Pendjari National Park.

AB  - The forest musk deer (Moschus berezovskii) is a national Class I protected wild animal in China, and the IUCN Red list classifies it as globally endangered. It has significant value in traditional Chinese medicine and spices. However, wild M. berezovskii has faced a severe population decline due to human hunting, habitat loss, and fragmentation. Thus, studying its population size and distribution pattern is of great importance to develop effective conservation measures. Here, we determined the optimal MaxEnt model and used stratified sampling and the fecal pile counting method to predict the population size and potential habitat distribution of wild M. berezovskii in Chongqing using 133 species distribution points and 28 environmental variables. The results were as follows: (1) When the optimal model parameters were RM = 3.5 and FC = LQHPT, it had high model prediction accuracy (AUC = 0.909 +/- 0.010, TSS = 0.663). (2) Under various climatic, topographic, vegetation, and anthropogenic disturbance scenarios, M. berezovskii was primarily distributed in northern, eastern, southwestern regions of Chongqing, covering an area of approximately 5562.80 km(2). (3) The key environmental factors affecting the potential habitat distribution of M. berezovskii were elevation (36.5%), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI, 16.6%), slope (11.8%), and land-use type (7.6%), whereas climate and anthropogenic disturbance factors had relatively little influence. (4) A population estimation for M. berezovskii identified approximately 928 +/- 109 individuals in Chongqing. We recommend prioritizing the preservation of high-altitude habitats and native vegetation to mitigate human interference and minimize road damage. In summary, our results can enhance the understanding of M. berezovskii distribution and provide a basis for effective conservation and management initiatives.

AB  - The benthic ecosystem in temperate regions is becoming barren owing to the replacement of macroalgae by calcareous algae as a result of climate change-induced increases in water temperature. The aim of this study was to observe how the top shell, Turbo sazae, an invertebrate that feeds on macroalgae, adapts to a benthic environment with a reduced macroalgae population owing to replacement by calcareous algae. Using tank experiments, the top shells were cultured for 18 weeks. Within this period, they were fed a diet comprising either Eclonia cava or Corallina officinalis. Thereafter, hemocyte response, reproductive development, and the levels of biochemical compounds in the individuals under investigation were analyzed. The results obtained showed no significant differences in immunological responses, gonad development, and general body weight between the two feeding groups. However, amino acid profiling showed a decreasing trend in amino acid contents in both feeding groups, but no significant differences were observed with respect to overall protein content. These findings indirectly suggested that even in a macroalgae-depleted environment, the top shells can survive by consuming crustose calcareous algae, but with the change in diet affecting the levels of some amino acids in their bodies. Therefore, this study provides valuable insights into the adaptability of the top shells inhabiting the waters around Jeju Island to changes in their feeding environment and may also serve as basis for enhancing resource management strategies in response to climate change-induced changes in the benthic ecosystem.

AB  - Delineating relevant local populations of widely distributed species is a common challenge in conservation ecology. Caribou and reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) are in general decline throughout their global range, despite ongoing conservation efforts. In Canada, recovery actions for the threatened boreal population of woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) are stratified by 'local population units' (LPUs) on ranges distributed across 2.4 x 10 km2 of the species' geographic range. To estimate local population dynamics, LPUs are assumed to be geographically closed, though supporting evidence varies widely. We assembled an exceptionally large database of GPS telemetry locations (891,306 telemetry days, 1998-2020) from 1586 adult female caribou across the 19 northwesternmost LPUs. We generated a many-to-many Gaussian Bayesian Network to identify candidate local populations at range-level extents, as well as subpopulations, termed 'communities' in network analysis. We detected local population boundaries that in some cases were consistent with accepted LPUs and consistent with the assumption of geographic closure. In other cases, local population boundaries did not map well to currently delineated LPUs. Several communities at smaller spatial extents were consistent with expert and local knowledge of caribou movements and support recovery planning and actions "stepped down" from entire ranges. Evidence consistent with population fragmentation was confirmed along the southern and southwestern boundaries of the species' geographic range within the study area, as were more continuous distributions confirmed to the north. We suggest that network analysis can help to inform conservation planning for boreal caribou and other wide-ranging species that would benefit from data-driven characterizations of multiscale population spatial structure.

AB  - European wildlife has been subjected to intensifying levels of anthropogenic impact throughout the Holocene, yet the main genetic partitioning of many species is thought to still reflect the late-Pleistocene glacial refugia. We analyzed 26,342 nuclear SNPs of 464 wild boar (Sus scrofa) across the European continent to infer demographic history and reassess the genetic consequences of natural and anthropogenic forces. We found that population fragmentation, inbreeding and recent hybridization with domestic pigs have caused the spatial genetic structure to be heterogeneous at the local scale. Underlying local anthropogenic signatures, we found a deep genetic structure in the form of an arch-shaped cline extending from the Dinaric Alps, via Southeastern Europe and the Baltic states, to Western Europe and, finally, to the genetically diverged Iberian peninsula. These findings indicate that, despite considerable anthropogenic influence, the deeper, natural continental structure is still intact. Regarding the glacial refugia, our findings show a weaker signal than generally assumed, but are nevertheless suggestive of two main recolonization routes, with important roles for Southern France and the Balkans. Our results highlight the importance of applying genomic resources and framing genetic results within a species' demographic history and geographic distribution for a better understanding of the complex mixture of underlying processes.

AB  - Understanding species' responses to upwelling may be especially important in light of ongoing environmental change. Upwelling frequency and intensity are expected to increase in the future, while ocean acidification and deoxygenation are expected to decrease the pH and dissolved oxygen (DO) of upwelled waters. However, the acute effects of a single upwelling event and the integrated effects of multiple upwelling events on marine organisms are poorly understood. Here, we use in situ measurements of pH, temperature, and DO to characterize the covariance of environmental conditions within upwelling-dominated kelp forest ecosystems. We then test the effects of acute (0-3 days) and chronic (1-3 months) upwelling on the performance of two species of kelp forest grazers, the echinoderm, Mesocentrotus franciscanus, and the gastropod, Promartynia pulligo. We exposed organisms to static conditions in a regression design to determine the shape of the relationship between upwelling and performance and provide insights into the potential effects in a variable environment. We found that respiration, grazing, growth, and net calcification decline linearly with increasing upwelling intensity for M. francicanus over both acute and chronic timescales. Promartynia pulligo exhibited decreased respiration, grazing, and net calcification with increased upwelling intensity after chronic exposure, but we did not detect an effect over acute timescales or on growth after chronic exposure. Given the highly correlated nature of pH, temperature, and DO in the California Current, our results suggest the relationship between upwelling intensity and growth in the 3-month trial could potentially be used to estimate growth integrated over long-term dynamic oceanographic conditions for M. franciscanus. Together, these results indicate current exposure to upwelling may reduce species performance and predicted future increases in upwelling frequency and intensity could affect ecosystem function by modifying the ecological roles of key species.

AB  - Increasing the efficiency of rumen fermentation is one of the main ways to maximize the production of ruminants. It is therefore important to understand the ruminal microbiome, as well as environmental influences on that community. However, there are no studies that describe the ruminal microbiota in buffaloes in the Amazon. The objective of this study was to characterize the rumen microbiome of the water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) in the eastern Amazon in the dry and rainy seasons in three grazing ecosystems: Baixo Amazonas (BA), Continente do Para (CP), Ilha do Marajo (IM), and in a confinement system: Tome-Acu (TA). Seventy-one crossbred male buffaloes (Murrah x Mediterranean) were used, aged between 24 and 36 months, with an average weight of 432 kg in the rainy season and 409 kg in the dry season, and fed on native or cultivated pastures. In the confinement system, the feed consisted of sorghum silage, soybean meal, wet sorghum premix, and commercial feed. Samples of the diet from each ecosystem were collected for bromatological analysis. The collections of ruminal content were carried out in slaughterhouses, with the rumen completely emptied and homogenized, the solid and liquid fractions separated, and the ruminal pH measured. DNA was extracted from the rumen samples, then sequenced using Restriction Enzyme Reduced Representation Sequencing. The taxonomic composition was largely similar between ecosystems. All 61 genera in the reference database were recognized, including members of the domains Bacteria and Archaea. The abundance of 23 bacterial genera differed significantly (p < 0.01) between the Tome-Acu confinement and other ecosystems. Bacillus, Ruminococcus, and Bacteroides had lower abundance in samples from the Tome-Acu system. Among the Archaea, the genus Methanomicrobium was less abundant in Tome-Acu, while Methanosarcina was more abundant. There was a difference caused by all evaluated factors, but the diet (available or offered) was what most influenced the ruminal microbiota.

AB  - Transgenic Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) maize has broad prospects for application in China. Before commercialization, it is necessary to assess possible ecological impacts, including impacts on non-target arthropods (NTAs) in the field. In the present study, transgenic Bt maize expressing cry1Ab/2Aj and its corresponding non-transformed near isoline were planted under the same environmental and agricultural conditions, and arthropods in the field were collected during the three main growth stages of maize. In a one year trial, the results showed the composition of NTA communities in the transgenic and control maize fields were similar. There were no significant differences for community-level parameters of species richness (S), Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H'), evenness index (J) and Simpson's dominant concentration (C) between the two types of maize fields. Likewise, a Bray-Curtis dissimilarity and distance analysis showed that Cry1Ab/2Aj toxin exposure did not increase community dissimilarities between Bt and non-Bt maize plots and that the structure of the NTAs community was similar on the two maize varieties. Furthermore, planting of the transgenic cry1Ab/2Aj maize did not affect the density or composition of non-target decomposers, herbivores, predators, parasitoids and pollinator guilds. In summary, our results showed that planting of Bt maize producing Cry1Ab/Cry2Aj proteins do not adversely affect population dynamics and diversity of NTAs.

AB  - ContextThe Adirondack-to-Laurentians (A2L) transboundary wildlife linkage is one of three north-south movement linkages that connect natural areas in northeastern USA and southeastern Canada. This region still retains habitats of high ecological integrity and biodiversity; however, anthropogenic land transformation may be putting transboundary connectivity at risk.ObjectivesWe measured the impacts of anthropogenic land transformation on species-specific habitat amount, fragmentation, and connectivity in the A2L between 2000 and 2015.MethodsWe developed suitable habitat and resistance models for the American black bear (Ursus americanus), fisher (Pekania pennanti), moose (Alces alces), and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) to identify suitable and optimal habitat patches for each species. We quantified habitat amount, fragmentation, and connectivity, and used Linkage Mapper and Circuitscape to map corridors and pinch-points important for connectivity.ResultsIn the A2L between 2000 and 2015, suitable and optimal habitat patch area declined considerably, fragmentation increased, and inter-patch connectivity decreased for each species. Moose and black bear habitat patches experienced the greatest habitat loss, fragmentation, and decline in inter-patch connectivity. The majority of habitat patch area loss and fragmentation occurred in the southern Quebec and Ontario portions.ConclusionsTo achieve long-term functionality of the A2L, collaborative and coordinated measures will be necessary to preserve the integrity of the Quebec mega-patch, restore extensive habitat in eastern Ontario, and reestablish or maintain connectivity throughout the linkage. Left unaddressed, continued anthropogenic land transformation is likely to have detrimental effects on the ability of the A2L to function as a transboundary wildlife linkage.

AB  - Plant damage by invertebrate herbivores and pathogens influences the dynamics of grassland ecosystems, but anthropogenic changes in nitrogen and phosphorus availability can modify these relationships. Using a globally distributed experiment, we describe leaf damage on 153 plant taxa from 27 grasslands worldwide, under ambient conditions and with experimentally elevated nitrogen and phosphorus. Invertebrate damage significantly increased with nitrogen addition, especially in grasses and non-leguminous forbs. Pathogen damage increased with nitrogen in grasses and legumes but not forbs. Effects of phosphorus were generally weaker. Damage was higher in grasslands with more precipitation, but climatic conditions did not change effects of nutrients on leaf damage. On average, invertebrate damage was relatively higher on legumes and pathogen damage was relatively higher on grasses. Community-weighted mean damage reflected these functional group patterns, with no effects of N on community-weighted pathogen damage (due to opposing responses of grasses and forbs) but stronger effects of N on community-weighted invertebrate damage (due to consistent responses of grasses and forbs). Synthesis. As human-induced inputs of nitrogen and phosphorus continue to increase, understanding their impacts on invertebrate and pathogen damage becomes increasingly important. Our results demonstrate that eutrophication frequently increases plant damage and that damage increases with precipitation across a wide array of grasslands. Invertebrate and pathogen damage in grasslands is likely to increase in the future, with potential consequences for plant, invertebrate and pathogen communities, as well as the transfer of energy and nutrients across trophic levels.

AB  - Aerial drone systems are now widely used to survey wildlife, but validation in the detectability of individuals is rarely assessed. This knowledge gap is critical, given the influence of local environments on wildlife detectability from the air. In this study, we integrated Animal Biotelemetry technology with aerial drones to evaluate the temporal and environmental factors influencing animal detection probability and subsequent population estimates. Wild-caught feral pigs (Sus scrofa) were fitted with GPS tracking collars and releasing them into a large natural habitat enclosure in northern Australia. Utilizing a fixed-wing drone equipped with a dual camera (thermal infrared and RGB), we conducted multiple flights over the study area during both wet and dry seasons, from sunrise to sunset. The study found that the probability that a pig was visible in aerial imagery was highly variable depending on the timing of the aerial survey. Detection probability was at its lowest during mid-afternoon (5 to 20%), while the early evening yielded the highest detection probability (50 to 75%). We observed seasonal differences, with detection probabilities exceeding 50% in the mornings of the wet season, in contrast to less than 30% during the dry season. Temporal trends in detection probability were similar in both thermal infrared and RGB imagery. The GPS location data enabled us to assess how localized factors (canopy cover, land cover, ambient temperature) altered animal detection probability. This information facilitated the identification of survey times to maximize feral pig detection and the development of a correction factor to account for non-detected individuals at specific times and locations. The study demonstrates the value of integrating Animal Biotelemetry technology and aerial drones to account for variations in detection probability when undertaking wildlife aerial surveys. Insights gained from this approach have implications for enhancing the accuracy of population assessments and contributing to more effective wildlife management and conservation.

AB  - Climate change will profoundly alter the physiology and ecology of plants, insect herbivores, and their natural enemies, resulting in strong effects on multitrophic interactions. Yet, manipulative studies that investigate the direct combined impacts of changes in CO2, temperature, and precipitation on the third trophic level remain rare. Here, we assessed how exposure to elevated CO2, increased temperature, and decreased precipitation directly affect the performance and predation success of species from four major groups of herbivore natural enemies: an entomopathogenic nematode, a wolf spider, a ladybug, and a parasitoid wasp. A four-day exposure to future climatic conditions (RCP 8.5), entailing a 28% decrease in precipitation, a 3.4 degrees C raise in temperature, and a 400 ppm increase in CO2 levels, slightly reduced the survival of entomopathogenic nematodes, but had no effect on the survival of other species. Predation success was not negatively affected in any of the tested species, but it was even increased for wolf spiders and entomopathogenic nematodes. Factorial manipulation of climate variables revealed a positive effect of reduced soil moisture on nematode infectivity, but not of increased temperature or elevated CO2. These results suggest that natural enemies of herbivores may be well adapted to short-term changes in climatic conditions. These findings provide mechanistic insights that will inform future efforts to disentangle the complex interplay of biotic and abiotic factors that drive climate-dependent changes in multitrophic interaction networks.

AB  - Translocations have become an essential tool in animal conservation for establishing and maintaining viable populations. Yet, the viability of a population is implicitly based on the individual fitness, that is on the survival and reproduction of individuals. Individual-based assessments of post-translocation fitness are challenging in the wild while conservation breeding programs may provide vital insights. Long-term breeding records of semi-captive (fenced) small population of the Western Derby eland (Taurotragus derbianus derbianus) running in two fenced reserves in Senegal present a case study. This study shows that transport distance and the individual's age at translocation influence animal post-translocation survival rates and individual reproductive performance. The most critical period for the antelope's post-translocation survival was the first 2 years following the event, with higher mortalities reported after long-distance transport in an ecologically novel environment. The first successful calving of translocated females was postponed by 1 year, but the life-long reproductive performance was not affected. However, higher calf survival in a habitat similar to that in the wild suggests a non-negligible effect of the habitat on individual fitness, thus crucial to conservation decisions on translocating threatened species.

AB  - . The microbiome plays an important role in human health and biodiversity conservation. However, the gut microbial composition of many wild animals is still unknown due to the difficulty in sampling. To explore and describe the microbiome of white-lipped deer, we conducted 18S rRNA gene sequencing and analyzed the gut eukaryotes in 20 fecal samples in both GBJD (white-lipped deer populations from Gongbujiangda White-lipped deer National Nature Reserve) and ND (Naidong district) regions of Xizang, China. From a total of 161.78G clean data, 313 genera were identified, belonging to 25 phyla. Nematoda, Evosea, Basidiomycota, Cercozoa, and Ascomycota were the dominant phyla in GBJD, while Evosea, Nematoda, Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and Cercozoa were dominant in ND. Moreover, alpha diversity indexes differed significantly between the two regions (ACE: p = 0.000; Sobs: p = 0.001; Chao1: p = 0.001; Shannon: p = 0.038). Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis indicated significant differences in the beta diversity of the gut eukaryotes between the two regions. These results showed that the composition and the alpha and beta diversity of the gut eukaryotes in white-lipped deer differed significantly between GBJD and ND. Additionally, food resources and human disturbance could impact the composition and diversity of gut eukaryotes in wild white-lipped deer. Our results suggested that gut eukaryotes can facilitate their host to adapt to different environments during the coevolution with their hosts.

AB  - 1. According to risk-sensitive foraging theory, animals should make foraging decisions that balance nutritional costs and gains to promote fitness. Human disturbance is a form of perceived risk that can prompt avoidance of risky habitat over acquisition of food. Consequently, behavioural responses to perceived risk could induce nutritional costs.
   2. Population declines often coincide with increases in human disturbance, which likely is associated with direct and indirect habitat loss. Nevertheless, behavioural and physiological responses to perceived risks associated with human disturbance could be an added nutritional deficit with population-level repercussions.
   3. Using GPS-collar data from three populations of migratory mule deer Odocoileus hemionus exposed to a gradient of established industrial energy development on winter ranges where direct and indirect habitat loss were well documented, we evaluated whether exposure and behavioural responses to human disturbance alter changes in nutritional condition (i.e. fat reserves) over winter.
   4. Although animals exhibited behaviours indicative of perceived risk of human disturbance, such as increased movement rates and avoidance of infrastructure, exposure and behavioural responses to human disturbance had little to no measurable effect on fat loss over a winter. Instead, catabolism of fat reserves occurred primarily as a function of the amount of fat animals had entering winter, suggesting that, in the short term, animals were able to mitigate the energetic costs of perceived risk of human disturbance over winter. Animals, however, did not appear to overcome persistent food limitations, and animals with less food availability lost more fat over winter.
   5. Our findings heed caution in using short-term behavioural and physiological responses to inform long-term nutritional consequences of human disturbance. Although animals appear to mitigate the energetic costs of perceived risk, food limitations exacerbated by broader-scale avoidance of food near human disturbance may be the primary pathway causing the frequently observed population declines following human disturbance to pristine landscapes.

AB  - Conservation translocations-the intentional movement of animals to restore populations-have increased over the past 30 years to halt and reverse species declines and losses. However, there are many challenges translocated animals face that should be considered for restoration programs to be successful. Understanding how long it takes for translocated animals to acclimate to these challenges and their new landscape is a critical component of post-release population management. Physiological measures such as hormone responses are increasingly used to assess animal responses and acclimation to disturbances including translocation. We determined the physiological acclimation period of elk (Cervus canadensis) translocated to the Missouri Ozarks, USA, as part of a restoration effort. From 2011 to 2013, we translocated 108 GPS-radio-collared elk from Kentucky, USA, to Missouri, USA, and collected faecal samples for glucocorticoid metabolite extraction to use as an indicator of physiological acclimation. We modelled the response of population-wide faecal glucocorticoid metabolites (fGCMs) across the initial 9 years of the restoration in response to days following release and additional site-specific covariates. Presence of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) hunts and monthly precipitation levels were positively and negatively associated with fGCM levels, respectively. Concurrent with influences from site-specific conditions on the release landscape, fGCM levels declined following release. We identified a breakpoint in fGCM decline at similar to 42 days following translocation releases suggesting elk acclimated physiologically relatively quickly compared to other species. The fast physiological acclimation by Missouri elk suggests effective use of temporary post-release management efforts. Determining how quickly animals acclimate following translocations allows researchers to tailor post-release management plans to each species' needs, thus maximizing the success of future translocation efforts while minimizing costs.

AB  - Climate change through an increase in temperature and a reduction of rainfall constitutes a serious threat to the African savannah elephants Loxodonta africana Cuvier. Climate change can directly shrink suitable habitats of the main food resources of elephants; hence reducing their food availability. In this study, we assessed the present-day and future suitable habitat for 14 tree and shrub species previously identified as main components of the elephant diet in the W-Arli-Pendjari-Oti-Mandouri-Keran (WAPOK) ecosystem, the largest savannah ecosystem in West-Africa. Bioclimatic and soil data were used to build the present-day and future models under two representative concentration pathway scenarios: RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. We further explicitly accounted for dispersal constraints and compared "actually" colonized habitats to suitable habitats based on the traditional assumption of unlimited dispersal. Mean diurnal temperature range, isothermality, temperature seasonality, annual temperature range, annual precipitation, number of dry months, and soil were the seven most important drivers of the distribution of the species. However, their relative importance varied greatly among species. Nevertheless, the annual precipitation had a high contribution (47-77 %) for nine out of the 14 species (similar to 65 %). Compared to present-day, results showed a moderate decrease in suitable habitats for seven out of the 14 species under scenarios RCP4.5 (1.30 - 12.95 %) and RCP8.5 (1.89 - 17.21 %). The remaining species, namely, Tamarindus indica, Annona senegalensis, Vitex doniana, Vachellia sieberiana, Kigelia africana, Adansonia digitata, and Borassus aethiopum will experience an increase of 2.97 - 51.68 % (RCP45) and (2.58 - 53.55 %) (RCP85) of their suitable habitats. Incorporation of dispersal constraints in the models showed that 9.26 - 48.26 % of currently suitable habitats will be occupied with the lowest and highest values for T. indica and A. digitata respectively. Top five species with moderate probabilities (35-48 %) to colonize and occupy suitable habitats included A. digitata, followed by V. sieberiana, V. doniana, D. microcarpum, P. erinaceus, and P. biglobosa. Species with the lowest probability to colonize suitable habitats were V. paradoxa, followed by K. africana, Khaya senegalensis, Balanites aegyptiaca, B. aethiopum, and T. indica. This study shows that climate change by reducing the availability of some food resources may shift diet of African savanna elephants. It further indicated that dispersal constraint is important in habitat suitability modeling. Finally, it provides valuable information on the potential impacts of climate change on key food resources of savannah elephants which can guide conservation and management actions in the WAPOK ecosystem.

AB  - Alpine ecosystems are vulnerable to the warming climate, yet alpine soil mesofauna remains the less studied part of NZ biodiversity. Here we present a survey of soil mesofauna communities of three mountain peaks in the Nelson-Tasman and Marlborough regions of the South Island of New Zealand. We assessed changes in abundance, diversity and trophic composition along the elevational gradient from subalpine forests to alpine herb fields (800-1600 m a.s.l.) and analysed the influence of selected environmental factors on mesofauna. Taxon richness was expected to decrease and the proportion of predators to increase in alpine habitats, as has been observed elsewhere. Sub-alpine beech forests harboured a high diversity of soil mesofauna, many of which are Gondwanan relics. There was a decline in abundance and taxonomic richness of mesofauna with increasing elevation. However, no proportional increase in predators with increasing elevation was seen - alpine mesofauna assemblages had lower predator-to-herbivore ratios than upland forests. Several interesting taxa - harpacticoid copepods, moss bugs (Hemiptera: Peloridiidae), unique-headed bugs (Hemiptera: Enicocephalomorpha), micro-spiders, mite harvestmen, Neelidae springtails and acarifauna are discussed in more detail. Baseline data such as these advance the knowledge of native fauna and provide a baseline for ecological monitoring in the alpine zone.

AB  - Background Water buffalo is a cornerstone livestock species in many low- and middle-income countries, yet major gaps persist in its genomic characterization-complicated by the divergent karyotypes of its two subspecies (swamp and river). Such genomic complexity makes water buffalo a particularly good candidate for the use of graph genomics, which can capture variation missed by linear reference approaches. However, the utility of this approach to improve water buffalo has been largely unexplored.Results We present a comprehensive pangenome that integrates 4 newly generated, highly contiguous assemblies of Pakistani river buffalo with 8 publicly available assemblies from both subspecies. This doubles the number of accessible high-quality river buffalo genomes and provides the most contiguous assemblies for the subspecies to date. Using the pangenome to assay variation across 711 global samples, we uncovered extensive genomic diversity, including thousands of large structural variants absent from the reference genome, spanning over 140 Mb of additional sequence. We demonstrate the utility of these data by identifying putative functional indels and structural variants linked to selective sweeps in key genes involved in productivity and immune response across 26 populations.Conclusions This study represents one of the first successful applications of graph genomics in water buffalo and offers valuable insights into how integrating assemblies can transform analyses of water buffalo and other species with complex evolutionary histories. We anticipate that these assemblies, as well as the pangenome and putative functional structural variants we have released, will accelerate efforts to unlock water buffalo's genetic potential, improving productivity and resilience in this economically important species.

AB  - Aim Our goal was to quantify nitrogen flows and stocks in green-brown food webs in different ecosystems, how they differ across ecosystems and how they respond to nutrient enrichment. Location Global. Time period Contemporary. Major taxa studied Plants, phytoplankton, macroalgae, invertebrates, vertebrates and zooplankton. Methods Data from >500 studies were combined to estimate nitrogen stocks and fluxes in green-brown food webs in forests, grasslands, brackish environments, seagrass meadows, lakes and oceans. We compared the stocks, fluxes and metabolic rates of different functional groups within each food web. We also used these estimates to build a dynamical model to test the response of the ecosystems to nutrient enrichment. Results We found surprising symmetries between the green and brown channels across ecosystems, in their stocks, fluxes and consumption coefficients and mortality rates. We also found that nitrogen enrichment, either organic or inorganic, can disrupt this balance between the green and brown channels. Main conclusions Linking green and brown food webs reveals a previously hidden symmetry between herbivory and detritivory, which appears to be a widespread property of natural ecosystems but can be disrupted by anthropogenic nitrogen additions.

AB  - Conservation of large mammals inhabiting steep and rugged terrain in high elevations presents unique challenges for collection of demographic and ecological information to serve the conservation efforts. Studies that utilize capturing of wildlife provide valuable information on the biology of the species, including otherwise inaccessible information on the relation of the species with its habitat. However, capturing wildlife also presents unique challenges in terms of effort and budget allocation and animal welfare. In this study, capturing of nine individuals of the near threatened (NT) wild goat (Capra aegagrus) was done using two methods: clover trap and drop net. These methods were compared by evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of each method. According to the results of the study, clover trap method prevailed, when animal welfare, field effort, ease of capture area selection, budget, and technological constraints were taken into account. On the other hand, drop net method was found as the better alternative, considering multiple captures and ease of habituation to trap site. The findings of this study offer valuable insights to guide researchers and to prepare them for challenges that they may encounter in their studies involving capturing of large herbivores such as wild goat.

AB  - Muskellunge (Esox masquinongy Mitchill), northern pike (Esox lucius L.) and walleye (Sander vitreus Mitchill) often coexist in lake communities, yet uncertainty exists about the potential for interspecific competition among these top predators. Stable isotope data were used to assess niche overlap and diets of these predators in Elk Lake (Minnesota, U.S.A). delta C-13 indicated primary production sources (e.g. pelagic v. littoral) and delta N-15 indicated trophic position; the bivariate distribution of these isotopes defined the species' isotopic niche. Niche overlap probabilities were calculated and stable isotope mixing models were used to quantify diet proportions. Muskellunge and northern pike niches overlapped little (<10%), while walleye overlapped muskellunge (15%-60%) and northern pike (33%-53%) more extensively. Muskellunge diets focused (50%) on cisco (Coregonus artedi Lesueur), walleye primarily assimilated non-cisco prey fish (80%), and northern pike diets were dominated by non-cisco prey fish (45%) and invertebrates (40%). The presence of a cisco population and the flexibility of northern pike to use invertebrate resources may decrease potential competition among these predators. However, cisco are threatened by climate change and eutrophication, and our results suggest that extirpation of cisco may cause major changes in potential competitive interactions among these top predators. Moreover, cisco were unique among prey species in their ability to exploit pelagic energy, such that loss of cisco will likely alter energy flow in lake food webs where they currently exist.

AB  - Aims Herbivores create large differences in litter decomposition rates, but identifying how they do this can be difficult because they simultaneously influence both biotic and abiotic factors. In the Yukon-Kuskokwim (Y-K) River Delta in western Alaska, geese are dominant herbivores in wet-sedge meadows, where they create 'grazing lawns' that have nutrient-rich litter and an open habitat structure. To understand how geese affect decomposition, we tested the effects of litter quality and habitat type on litter decomposition over one year. Methods We performed a litter bag study in which we collected two litter types representing grazed and ungrazed vegetation conditions (high quality litter similar to grazed litter, and lower quality senesced, ungrazed litter), then incubated them in 'grazing lawn' and ungrazed meadows. Litter mass loss, carbon, nitrogen, cellulose and lignin content were measured after 3, 6, 9, and 52 weeks. We also monitored abiotic conditions (i.e., soil temperature, UV radiation, throughfall, and soil moisture content) in each habitat type. Results High-quality litter (lower lignin:N ratios) lost more mass than low-quality ungrazed litter over the whole study. However, at different times during the decomposition process, lower quality litter decomposed faster in grazed habitat, whereas higher quality litter decomposed faster in ungrazed habitat. This occurred despite abiotic conditions in grazed habitat that generally promote faster decomposition. Conclusion Results suggest that herbivore-induced increases in litter quality increase decomposition rates, and that the accumulation of the low-quality litter in ungrazed habitats is partly due to slow decomposition rates. While herbivores influence habitat conditions, the effects of habitat on decomposition differed across litter qualities, which suggests that other variables, such as differing microbial communities, play a role in decomposition processes.

AB  - Species spatiotemporal responses to human presence and prioritizing conservation areas are essential for effective management and conservation planning. To address this information, we conducted a long-term large mammal survey in both protected areas (PAs) and outside of PAs (non-PA) in Northern Mountain Forest Complex (NMFC), Myanmar by using 174 camera traps from 2015 to 2019. We selected 14 common species for the single species occupancy model and activity pattern analysis to evaluate their spatiotemporal responses to different anthropogenic and environmental variables. Results showed that human presence did not have a significant impact on mammal occupancy, whereas at the community level, it had a significant influence on mammal abundance. Some variables, including distance to settlements, proximity to water sources and forest cover, shaped the habitat occupancy of mammals in NMFC. Regarding the temporal axis, only three out of 14 species had higher temporal activity overlap with humans, while the remaining species showed lower to medium overlap in both PAs and non-PA, confirming that most mammals avoided human presence through temporal rather than spatial scale. Moreover, our priority analysis revealed that non-PA supported a significant proportion of mediumto high-priority areas, particularly in the south-eastern part of NMFC. We concluded that preserving both PAs and non-PA are crucial and human activities have an implicit influence on large mammal conservation in NMFC. The government should prioritize the south-eastern region of outside of the current PAs network and adopt community-based conservation strategies to ensure the efficacy of PA networks and biodiversity conservation in NMFC.

AB  - Context. Overabundant ungulate populations frequently cause ecological and economic damage and are difficult to control. Sustained culling efforts at El Palmar National Park have largely reduced wild boar (Sus scrofa) numbers and damage but have failed to halt the ever-increasing abundance of axis deer (Axis axis) for undefined reasons. Multi-year camera-trap surveys indicated a mismatch between deer core activity and the usual timing of hunting sessions. Aim. We used the spatial and temporal forms of Taylor's law (TL, a power relationship between the sample mean and sample variance) to test whether overnight hunting sessions are more effective for culling axis deer and wild boar than are daytime sessions, and assessed whether they modify ungulate harvest composition. Methods. We implemented a quasi-experimental trial (i.e. 'experiments in which units are not assigned to conditions randomly'), including nine alternating blocks of four to seven hunting sessions each (overnight or daytime) in which an average of 42 hunter groups performed controlled shooting over bait from fixed elevated blinds, retrieved, sexed, weighed and measured all quarry. Key results. The relationship between the mean and variance of ungulate crude catch per hunting-party session and crude catch per unit effort (CPUE, where effort is measured in hunting-party hours) by hunting shift satisfied the spatial and temporal TL. On average, axis deer catch was 2.39-2.61 times greater in overnight than in daytime sessions, whereas CPUE indices were 1.54-1.73 times greater. For wild boar, overnight sessions returned catches similar to (0.94-1.03x), and a significantly lower CPUE (0.63-0.67x) than for daytime sessions. The harvest indices were substantially aggregated in daytime sessions only, and were consistently skewed towards yearlings or subadults and males, especially among adult deer. Overnight sessions culled proportionally more adults and more pregnant hinds and sows than did daytime sessions, and significantly heavier deer and wild boar males. Conclusions. Overnight sessions were substantially more effective for culling deer than were daytime sessions, and selected for individuals with greater fitness. Stage- and male-skewed harvest most likely explains the steady population growth of axis deer despite increasing hunting pressure over a decade.

AB  - The extinction of large-bodied terrestrial 'megafauna' during earlier phases of the Quaternary had a significant impact on the transforming structure of ecosystems. However, the causes of such losses remains difficult to determine in part because of a paucity of reliable geochronological information about the taxa involved. This is especially true for continents such as Australia where the majority of extinct species have never been dated using radiometric and/or luminescence methods. Here we add new understanding about the geochronology of the world's largest-ever marsupial, the giant wombat-like Diprotodon optatum, an iconic member of the large herbivore guild of Pleistocene Australia. We present 28 new direct U-series ages (dentine) and 10 luminescence ages (sediments) for D. optatum fossils from three sites in tropical north and subtropical eastern Australia. The luminescence ages lie close to saturation for the tropical northern site of Floraville and therefore indicate minimum ages, and sediments from Gowrie Creek in the Darling Downs were mixed and can only be stated as a likely age range. Nevertheless the results assist in our broader understanding of the timing of persistence of the species. Our results demonstrate that the species roamed the northern tropics at least until the mid-Pleistocene (ca. 420 ka). They likely remained widespread during Marine Isotope Stage 5 (ca. 110 ka) and were abundant on the Darling Downs of eastern Australia. The youngest of the new ages that we report (ca. 60 ka) are from Neds Gully on the Darling Downs, a catchment previously considered by some to contain among the last survivors of the now-extinct megafauna. The new dated record demonstrates that deposits of varying ages occur within the catchment. Consequently, existing species lists that treat Neds Gully as a single faunal assemblage are likely significantly time-averaged and overinflated in terms of palaeo-diversity.

AB  - Along the northern Mid-Atlantic Ridge (nMAR), in habitats under moderate (<10 degrees C) hydrothermal influence on the Snake Pit vent field (SP), large assemblages dominated by Bathymodiolin mussels remain poorly characterised, contrary to those in warmer habitats dominated by gastropods and alvinocaridid shrimps that were recently described. In this study, we assessed and compared the population structure, biomass, diversity and trophic interactions of two Bathymodiolus puteoserpentis assemblages and their associated fauna at SP. Three sampling units distanced by 30 cm were sampled in 2014 during the BICOSE cruise at the top of the Moose site ("Elan"site), while few meters further down three others, distanced by similar to 1 m were obtained in 2018 during the BICOSE 2 cruise at the edifice's base. We observed a micro-scale heterogeneity between these six sampling units partially explained by temperature variations, proximity to hydrothermal fluids and position on the edifice. Meiofauna dominate or co-dominate most of the sampling units, with higher densities at the base of the edifice. In terms of macrofauna, high abundance of Pseudorimula midatlantica gastropods was observed at the top of the vent edifice, while numerous Ophioctenella acies ophiuroids were found at the base. Contrary to what was expected, the apparent health and abundance of mussels seems to indicate a current climax stage of the community. However, the modification of B. puteoserpentis isotopic signatures, low number of juveniles decreasing over the two years and observations made during several French cruises in the study area raise questions about the fate of the B. puteoserpentis population over time, which remains to be verified in a future sampling campaign.

AB  - This study was conducted in the dry areas of the northern Algerian Sahara; The northwest of the El-Oued region, this northern zone of the Sahara presents a very diverse floristic procession. The study of the flora of this region, over five (5) years (2019 to 2023), allowed us to record 85 species belonging to 68 genera and 29 families. The Asteraceae family was represented by 16.47% different species followed by Amaranthaceae at 14.12%, Poaceae at 12.94%, and Brassicaceae at 7.06%. The most frequent life forms are Therophytes (42.35%) followed by Chamaephytes (30.59%), Hemicryptophytes 14.12% and Phanerophytes 7.06%. the biological forms that characterize this herbaceous and bushy desert vegetation are the ability to resist the scarcity of water, silting, higher salinity levels, and high temperatures in this area. The distribution of species is heterogeneous from one site to another due to different chemical and physical soil conditions, notably gypsum, limestone, salts, silting, and dunes. Land reclamation programs and excessive overgrazing by stray camels have put some species in danger of extinction, including Fabaceae and Apiaceae. A notable decrease in specific richness is recorded in this dry region, Shannon's index recorded a decrease from 0.266 in Still to 0.159 in Hamraia due in particular to climate and conditions.

AB  - There is a demand for more progressive restoration directives to regenerate forest ecosystems impacted by harvesting, wildfire, insect outbreaks, and mineral resource extraction. Forest restoration may take many decades and even centuries without active silvicultural intervention to grow large trees that provide suitable habitat for various wildlife species. We tested the hypotheses (H) that, compared with unmanaged (unthinned and old-growth) stands, large-scale precommercial thinning (heavy thinning to <500 stems/ha) of young lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia), at 20-25 years post-treatment, would enhance: (H-1) the architecture of large overstory trees (e.g., diameter, height, and crown dimensions); (H-2) mean (i) total abundance and species diversity of forest-floor small mammals, (ii) abundance of tree squirrels; and (H-3) relative habitat use by mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus). There were three levels of thinning with mean densities of crop trees/ha: 353 (low), 712 (medium) and 1288 (high), an unthinned, and old-growth stand replicated at three areas in south-central British Columbia, Canada. Mammal abundance and habitat use were measured during the period 2013 to 2015. Mean diameter of crop trees was significantly different among stands with the low-density, medium-density, and old-growth stands having diameters larger than the high-density and unthinned stands. Mean height of crop trees was highest in the old-growth stands. Mean crown volume of crop trees was significantly different among stands with the low-density stands 2.1 to 5.8 times higher than the high-density, unthinned, and old-growth stands, and hence partial support for H-1. Mean total abundance of forest-floor small mammals was significantly different among stands with the low-density and old-growth stands 1.9 to 2.4 times higher than the other three treatment stands. Mean abundances per stand of the red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) (range of 4.8 to 12.0) and the northern flying squirrel (Glaucomys sabrinus) (range of 3.2 to 4.3) were similar among stands. Mean relative habitat use by mule deer was similar among stands, but variable with counts of pellet-groups/ha in the thinned stands were 3.8 to 4.2 and 2.1 to 2.3 times higher than the unthinned and old-growth stands, respectively. Thus, mean total abundance of forest-floor small mammals of H-2 was supported, but species diversity and abundance of tree squirrels was not. Enhanced relative habitat use by mule deer (H-3) was not supported. To our knowledge, this is the first concurrent measurement of several mammal species in heavily thinned, unthinned, and old-growth forest across three replicate study areas at 20-25 years post-treatment. Although not all mammal responses were significant, there was a strong indication that restored forests via heavy thinning (<500 trees/ha) produced large overstory trees (at least for diameter and crown dimensions) in stands 33 to 42 years old. Comparable old-growth stands, albeit with crop trees of greater height and merchantable volume, ranged from 120 to 167 years of age. Restored forests with large trees capable of supporting at least these mammal species may be achieved in decades rather than centuries.

AB  - Freshwater megafish species, such as sturgeons, salmonids, carps, and catfishes, have a maximum reported weight >= 30 kg. Due to their charisma and economic value, they have been widely introduced outside of their native ranges. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the introduction of freshwater megafish and an assessment of their environmental impacts. Of the 134 extant freshwater megafish species, 46% have been introduced to new environments, and of these, 69% have established self-sustaining alien populations. These introductions affect 59% of the world's main basins, with the USA and western Europe being particular hotspots of megafish introductions. The common carp (Cyprinus carpio) is the most widely introduced species. Using the Environmental Impact Classification for Alien Taxa (EICAT and EICAT+) frameworks, we assessed the severity and type of negative and positive impacts posed by alien megafish on native species. Alien megafish caused negative impacts through nine different mechanisms, with predation being the most frequently reported mechanism, followed by herbivory and competition. Moreover, 58% of the alien megafish species with sufficient data to evaluate the severity of their impacts caused declining populations of native species, or worse, extirpations of native species populations. The positive environmental impacts of alien megafish were far less frequently documented. They include biotic interactions that benefit native species, and the provision of trophic resources or habitats. Widely introduced or extensively studied species are more likely to have documented severe impacts on native species. There is a clear trade-off between the economic benefits associated with megafish introductions and the severe adverse impacts they have on native biodiversity. Our study highlights the need for comprehensive risk assessments to evaluate the potential environmental impacts of megafish. More research and long-term monitoring schemes are required to inform management actions to protect biodiversity, particularly in the Global South.

AB  - Nutrient enrichment is widespread throughout grassland systems and expected to increase during the Anthropocene. Trophic interactions, like aboveground herbivory, have been shown to mitigate its effect on plant diversity. Belowground herbivory may also impact these habitats' response to nutrient enrichment, but its influence is much less understood, and likely to depend on factors such as the herbivores' preference for dominant species and the symmetry of belowground competition. If preferential toward the dominant, fastest growing species, root herbivores may reduce these species' relative fitness and support diversity during nutrient enrichment. However, as plant competition belowground is commonly considered to be symmetric, root herbivores may be less impactful than shoot herbivores because they do not reduce any competitive asymmetry between the dominant and subordinate plants. To better understand this system, we used an established, two-layer, grassland community model to run a full-factorially designed simulation experiment, crossing the complete removal of aboveground herbivores and belowground herbivores with nutrient enrichment. After 100 yr of simulation, we analyzed communities' diversity, competition on the individual level, as well as their resistance and recovery. The model reproduced both observed general effects of nutrient enrichment in grasslands and the short-term trends of specific experiments. We found that belowground herbivores exacerbate the negative influence of nutrient enrichment on Shannon diversity within our model grasslands, while aboveground herbivores mitigate its effect. Indeed, data on individuals' above- and belowground resource uptake reveals that root herbivory reduces resource limitation belowground. As with nutrient enrichment, this shifts competition aboveground. Since shoot competition is asymmetric, with larger, taller individuals gathering disproportionate resources compared to their smaller, shorter counterparts, this shift promotes the exclusion of the smallest species. While increasing the root herbivores' preferences toward dominant species lessens their negative impact, at best they are only mildly advantageous, and they do very little reduce the negative consequences of nutrient enrichment. Because our model's belowground competition is symmetric, we hypothesize that root herbivores may be beneficial when root competition is asymmetric. Future research into belowground herbivory should account for the nature of competition belowground to better understand the herbivores' true influence.

AB  - This study investigated the gut microbiota of yaks in the extreme conditions of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Using amplicon sequencing, 13,683 bacterial and 1912 fungal variants were identified, revealing distinct microbial structures in yaks from different altitudes and temperatures. Firmicutes, Bacteroidota, and Actinobacteriota were dominant bacterial phyla, while Ascomycota and uncultured fungi dominated the fungal community. Certain genera like UCG-005, Christensenellaceae_R-7_group, and Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group were prevalent in specific regions. Statistical analysis highlighted significant differences in microbial composition and metabolic functions, particularly in digestive systems at different altitudes. Notably, microbial diversity, richness, and specific genera varied across regions, suggesting the adaptability of yak gut microbiota to high-altitude conditions. This study sheds light on the significant impact of altitude and temperature on yak gut microbiota, offering valuable insights into their adaptability in extreme environments. Despite the crucial role of the gut microbiota in different physiological processes occurring in the animal body, reports regarding the gut microbiota of animals residing in different environmental conditions like high altitude and different climate settings are limited. The Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau is renowned for its extreme climatic conditions that provide an ideal environment for exploring the effects of high altitude and temperature on the microbiota of animals. Yaks have unique oxygen delivery systems and genes related to hypoxic response. Damxung, Ny & ecirc;mo, and Linzhou counties in Tibet have variable altitudes and temperatures that offer distinct settings for studying yak adaptation to elevated terrains. The results of our study suggest that amplicon sequencing of V3-V4 and internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) regions yielded 13,683 bacterial and 1912 fungal amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). Alpha and beta diversity indicated distinct microbial structures. Dominant bacterial phyla were Firmicutes, Bacteroidota, and Actinobacteriota. Genera UCG-005, Christensenellaceae_R-7_group, and Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group were dominant in confined yaks living in Damxung county (DXS) and yaks living in Linzhou county (LZS), whereas UCG-005 prevailed in confined yaks living in Ny & ecirc;mo county (NMS). The linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) analysis highlighted genus-level differences. Meta-stat analysis revealed significant shifts in bacterial and fungal community composition in yaks at different high altitudes and temperatures. Bacterial taxonomic analysis revealed that two phyla and 32 genera differed significantly (p < 0.05). Fungal taxonomic analysis revealed that three phyla and four genera differed significantly (p < 0.05). Functional predictions indicated altered metabolic functions, especially in the digestive system of yaks living in NMS. This study reveals significant shifts in yak gut microbiota in response to varying environmental factors, such as altitude and temperature, shedding light on previously unexplored aspects of yak physiology in extreme environments.

AB  - How easily can we obtain optimal trade-offs between conflicting ecosystem services (ES)? We studied this question by crossing metrics of optimality and robustness in a model simulating sheep/cattle mixed-grazing (mixed-grazing is grazing by more than one species). We hypothesized that mixed-grazing processes (complementary use of vegetation and parasitism reduction) would improve ES bundles by increasing meat production with limited additional environmental costs. We assessed bundle optimality with a production possibility frontier and robustness through a management density approach (bundles can be obtained by one or several management decisions). We modeled two provisioning and two regulating ESs and confirmed that mixed-grazing can potentially improve the monetary value of bundles. Optimal bundles were the most robust, because of the shape of the biological function driving animal growth, according to the sheep/cattle ratio. This function is humpshaped with a plateau that buffers small ratio deviations. It makes bundles optimal or quasi-optimal over a wide range of management decisions, which eases their optimization. For this reason, based on the principles of ergonomics and the definition of the adjective operable ('capable of being put into use, operation, or practice'), we considered mixed-grazing a 'Biologically Operable' practice.

AB  - The frequency and duration of marine heat waves (MHWs) have recently increased. There is therefore an urgent need to understand the response of marine organisms to MHWs. However, most estimates of MHW impacts on abundances include the effects of environmental stochasticity other than the MHWs. In addition, although MHWs sometimes persist for year-round or occur repeatedly for shorter periods, the accumulative carryover effects (ACEs)- the effects of sequential events accumulating additively over time- of MHWs on organisms have never been evaluated. Furthermore, the relationship between species niche traits other than thermal niches and susceptibility to MHWs is unknown. We examined the impacts of MHWs in southeastern Hokkaido, northern Japan, in summer from 2010 to 2016 on rocky intertidal communities by distinguishing MHW effects from environmental stochasticity. We asked (1) Did MHWs have ACEs on four major functional groups: macroalgae, sessile invertebrates, herbivorous invertebrates, and carnivorous invertebrates? (2) Does ignoring ACEs lead to biased assessments? (3) How did the effects of the MHWs on functional groups and their subsequent recovery differ? And (4) How does the susceptibility to MHWs differ with species niche (thermal and vertical) traits? We detected ACEs of MHWs and found that if they are ignored, the effects of MHWs can be underestimated. Although MHWs are known to reduce the abundance of macroalgae and increase that of sessile invertebrates in rocky intertidal habitats, our results show that macroalgal abundance increased during and after MHWs, whereas sessile invertebrates showed no change during or after MHWs. The abundance of herbivorous mollusks decreased during and after MHWs. Carnivorous invertebrates declined during MHWs and in the first year after MHWs. During and after MHWs, abundances of species with low thermal niches decreased and those with high thermal niches increased. There were no differences in response to MHWs between vertical niches when accumulative carryover effects were ignored. These results emphasize the importance of considering ACEs when assessing the response of marine organisms to MHWs, and that more studies of these responses are needed for a variety of ecosystems, regions and organisms to predict the responses of marine organisms.

AB  - Our own species, Homo sapiens, has been able to invade near-all global ecosystems through a unique form of ecological plasticity. To understand how Homo sapiens have been able to disperse to such a wide range of environments, we need to understand the origins of the characteristic which enabled this, plasticity. Growing evidence indicates that Homo species were already able to occupy a diverse set of environments in the Early Pleistocene, suggesting that the origins of human ecological plasticity have deeper roots than previously anticipated. We analysed the distribution of two dental traits, mean ordinated hypsodonty of large herbivores and proboscidean mesowear, across the mammalian communities at Early Pleistocene hominin sites, to infer the vegetation and climate contexts of these locations. The global distribution of community-level dental traits suggests that, while open grassy vegetation made up a large proportion of the sites, mixed and wooded vegetation was also represented. From our analysis we conclude that Early Pleistocene Homo species were able to exploit habitats with different vegetation types and occupied a range of different environments. In addition to this we found that the distribution of dental traits of mammalian communities in the Eurasian sample was notably different from that of the African sample, suggesting that Homo's dispersal into Eurasia resulted in a niche expansion. Together these findings suggest that Homo in the Early Pleistocene was ecologically plastic and occupied a wide environmental niche space.

AB  - Ocean acidification is expected to degrade marine ecosystems, yet most studies focus on organismal-level impacts rather than ecological perturbations. Field studies are especially sparse, particularly ones examining shifts in direct and indirect consumer interactions. Here we address such connections within tidepool communities of rocky shores, focusing on a three-level food web involving the keystone sea star predator, Pisaster ochraceus, a common herbivorous snail, Tegula funebralis, and a macroalgal basal resource, Macrocystis pyrifera. We demonstrate that during nighttime low tides, experimentally manipulated declines in seawater pH suppress the anti-predator behavior of snails, bolstering their grazing, and diminishing the top-down influence of predators on basal resources. This attenuation of top-down control is absent in pools maintained experimentally at higher pH. These findings suggest that as ocean acidification proceeds, shifts of behaviorally mediated links in food webs could change how cascading effects of predators manifest within marine communities.

AB  - Recovery of green turtles (Chelonia mydas), mega-herbivores that consume seagrasses, is resulting in dramatic ecosystem-wide changes as meadows are returned to a natural grazed state. The green turtle grazing strategy, with long-term cultivation of meadows and high foraging site fidelity, is distinct from other terrestrial and aquatic mega-herbivores and may affect seagrass compensatory growth responses. Identifying the mechanisms of compensatory growth responses to grazing is essential to understand the functioning of plant systems under natural grazing regimes. In a naturally grazed Caribbean seagrass ecosystem, we identify a mechanism for compensatory growth responses to grazing by evaluating relationships between Thalassia testudinum morphology and growth, grazing intensity, and canopy light dynamics in grazed and ungrazed areas. The morphological characteristics that explain variability in T. testudinum growth differed between grazed and ungrazed areas. In grazed areas, T. testudinum leaf linear growth, leaf area growth, and productivity:biomass (P:B) significantly increased as above-ground biomass decreased; P:B also increased with shoot density. Mass growth in grazed areas exhibited an increasing trend with shoot density and was maintained above a threshold of 2.5 g dry mass m(-2) above-ground biomass. In ungrazed areas, trends for mass growth and P:B with above-ground biomass and shoot density were opposite to those in grazed areas. In grazed areas, shoot density significantly increased with grazing intensity while above-ground biomass decreased and leaf area index (LAI) was not affected. Light availability at canopy height was greater in grazed areas than in ungrazed areas, and canopy light attenuation increased with shoot density in grazed areas. Synthesis. Grazing removes above-ground biomass, which increases light availability and stimulates leaf growth and turnover (i.e. compensatory growth). Shoot density increases with grazing intensity, maintaining LAI and canopy light harvesting potential. This maximizes the potential for leaf photosynthetic activity and provides the plant with the capacity to sustain mass growth and support a compensatory growth response to grazing. This study presents novel insight for assessing the underlying mechanisms of plant compensatory growth responses to cultivation grazing and proposes potential thresholds that may be used to evaluate the sustainability of in situ grazing pressure by a recovering mega-herbivore.

AB  - We reconstruct the subsistence strategies of foragers during the Cantabrian Lower Magdalenian (19.3-18ka cal BP) based on an extensive archaeofaunal assemblage from El Miro<acute accent>n Cave. The cave, situated in the montane interior of northern Atlantic Iberia, likely served as a repeatedly occupied, long-term residential base camp for mobile hunter-gatherers in the post-LGM period. The exploitation of ungulates was intensive and versatile, as evidenced by skinning, disarticulation, filleting cut marks, and impact marks on cancellous and long bones (for extraction of grease and marrow) from Spanish ibex and red deer. El Miro<acute accent>n Cave was an integral site in a Lower Magdalenian band territory centered on a major river valley in eastern Cantabria (the Aso<acute accent>n), serving both logistical and residential purposes (sensu L.R. Binford). Our detailed multifactorial analysis of animal remains from a complex palimpsest accumulation (so typical of the Cantabrian Lower Magdalenian at classic coastal zone sites such as Altamira, El Juyo, or El Castillo) provides valuable insights into the specific subsistence and settlement dynamics of hunter-gatherers in the Cantabrian mountains during the post-LGM period when there is genetic evidence for important human population changes in Western Europe.

AB  - Across the western North American boreal region, networks of narrow clearings called seismic lines from oil and gas exploration fragment forests. Restoration of seismic lines for habitat recovery of threatened woodland caribou has been prioritized, but there is little guidance on temporal and spatial targets for boreal forest recovery. Between 2016 and 2022, we sampled regenerating trees on 344 seismic lines with limited re-disturbance across the oil sands region of Alberta, Canada. We modeled growth relationships for regenerating trees, including regeneration lags, using field and geospatial data to predict passive forest recovery on seismic lines. Recovery on seismic lines in peatland and transitional forests could take >30 years, due to longer regeneration lags (8-13 years) and slower-growing tree species (>25 years to reach 3 m). Recovery in xeric and mesic uplands was nearly half that, due to shorter regeneration lags (3-5 years), faster-growing species (9-13 years to reach 3 m), and recent wildfires. Over half of seismic lines in upland forests had predicted regeneration lags <= 5 years, including many seismic lines that burned after initial seismic line clearing, indicating regeneration was not delayed. However, all seismic lines in transitional and peatland forests were predicted to have regeneration lags >8 years. Slower recovery on seismic lines is associated with the compounding effects of longer regeneration lags and slower growth rates of dominant tree species. Restoration efforts should prioritize seismic lines where active treatment can significantly reduce regeneration lags and expedite growth.

AB  - Observations of Black Spot Syndrome (BSS), a pigmented dermatopathy in marine fishes, have been increasingly reported in important grazers such as surgeonfish and parrotfish in the Caribbean. This condition has been linked to infection by the trematode parasite, Scaphanocephalus spp., although relatively little is known about the environmental drivers of infection and how they vary spatially. This study introduces a non-invasive, video-based method to survey BSS presence and severity in ocean surgeonfish (Acanthurus tractus). Application of the approach across 35 coastal sites in Curacao was used to evaluate the influence of environmental factors on BSS, including longitude, herbivorous fish density, wave energy, depth, nutrient pollution, and inhabited surface area. Of the 5123 fish surveyed between February 2022 and January 2023, 70% exhibited visible signs of BSS, and the average number of lesions per fish increased by similar to fivefold from eastern to western sites along the leeward coastline. Within a site, estimates of BSS severity were broadly consistent between different divers, different reviewers of video footage, and the date of sampling, emphasizing the robustness of the surveillance approach. Analyses of environmental factors indicated that BSS decreased with wave intensity while increasing in association with higher nutrient runoff and fishing pressure. This study provides insight into environmental correlates of BSS severity while highlighting the use of video-based surveillance as a non-invasive survey method. The mechanisms linking environmental factors with BSS as well as its consequences for affected fish remain unknown, emphasizing the need for long-term and experimental studies in this system.

AB  - Trapping is an effective strategy for control of invasive wild pig (Sus scrofa), but eradication of populations via trapping alone typically is impractical throughout much of the species' introduced range. Consequently, recovery of wild pig populations to pre-trapping levels following control is a major impediment to success of long-term control. In this study, we conducted camera-trap surveys to monitor recovery of two wild pig populations immediately following density reductions achieved via trapping on two sites on the Savannah River Site, SC. We used spatial capture-recapture models to estimate wild pig density during seven 3 week periods spanning 12 months to: (1) determine the time required for populations to recover to pre-trapping levels; and (2) evaluate trends in population growth, density, and distribution during recovery. Recovery of both wild pig populations started immediately after trapping ceased, with populations reaching pre-trapping levels in 3 and 5 months. Threeweek population growth rates for each wild pig population during recovery averaged 1.28 (range = 1.11-1.39 on site 1) and 1.24 (range = 0.64-1.92 on site 2), which corresponded to a 345% and 132% increase in abundance (an increase of 141 and 126 individual wild pigs on site 1 and 2, respectively) of each population by the last survey period. Rapid recovery and growth beyond pre-trapping levels of wild pig populations likely were driven by residual wild pigs not removed by trapping and compensatory reproduction and immigration. Our study is one of the first to provide information on how quickly wild pig populations can recover following overall density reductions of 54-68% and indicates practitioners should be prepared to reinitiate trapping efforts in as little as 3 months to prevent recovery of wild pig populations following control.

AB  - Background Recent climate changes have produced extreme climate events. This study focused on extreme snowfall and intended to discuss the vulnerability of temperate mammals against it through interspecies comparisons of spatial niches in northern Japan. We constructed niche models for seven non-hibernating species through wide-scaled snow tracking on skis, whose total survey length was 1144 km. Results We detected a low correlation (r(s )< 0.4) between most pairs of species niches, indicating that most species possessed different overwintering tactics. A morphological advantage in locomotion cost on snow did not always expand niche breadth. In contrast, a spatial niche could respond to (1) drastic landscape change by a diminishing understory due to snow, possibly leading to changes in predator-prey interactions, and (2) the mass of cold air, affecting thermoregulatory cost and food accessibility. When extraordinary snowfall occurred, the nonarboreal species with larger body sizes could niche shift, whereas the smaller-sized or semi-arboreal mammals did not. In addition, compared to omnivores, herbivores were prone to severe restriction of niche breadth due to a reduction in food accessibility under extreme climates. Conclusions Dietary habits and body size could determine the redundancy of niche width, which may govern robustness/vulnerability to extreme snowfall events.

AB  - Cultivated plants are often much more susceptible to insect herbivores than wild-type plants. In addressing this observation, much attention has focused on a trait-based approach, and especially on how artificial selection via domestication has modified morphological and chemical traits, in particular levels of defensive secondary metabolites. However, larger scale ecological processes, such as the spatial distribution and diversity of species in a plant community, also determine how insects locate and exploit their food plants, and these differ profoundly between natural and agricultural ecosystems. In this paper we discuss these two approaches to better understand differences in levels of insect herbivory between agricultural and natural ecosystems. We argue that studies investigating the effects of secondary metabolites on insect herbivory are compromised by the methodological approach that is often used. Insect feeding assays testing the effect of reduced concentrations of secondary metabolites in domesticated plants rely on testing a limited subset of insect species, usually those that can easily be reared in the laboratory and often are agricultural pest species. The responses of these insects do not reflect the full range of responses of the species present in the plant's natural habitat. This may explain why reduced levels of secondary metabolites in crop plants may only partially explain increased susceptibility to herbivory. Hypotheses explaining larger scale patterns of insect herbivore abundance are often based on studies in agricultural settings. In our opinion, developing broad ecological hypotheses based on studies in agricultural systems do not necessarily apply to natural systems and vice versa. To fully understand how susceptibility or resistance to insect herbivory is affected by plant traits and habitat heterogeneity, these have to be studied together in both natural and agricultural settings.

AB  - Here we describe the methods and results for biological characterization of the benthos on a previously unexplored area of central California, USA seafloor. We conducted 40 remotely operated vehicle dives from 371 to 1173 m water depth. Seafloor habitats and megafauna (fish and invertebrates) were documented from 46.8 km of seafloor video footage. Our expanded development and analysis of biotopes from quantitative data allowed us to describe detailed biological communities, along with the physical characteristics and habitat associations within the study area. This method provides a framework for potential monitoring, detection of future environmental change (natural and anthropogenic) and comprehensive comparison to other deep water regions. From 185 h of observational video at 25 sites, nearly 120,000 annotations of organisms, habitat characters, biological detritus and anthropogenic debris were recorded and analyzed. We identified a total of 228 taxa, with 173 of them present on linear quantitative transects. Species richness for transects ranged from 0.04 to 0.28 m(-2) (8-55 taxa), with densities ranging from 0.07 to 5.20 ind. m(-2). Both were highest on hard substrate with greatest surface area. Densities decreased with depth. Within soft substratum zones was a large field of pockmarks, which are seafloor depressions averaging 175 m in diameter and 5 m in depth. Pockmarks have sometimes been associated with seafloor gas seepage, but here we found no biological evidence of chemosynthetic organisms. No significant differences were found in either density nor species richness at pockmark sites vs. non-pockmark sites. Mud draped greenish-black coarse sand occurred only in low oxygen areas, while hummocky, rugose mud supported somewhat different species than flat mud plains. Seventy percent of the transects occurred inside the oxygen minimum zone. We conclude that high rugosity, slope, and the presence of hard substratum were better predictors of species richness and density than oxygen concentration in this specific study. Abundant biological detritus, in the form of dead and dying pelagic pyrosomes and salps, created a large, presumably ephemeral flux of carbon to the seafloor during the study period.

AB  - People often visit natural settings for recreation and psychological restoration. This study aims to improve understanding of how exposure to and experiences of mammalian wildlife in local natural settings can permit and promote recreation and restoration. Randomly sampled residents in three regions of Sweden (N = 303) with varying presence of fear-relevant species (wolf, wild boar) and fear-irrelevant species (roe deer, squirrel) completed a questionnaire. Squirrel and roe deer were rated significantly higher than wolf and wild boar for anticipated positive feelings and restoration outcomes, and significantly lower for negative feelings and avoidance of natural settings. The possibility of exposure explained little of the variation in the restoration variables, whereas the experiences anticipated with an animal encounter contributed substantially to explanation. Vulnerability seems to counteract the restorative benefit of fascination. Wildlife conservation efforts and public health initiatives may find practical utility in distinguishing between potential exposure and anticipated experience when designing interventions.

AB  - Significant air temperature and precipitation changes have occurred since the 2000s in vulnerable Siberian subarctic regions and urged updates of available chronologies towards the third millennium. It is important to better understand recent climatic changes compared to the past decades, centuries and even millennia. In this study, we present the first annually resolved triple tree-ring isotope dataset (delta C-13, delta O-18 and delta H-2) for the eastern part of the Taimyr Peninsula (TAY) and northeastern Yakutia (YAK) from 1900 to 2021. We found that the novel and largely unexplored delta H-2 of larch tree-ring cellulose was linked significantly with delta O-18 for the YAK site, which was affected by averaged April-June air temperatures and evaporation. Simulated by the Land Surface Processes and Exchanges (LPX-Bern 1.0) model, the water fraction per year for soil depths at 0-20 and 20-30 cm was significantly linked with the new eco-hydrological tree-ring delta H-2 data. Our results suggest increasing evapotranspiration and response of trees' water relation to rising thaw water uptake from lower (20-30 cm) soil depth. A positive effect of July air temperature on tree-ring delta O-18 and a negative impact of July precipitation were found, indicating dry conditions. The delta C-13 in larch tree-ring cellulose for both sites showed negative correlations with July precipitation and relative humidity, confirming dry environmental conditions towards the third millennium.

AB  - Scientists and managers rely on indicator taxa such as coral and macroalgal cover to evaluate the effects of human disturbance on coral reefs, often assuming a universally positive relationship between local human disturbance and macroalgae. Despite evidence that macroalgae respond to local stressors in diverse ways, there have been few efforts to evaluate relationships between specific macroalgae taxa and local human-driven disturbance. Using genus-level monitoring data from 1205 sites in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, we assess whether macroalgae percent cover correlates with local human disturbance while accounting for factors that could obscure or confound relationships. Assessing macroalgae at genus level revealed that no genera were positively correlated with all human disturbance metrics. Instead, we found relationships between the division or genera of algae and specific human disturbances that were not detectable when pooling taxa into a single functional category, which is common to many analyses. The convention to use percent cover of macroalgae as an indication of local human disturbance therefore likely obscures signatures of local anthropogenic threats to reefs. Our limited understanding of relationships between human disturbance, macroalgae taxa, and their responses to human disturbances impedes the ability to diagnose and respond appropriately to these threats.

AB  - The available science often demonstrates the need for feral horse population control but not the degree of control required to achieve environmental conservation objectives. To better manage the influence of feral horses, we must first understand the relationship between feral horse density and environmental impact. We recorded vegetation and soil disturbance, and the sign of potential causes of this impact in two parts of the Australian Alps, the Bogong high plains (BHP) and the Eastern Victorian Alps (EVA). We calculated density-impact functions to assist managers with determining feral horse density targets for control programmes. Minimal sign of feral horse impact was detected on the BHP, with no impact of feral horses observed along 99% of the length of transects. In contrast, impacts assigned to feral horses were significantly higher in the EVA, where a larger, higher-density population of feral horses existed. However, greater than 83% of the walked transect length was still undisturbed by feral horses in the EVA. We detected a threshold of horse impact at similar to 250 horse faecal piles per ha. Above this threshold, a slight increase in horse density resulted in a disproportionately large increase in impact. In this context, a relatively small population control effort may substantially reduce direct horse impact. But where horse densities exist below this threshold, considerably more expense and control effort (resulting from the difficulties related to control at low density) is likely to make very little difference to an already low level of direct impact. The combined impacts associated with the sign of deer, feral pigs, fire and humans were large compared to that of feral horses. Management of feral horses to reduce their direct impact is unlikely to be beneficial without complementary management to reduce the effects of these other agents of impact.

AB  - Alpine grassland has very important water conservation function. Grassland degradation seriously affects the water conservation function; moreover, there is little understanding of the change of water state during grassland restoration. Our study aims to bridge this gap and improve our understanding of changes in soil moisture during the restoration process. In this study, the water storage, vegetation, and meteorology of a non-degradation grassland (grazing intensity of 7.5 sheep/ha) and a severely degraded grassland (grazing intensity of 12-18 sheep/ha) were monitored in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau for seven consecutive years. We used correlation, stepwise regression, and the boosted regression trees (BRT) model analyses, five environmental factors were considered to be the most important factors affecting water storage. The severely degraded grassland recovered by light grazing treatment for 7 years, with increases in biomass, litter, and vegetation cover, and a soil-water storage capacity 41.9% higher in 2018 compared to that in 2012. This increase in soil-water storage was primarily due to the increase in surface soil moisture content. The key factors that influenced water storage were listed in a decreasing order: air temperature, litter, soil heat flux, precipitation, and wind speed. Their percentage contributions to soil-water storage were 50.52, 24.02, 10.86, 7.82, and 6.77%, respectively. Current and future climate change threatens soil-water conservation in alpine grasslands; however, grassland restoration is an effective solution to improve the soil-water retention capacity in degraded grassland soils.

AB  - Coral community structure exhibits variation at each stage of its life cycle, but the spatial distribution of corals in early life stages, including from juvenile to adult stages, is not well understood, especially at a larger scale. Spatially, our study compared the genera richness and abundance of juvenile and sub/adult corals at 9 locations and 83 sites along the coast and small islands of western and eastern Sumatra, Indonesia. Field surveys were conducted by recording juvenile corals measuring <= 5 cm in diameter in 1 x1 m quadrat transects with 6 times randomly at each site, while those with diameters greater than 5-10 cm were categorized as transitional to sub/ adult corals. A total of 52 genera from 16 juvenile coral families were recorded and identified, which is higher than the sub/adult level, where a total of 40 genera from 14 families were found. The most common genera came from the Acroporidae (23.0 %), Merulinidae (18.7 %), and Agariciidae (12.7 %) families. The genera richness at the juvenile stage showed variation between locations and regions in western and eastern Sumatra, except between locations in the eastern region, while at the sub/adult stage there was no variation between the western and eastern regions. Abundance at the juvenile stage also showed variation between locations, but did not differ between the western and eastern regions and at locations in the eastern region. In contrast, coral abundance at the sub/adult stage showed differences between locations and regions, but did not show variation at locations in the eastern region. The abundance of juvenile corals was influenced by live coral cover, the presence of herbivorous and corallivorous reef fish, and hard substrates of dead coral, limited to sandy or muddy bottoms and coral rubble. Genera richness was also influenced by live coral cover, but limited by sandy and rubble reef habitats, the cover of other biota such as soft corals, and the presence of herbivorous fish. Variations in water conditions and geomorphological forms between locations on the west and east sides of Sumatra impacted the diversity and abundance of corals in the early stages of life, affecting their success in becoming adult colonies. The transition from juvenile to sub/adult corals emerged as a critical phase in the early life stages of coral for population maintenance and sustainability.

AB  - Long-lived bigmouth buffalo (Ictiobus cyprinellus) are declining and a species of special concern in central Canada whose densities may be impacted by invasive common carp (Cyprinus carpio). In addition, the bigmouth buffalo is a culturally important species for the File Hills Qu'Appelle Tribal Council Member First Nations, who have harvested them since time immemorial. Here we analyzed S13C and S15 N in bigmouth buffalo and common carp muscle tissue, along with bulk and compound-specific amino-acid S15 N of otoliths, to examine the food-web interactions of species over the past 100 years. Stable isotope ratios of muscle tissue inferred that the fishes generally occupied different isotopic niches, with bigmouth buffalo exhibiting greater evidence of pelagic feeding (mean f SD; 88 f 22% and 42 f 13% in two lakes), and higher trophic position (3.6 f 0.3 and 3.8 f 0.3) than common carp (74 f 11% and 33 f 13%; 3.2 f 0.4 and 3.4 f 0.3, respectively). Overall, modern otolith isotope values agreed with paired muscle isotope values, while bulk otolith material exhibited increased S15 N over a century. Apparent isotopic niche differentiation between the species may have arisen from ongoing niche displacement by common carp following watershed invasion ca. 1955. This competition may be more intense for larger bigmouth buffalo.

AB  - The summer season of 2019-2020 has been named Australia's Black Summer because of the large forest fires that burnt for months in southeast Australia, affecting millions of Australia's citizens and hundreds of millions of animals and capturing global media attention. This extensive fire season has been attributed to the global climate crisis, a long drought season and extreme fire weather conditions. Our aim in this study was to examine the factors that have led some of the wildfires to burn over larger areas for a longer duration and to cause more damage to vegetation. To this end, we studied all large forest and non-forest fires (>100 km(2)) that burnt in Australia between September 2019 and mid-February 2020 (Australia's Black Summer fires), focusing on the forest fires in southeast Australia. We used a segmentation algorithm to define individual polygons of large fires based on the burn date from NASA's Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) active fires product and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) burnt area product (MCD64A1). For each of the wildfires, we calculated the following 10 response variables, which served as proxies for the fires' extent in space and time, spread and intensity: fire area, fire duration (days), the average spread of fire (area/days), fire radiative power (FRP; as detected by NASA's MODIS Collection 6 active fires product (MCD14ML)), two burn severity products, and changes in vegetation as a result of the fire (as calculated using the vegetation health index (VHI) derived from AVHRR and VIIRS as well as live fuel moisture content (LFMC), photosynthetic vegetation (PV) and combined photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic vegetation (PV+NPV) derived from MODIS). We also computed more than 30 climatic, vegetation and anthropogenic variables based on remotely sensed derived variables, climatic time series and land cover datasets, which served as the explanatory variables. Altogether, 391 large fires were identified for Australia's Black Summer. These included 205 forest fires with an average area of 584 km(2) and 186 non-forest fires with an average area of 445 km(2); 63 of the forest fires took place in southeast (SE) Australia (the area between Fraser Island, Queensland, and Kangaroo Island, South Australia), with an average area of 1097 km(2). Australia's Black Summer forest fires burnt for more days compared with non-forest fires. Overall, the stepwise regression models were most successful at explaining the response variables for the forest fires in SE Australia (n = 63; median-adjusted R-2 of 64.3%), followed by all forest fires (n = 205; median-adjusted R-2 of 55.8%) and all non-forest fires (n = 186; median-adjusted R-2 of 48.2%). The two response variables that were best explained by the explanatory variables used as proxies for fires' extent, spread and intensity across all models for the Black Summer forest and non-forest fires were the change in PV due to fire (median-adjusted R-2 of 69.1%) and the change in VHI due to fire (median-adjusted R-2 of 66.3%). Amongst the variables we examined, vegetation and fuel-related variables (such as previous frequency of fires and the conditions of the vegetation before the fire) were found to be more prevalent in the multivariate models for explaining the response variables in comparison with climatic and anthropogenic variables.
   This result suggests that better management of wildland-urban interfaces and natural vegetation using cultural and prescribed burning as well as planning landscapes with less flammable and more fire-tolerant ground cover plants may reduce fire risk to communities living near forests, but this is challenging given the sheer size and diversity of ecosystems in Australia.

AB  - Plant-animal interactions are key to sustaining whole communities and ecosystem function. However, their complexity may limit our understanding of the underlying mechanisms and the species involved. The ecological effects of epizoochory remain little known compared to other seed dispersal mechanisms given the few vectors identified. In addition, epizoochory is mostly considered non-mutualistic since dispersers do not obtain nutritional rewards. Here, we show a widespread but unknown mutualistic interaction between parrots and plants through epizoochory. Combining our observations with photos from web-sources, we recorded nearly 2000 epizoochory events in 48 countries across five continents, involving 116 parrot species and nearly 100 plant species from 35 families, including both native and non-native species. The viscid pulp of fleshy fruits and anemochorous structures facilitate the adherence of tiny seeds (mean 3.7 x 2.56 mm) on the surface of parrots while feeding, allowing the dispersion of these seeds over long distances (mean = 118.5 m). This parrot-plant mutualism could be important in ecosystem functioning across a wide diversity of environments, also facilitating the spread of exotic plants. Future studies should include parrots for a better understanding of plant dispersal processes and for developing effective conservation actions against habitat loss and biological invasions.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) immobilization (Nim, including microbial N assimilation) and plant N uptake (PNU) are the two most important pathways of N retention in soils. The ratio of Nim to PNU (hereafter Nim:PNU ratio) generally reflects the degree of N limitation for plant growth in terrestrial ecosystems. However, the key factors driving the pattern of Nim:PNU ratio across global ecosystems remain unclear. Here, using a global data set of 1018 observations from 184 studies, we examined the relative importance of mycorrhizal associations, climate, plant, and soil properties on the Nim:PNU ratio across terrestrial ecosystems. Our results show that mycorrhizal fungi type (arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) or ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi) in combination with soil inorganic N mainly explain the global variation in the Nim:PNU ratio in terrestrial ecosystems. In AM fungi-associated ecosystems, the relationship between Nim and PNU displays a weaker negative correlation (r = -.06, p < .001), whereas there is a stronger positive correlation (r = .25, p < .001) in EM fungi-associated ecosystems. Our meta-analysis thus suggests that the AM-associated plants display a weak interaction with soil microorganisms for N absorption, while EM-associated plants cooperate with soil microorganisms. Furthermore, we find that the Nim:PNU ratio for both AM- and EM-associated ecosystems gradually converge around a stable value (13.8 +/- 0.5 for AM- and 12.1 +/- 1.2 for EM-associated ecosystems) under high soil inorganic N conditions. Our findings highlight the dependence of plant-microbial interaction for N absorption on both plant mycorrhizal association and soil inorganic N, with the stable convergence of the Nim:PNU ratio under high soil N conditions.

AB  - Abiotic conditions can influence the effect that herbivores have on plant growth. Such biotic and abiotic interactions are of special interest in plant biological control programs because the goal of herbivore suppression of the target weed may not be reached in some abiotic settings. Additionally, target invasive plants typically occur across diverse landscapes raising the possibility that local adaptation to site-specific conditions leads to phenotypic variation that can affect herbivore responses. Here, we used Tamarix, an invasive plant, and its associated biological control agent, Diorhabda carinulata, to investigate how local variation in soil salinity and host plant origin influence interactions between the two taxa. To test if Tamarix was adapted to local conditions, we collected plants from sites with either low or high groundwater salinity, asexually propagated them through multiple generations, and then treated them with their home or reciprocal salinity levels. We found that plants accumulated the most biomass when grown at the salinities of their origin site. The biological control agent, D. carinulata preferred plants grown at source site salinity when given a choice against plants grown in the reciprocal salinity treatment. Although plants compensated for herbivory by regrowing foliage over three defoliation events and maintained similar leaf biomass through regrowth, they ultimately had a reduced basal area and 62% lower root biomass compared to the controls. Thus, herbivory caused a shift in plant allocation of resources from overall growth to compensation, reducing root and stem investment. Overall, D. carinulata caused a significantly greater reduction in total biomass in the high salinity plants than the low salinity ones when grown at their source salinity (averages of 63% and 32% respectively). Thus, the Tamarix biological control program may experience its greatest efficacy in high salinity areas where the impact of the agent is the greatest, likely due to increased water stress and reduced resources to enable regrowth.

AB  - Questions Plant facilitation often dominates over competition in stressful environments. However, to our knowledge few studies have examined plant facilitation within the context of herbivore pressure. Herbivory-induced is a classic example of indirect facilitation. For example, in the temperate steppe region of Inner Mongolia, China, the intensive grazing by domestic animals has induced widespread grassland degradation. Here, we ask whether such long-term overgrazing leads to facilitation in plants.
   Location Xilingol steppe region, Inner Mongolia, China.
   Methods We examined the spatial structure of three dominant plant species, including two species that are palatable to sheep (Leymus chinensis and Agropyron michnoi) and one that is unpalatable (Stipa grandis). We examined whether the spatial aggregation of these three species provided evidence for facilitation by comparing their spatial patterns along a recovery gradient: high grazing pressure (HG), an eight-years grazing exclusion (early-stage recovery from grazing; ER), and a 21-years grazing exclusion (late-stage recovery; LR). To accomplish this, we used the bivariate pair-correlation function, g(12)(r), to assess the spatial association between unpalatable and palatable species. A positive spatial association indicates that facilitation dominates over competition (or dispersal limitation, habitat heterogeneity). We used a null model to assess the significance of spatial associations. Furthermore, we evaluated intraspecific spatial aggregation with the g(11)(r) by combining to three null models at fine spatial scales.
   Results The spatial association between palatable and unpalatable species suggests a hump-shaped relationship along the gradient of the grazing exclusion time. Specifically, Leymus chinensis and Stipa grandis showed a neutral, positive and negative association across the three stages of natural recovery from 21 years of grazing exclusion to current grazing. Similarly, Agropyron michnoi and Stipa grandis showed a negative, very positive and positive spatial association along the same gradient. Moreover, intraspecific spatial aggregation was higher in the current grazing treatment than in the grazing exclusion treatment. This was particularly true at the finest spatial scales (i.e., <0.2 m).
   Conclusions Our results suggest that facilitation between and within species along the recovery gradient in steppe communities is related to herbivore pressure induced by long-term overgrazing. First, we observed no evidence of indirect facilitation between species in current grazing treatment, while direct facilitation between plant species appears strongest at early stages of natural recovery along the gradient of the grazing exclusion time. Moreover, we observed indirect intraspecific facilitation dominated in the current grazing treatment, especially at small scales across the same gradient.

AB  - Species geographic distribution and conservation priority areas are important bases for in situ biodiversity conservation and conservation decision-making. In view of the urgency of endangered species protection, eight representative endangered species in the typical forest ecosystem of the Greater and Lesser Khingan Mountains were studied. Based on 1127 occurrence points and environmental data collected from 2016 to 2021, used BIOMOD2 and Zonation to reconstruct the potential distribution area and identify conservation priority areas of eight species (Tetrao parvirostris, T. tetrix, Gulo gulo, Alces alces, Martes zibellina, Moschus moschiferus, Lynx lynx, Lutra lutra). The results showed potential distribution areas for almost all species concentrated in the northern part of the Greater Khingan Mountains (GKM) and the central part of the Lesser Khingan Mountains (LKM). The potential distribution areas of each species were as follows: black-billed capercaillie, 102,623 km2; black grouse, 162,678 km2; wolverine, 63,410 km2; moose, 140,287 km2; sable, 112,254 km2; Siberian musk deer, 104,787 km2; lynx, 139,912 km2; and Eurasian otter, 49,386 km2. Conservation priority areas (CPAs) clustered in the north GKM and central LKM and totaled 220,801 km2, and only 16.94% of the CPAs were currently protected by nature reserves. We suggest that the Chinese government accelerate the integration of existing protected areas in the northern GKM and establish a larger GKM National Park based on cost-effective multi-species protection.

AB  - The presence of Sus scropha in the areas of Quercus cubana could be affecting the propagation of this species, for which reason two natural areas of oak forest were selected on Alturas de Pizarra of the Vinales Agroforestry Experimental Station. The objective was to determine the effect of raising Sus scropha on the natural regeneration of Quercus cubana. Twenty 100 natural regeneration of Quercus cubana with the intensity of their activity and the measured vegetation variables were determined. In the oak groves studied, there were no significant differences in the associated plant species according to the trend of the rarefaction curves and the non-parametric estimators. In both areas, the herbaceous layer was the best represented followed by the shrub layer in terms of species richness and number of feet, being the ones with the highest incidence in the sociological position. Pigs are common in the areas, and their intensity of activity was considered high and also affects the increase in the latter in the decrease in the natural regeneration of the oak. There are no significant differences between the top and the middle part of the area.

Through field investigation, we quantified rodent disturbance intensity (DI) to H. ammodendron and analyzed the ecological response mechanism of H. ammodendron population to rodent disturbance from the perspective of plant and soil nutrient cycling and changes. The results indicated that moderate rodent DI (number of effective burrows = 3-6) was the maximum limit that can be tolerated by H. ammodendron; the threshold for optimal H. ammodendron response to rodent disturbance was mild (number of burrows = 1-3). Meanwhile, the rodent disturbance caused significant nutrient enrichment (e.g., organic carbon, available phosphorus, and available potassium) in the deeper soil (at 20-40 and 40-60 cm depth) and significantly reduced the soil total salt content (p < .05). Furthermore, as the DI increased, the branches of H. ammodendron showed significantly increased soluble total sugar, crude fiber, and total nitrogen contents (p < .05) but significantly decreased crude fat and crude protein contents (p < .05); these results are related to the nutritional target transfer strategy evolved by H. ammodendron for long-term resistance to rodent disturbance. The current study clarified the optimal disturbance model for mutually beneficial H. ammodendron-great gerbil relationship, on the basis of which the ecological response mechanism of H. ammodendron population to rodent disturbance in deserts was illustrated. The current study provides a scientific basis for the protection mechanisms of desert plants to rodent disturbance.

AB  - High-elevation rangelands in Bhutan provide livelihoods for many herding communities. However, severe rangeland degradation in the far eastern region is threatening livestock productivity, biodiversity conservation, and household wellbeing. This paper describes a 3-year community-based rangeland project in eastern Bhutan aimed at restoring and protecting high-elevation rangelands, including wildlife habitats, grasslands, and watersheds, while improving livelihoods. Herder families (120) of the Brokpa ethnic group participated in group management training, savings schemes, pasture improvement, revegetation, and conservation education. Herders restored 35 ha of severely eroded rangeland and sowed 80 ha of improved pasture, and 148 household members invested in savings, with 10 households borrowing funds to diversify income. Households were interviewed before and after the project using semistructured interview guides to determine their perceptions of the project's impacts and limitations. Respondents were satisfied that gully erosion was under control, savings groups were generating income, community cohesion had improved, and awareness of red panda conservation had increased. However, there was ongoing winter fodder shortage, heavy rain damage, and lack of consensus about improving communal pasture areas. We conclude that pastoralists' willingness and ability to restore mountain rangelands will depend on the security of their use rights to graze and manage high-elevation areas. Building trust between mountain communities and agencies and staying committed to long-term social and environmental change are essential for practitioners and policymakers.

AB  - White-tailed deer can limit both growth and survival in slow-growing, shade-tolerant tree species. We monitored 1,100 juvenile hemlocks (Tsuga canadensis) for up to 20 years at 54 sites in northern Wisconsin and Michigan to document causes of recruitment failure. These sites include public and private forestlands and First Nation reservations with distinct approaches to forest and wildlife management. We assessed deer impacts experimentally by protecting half of the juveniles from deer and observationally by tracking unprotected individuals at sites with various deer densities. We estimated local deer and hare presence and density using repeated pellet counts, which best predicted the survival and growth of juvenile hemlocks. Caged individuals out-survived unprotected ones (35.2 vs. 15.0y estimated half-lives). For the fastest-growing quartiles, transition times through the "molar zone" of vulnerability to deer browse (heights 5-200 cm) were 33.4 and 77.7y for protected vs. unprotected juveniles. Deer browsing strongly reduces both survival and growth, allowing us to compare estimates of these processes and their ratio among sites and cohorts. The "Regeneration Ratio" of half-life to growth averaged 1.06 for the top quartile of protected hemlock juveniles vs. 0.19 for juveniles exposed to deer. Ratios below 1.0 suggest risks to hemlock regeneration while values below 0.50 signal likely failure. Forest and wildlife managers must limit deer impacts if hemlock trees and stands are to remain viable components of the region's forests.

AB  - Indigenous peoples' deep time relationships with ecosystems hold valuable lessons on how humans can relate to, and be stewards in, the natural world. At the crux of these lessons is the multifaceted way Indigenous peoples participate within ecosystems. This paper describes this multifaceted connection between people and place by analysing a legal and pedagogical philosophy called gugwilx'ya'ansk amongst the Ts'msyen (Tsimshian) people of the northwest coast of North America. The author, an Indigenous anthropologist from the Gitk'a'ata (Gitga'at) tribe of the Tsimshian, narrates how gugwilx'ya'ansk weaves education, governance, identity, spirituality, and ritual into land-based practices for the purpose of deep-time stewardship. Through autoethnographic narrative and storytelling, he focuses on his own journey of being groomed into becoming a mountain goat hunter within the hereditary governance system of his community, and how this process revealed a methodology to achieve relationality and reciprocity on the landscape while harvesting. This paper concludes by reflecting on why this Indigenous methodology has been successful for the author, and what lessons it has to offer greater society.

AB  - The sea urchins Paracentrotus lividus and Arbacia lixula are important herbivores in algal communities of the infralittoral rocky bottoms in the Mediterranean Sea. However, grazing by sea urchins that outweighs natural algal recruitment processes might result in the formation of barrens, which are areas dominated by urchins and coralline algae. We present the results of the first large-scale mapping of sea urchin barrens and analyses of sea urchins' impact on the main algal communities across 1955.5 km of rocky coastline on the eastern side of the Adriatic Sea (Croatia). Since mapping was performed over a geographically wide area and covered a representative quantity of approximately 40% of the coastline of the central part of the Adriatic Sea, the results could be considered to reflect the general situation in that area of the eastern Adriatic coast. Mapping revealed that sea urchin barrens are present along over 35% of the coastline, while the complete absence of algal cover was recorded in 8% of the inspected area. Communities with canopy -forming algae, which are the most valuable shallow -water communities of the Mediterranean Sea, represent the largest proportion of the observed coastline and are affected by sea urchins in over 28% of their extent. Among other factors, the extensive harvesting of date mussels ( Lithophaga lithophaga ) in the 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s is likely one of the main activities that resulted in exceptional sea urchin expansion via the removal of micropredators and establishment of shelters for subadult urchins.

AB  - Leaf traits are good indicators of ecosystem functioning and can affect herbivory and leaf reflectance patterns, allowing a better understanding of changes in environmental conditions, such those observed during forest natural regeneration. The aim of this study was to evaluate the intraspecific variation in leaf traits and their influence on the pattern of herbivory and leaf reflectance in three species distributed along a successional gradient (early, intermediate and late stages) in a tropical dry forest (TDF) in northern Minas Gerais, Brazil. We sampled individuals of the following abundant tree species that occurred in multiple successional stages: Cenostigma pluviosum, Handroanthus ochraceus, and Tabebuia reticulata. We collected 10 leaves from each tree to determine the contents of chlorophyll a, b, and total, carotenoids and water, as well as the percentage of leaf area removed by herbivores and leaf specific mass (LSM). We also measured five spectral reflectance indices (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index-NDVI, Simple Ratio-SR, modified Normalized Difference-nND, modified SR-mSR and Water Index-WI) using a portable spectrometer. Our results showed intraspecific differences in most leaf traits along the successional gradient, suggesting that local adaptation may play an important role in plant community assembly. However, herbivory only differed for H. ochraceus in early and intermediate stages, but it was not affected by the leaf traits considered here. Spectral reflectance indices also differed among successional stage for all species together and for each species separately, except for T. reticulata in intermediate and late stages. Thus, leaf spectral signatures may be an important tool to the remote detection of different successional stages in TDFs, with implications for forest management.

AB  - The temperament of captive common eland (Taurotragus oryx) during handling is crucial for their management, as they have been identified as an ideal antelope for game meat farming, and are well-represented in captive antelope populations world-wide. Generally speaking, common eland are considered undomesticated, and thus maintain their natural prey instincts, making it necessary to habituate them to routine handling. Immunocastration can be implemented as part of the herd management strategy in mixed or single-sex eland groups, and might reduce aggressive behaviour of males by blocking the production of testosterone, thereby improving docility for ease of handling. Within this study, data was collected to determine the influence of routine handling and immunocastration on the temperament of common eland during handling. Twenty-nine common eland were divided into two groups: sub-adults (n = 15; ca. 2 years old; 182.9 ? 59.37 kg) and juveniles (n = 14; ca. 6 months old; 94.18 ? 24.76 kg), and they were routinely handled every two weeks over a four-month period (10 handling events). Within each age group, females, males, and immunocastrated males were present. Immunocastration treatment was administered during the second and fourth handling events (2 mL Improvac?/ animal). During handling, animals were individually driven through the raceway and finally restrained in a squeeze chute, where routine biological samples and measurements were collected. Faecal androgen metabolite (fAM) concentrations were measured for each event, for males only. Each animal was focally sampled for specific behaviours during the handling. A temperament score was obtained by observing the general state of the animal from the point of entering the raceway, until its exit from the squeeze chute. Generalized linear mixed models tested the influence of immunocastration, week, group, fAM concentration, and body weight on the temperament score. Immunocastration did not affect the temperament score, the general state in the squeeze chute, the order of entering the handling system, and the chute exit. However, the temperament score and the state in the squeeze chute improved overtime (with animals being less nervous). Moreover, animals with low temperament scores (calmer) entered the system earlier, and exited the system calmly over the repeated handling period. The results show that routine handling through a raceway and squeeze chute system leads to habituation, and improves the ease of handling in common eland. However, immunocastration did not affect the temperament of the male common eland during handling.

AB  - Coniferous forests contribute to the European economy; however, they have experienced a decline since the late 1990s due to an invasive pest known as the pine processionary moth, Thaumetopoea pityocampa. The impacts of this pest are increasingly exacerbated by climate change. Traditional control strategies involving pesticides have had negative effects on public health and the environment. Instead, forest managers seek a more ecological and sustainable approach to management that promotes the natural actions of pest control agents. This study aims to evaluate the role of bats in suppressing pine processionary moths in pine forests and examine how the bat community composition and abundance influence pest consumption. Bats were sampled in the mountainous environment of the Serra da Estrela in central Portugal to collect faecal samples for DNA meta-barcoding analysis. We assessed the relationship between a) bat richness, b) bat relative abundance, c) bat diet richness, and the frequency of pine processionary moth consumption. Our findings indicate that sites with the highest bat species richness and abundance exhibit the highest levels of pine processionary moth consumption. The intensity of pine processionary moth consumption is independent of insect diversity within the site. The highest occur-rence of pine processionary moth presence in bat diets is primarily observed in species that forage in cluttered habitats. A typical predator of pine processionary moths among bats is likely to be a forest-dwelling species that specialises in consuming Lepidoptera. These species primarily use short-range echolocation calls, which are relatively inaudible to tympanate moths, suitable for locating prey in cluttered environments, employing a gleaning hunting strategy. Examples include species from the genera Plecotus, Myotis, and Rhinolophus. This study enhances our understanding of the potential pest consumption services provided by bats in pine forests. The insights gained from this research can inform integrated pest management practices in forestry.

AB  - One of the key purposes of conservation selection strategies is to design a network of sites to support relevant biodiversity components and, therefore, decrease the risk of populations becoming isolated. To this end, it is important to be aware of the habitat locations of the target species and the threats of human activities, in order to identify areas of a high conservation priority. This paper takes the Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari province (Iran) as a case study, to highlight a network optimization for six target species of conservation concern, including the Persian leopard, Panthera pardus Pocock, wild sheep, Ovis orientalis Gmelin and wild goat, Capra aegagrus Erxleben. To run the optimization, we first generated the following input data: we modelled suitable habitats, using the InVEST model (Integrated Valuation of Environmental Services and Tradeoffs) and simulated the ecological impact of road networks (Spatial Road Disturbance Index (SPROADI), Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) and the Landscape Ecological Risk Index (ERI)). A visual inspection of the input data revealed that a large percentage of the study area constitutes a suitable habitat for the target species, however, the disturbances caused by the road demonstrate that the central and north-eastern regions of the study area are significantly affected. Indeed, approximately 10% and 25% of the study area are in the high and medium risk categories, respectively. Optimization using Marxan, shows that the north-western and southern regions of the study area should be given high conservation priority, necessary for an efficient conservation network. Habitats located in the north-central region should act as stepping-stone areas or corridors between the isolated regions in the north-east and the wellconnected areas in the north-west and south. Overall, the findings of the present study show that the current network of protected areas is not contradictory to that suggested by Marxan, but has deficiencies in terms of size and stepping-stones.

AB  - Past research has demonstrated how local-scale human impacts-including reduced water quality, overfishing, and eutrophication-adversely affect coral reefs. More recently, global-scale shifts in ocean conditions arising from climate change have been shown to impact coral reefs. Here, we surveyed benthic reef communities at 34 U.S.-affiliated Pacific islands spanning a gradient of oceanic productivity, temperature, and human habitation. We re-evaluated patterns reported for these islands from the early 2000s in which uninhabited reefs were dominated by calcifiers (coral and crustose coralline algae) and thought to be more resilient to global change. Using contemporary data collected nearly two decades later, our analyses indicate this projection was not realized. Calcifiers are no longer the dominant benthic group at uninhabited islands. Calcifier coverage now averages 26.9% +/- 3.9 SE on uninhabited islands (compared to 45.18% in the early 2000s). We then asked whether oceanic productivity, past sea surface temperatures (SST), or acute heat stress supersede the impacts of human habitation on benthic cover. Indeed, we found variation in benthic cover was best explained not by human population densities, but by remotely sensed metrics of chlorophyll-a, SST, and island-scale estimates of herbivorous fish biomass. Specifically, higher coral and CCA cover was observed in more productive waters with greater biomass of herbivores, while turf cover increased with daily SST variability and reduced herbivore biomass. Interestingly, coral cover was positively correlated with daily variation in SST but negatively correlated with monthly variation. Surprisingly, metrics of acute heat stress were not correlated with benthic cover. Our results reveal that human habitation is no longer a primary correlate of calcifier cover on central Pacific island reefs, and highlight the addition of oceanic productivity and high-frequency SST variability to the list of factors supporting reef builder abundance.

AB  - A recent paradigm shift in ecology supports that the classic functional trait space should be extended to include the metabolome. Accordingly, metabolomic signatures differ between plant species or genotypes depending on where they grow along ecological gradients. Yet, it remains unclear whether environmental gradients alone induce intraspecific phytochemical shifts in natural populations, and if these differences can be replicated experimentally. To address this gap, we combined an observational and experimental study to explore how elevation drives differences in the diversity, endemism and composition of specialized metabolites within the widely distributed perennial grass Festuca rubra. We show that both natural and experimental populations (consisting of identical sets of unique genotypes) exhibit distinct metabolic profiles, unique to each elevation. While natural populations growing in alpine environments displayed lower phytochemical diversity and endemism than those inhabiting lower elevations, phytochemical diversity and endemism peaked at intermediate elevation for the experimental populations. In addition, elevation caused shifts in overall composition of metabolomic groups for experimental populations, reflected in alterations in the over- and under-representation of metabolites within specific superclasses. Our study demonstrates that elevation plays an important role in shaping the metabolome. Rapid shifts in abiotic and biotic environments following climate change may act to alter the plant metabolome, which can impact future ecosystem-level dynamics.

AB  - Giant clams are threatened by overexploitation for human consumption, their valuable shells and the aquarium trade. Consequently, these iconic coral reef megafauna are extinct in some former areas of their range and are included in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species and Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. Now, giant clams are also threatened by rapid environmental change from both a suite of local and regional scale stressors and global change, including climate change, global warming, marine heatwaves and ocean acidification. The interplay between local- to regional-scale and global-scale drivers is likely to cause an array of lethal and sub-lethal effects on giant clams, potentially limiting their depth distribution on coral reefs and decreasing suitable habitat area within natural ranges of species. Global change stressors, pervasive both in unprotected and protected areas, threaten to diminish conservation efforts to date. International efforts urgently need to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to avoid lethal and sub-lethal effects of global change on giant clams. Meanwhile, knowledge of giant clam physiological and ecological responses to local-regional and global stressors could play a critical role in conservation strategies of these threatened species through rapid environmental change. Further work on how biological responses translate into habitat requirements as global change progresses, selective breeding for resilience, the capacity for rapid adaptive responses of the giant clam holobiont and valuing tourism potential, including recognizing giant clams as a flagship species for coral reefs, may help improve the prospects of these charismatic megafauna over the coming decades.

AB  - One aspect of plant-herbivore interactions in African savannas is the browsing impact of mammalian herbivores on plants, which may result in induced physical defences (spines) and changes in leaf morphology in trees experiencing intensive browsing. In these savannas, spinescence is considered to have evolved in response to herbivore pressure from large mammals. We assessed the impact of free-ranging domesticated goats on the spines and leaves of Vachellia karroo, V. nilotica and V. torahs in Msinga, South Africa. We predicted that there would be fewer and smaller leaves, and longer spines occurring below compared to above 1.5 m for all tree species. We further predicted that the outer parts of the tree canopy would have smaller and fewer leaves, as well as more and longer spines compared to the inner part of the canopy. To determine the response of these trees to goat herbivory, 35 trees of each Vachellia species were selected, the number of leaves and spines found on two randomly selected branches below 1.5 m and one above 1.5 m were measured. We found that leaves were fewer and smaller below compared to above 1.5 m. Interestingly, we found the reduced leaf size to be equal to the size of spines below 1.5 m. We also found that V. karroo had more spines below 1.5 m compared to V. torahs and V. nilotica. Along the branch segments, we found that spines were longer in the most accessible parts of the branch, the outer canopy. This study showed that browsing by goats, unlike wild herbivores, do not induce plant physical defences but rather limit available foliage. We also showed that physical defences (spine density) of Vachellia trees vary. This has implications for management and ecology of rangelands browsed by domestic mammals.

AB  - Incorrect species delimitation will lead to inappropriate conservation decisions, especially for threatened species. The takin (Budorcas taxicolor) is a large artiodactyl endemic to the Himalayan-Hengduan-Qinling Mountains and is well known for its threatened status and peculiar appearance. However, the speciation, intraspecies taxonomy, evolutionary history, and adaptive evolution of this species still remain unclear, which greatly hampers its scientific conservation. Here, we de novo assembled a high-quality chromosome-level genome of takin and resequenced the genomes of 75 wild takins. Phylogenomics revealed that takin was positioned at the root of Caprinae. Population genomics based on the autosome, X chromosome, and Y chromosome SNPs and mitochondrial genomes consistently revealed the existence of two phylogenetic species and recent speciation in takins: the Himalayan takin (B. taxicolor) and the Chinese takin (B. tibetana), with the support of morphological evidence. Two genetically divergent subspecies were identified in both takin species, rejecting three previously proposed taxonomical viewpoints. Furthermore, their distribution boundaries were determined, suggesting that large rivers play important roles in shaping the genetic partition. Compared with the other subspecies, the Qinling subspecies presented the lowest genomic diversity, higher linkage disequilibrium, inbreeding, and genetic load, thus is in urgent need of genetic management and protection. Moreover, coat color gene (PMEL) variation may be responsible for the adaptive coat color difference between the two species following Gloger's rule. Our findings provide novel insights into the recent speciation, local adaptation, scientific conservation of takins, and biogeography of the Himalaya-Hengduan biodiversity hotspot.

AB  - Aim: Large herbivore grazing is a popular conservation management tool to promote vegetation structural diversity of rangelands. However, vegetation patch dynamics, that is, how patches of grazing-defended tall vegetation and grazer-preferred short lawns shift over space and time, is poorly understood. Here, we describe a new conceptual framework for patch dynamics within rangelands, combining theories of classical cyclical succession, self-organization and multitrophic feedbacks between grazers, vegetation and bioturbating soil fauna.Location: We use the cattle-grazed salt marsh of the island Schiermonnikoog, The Netherlands, as a model system. The grazed salt marsh is characterized by distinct tall vegetation patches dominated by the grazing-defended rush Juncus maritimus and grazing-intolerant grass Elytrigia atherica, surrounded by a matrix of grazing lawn (dominated by Festuca rubra).The Framework: Based on previous observational and experimental studies, we propose a cyclical patch dynamic where plant species composition and structure transitions through four phases: patch initiation (a) occurs when the grazing-defended rush J. maritimus establishes in the grazed lawn. Patch establishment (b) follows when the grazing-intolerant grass E. atherica establishes in the patch due to associational defence by J. maritimus and produces a large amount of litter that attracts the key bioturbating amphipod Orchestia gammarellus. Patch expansion (c) occurs when O. gammarellus activities improve soil properties of the patch, which favours E. atherica growth, leading to E. atherica competitively displacing J. maritimus in the centre of the patch. Patch degeneration (d) follows when cattle enter the enlarged patch to consume E. atherica in the centre, trample the soil, displace O. gammarellus and decrease vegetation cover, opening space for grazing-lawn species to invade. The cycle restarts when remnants of the rush J. maritimus in the degenerated patches (or individuals recently established from seed dispersal) initiate new patches in the grazing lawn.Synthesis: Our proposed patch-dynamic model provides a means to describe the mechanisms driving vegetation patch dynamics and serves as a foundation for further experimental and observational exploration, not only for this specific system, but more generally for grazed systems worldwide that show patches of typical grazing-defended and grazer-preferred vegetation.

AB  - Despite the importance of grasslands for carbon storage and climate regulation, there is uncertainty about the effect of livestock grazing intensity on aboveground carbon assimilation and belowground carbon partitioning. Furthermore, the relationship between belowground carbon allocation and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, which serve as a conduit for carbon movement through the plant and soil, is unclear. To investigate this, we used an in situ C-13 stable isotope pulse-chase labeling approach in plots under seven rates of sheep grazing intensity in a steppe grassland in northern China. We quantified the allocation of carbon to plants, soil, and soil-respired CO2 along with measurements of mycorrhizal hyphal density in the soil. With increasing grazing intensity, carbon assimilation per unit shoot biomass increased significantly, whereas carbon allocation to roots marginally decreased. Soil-respired CO2 appeared to be independent of grazing intensity. Mycorrhizal hyphal density decreased with increasing grazing intensity and was correlated significantly with new carbon input to roots 2 d after labeling and marginally related to that of soil 1 d after the 13 C-CO2 pulse. Our study suggests that grazing intensity alters the distribution of carbon among different carbon pools within the plant-soil system. The results also underscored the key role of mycorrhizas as a fast route for carbon transfer from plant to soil. (c) 2022 The Society for Range Management. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Despite sometimes strong codependencies of insect herbivores and plants, the responses of individual taxa to accelerating climate change are typically studied in isolation. For this reason, biotic interactions that potentially limit species in tracking their preferred climatic niches are ignored. Here, we chose butterflies as a prominent representative of herbivorous insects to investigate the impacts of temperature changes and their larval host plant distributions along a 1.4-km elevational gradient in the German Alps. Following a sampling protocol of 2009, we revisited 33 grassland plots in 2019 over an entire growing season. We quantified changes in butterfly abundance and richness by repeated transect walks on each plot and disentangled the direct and indirect effects of locally assessed temperature, site management, and larval and adult food resource availability on these patterns. Additionally, we determined elevational range shifts of butterflies and host plants at both the community and species level. Comparing the two sampled years (2009 and 2019), we found a severe decline in butterfly abundance and a clear upward shift of butterflies along the elevational gradient. We detected shifts in the peak of species richness, community composition, and at the species level, whereby mountainous species shifted particularly strongly. In contrast, host plants showed barely any change, neither in connection with species richness nor individual species shifts. Further, temperature and host plant richness were the main drivers of butterfly richness, with change in temperature best explaining the change in richness over time. We concluded that host plants were not yet hindering butterfly species and communities from shifting upwards. However, the mismatch between butterfly and host plant shifts might become a problem for this very close plant-herbivore relationship, especially toward higher elevations, if butterflies fail to adapt to new host plants. Further, our results support the value of conserving traditional extensive pasture use as a promoter of host plant and, hence, butterfly richness.

AB  - Bacterial communities in animals are often necessary for hosts to survive, particularly for hosts with nutrient-limited diets. The composition, abundance, and richness of these bacterial communities may be shaped by host identity and external ecological factors. The turtle ants (genus Cephalotes) are predominantly herbivorous and known to rely on bacterial communities to enrich their diet. Cephalotes have a broad Neotropical distribution, with high diversity in the South American Cerrado, a geologically and biologically diverse savanna. Using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, we examined the bacterial communities of forty-one Cephalotes samples of sixteen different species collected from multiple locations across two sites in the Cerrado (MG, Brazil) and compared the bacterial communities according to elevation, locality, species, and species group, defined by host phylogeny. Beta diversity of bacterial communities differed with respect to all categories but particularly strongly when compared by geographic location, species, and species group. Differences seen in species and species groups can be partially explained by the high abundance of Mesorhizobium in Cephalotes pusillus and Cephalotes depressus species groups, when compared to other clades via the Analysis of Composition of Microbiome (ANCOM). Though the Cephalotes bacterial community is highly conserved, results from this study indicate that multiple external factors can affect and change bacterial community composition and abundance.

AB  - Patterns in disturbance severity and time since fire can drive landscape heterogeneity that is critical to conservation; however, there is limited understanding of how wildlife interact with the spatial-temporal complexities of disturbance outcomes and at what scales. We conducted multiscale modeling of habitat selection for male and female Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis canadensis) over an 8-year period. We aimed to identify the spatial scales at which bighorn sheep responded to various habitat features and determine how fire severity and time since fire can shape habitat selection by bighorn sheep over different seasons and between sexes. With the exception of litter cover, spatial scales that extended beyond the finest spatial grain (i.e., a 30-m pixel) to include the surrounding landscape were better at predicting habitat selection. Escape terrain, elevation, fire severity, year, perennial and annual forb and grass cover, and shrub cover occurred in every best-supported model. Associations with escape terrain, elevation, and perennial and annual forb and grass cover varied by sex and season. In contrast, bighorn sheep were consistently positively associated with low- and high-severity fire. Females increased use of low- and high-severity burned areas with greater time since fire, while males tended to decrease use of areas that burned at high severity with greater time since fire. Our results support the importance of landscape heterogeneity created by fire severity and time since fire for Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep and reinforces calls to integrate disturbance-driven heterogeneity into our assessments and management of wildlife.

AB  - Simple Summary Castration is used to improve the management of buffalo calves and their meat quality. Despite the growing interest in livestock welfare, water buffaloes have not been studied as frequently as other species. General anaesthesia produces complete unconsciousness, insensitivity to pain and muscle relaxation. The quality and safety of general anaesthesia may be improved using sedatives prior to the induction of general anaesthesia. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of two different intramuscular doses of xylazine for premedication, followed by ketamine induction, in water buffalo calves undergoing isoflurane maintenance anaesthesia for routine castration surgery. Based on the results obtained, we can conclude that both protocols are safe for buffalo castration, but the higher dose protocol is recommended for buffalo orchiectomy. Castration is one of the most frequently performed surgical procedures in livestock. All methods of castration are associated with a significant degree of pain, affecting the patients' welfare. Limited information on species-specific protocols in buffaloes is available. Considering the importance of this species and the scarcity of reports available, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of two different intramuscular doses of xylazine for premedication in water buffalo calves undergoing isoflurane maintenance anaesthesia for routine castration surgery. Twenty clinically healthy male water buffaloes undergoing bilateral orchiectomy were randomly assigned to two groups of 10 animals each: Group 1 was premedicated with xylazine 0.1 mg/kg bw i.m. and Group 2 was premedicated with xylazine 0.15 mg/kg bw i.m. Anaesthesia was induced by ketamine (2 mg/kg bw i.v.) and maintained with isoflurane-oxygen-air in both groups. The HR, RR, presence/absence of ataxia, sedation, depth of anaesthesia, muscle relaxation status, response to acoustic and tactile stimuli, eyelid reflex, extent of salivation and stimulus were evaluated every 5 min. Both protocols provided consistent sedation and were safe. Faster and more satisfactory sedation was recorded when xylazine was administered at 0.15 mg/kg bw i.m., leading us to recommend this dose for buffalo orchiectomy.

AB  - This paper provides a review of the history of fire research over the past century, the current understanding fire ecology and management, and gaps in knowledge in South Africa. Fire regimes (i.e. the combination of frequency, season and intensity of fire) have been quantified for the main fire-prone vegetation types (fynbos, grassland and savanna) in the eastern and southern parts of the country. Early ecologists regarded fires as harmful, but a growing realization that fires were inevitable and potentially necessary led to the establishment of long-term experiments in fynbos and montane grassland (by the Department of Forestry) and savannas (in the Kruger National Park) in the 1940s and 1950s. Formal collaborative research programs were initiated in the 1970s, including the CSIR's National Programme for Ecosystem Research and the Scientific Committee on Problems of the Environment's (SCOPE) project to synthesize knowledge on the ecological effects of fire. These and other initiatives improved understanding substantially. It is now known that fynbos vegetation is dependent of fires at intervals of 10- 20 years in the dry summer season, while grasslands are resilient under shorter fire return periods (2- 3 years) in the dry winter. Savanna fire ecology tends to be more complex as multiple factors (rainfall, soil fertility, herbivory and fire that vary over space and time) interact to determine the relative proportions of grass and trees. Forest vegetation is not fire-prone, but fire strongly influences the distribution of forests in the landscape. Managers of protected areas, rangelands and water catchments use fire to achieve ecological goals, including maximizing rangeland productivity, reversing woody encroachment, reducing tree mortality, and controlling invasive alien species or disease vectors (mainly ticks). Some ecological goals aim to achieve "natural" or heterogenous fire patterns, assuming that these will conserve biodiversity. Social goals include the prevention of destructive wildfires and protection of infrastructure, the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, and the protection of harvestable resources. Management has in some cases been adaptive, and targets have been altered as understanding grew, and as practical experience coupled with periodic reflection helped to set more realistic goals. Research findings have altered approaches to management in several instances or confirmed that current practices were appropriate. There are however limits to what management can practically achieve. Spatial heterogeneity and seasonal distribution of fires are more easily manipulated at a landscape scale than fire return intervals, especially in more arid areas. Several challenges remain. Climate change may increase the incidence of high fire danger weather, although these projections are more severe for the fire-free parts of the country. Effective implementation of prescribed burning programs necessitates tradeoffs between safety considerations and ecological requirements, and in savannas can precipitate positive and negative outcomes by simultaneously reducing bush encroachment but increasing tree mortality. Finally, problems along a growing urban-wildland interface require a much better understanding of how fires propagate across these boundaries, and how such risks can be reduced. (c) 2025 SAAB.

AB  - Invertivorous fishes are key middle-order consumers that connect energy flows across different trophic levels. However, the potential for distinct functional roles to exist within this trophic guild has not been satisfactorily explored to date, meaning that current assessments of ecosystem resilience are likely to over-estimate the level of functional redundancy within a given invertivorous fish assembly. Our study examined the foraging behaviour and microhabitat preferences of invertivorous fish communities within the productive canopy macroalgal meadows of Ningaloo Marine Park, Western Australia. Our aim was to identify foraging specialisations that could yield distinct functional roles for species belonging to the guild. We found that invertivorous fishes at this location were chiefly represented by species belonging to the Labridae, Lethrinidae and Mullidae families. Individual species demonstrated strong preferences for foraging within specific microhabitat types, suggesting that the guild can be grouped into three categories of foraging specialists: 'canopy forager', 'generalist' and 'abiotic forager'. Our results highlight subtle niche partitioning of foraging microhabitats within the trophic guild of invertivorous fishes associated with tropical macroalgal meadows. Moreover, this partitioning is consistent across seasons, despite significant fluctuations in canopy structure and biomass. The resulting refinement of foraging specialisations allows us to identify the functional roles of invertivorous fishes and afford greater protection to individual species that might otherwise be considered functionally redundant. Our results will help to inform knowledge of the functional impact of particular species and their ecological specialisations and improve our understanding of trophic flows in marine food webs for appropriate management and conservation.

AB  - Escape terrain is an integral component in species ecology for survival and predation avoidance, alongside other factors. For mountain ungulates, escape terrains are steep cliffs serving as refuge in case of predation or other disturbances. Mountain ungulates can exploit their habitat safely within certain distance from these escape terrains. This distance to escape terrain depends on topography, availability/distribution of nutritious forage and nature and extent of interspecific interactions in different montane habitats. Alpine pastures of the Greater Himalaya are shared by mountain ungulates as well as pastoralists who migrate to graze their livestock in summer-monsoon season. In such habitats, nutritious grasses are often distributed in patches, far away from cliffs. In presence of livestock, mountain ungulates have to tradeoff between food acquisition and avoiding predation, competition and disturbance by maintaining an optimal distance between their escape terrain and available forage. In this regard, we estimated optimal distance to escape terrain which bharal (Pseudois nayaur) maintains in alpine areas of Greater Himalaya. Spatial analysis was carried out with observation data and considering slopes above 45 degrees as cliffs, providing appropriate cover in our study area. The results revealed bharal maintained optimal distance till 795.2 m from cliffs during livestock presence. This contrasts with Trans Himalayan habitat where bharal tend to remain closer to cliffs as nutritional forage is more evenly distributed here compared to cis-Himalayas. Such crucial information on topographic factors affecting bharal ecology with respect to livestock can help in strategizing management decision and species monitoring in Greater Himalayan landscapes.

AB  - Half of the world's livestock live in (semi-)arid regions, where a large proportion of people rely on animal husbandry for their survival. However, overgrazing can lead to land degradation and subsequent socio-economic crises. Sustainable management of dry rangeland requires suitable stocking strategies and has been the subject of intense debate in the last decades. Our goal is to understand how variations in stocking strategies affect the resilience of dry rangelands. We describe rangeland dynamics through a simple mathematical model consisting of a system of coupled differential equations. In our model, livestock density is limited only by forage availability, which is itself limited by water availability. We model processes typical of dryland vegetation as a strong Allee effect, leading to bistability between a vegetated and a degraded state, even in the absence of herbivores. We study analytically the impact of varying the stocking density and the destocking adaptivity on the resilience of the system to the effects of drought. By using dynamical systems theory, we look at how different measures of resilience are affected by variations in destocking strategies. We find that the following: (1) Increasing stocking density decreases resilience, giving rise to an expected trade-off between productivity and resilience. (2) There exists a maximal sustainable livestock density above which the system can only be degraded. This carrying capacity is common to all strategies. (3) Higher adaptivity of the destocking rate to available forage makes the system more resilient: the more adaptive a system is, the bigger the losses of vegetation it can recover from, without affecting the long-term level of productivity. The first two results emphasize the need for suitable dry rangeland management strategies, to prevent degradation resulting from the conflict between profitability and sustainability. The third point offers a theoretical suggestion for such a strategy.

AB  - To develop effective management to maintain or restore populations of large herbivores, wildlife managers require sound empirical data on their variations in size and associated parameters. Many studies have highlighted links between morphological traits of individuals and population density; however, less attention has been devoted to whether or not morphological traits can reliably inform on population size in years when no population estimates are available. We evaluated the relationships between three morphological traits (hind foot length, body mass, and body fat) and population size interpolated over three decades, for four migratory caribou (Rangifer tarandus) herds in northern Canada and Alaska. Our sample included 8865 measurements of 4473 individuals. We used a Bayesian modeling approach to evaluate the relationships between morphology and population size across different sex and age classes, considering different temporal scales and, when possible, phases of population growth or decline. We found that morphological traits were not consistently linked to population size. Statistically significant relationships existed for some combinations of herd and age classes, but weak to absent relationships were more common. Our study suggests that morphological traits alone cannot replace data obtained from aerial surveys to approximate population size when population trends are unknown. We discuss the usefulness of morphological traits to explain population size, and recognize their role as complementary metrics to inform the management and conservation of large herbivores, but conclude that morphological data should not be used to predict population size without information on population trends.

AB  - Background Fire is a key ecological factor in the Miombo woodlands of southern Africa, but its role in tree dynamics has not been fully explored.Aim Investigate relationships between fire and forest dynamics and predict Miombo diameter distribution for the year 2033.Methods Tree data (growth, recruitment and mortality) were collected (2005, 2009, 2015 and 2019) along a fire frequency (ff) and severity (fs) gradient in 50 permanent plots in Niassa Special Reserve (NSR). A transition matrix was used to forecast forest structure for the year 2033.Main results Fire frequency (ff) and severity (fs) classes (low, medium and high) were associated with different tree species assemblages. High ff and fs had varied effects on tree mortality, recruitment, growth and carbon stocks. Julbernardia globiflora had higher mortality rate in high ff plots compared to other tree species. Projections indicated that, despite the regular distribution of diameter, high ff may reduce tree density in young cohorts.Conclusions A moderate fire regime is a determinant of sustaining the Miombo dynamics in NSR.Implications Fire management action through early dry season controlled burning is needed to prevent the impact of intense late dry season fire.

AB  - Simple Summary Water buffalo husbandry is generally conducted for dairy purposes. However, buffalo meat is gaining growing importance due to its health benefits. To meet the increasing consumer demand, it is necessary to investigate the factors affecting the buffalo carcass weight. This study explored how the buffalo slaughter weight and age at slaughter were affected by various factors, including the sex, year of slaughter, season of slaughter, farm origin, and animal origin. Our results showed that the buffalo weight improved significantly by 46 kg throughout 2017-2021. Male buffalos and buffalos slaughtered in summer had higher carcass weights than their counterparts. Furthermore, we determined that the slaughter age and farm origin differed significantly between sexes. Since the buffalo carcass price in Turkey is based on quantity, our results can be implemented to achieve more efficient buffalo husbandry to increase farm incomes.Abstract This study analyzed data collected on a slaughterhouse from 2017 to 2021, belonging to five hundred and twenty one Anatolian water buffalos from different farms located in Edirne, Istanbul, and Kirklareli. Specifically, it aimed to determine the factors affecting the carcass weights and slaughter ages of the Anatolian water buffalos. The results of the study showed that the slaughter age of the buffalos was a significant determinant of their carcass weights. Meanwhile, the sex, slaughter year, and slaughter season affected the carcass weight. Differences were observed for the slaughter age regarding the sex and farm origin. Since the pricing system in local markets is based on the buffalo carcass weight, the findings of this study could be essential for farmers when determining their fattening strategies.

AB  - The wild boar (Sus scrofa L., 1758) is one of the most common and widespread game species not only in the Baltic Sea region but also throughout its entire range. However, quantitative population management is required due to the danger of contagious diseases; the census is imprecise, and integrated management and monitoring are still missing in Lithuania. This study focused on the current condition of the wild boar population at the country level, species activity in forests and adjacent agricultural lands, the problem of damage to agriculture and forestry caused by wild boar, and methods for the management of the wild boar population. A methodology for the assessment of the effect of wild boar will help in reducing their impact. For the successful management of wild boar, an increase in the carrying capacity in conformity with animal density should be accomplished.

AB  - Indigenous food sovereignty relies on ecological knowledge of plants and animals, including knowledge related to their development and behavior through the seasons. In the context of anthropogenic climate change, ecological calendars based on Indigenous knowledge may enable communities to anticipate seasonal phenomena. We conducted research with communities in the Standing Rock Nation (North and South Dakota, USA) to develop ecological calendars based on their ecological knowledge. We present ecological calendars developed in seven communities through a series of workshops and interviews. These calendars are rich with knowledge about temporal relations within each community's ecosystem, including the use of plants and animals as seasonal indicators and cues for food system activities. However, the calendars also reveal the impacts of cultural genocide wrought by the United States government in its efforts to colonize the lands and minds of Indigenous communities. Given the diversity of knowledge among Standing Rock communities, we identify opportunities for knowledge exchange to revitalize ecological relations at the heart of food sovereignty. We highlight the potential for ecological calendars to facilitate climate adaptation by enabling communities to synchronize their food systems with an increasingly variable climate.

AB  - Wildlife management decisions require accurate knowledge of population parameters such as density. The random encounter model (REM) is effective for estimating densities of unmarked animals but has not been tested in areas smaller than 10 km2. This study evaluates REM's precision in small areas, considering study area size, shape, and species aggregation behaviours. It also examines whether REM can be simplified by using averaged REM parameters (AVE) instead of site-specific parameters (SSP). Camera trap data from 19 alpine and continental areas in Austria, covering 28 ungulate populations of roe deer Capreolus capreolus, red deer Cervus elaphus, chamois Rupicapra rupicapra, and wild boar Sus scrofa, were analysed. The mean coefficient of variation (CV) was 0.45 +/- 0.03, comparable to studies in larger areas (46.6 km2-501 km2). Study area size and shape did not significantly affect CV. The ratio of cameras with contact negatively impacted CV, indicating higher precision for evenly distributed species like roe deer (overdispersion factor k = 1.0 +/- 0.11) compared to aggregated species like red deer (k = 0.5 +/- 0.12). SSP and AVE densities were not statistically different but could not be explained by the same parameters, such as sea level, ecoregion, accessibility, road length, and feeding. Thus, a simplified approach using averaged REM parameters does not yield sufficiently comparable results. For wildlife management in small areas, REM can be used without restrictions related to the size and shape of the areas sampled.

AB  - Grasslands are globally abundant and provide many ecosystem services, including carbon (C) storage. While grasslands are widely subject to livestock grazing, the influence of grazing on grassland ecosystem C remains unclear. We studied the effect of long-term livestock grazing on C densities of different ecosystem components in 110 northern temperate grasslands across a broad agroclimatic gradient in Alberta, Canada. These grasslands stored 50 to 180 t ha(-1)C in live and dead vegetation, as well as soil C to 30 cm depth, with the majority as soil organic C (SOC). The mulch layer comprised a large amount of C (similar to 18 t ha(-1)C) especially within humid grasslands. Although grazing reduced C densities in litter mass, total ecosystem C was 8.5 % greater under grazing (127.8 t ha(-1)) compared to those non-grazed (117.8 t ha(-1)), primarily due to increases in SOC and roots. Increases in SOC were consistently observed in the 0-15 cm layer across all climatic conditions, with changes in SOC of the 15-30 cm layer inversely related to aridity. A structural equation model revealed that increased SOC under grazing was indirectly attributed to increases in eudicot rather than graminoid biomass. In addition, SOC increased with graminoid quality (i.e., a reduced carbon to nitrogen ratio), which together with elevated eudicots, increased litter and mulch C, and ultimately enhanced SOC densities. When applied to spatial maps of habitat type and land use (livestock grazing) activity across the region, an area of similar to 3.8 M ha of grassland was projected to contain an additional 17.1 M t of C under grazing, primarily in mesic grasslands, worth an estimated $3.1 B (Cdn.) under current C valuation guidelines in Canada. Overall, these results highlight the importance of grasslands for C storage and establishing policies that maintain and promote their sustainable use, including light to moderate grazing.

AB  - Human-wildlife conflict (HWC) is a serious threat to communities living proximal to wildlife areas. Under-standing the attitudes of local communities toward HWC management is critical for planning and designing effective and sustainable mitigation strategies. Here we used quasi-structured questionnaires to assess local community attitudes toward the electrified fencing installed in the Western Corridor of the Serengeti Ecosystem to mitigate human-elephant conflict (HEC). We found that most of the respondents agreed that the installed electrified fence effectively mitigates HEC. In addition, fencing has been perceived as effective in controlling problematic or dangerous animals other than elephants, and therefore increasing harvest yields, improving the physical security of farms and properties, minimizing illegal hunting, and reducing interaction between domestic and wild animals. Furthermore, the local people in the surveyed area expect that human-wildlife coexistence will improve after the fence installation. As the area is famously known for the annual great wildebeest migration, we recommend further studies on the ecological impacts of the installed fence.

AB  - Fucus vesiculosus (here Fucus) is a key species on rocky shores of the Baltic Sea, providing habitat for a diverse invertebrate community. While the invertebrate species within Fucus belts and their general distribution in the Baltic Sea are well known, much less is known about variation in invertebrate abundances and in community composition on different spatial scales. With requirements to monitor the status of marine habitats and com-munities, knowledge on species variation across environmental gradients is increasingly important. Knowledge on the abundances of different grazer species is also needed to evaluate the effects of fauna on Fucus on different spatial scales.In this study, a large-scale field campaign in seven geographically distinct areas along the Baltic Sea coast was conducted to assess variation in Fucus-associated invertebrate communities along eutrophication gradients (areas classified as either good, moderate or poor status). In addition, local scale exposure effects on invertebrate communities were studied. Eutrophication-related variation in invertebrate communities was found, with generally lower species abundances in the good status areas compared to areas in poor or moderate status. Especially in poor status areas, Fucus hosted high abundances of gammarids and chironomids. No specific taxa clearly functioned as an indicator for the eutrophication status and Pielou's evenness was similar across studied areas. However, lower Shannon diversity and number of taxa were found in areas where the status of Fucus is poor. Furthermore, abundances of some taxa, e.g. Idotea spp. isopods and Theodoxus fluviatilis snails were lower in areas where the non-indigenous crab Rhithropanopeus harrisii has been observed. On a local scale, exposed sides of small islands had less T. fluviatilis. This study took the first step to unravel spatial patterns in Fucus- associated invertebrate fauna, and the results illustrate how different environmental and biotic drivers shape these communities both on large and local scales.

AB  - 1. Coral reef habitat quality is declining in many locations because of heatwaves (coral bleaching) and other disturbances. Reef-building corals provide refuge from predation, so declining complexity restricts the transfer of energy to upper trophic levels.2. We use a size-based ecosystem model to test systematically the effects of refuge at specific sizes and the impacts of distributions of refuges that vary in size. Outcomes are assessed in terms of ecosystem service provision.3. Simulations indicate that refuge sheltering fish between 5 and 10 cm in length enhances fish biomass and fisheries productivity, for example, increasing herbivore biomass by up to 80%.4. We identify and present a range of refuge profiles that can theoretically improve ecosystem service provision by as much as sixfold. Profiles where refuge availability decreases with increasing fish size consistently outrank other designs.5. Synthesis and application: These results highlight how critical small-scale refuge is for coral reefs, and how we might design artificial reefs to maximise service provision.

AB  - Human expansion is a major driver of both declining wildlife abundance and the contraction of species' distributions, increasing the risk of genetic erosion and the need for genetic monitoring. Rapidly advancing technology has expanded the types of genetic data that are available for wildlife conservation. However, inferences from different genetic markers could result in different management decisions and, thus, must be considered carefully. Rebounding from near extinction in the early 1900s, the majority of North American plains bison (Bison bison bison) are managed as small and isolated herds. Microsatellite-based analyses have been used to inform management of the US Federal bison conservation herds since the early 2000s. Transitioning from monitoring with tens of multiallelic loci (e.g., microsatellite loci) to thousands of biallelic loci (e.g., single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs]) could increase genotyping efficiency and improve the precision of population genetic inference but would require an understanding of the inferential differences between genetic marker types. We compared microsatellite-based measures of genetic diversity, differentiation, and population structure for 20 bison conservation herds (17 Federal, 1 Tribal, 2 Canadian) to inference from SNP-based analyses for the Tribal herd and 15 of the Federal herds. Data from both genetic marker types found that all herds have remarkably high genetic diversity given the severity of the bottleneck from which these populations recovered, and that population structure was consistent with founding histories. Importantly, SNPs had greater power to describe differences in genetic diversity and groups of related herds, but only if analyses are based on 250 or more loci. Overall, we found that microsatellite and SNP data can provide comparable conservation insight, but SNPs must be carefully selected to ensure continuity in genetic monitoring and to achieve the increased precision in genetic diversity and differentiation among herds that we observed in this study.

AB  - Culling large herbivores can reduce browsing damage. Our objective was to verify the effect of culling by considering spatial changes in browsing damage to test the hypothesis that the benefits of spatially biased culling extend to the spatial scale of culling. Culling sika deer (Cervus nippon) in Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, increased from 2009-2017, but browsing damage remained stable across the prefecture; regional damage trends differed among grid meshes (i.e., 5 km x 5 km). Meshes with browsing damage reduction received higher culling pressure and a decline in the deer population. Browsing damage reduction from culling was not uniform across regions and was biased by spatial bias in culling. This study highlights the importance of spatial scale in large herbivore management and evaluation of its effect.

AB  - The relative importance of herbivore identity and density in determining the outcome of above-belowground herbivore interactions has not yet been fully explored. Here, we tested the effects of foliar insect identity (the specialist Gadirtha fusca vs. the generalist Spodoptera litura) on the number of root knots and the effects of nematode density on the performance of the two leaf herbivores. We found that plant-mediated interactions between the two caterpillars and the nematode were highly density-dependent. Herbivory by G. fusca facilitates the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita, but only under the low density of nematodes. Conversely, infestation of M. incognita inhibited the performance of both caterpillars, which both grew smaller on nematode-infested plants and caused lower damage on plants under the low density of nematodes compared to plants with no nematodes. Both G. fusca or S. litura and the high density of nematodes herbivory either alone or in combination all greatly reduced plant growth and biomass of tallow compared to control plants with no herbivory. However, the combinative herbivory between the caterpillars (especially G. fusca) and the low density of nematodes exerted antagonistic effects on tallow tree that plant growth and biomass were similar or even higher than for control plants with no herbivory. Flavonoids and tannins varied among tissues and were also greatly influenced by nematode density. These results suggest that interactions among leaf and root organisms and their effects on the host plant appear to be more affected by root herbivore density than leaf herbivore identity.

AB  - Background and Aims Some plant species suppress competitors through release of chemical compounds into the environment. As the production of allelochemicals may be costly, it would be beneficial if their production would only be induced when plants experience competition. We tested whether two plant species that frequently co-occur show evidence for induced allelopathy in response to intra- and interspecific competition. Methods We used the annual forb Crepidiastrum sonchifolium and the perennial forb Achyranthes bidentata, which are native to China and predominantly occur in ruderal communities, as focal species. We first grew the species without competition, with intraspecific competition and in competition with each other. We chemically analysed aqueous extracts made from these plants to test for evidence that the competition treatments affected the metabolomic profiles of the species. We then tested the effects of the aqueous extracts on seed germination and seedling growth of both plant species. Key Results Metabolomic analysis revealed that competition treatments modified the chemical profiles of the two study species. The root lengths of A. bidentata and C. sonchifolium seedlings were reduced by the aqueous plant extracts. For seedling root length of A. bidentata, heterospecific allelopathy was more negative than conspecific allelopathy, but for germination of C. sonchifolium seeds, the reverse was true. Moreover, conspecific allelopathic effects on germination of A. bidentata seeds and on seedling root length of both species were most negative when the aqueous extracts were made from plants that had experienced competition. In the case of seedling root length of A. bidentata, this effect was most negative when the plants had experienced interspecific instead of intraspecific competition. Conclusions We showed that plants change their metabolomic profiles in response to competition, and that this correlated with allelopathic inhibition of conspecific seed germination and seedling growth. We suggest that autoallelopathy for seed germination could function as a mechanism to avoid strong competition by keeping the seeds in a dormant state.

AB  - Tree shelters are effective in enhancing early survival and growth and protecting planted seedlings against herbivory by mammals; they are, however, expensive. In order to be cost-effective, we need to employ silvicultural practices that maximize the benefits of using tree shelters. Thus, this study examined whether tree shelter effects on early seedling growth are enhanced by the combination of large stock and vegetation control, based on a three factor split-plot experiment for the first three years after planting the seedlings out in a fenced plantation of Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica). Vegetation control involved spot and strip weeding to reduce labor costs. The experiment demonstrated the great effect of tree shelters on enhancing the early height growth of seedlings. At the end of the third growing season, sheltered seedlings were 1.5 times taller than unsheltered seedlings on average, and approximately two-thirds of sheltered seedlings had exceeded the browsing height of deer, while unsheltered seedlings had not. Using large stock and employing vegetation control also positively affected seedling height. However, combining these treatments with tree shelters intensified the positive effects on seedling height, and shortened the period during which the leader shoots of seedlings would be unprotected from the browsing without fencing. The present study thus reveals that the combination of tree shelters, large stock and vegetation control is effective in maximizing the benefit of tree shelter installation.

AB  - Simple Summary
   In the present study, twenty microsatellite loci were tested to assess and analyze the genetic diversity between and within 17 different populations of Turkish water buffalo. The total number of animals sampled was 837, collected from six geographical regions: Marmara Region (MRM), Black Sea Region (BSR), Aegean Region (AER), Central Anatolia Region (CAR), Eastern Anatolia Region (EAR) and Southeastern Anatolia Region (SAR). All studied microsatellites markers showed allelic polymorphism. In this study, the results indicated a definite genetic diversity among the Turkish water buffalo populations which indicates the existence of at least two major clusters.
   The present study was aimed to investigate the genetic diversity among 17 Turkish water buffalo populations. A total of 837 individuals from 17 provincial populations were genotyped, using 20 microsatellites markers. The microsatellite markers analyzed were highly polymorphic with a mean number of alleles of (7.28) ranging from 6 (ILSTS005) to 17 (ETH003). The mean observed and expected heterozygosity values across all polymorphic loci in all studied buffalo populations were 0.61 and 0.70, respectively. Observed heterozygosity varied from 0.55 (Bursa (BUR)) to 0.70 (Mus (MUS)). It was lower than expected heterozygosity in most of the populations indicating a deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The overall value for the polymorphic information content of noted microsatellite loci was 0.655, indicating their suitability for genetic diversity analysis in buffalo. The mean F-IS value was 0.091 and all loci were observed significantly deviated from Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE), most likely based on non-random breeding. The 17 buffalo populations were genetically less diverse as indicated by a small mean F-ST value (0.032 +/- 0.018). The analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) analysis indicated that about 2% of the total genetic diversity was clarified by population distinctions and 88 percent corresponded to differences among individuals. The information produced by this study can be used to establish a base of national conservation and breeding strategy of water buffalo population in Turkey.

AB  - Forest dynamics is driven by the formation of gaps, especially in temperate forests. A potentially useful tool for identifying canopy gaps at different spatial scales is remote sensing. Our study used two types of data: (1) high spatial resolution Canopy Height Model (CHM) to detect canopy gaps in the forest and (2) field data to quantify natural and artificial regeneration within the gaps. The study aimed to: (i) measure the characteristics of canopy gaps; (ii) identify the regeneration patterns within gaps; (iii) identify the factors influencing tree species regeneration within gaps. We analysed 313 tree canopy gaps in the Polish part of Bialowieza Forest (ca. 620 km(2)), east Poland. Variability in the mean gap area was very high, ranging from 20.2 to 8693.8 m(2). The number of gaps with an area > 1000 m(2) was the largest. The total area of gaps was highest in coniferous stands, where the biggest median area was also found. Gap size did not affect regeneration density in the Bialowieza Forest, except for birch and hornbeam. The density of less light-demanding tree species in the gaps was greater than light demanding ones. Birch regenerated in all gap sizes, and its density increased with gap area. Oak seedlings dominated in small gaps but conditions in the 'matrix of small gaps' was sufficient for short oak saplings. Hornbeam regeneration was highest in the gaps surveyed, especially the density of short saplings. Seedlings of hornbeam were present in 32% of gaps, but saplings were present in as many as 56% of gaps. Spruce regeneration was less numerous than hornbeam regeneration. Birch regeneration was the most numerous in short sapling stage. We analyzed 31 variables from different categories to identify the factors influencing tree species regeneration within gaps. The most essential variables for the birch and hornbeam regeneration were those containing supporting information, especially the percentage of the specific tree species covering the land around the gap. The variables based on gap geometry (size, shape, direction, elongation) were less important than variables from other categories. We found the positive influence of browsing on the density of hornbeam saplings. However, the high density of ungulates and their browsing pressure hinder birch regeneration. Intensive browsing by ungulates seems to be the most important factor in changing species composition and forest regeneration structure in gaps.

AB  - The introduction of non-native species has led to an increase in co-occurring species in shared habitats, particularly in aquatic ecosystems. This study aimed to elucidate how biological control agents modulate the interspecific competition between the invasive plant species Eichhornia crassipes and Alternanthera philoxeroides while also assessing the impact of their respective biocontrol agents, Neochetina eichhorniae and Agasicles hygrophila. Under controlled conditions, a 60-day experiment was conducted in which the growth, defoliation, relative growth rates, and root-to-shoot ratios of the two species in both monoculture and mixed culture were evaluated in the presence and absence of their biological control agents. The results indicate that E. crassipes consistently outperformed A. philoxeroides in growth under all of the tested treatment conditions, exhibiting greater biomass and higher relative growth rates in monocultures than in mixed cultures (p < 0.05). Defoliation of E. crassipes and A. philoxeroides increased significantly under herbivory (p < 0.05). Pathway analysis revealed that biological control agents had a pronounced negative effect on A. philoxeroides (the standardized path coefficients: - 0.93, p < 0.05), whereas interspecific competition was the most significant factor that suppressed E. crassipes (the standardized path coefficients: - 0.73, p > 0.05). These findings suggest that when biological control agents are present, E. crassipes is likely to gradually dominate and to displace A. philoxeroides within shared habitats. Mechanical removal of E. crassipes may be necessary in the short term, while the development and introduction of additional biocontrol agents could provide a more sustainable solution in the long term. The insights gained from this research provide a scientific basis for developing more effective management strategies to control the invasion of E. crassipes and A. philoxeroides in the riparian and wetland regions of southern China, where the two invasive species and their biological control agents frequently co-occur. Specifically, in addition to mechanical removal, the introduction, development, and enhancement of biological control agents are crucial for the effective restoration of native aquatic ecosystems compromised by multiple invasive species.

AB  - Extensive deer browsing threatens the ability of many forests in the northeastern United States to regenerate and sustain their biodiversity. To reliably assess whether deer are reducing the regeneration of key tree species valued for timber and wildlife, we developed a rapid field protocol for Assessing Vegetation Impacts from Deer (AVID, http://AVIDdeer.com). AVID is a method for foresters, landowners, volunteers, and others to measure the effect of deer browsing on seedling growth. Our objectives were to: 1. Determine if the AVID method could detect differences in growth rates for protected (fenced) and unprotected seedlings, 2. Evaluate AVID's usefulness as a regeneration monitoring tool for citizen-science engagement, and 3. Compare and contrast the relative strengths and weaknesses of common methods for measuring deer impacts to vegetation. We compared fenced and un-fenced plots at 10 research sites in New York State to validate the sensitivity of AVID for detecting deer impacts to seedling growth. Tagged seedlings were measured annually for height growth in replicated plots. Deer reduced average seedling height growth of palatable species several fold at these sites often in combination with the effects of site and year. From 2016 through 2020, we conducted 59 AVID training events with 1,399 participants including landowners, students, educators, naturalists, resource management professionals, and land trust staff. Volunteers established plots at 83 sites in 24 New York counties demonstrating that AVID provides a valued citizen-science approach for both teaching people and assessing deer impacts to forest regeneration. Once vol-unteers consistently monitor a statistically valid number of plots for several years, the New York's Department of Environmental Conservation intends to use AVID data to inform deer management decisions.

AB  - The prevalence of vector-borne pathogens in 81 European bison (Bison bonasus) was determined by nested PCR and DNA sequencing. Trypanosoma sp. Infections were detected in blood from 66.67 % of the studied animals, with the highest prevalence in Knyszyn Forest (82.67 %). Anaplasma phagocytophilum infections were found in 38.27 % of cases, with the highest prevalence in Bia & lstrok;owiez(center dot)a Forest (45.45 %). Anaplasma infection rates were influenced by location and age, with older animals showing lower prevalence. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that Trypanosoma sequences obtained from European bison were closely related to T. theileri, suggesting T. wrublewskii may be a synonym. This study provides new insights into the distribution of vector-borne pathogens in European bison, emphasizing their high prevalence in free-ranging populations. These findings contribute to a better understanding of European bison health and potential disease transmission risks in European ecosystems.

AB  - Background Traditional knowledge is key for sustainability, but it is rapidly disappearing. Pig keeping in forests and marshes is an ancient, once widespread, now vanishing practice, with a major economic and ecological potential. The knowledge of pig keepers and the foraging activity of pigs are hardly documented. Methods We studied the knowledge of traditional pig keepers (svinjars) on wild plants and pig foraging on the Sava-Bosut forest-marsh complex in Serbia. We conducted picture-based interviews about 234 locally common and/or salient plant species, and participatory fieldwork (11 days) and visual observation (21 days) on pig foraging. Results 181 wild plant species were known by svinjars and 106 taxa were consumed by pigs. Svinjars knew well and could name most regularly foraged species. 98 species were reported by svinjars as foraged and 56 as not eaten. 28 species were observed by the authors as eaten regularly, while 21 were nibbled and 17 avoided. Contradictory information on foraging was rare both among svinjars (8 species) and between svinjars and researchers (7 species); several of these species were rare. Leaves of 92, fruits or seeds of 21 and 'roots' of 20 species were reported or observed as eaten, usually with high seasonality. Svinjars were overall observant, but knew little about some less salient species (e.g. Veronica, Circaea). The most common forages (reported and/or observed) were fruits (Quercus, fleshy fruits), grasses (Agrostis, Glyceria), herbs (Ranunculus ficaria, Circaea), nutritious 'roots' (Carex spp., Iris), young shrub leaves (Crataegus, Carpinus) and 'tame' plants growing in the sun (Persicaria dubia, Erigeron annuus). Traditional, now extinct pig breeds were reported as less selective and more 'knowledgeable' about plants, as they received less additional fodder. Svinjars learnt their knowledge since childhood, from community members, but long-term personal observations and everyday encounters with pigs were also important sources of knowledge. Conclusions A deeper understanding of pig foraging could contribute to using pigs in nature conservation management, resource management and organic farming, and to a better understanding of wild boar foraging. The knowledge of svinjars is a disappearing intangible cultural heritage of European importance. Knowledge holders deserve recognition, and legal and financial support to continue this tradition.

AB  - We explored the effect of N addition and adult canopy competition on the recruitment of lost preferred species in the Patagonian steppe, where a decelerated N cycling scenario (sensu Ritchie et al., 1998) had been previously detected. In the first experiment we demonstrated that the preferred scarce grass Bromus pictus has typical traits of Competitive species, while the dominant less preferred Pappostipa speciosa has typical traits of Stress tolerant species (sensu Grime, 1997): B. pictus showed higher maximum Relative Growth Rate, water consumption and competitive ability than P. speciosa. In the second experiment, we proved that without N addition, seedlings of the preferred species showed its maximum survival rate under moderate grazing, where adult competition is lower than under ungrazed conditions and N-limitation is lower than under intense grazing. Instead, with N addition, the survival rate of B. pictus was maximum under intense grazing, where N limitation is maximum and adult competition is minimum. These results suggest that in degraded systems subjected to a decelerating N cycling scenario, the revegetation with preferred species would require recovering soil N levels, and would be more successful in the most degraded sites, where the remnant canopy has low cover.

AB  - Under the context of socio-economic and ecological changes, frequent human-wildlife conflicts (HWCs) have occurred worldwide in recent years. To identify the drivers of human-wildlife conflicts and establish effective management measures, the human-wild boar conflicts in typical city of China were used to conduct empirical study. This study built a database of human-wild boar conflicts (also known as wild boar damage incidents) using 102 wild boar damage incidents occurred in the urban area of Nanjing from 2000 to 2022 to identify the spatiotemporal patterns, hazards and driving factors of these incidents by employing exploratory spatial analysis and geographical detector model. The results showed that the increase in wild boar damage incidents was influenced by a combination of rapid urbanization, habitat fragmentation, vegetation recovery, topography and other aspects. Among them, the root cause is the continuous expansion of built-up areas into the mountainous areas within cities and even encroachment on the mountains, resulting in the fragmentation and shrinkage of wildlife living space. Thus wildlife (represented by wild boars) had to move out and even invade the living space of humans, intensifying conflicts between humans and wild boars. HWCs are a symptom of the imbalance between socioeconomical systems and ecosystems within cities. The government should take some management measures to mitigate these conflicts and promote the harmonious coexistence between humans and nature within cities. For example, limit development, take defragmentation actions and improve compensation mechanism. The process of driving factor analysis of human-wild boar conflicts and related management measures in this paper would be helpful to address similar issues in other cities.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs; or drones) are an emerging tool to provide a safer, cheaper, and quieter alternative to traditional methods of studying marine megafauna in a natural environment. The UFES Nectology Laboratory team developed a drone-monitoring to assess the impacts on megafauna related to the Fundao dam mining tailings disaster in the Southeast Brazilian coast. We have developed a systematic pattern to optimize the available resources by covering the largest possible area. The fauna observer can monitor the environment from a privileged angle with virtual reality and subsequently analyzes each video captured in 4k, allowing to deepening behavioral ecology knowledge. Applying the drone-monitoring method, we have observed an increasing detectability by adjusting the camera angle, height, orientation, and speed of the UAV; which saved time and resources for monitoring turtles, sea birds, large fish, and especially small cetaceans efficiently and comparably.

AB  - Climate change is driving a shift in the distribution of global kelp forests, with the contraction of kelp habitats occurring at warm range edges. Declining kelps often have been replaced by novel algal turf assemblages, which are reinforced by ecological feedback mechanisms and provide fewer ecosystem services. Trophic interactions among marine herbivores, algal turfs, and kelps on algal turf-dominated reefs remain poorly resolved but could have important implications for the stability of algal turf reefs and the potential for kelp forest recovery. Here, we examine herbivory by the Atlantic purple sea urchin, Arbacia punctulata, in a degraded kelp forest ecosystem dominated by algal turf in southern New England, USA. In a localized field survey, we observed lower algal turf cover on reef areas containing A. punctulata (mean +/- SE: 62 +/- 12% turf cover) as compared to areas with no sea urchins present (92 +/- 4% turf cover). Reef areas with and without sea urchins had similarly low cover of the previously dominant kelp, Saccharina latissima (6-8% kelp cover). In laboratory and field experiments, individuals or groups of A. punctulata enclosed with a diet choice of algal turf versus kelp had higher grazing rates on the algal turf. A. punctulata in the laboratory also exhibited greater attraction to algal turf over kelp, physically moving towards this food source. In combination, the results provide evidence that A. punctulata has a feeding preference for algal turf over kelp in southern New England. Future research is warranted to further examine the grazing ecology of A. punctulata, particularly in the context of ongoing kelp forest restoration efforts in this region.

AB  - Trophic support of species-rich tropical fish communities remains uncertain in small forest streams where dense and constant canopy cover strongly limits the solar radiation available to aquatic producers. We sampled >1300 fish from 80 species in 14 remote headwater streams during the dry season in French Guiana. Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analyses and mixing models were run to estimate the trophic position (TP) of each species and its dependence on terrestrial organic carbon sources. Matching patterns were found between nitrogen stable isotope ratios and the literature on diets of species at the base and top of the food web. Nearly 60% of the species fed exclusively on animal prey (mean TP >3), including piscivorous and parasitic fish species. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that TP were distributed broadly along the phylogeny and changed gradually within lineages. Carbon stable isotope ratios differed strongly between herbivores that fed on aquatic primary producers and those that fed on terrestrial plants along banksides. Terrestrial carbon was dominant in nearly 90% of species, and most of them depended more or less exclusively on terrestrial carbon. Ancestral state reconstructions indicated that only a few lineages showed local changes toward the consumption of algal carbon. We conclude that fish in neotropical headwater streams shaded by a dense tree canopy depend strongly on terrestrial subsidies. Changes in this aquatic-terrestrial linkage would have major consequences for the remarkable fish biodiversity in these streams.

AB  - Tropical freshwater wetlands are subject to multiple stressors but there is little information on which stressors cause wetland degradation. Increased turbidity is considered a major cause of degradation, but the effects of introduced fish are often overlooked. Tilapia are frequently introduced in tropical regions, especially species in the genus Oreochromis, and the ecological effects of introducing tilapia are poorly studied. We used enclosure experiments in a shallow lake in Madagascar to assess the effects of tilapia and turbidity on macrophytes and benthic invertebrates, and to test management interventions designed to increase both. Tilapia at high and low stocking densities had negative effects on survival of Charophyte algae and water lilies, but no direct effect on benthic invertebrate abundance or diversity. Invertebrate abundance was highest on submerged Charophytes, so herbivory by tilapia indirectly affected invertebrates. Turbidity affected Charophyte survival, and abundance and diversity of non-Dipteran insects. As a complication, tilapia may increase turbidity by re-suspending the lake sediment. Our results suggest that herbivory by tilapia is a plausible cause of the removal of macrophytes from the lake and an impediment to their re-establishment. Tilapia are widely introduced in tropical areas as a food resource. Our results demonstrate serious consequences to these introductions.

AB  - Forest degradation has gained global attention for its role in exacerbating biodiversity loss and climate change, yet indicators, baselines, and thresholds of degradation remain under debate. Maintaining key forest characteristics within bounds of natural variability offers a strategy to sustain ecological integrity and to provide potential measures of degradation. We used forest inventories, satellite-derived information, and government planning guidelines to evaluate five potential indicators of forest degradation during 2012-2021 for public forests in boreal northeastern Ontario, Canada. We tested two contrasting hypotheses (natural disturbance emulation vs. timber maximization) by comparing observed values against those from two reference landscapes: one shaped by empirical estimates of natural fire disturbance regimes and one by forest management aimed at maximizing timber volumes. All indicators fell outside bounds of natural variability from natural landscapes and were more consistent with timber maximization. Specifically, compared to natural landscapes, some forest types were disturbed at substantially higher rates; the proportion of forest >100 years old was significantly lower (22.4% on average vs. 53.5% in a natural landscape); and modelled boreal caribou and American marten habitats were highly fragmented and substantially reduced (12% for boreal caribou and 36% for American marten vs. corresponding percentages of 73% vs. 76% in a natural landscape). Government planning targets for natural variability targets also were lower than, and did not overlap with, empirical estimates. Continued degradation of biodiversity and ecological services is likely unless management approaches are altered.

AB  - Animals have a significant impact on the territory where they live by the process of their lives. The studied objects are located in the zone of dry steppes, where climatic conditions limit the development of vegetation and contribute to changes in soil characteristics, which, in combination with the impact of animals, enhances the effect. The purpose of the work was to assess the impacts of animals on the ecological state of the soils of the enclosures of the Wildlife of the Steppe Association. In the course of the study, the main indicators of the ecological state of soils in enclosures with animals on the territory of the enclosures of the Wildlife of the Steppe Association in the arid regions of the Rostov region were determined. We explored enclosures of different sizes, with African ostriches (Struthio camelus), emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae), goats (Capra sp.), Przewalski's horses (Equus ferus przevwalskii) and saigas (Saiga tatarica), and on the territory with semi-free grazing of ungulates, that is, horses (Equus caballus), camels (camelus bactrianus), buffaloes (Bubalus arnee), yaks (Bos mutus), and lamas (Lamaganicoe). The studied areas differed in the intensity of soil degradation. To assess the physical condition the moisture, temperature, density, and structure of the soil were determined; pH, the gross chemical composition of soils, humus content, and biological activity were also assessed, and plots were ranked according to the degree of pasture digression. In the course of the study, the enclosure with African ostriches had the maximum degree of degradation of ten, which is characterized by severe inhibition of vegetation and soil degradation. As well, the soil density in the enclosure with African ostriches was the highest, 1.49 g/cm(3), and the percentage of structure was the smallest, 37%. These parameters had a close negative correlation with the pressure of the animals' hooves and paws on the ground (-0.9). The humidity level in the studied areas did not rise above 11%; despite this, the enzymatic activity of the soils no longer depended on hydrothermal conditions, but on the influence of excretions of animal waste products. In enclosures with ungulates, in particular in the enclosure with goats, the activities of catalase and urease were always higher than in other areas. A high content of humus, 10.3%, was also noted there, which is uncharacteristic for chestnut soils and confirms the influence of animal life on them. According to the research results, the lowest quality of the structure, humus, and biological activity, as well as increased soil density, occurred in the enclosure with the African ostrich. The data we obtained explain the decrease in the growth and development of vegetation in the area where animals kept in crowded conditions live.

AB  - Grassland soils represent a significant potential pool for the sequestering of atmospheric CO2; however, the magnitude of this pool depends to a certain extent on the grazing management of the grassland. Whether different herbivore species and combinations (herbivore assemblage) influence the soil organic carbon (SOC) in various grasslands remains unclear. Here we have investigated the impacts of herbivore assemblages (NG, no grazing; SG, sheep grazing; CG, cattle grazing; and MG, mixed grazing of sheep and cattle) under moderate grazing intensity on a shallow layer of SOC storage across the three different grassland types (meadow steppe, typical steppe, and desert steppe) in the temperate steppes of Eastern Eurasia. We found that herbivore-species-specific effects on SOC storage depended on the grassland type. In mesic grasslands (i.e. meadow steppe and typical steppe), CG enhanced SOC storage, but there were no effects from SG. In contrast, SG in the xeric grassland (i.e. desert steppe) dramatically increased SOC storage while no effects were observed for CG. Importantly, MG of sheep and cattle consistently increased SOC storage across all grassland types. We suggest that adopting herbivore-type-specific stewardship in different grasslands could assist with the enhancement of ecosystem C functionality and services; large herbivores and small herbivores are suitable for grazing in mesic grasslands and xeric grasslands, respectively. Moreover, MG with diverse herbivores may be the optimal moderate grazing mode for soil C sequestration in most grasslands of northern China.

AB  - Marine megafauna serve valuable ecological and economical roles globally, yet, many species have experienced precipitous population declines. The significance of marine megafauna is particularly evident in Macaronesia, a complex of oceanic archipelagos in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean. Macaronesian islands provide important habitats for marine megafauna species, in turn supporting considerable regional economic activity (e.g., ecotourism and fisheries). Despite this, concerted efforts to manage marine megafauna throughout Macaronesia have been limited. This systematic review provides the first description of the trends in marine megafauna research in this unique insular ecosystem, to provide a better understanding of taxa-specific research needs and future directions for conservation. We identified and validated 408 peer-reviewed publications until 2021 following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) criteria. Literature was dominated by marine mammal research conducted in the northern archipelagos (Azores, Madeira, and Canary Islands) and marine turtle research conducted in Cabo Verde. Much less research focused on large-bodied fish, especially in Madeira and Canary Islands, leaving some of the most vulnerable species regionally data deficient. Research across scientific disciplines focused more on biological studies than management and policy, and anthropogenic impacts were quantified more frequently on mammals or turtles and less on fishes. By identifying gaps in our knowledge of megafauna in relation to threats faced by these organisms, we offer taxa-specific recommendations for future research direction. Although, overall our results indicate that determining population level connectivity should be a major research priority among many marine megafauna species as this information is vital to numerous management strategies, including marine protected areas. In this review, we present a basis of understanding of the current work in Macaronesia, highlighting critical data gaps that are urgently needed to guide the next steps toward establishing conservation priorities for marine megafauna in the region.

AB  - Intense development of Offshore Wind Farms (OWFs) has occurred in the North Sea with several more farms planned for the near future. These OWFs pose a threat to marine megafauna stressing the need to mitigate the impact of human activities. To help mitigate impacts, the Before After Gradient (BAG) design was proposed. We explored the use of the BAG method on megafauna sightings recorded at different distances from OWFs in the southern North Sea. We predicted intra-annual variability in species distribution, then correlated species distribution with the presence of operational OWFs and investigated the potential impact the operation of prospective OWFs may have on species distribution. Four patterns of intra-annual variability were predicted: species most abundant in spring, in winter, in both spring and winter, or all year round. We recommend that future OWF constructions be planned in summer and early fall to minimise impact on cetaceans and that offshore areas off northern France and Belgium be avoided to minimise impact on seabirds. Our prospective analysis predicted a decreased density for most species with the operation of prospective OWFs. Prospective approaches, using e.g. a BAG design, are paramount to inform species conservation as they can forecast the likely responses of megafauna to anthropogenic disturbances.

AB  - Gastrointestinal tract (GIT) nematode infections have a significant negative impact on the well-being and productivity of animals. While it is common for a host to be co-infected with multiple species of nematode parasites simultaneously, there is a lack of effective tools to study the composition of these complex parasite communities. We describe the application of the "nemabiome" amplicon sequencing to study parasitic GIT nematode communities in captive wildlife at the National Zoological Garden, South African National Biodiversity Institute. A total of 13 samples from Roan antelope (n=1), Eland (n=1), Sable antelope (n=9), Arabian oryx (n=1), and Blue duiker (n=1) were analysed for the presence of GIT nematode infections. A total of 256 operational taxonomical units (OTUs) were generated and compared to a curated database with >= 99% identity to sequences in the NCBI database. The OTUs found represented nematode species which are commonly associated with wild ruminants. These belonged to members of the genera Haemonchus, Trichostrongylus, and Cooperia, with a few OTUs classified as unidentified genera detected. These were further classified to species level, with Haemonchus contortus and Trichostrongylus colubriformis having high relative abundance across all captive ungulate species. Utilizing amplicon sequencing to examine the nemabiome holds great potential for enhancing our basic knowledge of the biology of gastrointestinal nematodes and monitoring infections. This improved understanding could guide the development of more efficacious preventive and control measures against these significant parasites, which negatively impact animal health and productivity on a global scale.

AB  - Contrasting light environments in rainforests generates changes in the characteristics of the leaves and in the herbivore community. In the present study, we carried out a reciprocal transplant experiment under natural conditions to determine the plasticity of leaf characteristics of plant species that grow in contrasting light environments in a Neotropical forest. We further explored the relationship between these traits and insect herbivory. We found that six woody species differ markedly in the phenotypic plasticity of leaf features. The specific leaf area, chlorophyll content, carbon content, nitrogen content, and leaf thickness of the most light-demanding species were highest in gaps, but their carbon/nitrogen ratios were higher under closed canopies. The herbivores were more abundant in gaps (5.9%-14.8%) than under closed canopy habitats (3.4%-6.1%) and seemingly associated to the plasticity of the leaf traits. We observed 47% more herbivores in gaps than under closed canopies. Our results suggest that the phenotypic plasticity of leaf traits depends on the identity of the plant species and its wood density, while herbivory seems to be affected by plant defence, low nutritional quality, or herbivore tolerance.

AB  - The movements of animals affect biodiversity, ecological processes, and the resilience of an ecosystem. Movements carry both costs and benefits, and the use of a given landscape provides important insights into an animal's behavioural ecology and decision processes, as well as elucidating ecosystem complexity and informing conservation measures that are ever more important in the age of rapid global changes. The mobility and habitat preferences of African savanna elephants (Loxodonta africana) offer a good example to explore the concept of 'energy landscapes', that is, the interplay between the cost of locomotion and vegetation productivity, balanced by topography, availability of water and human presence and pressures. Our results, building on tracking data from 157 individuals collected between 1998 and 2020 in Northern Kenya, show that energy landscapes explained the elephants' usage of the landscape. In particular, we found that individuals generally avoided energetically costly areas and preferred highly productive habitats. We also found that water availability is important in determining habitat usage, but that its effect varied greatly among elephants, with some individuals preferring habitats avoided by others. Our analysis highlights the importance of the energy landscape as a key driver of habitat preferences of elephants. Energy landscapes rely on fundamental biomechanical and physical principles and provide a mechanistic understanding of the observed preference patterns, allowing us to disentangle key causal drivers of an animal's preferences from correlational effects. This, in turn, has important implications for assessing and planning conservation and restoration measures, such as dispersal corridors, by explicitly accounting for the energy costs of moving.

AB  - Waste pollution poses a significant threat to the survival of wildlife. In particular, microplastic pollution has received widespread attention. However, data on the exposure of threatened wildlife in nature conservation to microplastics, a very valuable basic data for animal conservation, are still limited. This study was conducted in the Qinling Mts., a key biodiversity hotspot and an essential genetic resource repository in China. Over the span from 2021 to 2023, a total of 22 fecal samples were collected from three species with different feeding habits over four months in two nature reserves in the Qinling Mts.: takin (Budorcas taxicolor), leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis), and golden snub-nosed monkey (Rhinopithecus roxellana). The potential reasons influencing the content of microplastics were studied on the basis of the distance of the fecal samples from the nearest residential area. Laser Direct Infrared Spectroscopy identified 34 types of microplastics, with diameters ranging from 20 to 100 mu m. Among them, acrylate copolymer, polyethylene, and polyurethane were the main types. Leopard cat (67.06 particles/g d.w.) had a significantly higher microplastic content than the takins (20.53 particles/g d.w.; Z=-3.162, P=0.002) and golden snub-nosed monkeys (27.69 particles/g d.w.; Z=-2.193, P=0.028). The average microplastic content in leopard cats and takins exhibited a negative correlation with the distance from residential areas. In conclusion, our study demonstrates the presence of microplastics within threatened terrestrial wildlife. Addressing this pressing issue may require concerted efforts to reduce plastic consumption in the surrounding regions, which could help mitigate the adverse impacts on wildlife.

AB  - Floodplain forests provide a highly suitable environment for wild boar, especially because they offer a sufficient quantity of good-quality food across the seasons. Combined with year-round additional feeding and treatment, wild boar enjoy ideal living conditions in floodplain forests, which should have a positive effect on reproduction and, in turn, an increase in population. We expected the high carrying capacity of the floodplain forest environment to be reflected in young boar showing greater body weight and have a higher layer of subcutaneous fat, young females being in their first heat earlier, and females of all ages having more young. This was verified on a sample of wild boar females collected in Czechia's largest floodplain forest, which extends above the confluence of the Morava and Dyje Rivers and which is fenced off and used for breeding hoofed ruminant mammals. In addition to determining body characteristics and examining reproductive tracts, food quality was also analysed based on an analysis of stomach contents. Body and reproductive characteristics were compared with available data for the South Moravia. It has been confirmed that, in the floodplain forest, wild boar have a sufficient quantity of good-quality food all year round, yet they reach a smaller body size across all age classes. Piglets ovulated more eggs, while in contrast older females ovulated fewer. That is also why they gave birth to fewer piglets per litter. Wild boar in the floodplain forest gave birth later, with a birthing peak in May-June. This delay can be explained by the adaptation of wild boar populations in floodplain forests to the annual floods that come in March. We estimate that wild boar are able to respond flexibly not only to the food conditions of their environment, but also to the risk of possible mortality and other significant stressors, and to adapt their reproductive strategy accordingly.

AB  - The excessive application of chemical fertilizers in intensively managed agricultural fields worldwide has resulted in soil degradation and biodiversity loss. This has contributed to a growing interest in sustainable management, such as organic farming. Until now, studies addressing the impact of conventional and organic management on soil biodiversity and functioning have mainly focused on arable farming and only a few reports are available on vegetable production. Vegetable farming is of particular interest, since management intensity is usually very high and there is an increasing demand for vegetable products. Soil nematodes are useful indicators of management intensity on soil ecosystem functioning because they occupy several trophic levels in soil microfood webs and play a crucial role in nutrient cycling, pest suppression, and the regulation of microbial communities. In this study, we assessed the impact of management intensity and farming system on the community structure and functional guilds of soil nematodes, comparing 20 conventional vegetable fields, 20 organic vegetable fields, and 20 extensive grasslands in Switzerland, analyzing over 30'000 nematode individuals and detecting 98 different nematode genera. We found significant differences in the community structure and functional composition across three farming systems. Extensive grasslands contained the highest nematode abundance, followed by organic vegetable fields, and conventional vegetable fields, indicating a decline due to land-use intensification. Organic farming led to a significant increase in the abundance of herbivores (+82%), bacterivores (+206%) and omnivores (+135%) in comparison with conventional farming. Organic management also enhanced composite (+195%) and herbivores (+451%) footprints, suggesting greater carbon and energy enrichment in soil food web through these functional groups. Community composition of soil nematodes varied significantly across the three farming systems, with each farming system fostering specific indicator taxa. In conclusion, our results show that farming system has a major impact on soil nematode communities with increasing nematode populations under organic vegetable farming. Although organic vegetable production may benefit from enhanced soil fertility due to increased population densities of microbe feeding and omnivorous nematodes, the threat from plant parasitic nematodes to vegetable production requires attention and control strategies should be developed further.

AB  - Background Comparative cognition has historically focused on a few taxa such as primates, birds or rodents. However, a broader perspective is essential to understand how different selective pressures affect cognition in different taxa, as more recently shown in several studies. Here we present the same battery of cognitive tasks to two understudied ungulate species with different socio-ecological characteristics, European bison (Bison bonasus) and forest buffalos (Syncerus caffer nanus), and we compare their performance to previous findings in giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis). We presented subjects with an Object permanence task, Memory tasks with 30 and 60 s delays, two inference tasks based on acoustic cues (i.e. Acoustic inference tasks) and a control task to check for the use of olfactory cues (i.e. Olfactory task). Results Overall, giraffes outperformed bison and buffalos, and bison outperformed buffalos (that performed at chance level). All species performed better in the Object permanence task than in the Memory tasks and one of the Acoustic inference tasks (which they likely solved by relying on stimulus enhancement). Giraffes performed better than buffalos in the Shake full Acoustic inference task, but worse than bison and buffalos in the Shake empty Acoustic inference task. Conclusions In sum, our results are in line with the hypothesis that specific socio-ecological characteristics played a crucial role in the evolution of cognition, and that higher fission-fusion levels and larger dietary breadth are linked to higher cognitive skills. This study shows that ungulates may be an excellent model to test evolutionary hypotheses on the emergence of cognition.

AB  - PurposeAnimal trypanosomosis is one of the most important parasitic diseases significantly affecting the Philippine economy. It is considered by the government to be the second most important disease of livestock after fasciolosis. A PCR-based molecular survey for trypanosomes in different animals in Bohol, Philippines, was performed to assess the prevalence of trypanosomosis in the area during the rainy and dry season.MethodsA total of 269 blood samples were collected in two batches in rainy and dry season from different animal species in Ubay Stock Farm in Ubay, Bohol, the Philippines, including 151 samples from water buffaloes, 76 samples from cattle, 35 samples from goats, and 7 samples from horses. DNA was subsequently extracted from these blood samples, and two different PCR assays were employed to detect and identify trypanosomes DNA including ITS1 PCR and CatL PCR.ResultsAnimal trypanosomes, Trypanosoma evansi and Trypanosoma theileri, were detected in water buffalo (37.7%) [95%CI: 30.4 - 45.7], cattle (44.7%) [95%CI: 34.1 - 55.9], and goats (34.3%) [95%CI: 20.8 - 50.8]. Only T. evansi was detected in horses (28.6%) [95% CI: 8.2 - 64.1]. No clinical signs were observed in all positive animals.ConclusionThis highlights the importance of domestic animals that can be infected with no signs but may act as reservoir animals and transmit trypanosomosis to susceptible animals. This study supports the importance of regular surveillance to estimate the prevalence of the disease, emphasizing its various dynamics in the affected areas and supporting efficient intervention measures.

AB  - Wild boar (Sus scrofa L.) is one of the most discussed game species, distributed across Europe, therefore the management of this species is considered important. This management should be based on data presented, population quality and preferences and craniometric dimensions show the development of the individual and its prosperity. A sample of 148 male and 153 female wild boar mandibles was studied to compare differences in craniometric measurements, especially to find out wild boar environmental demands and population trends. The width of the caput mandibulae and angle of the mandible showed significant difference between males and females. Measurements analysed with forest area size and other data also showed that larger craniometric dimensions were reached in hunting areas with at least 200 ha of forested area, which may be due to the wild boar's need for safety and vegetative cover in the first months of piglet development with respect to its home range. The development of young wild boar is dependent on rest and shelter in the first months of life. A forest cover of at least 200 ha appears to be sufficient in this respect. Information on habitat preferences and individual development can lead to improvements in wild boar management.

AB  - Context Winter is generally considered the limiting season for wildlife populations living in high-latitude/altitude regions. Logically, managers have used temperature and snow variables or indices to predict survival and adjust harvest quotas according to winter severity. A common approach is to use a winter severity index (WSI) to evaluate the effects of winter severity on game species (e.g. ungulates). However, a WSI requires both snow and temperature data, ideally collected at broad spatial scales and at high temporal resolution (e.g. weekly), and can take considerable effort to collect the data.Aims We evaluated the influence of several winter variables, including a WSI that has been used for predicting winter survival over the past several decades, on adult female white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) survival in northern New England. We also considered the influence of humans (anthropogenic influence), primarily in the form of artificial feeding, on deer survival.Methods We monitored 200 radio-collared deer in four different management units that spanned the gradient of winter climate and anthropogenic influence in the region over the course of seven winters (2015-2021). We used known-fate, staggered-entry, binomial models in a Bayesian framework to evaluate factors that influenced deer survival.Key results We recorded 64 mortalities that were primarily associated with predation in the northern regions but also from deer-vehicle collisions. Average (95% credible intervals [CI]) winter survival was 78% (66-89%), with the lowest and highest estimates occurring during the harshest (72%; CI = 54-85%) and mildest (82%; CI = 67-93%) winters respectively. The top survival model included snow depth under closed canopy and an additive effect of anthropogenic influence; snow depth had a negative effect, and anthropogenic influence had a positive effect on survival. However, WSI had low predictive power, and predicted higher survival in most winters and regions.Conclusions Our study indicated that winter survival rates of adult female deer were most influenced by snow and anthropogenic factors in northern New England and that WSI indices for evaluating the impacts of winter on deer populations were not robust for monitoring survival and determining harvest quotas.Implications Natural resource agencies should consider using alternative field methods (e.g. remote cameras) for monitoring annual snowpack and deer survival in high latitude regions. Further research is needed to determine which anthropogenic factors have a negative and positive impact on deer survival.

AB  - Salt cedar (Tamarix spp. L), is found across Texas and the western United States, primarily near riparian areas. Introduced in the 1800s as an ornamental plant, salt cedar escaped domestic gardens, invading native rangelands. Mechanical and chemical control options for salt cedar are available, but effective control can be difficult and cost prohibitive. Sheep and goats will readily consume salt cedar after exposure at weaning, and goats readily consume the plant when released on rangelands. Unfortunately, sheep and goats are not a viable option in many areas due to predation or lack of appropriate fencing. The objectives of this study were to determine if cattle would consume salt cedar at a similar level (body weight basis) as sheep and goats and to determine if preconditioning improved acceptance of salt cedar by cattle. Angus-Hereford cross heifers (n = 15), Rambouillet lambs (n = 15), and Boer-Spanish cross kids (n = 15) were placed in individual pens for 21 d and fed salt cedar leaves and tender stems daily. For the first 21 d, eight head from each species were fed a basal diet and salt cedar while 7 head only received the basal diet. The amount of salt cedar in the diet was increased from 5% of the diet to 10% of the diet after 7 d of feeding and fed until d 21. From d 22 to 28 both naive and familiar animals were fed salt cedar daily. All animals readily increased intake of salt cedar. By d 7, cattle, sheep, and goats consumed the plant, but intake varied daily for cattle and sheep. After the first 7 d, goats consistently ate more (P < 0.05) salt cedar than cattle or sheep. While goats may consume more salt cedar, cattle may be a viable option to reduce salt cedar cover when goats are not a viable option. (C) 2021 The Society for Range Management.

AB  - We live in an era where future generations are experiencing a serious loss of knowledge, sensitivity, and interest in biodiversity. This situation is thought to be unique to urbanised countries with limited green spaces. However, with the increasing urbanisation of rural areas, it is necessary to investigate what is happening in places of high biodiversity. In this study, we investigated the knowledge, attitudes and perceptions of children and adolescents in the rural municipality of Jos & eacute; Mar & iacute;a Morelos in southeastern Mexico. We analysed 1119 drawings by 117 children in their first three years of school and interviewed 280 students in their last three years of primary, secondary and high school. Younger children drew more native species, with the majority being mammals. Of the students surveyed, secondary school students had the highest level of species knowledge and considered deer and jaguar to be the most important species. They considered hunting to be the main cause of animal depletion and had a positive attitude towards nature conservation. Based on our findings, we recommend that educational strategies be implemented at all school levels to promote knowledge of the less emblematic species that inhabit the Selva Maya.

AB  - Assessing the effects of industrial development on wildlife is a key objective of managers and conservation practitioners. However, wildlife responses are often only investigated with respect to the footprint of infrastructure, even though human activity can strongly mediate development impacts. In Arctic Alaska, there is substantial interest in expanding energy development, raising concerns about the potential effects on barren-ground caribou (Rangifer tarandus granti). While caribou generally avoid industrial infrastructure, little is known about the role of human activity in moderating their responses, and whether managing activity levels could minimize development effects. To address this uncertainty, we examined the influence of traffic volume on caribou summer space use and road crossings in the Central Arctic Herd within the Kuparuk and Milne Point oil fields on the North Slope of Alaska. We first modeled spatiotemporal variation in hourly traffic volumes across the road system from traffic counter data using gradient-boosted regression trees. We then used generalized additive models to estimate nonlinear step selection functions and road-crossing probabilities from collared female caribou during the post-calving and insect harassment seasons, when they primarily interact with roads. Step selection analyses revealed that caribou selected areas further from roads (similar to 1-3 km) during the post-calving and mosquito seasons and selected areas with lower traffic volumes during all seasons, with selection probabilities peaking when traffic was <5 vehicles/h. Using road-crossing models, we found that caribou were less likely to cross roads during the insect seasons as traffic increased, but that response dissipated as insect harassment became more severe. Past studies suggested that caribou exhibit behavioral responses when traffic exceeds 15 vehicles/h, but our results demonstrate behavioral responses at much lower traffic levels. Our results illustrate that vehicle activity mediates caribou responses to road infrastructure, information that can be used in future land-use planning to minimize the behavioral responses of caribou to industrial development in sensitive Arctic landscapes.

AB  - Seabirds are important to island ecosystems because of their ecological functions; however, they are threatened by alien mammal invasions. Where alien mammals have been eradicated, seabird numbers, and ranges have often increased. Whether or not this constitutes recovery, however, is debatable because the post-eradication seabird fauna might be different from the pre-disturbance fauna that in most cases has not been recorded. Thus, identifying the pre-disturbance seabird fauna is essential to determine a conservation goal. With this as our aim, we examined and radiocarbon-dated avian bone remains found in a limestone cave on Minamijima, an islet on the Ogasawara Islands. The islet was invaded by goats Capra hircus and black rats Rattus rattus after 1830, and seabirds had declined. Since the 1970s, the alien mammals have been eradicated, and numbers of Wedge-tailed Shearwaters Puffinus pacificus, Bulwer's Petrels Bulweria bulwerii, and Brown Boobies Sula leucogaster have increased. However, the dominant species in the avian remains were Bonin Petrels Pterodroma hypoleuca, Bryan's Shearwaters Pu. bryani, and Bannerman's Shearwaters Pu. bannermani. The radiocarbon ages of the bones were approximately 6,000-600 years BP. Therefore, seabird fauna was largely changed by the invasion and eradication of alien mammals. Our results indicate that the post-eradication increase in seabirds is not a recovery, although the current inhabitants are native seabirds. The recent dominant species are likely to have thrived because they are cosmopolitan and competitive, and they prefer open habitats produced by goat grazing. We suggest that avian remains surveys should be exploited for ecosystem restoration.

AB  - Vertical seed dispersal towards higher or lower altitudes is an important process for plants' adaptation to climate change. Although many plants depend on animals for seed dispersal, studies on vertical seed dispersal by animals, determined by complex animal behaviours, are scarce. Previous studies hypothesised that animals inhabiting temperate regions disperse seeds uphill in spring/summer and downhill in autumn/winter due to their seasonal movement following the altitudinal gradients in food phenology. However, this hypothesis has only been tested in seed dispersal by mammals on one mountain range. Vertical seed dispersal by birds might differ from that by mammals, and frugivorous megafauna extinction and mountain topography may affect seed dispersal patterns. Here we assessed the vertical seed dispersal of summer and summer-to-autumn fruiting cherries by mammals and birds across three Japanese mountain ranges, two of them with presence of a megafauna, the Asian black bear. We found strong uphill seed dispersal of summer fruiting cherry species and weak downhill seed dispersal of summer-to-autumn fruiting cherry species, irrespective of the frugivore community and mountain topography. These indicate that the fruiting phenology affects the direction of vertical seed dispersal by mammals and birds across mountains. Mammals and birds dispersed seeds over a similar vertical profile, although birds are likely to be low-quantity seed dispersers. The absence of bears, which dispersed the majority of the seeds, was not compensated by the remaining mammal species. The results suggest that the fruiting phenology and megafauna presence affect whether animal-dispersed temperate plants can migrate efficiently under climate change.

AB  - Forest cover and light availability comprise key factors for plant establishment in tropical forests. In the Brazilian Atlantic Forest (AF), Euterpe edulis (Areacaceae) is an endangered and keystone food resource contributing to forest functionality. We investigated the influence of forest loss and light availability on leaf traits and acclimatization of young individuals of E. edulis in AF fragments. We aimed to understand (i) how canopy openness and transmitted light are affected by forest cover at the landscape scale and the individual palm level; and (ii) how local and landscape features, combined and separately, affect key leaf traits widely known to be related to plant growth. The study was carried out in 15 forest fragments, ranging from 16 to 97% of surrounding forest cover. In each fragment, we sampled 10-20 individuals of E. edulis and analyzed nine leaf traits related to morphological, biochemical and chemical aspects. We also took hemispherical photographs to estimate canopy openness on the top of each E. edulis and also within fragment plots. We found that young plants predominantly occurred in more shaded environments. Additionally, E. edulis succeeded to acclimate in six of the nine traits analyzed, with most traits being affected by local and landscape features. It is likely that the lack of variation in traits related to protection against herbivory are limiting the species establishment in highly deforested landscapes. Our results provide novel evidence that both landscape and local contexts affect the leaf traits of E. edulis young plants leading to biochemical, chemical and morphological adjustments.

AB  - Size of antlers in polygynous male cervids is a result of their genetic potential and nutrition and is believed to be a reliable indicator of males' fitness and habitat quality. We used data on antler size of 1390 red deer males harvested during hunting seasons 2014/2015-2018/2019 in Slovakia to test the hypothesis that spatial variation in the size of antlers, including number of tines, mass and length of antlers, is related to environmental conditions such as availability of calcium, phosphorus and nitrogen in soils and deer density. We found that overall hunting value of antlers including number of tines, mass and length of antlers were higher in areas with higher availability of the CaCO3, P and N in soils. Moreover, we found no signs of decline in the overall score and in number of tines when availability of CaCO3 was high, in the length of antler when availability of P was high, and in the antler mass when availability of N was high. Deer density had negative effect on the antler size including the number of tines and antler length and had no effect on the onset of the peak and rate of decline except for the antler mass. Understanding the extent to which environment influences antler size in cervids is important to develop structured and region-specific policies.

AB  - Understanding the drivers and impacts of spatiotemporal variation in species abundance on community trajectories is key to understanding the factors contributing to ecosystem resilience. Temporal variation in species trajectories across patches can provide compensation for species loss and can influence successional patterns. However, little is known about the underlying mechanisms that lead to patterns of species or spatial compensation and how those patterns may be mediated by consumer-resource relationships. Here we describe an experiment testing whether habitat attributes (e.g., structural complexity and spatial heterogeneity) mediate the effects of herbivory on tropical marine macroalgal communities by reducing accessibility and detectability, respectively, leading to variable trajectories among algal species at community (within patch) and metacommunity (i.e., among patch) scales. Reduced accessibility (greater habitat complexity) decreased the effects of herbivory (i.e., depressed consumption rate, increased algal species richness), and both accessibility and detectability (spatial heterogeneity) influenced algal community structure. Moreover, decreased accessibility at the community scale and a mosaic of accessibility at the metacommunity scale led to variation in community assembly. We suggest that habitat attributes can be important influencers of consumer-resource interactions on coral reefs, which in turn can increase species diversity, promote species succession, and enhance stability in algal metacommunities.

AB  - Landscapes are mosaics of habitat associated with different risks and resources, including human activities, which can affect individual survival in wildlife. Different relationships between habitat characteristics and human-caused and natural mortality can result in attractive sinks. We used individual-based data from 97 Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx monitored for 160 exposure-years to link adult survival and the risk of mortality to home range habitat characteristics in the human-dominated landscape of southern Sweden. Human-caused mortality (i.e. legal hunting, poaching and vehicle accidents) dominated mortality causes (24 out of 37 deaths). We did not detect any strong effects of habitat characterises explaining the variation in mortality risk in lynx. Although the density of roe deer affects several aspects of lynx ecology, we could not detect any effects of roe deer density on lynx survival, probably because roe deer density was sufficiently high in our study area. Instead, seasonal variation was the main factor influencing mortality in lynx. Mortality was highest during the hunting season for lynx (16 February-31 March), as well as during autumn and winter, probably because lynx poaching occurs opportunistically during the hunting season for moose and roe deer. We did not find any indication that human activity created attractive sinks for lynx, since there were no contrasting patterns between human-caused and natural mortality in terms of habitat characteristics. One explanation for the limited influence of the home range characteristics may be that lynx in our study died from multiple causes. Therefore, it is less likely that one or a few habitat characteristics could explain the risk of mortality at the home range scale. There is strong evidence that lynx can coexist with humans in multi-use and human-dominated landscapes, even without large protected areas, if the management regimes are favourable.

AB  - The diets of wild ungulates are a foundational component of their ecology, influencing their behavior, body condition, and demography. With changing environmental conditions, there is a significant need to identify important forage items for ungulates, but this has often proved challenging. Declines in several barren-ground caribou herds across the North American Arctic have raised concerns about the influence of climate change on caribou forage conditions. Shifts in plant phenology, biomass, quality, and composition may be influencing caribou diets and subsequently affecting their body condition and demographic rates. Although forage is a primary driver of barren-ground caribou behavior and population dynamics, there is limited recent information about the specific foods they consume, and uncertainty about appropriate methods for identifying those foods. Investigators are increasingly using fecal DNA metabarcoding and video camera collars to assess ungulate diets, but comparative studies of these approaches are lacking. To examine the summer diets of barren-ground caribou, we used both fecal metabarcoding and video camera collars to identify forage used by the Porcupine caribou herd, which spans the Alaska-Yukon border. In 2021, we sampled the diets of adult females by collecting fecal samples and observing collar videos during 4 sampling occasions. We found that caribou consumed very specific forage items, and those items varied markedly across the growing season. Caribou predominantly consumed graminoids and lichens during early summer, and shrubs and forbs later in the season. Metabarcoding and video data provided significantly different estimates of diet for all taxonomic levels we evaluated, and inferences from the two approaches were often disparate. Metabarcoding failed to detect some items frequently consumed in videos, such as lichens, and indicated high use of other items rarely consumed, such as mosses. We found that video data provided greater taxonomic diversity and resolution for vascular plants and lichens, and more closely aligned with past research and biological expectations than data from fecal metabarcoding. Additional research is needed to be able to use these methods to identify the biomass of different forage items consumed.

AB  - Wild pigs (Sus scrofa) are one of the most ecologically harmful invasive vertebrates globally. Due to their negative impacts, wild pig populations are managed via trapping, yet studies investigating various trap designs have been limited in duration, location, and number of trappers. Using data from professional trappers across the southeastern U.S., we evaluated the performance of 3 wild pig trap types (corral, drop, passive net), and the effect of forage season (barren, green-up, masting) on trapping success. Specifically, we compared trap effectiveness (estimated proportion of targeted wild pigs caught per capture event), trap night effort (number of days to first catch), and the amount of bait and time used per individual take over the lifetime of each trap location across the 3 trap types and forage seasons. Across >850 capture events by 31 trappers, all 3 trap types evaluated were effective at capturing entire social groups of wild pigs. Few differences were observed among trap types, although drop traps in masting season captured a greater estimated proportion of wild pigs per capture event compared to other trap type-season combinations. Our data also revealed that passive net traps required slightly more bait/wild pig captured than drop traps but there was no difference in the time/wild pig captured among traps. Our findings demonstrate that when operated by wildlife professionals, multiple designs of wild pig traps can be effective at removing targeted groups of wild pigs. Further, our results offer insights regarding the performance of wild pig trap types across seasons that can be used to inform wild pig trapping programs.

AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation are critical threats to biodiversity decline as they decrease the species occurrence and dispersal probability between natural habitats. Thus, promoting habitat connectivity supports species dispersal and accessibility to vital resources within the landscape, and contributes to long term population persistence. However, decision-making in human dominated landscapes challenges the sustainability of conservation-based land management initiatives. The Llanganates - Sangay Ecological Corridor is located on the eastern slopes of the Ecuadorian Andes, harbouring high levels of endemism and biodiversity in a humandominated landscape between two National Parks. We applied circuit analysis to model the habitat connectivity for the Mountain Tapir. We defined the limits of the corridor based on a Multi -Criteria Decision Analysis and a spatial suitability approach combined with a sub -basin prioritization method. We found that forest and native grasslands contribute the most to the Mountain Tapir's dispersal movements, while roads constrain them the most. Furthermore, natural vegetation remnants between pastures and crops support habitat connectivity as stepping-stones. We identified threats to biodiversity and distance to conservation areas as the most crucial features of spatial suitability. Our study combined scientific information to identify key areas for providing habitat connectivity of a landscape species and the spatial suitability necessary for sustaining wildlife conservation, while supporting the participation of local stakeholders, conservationists, academia, and NGOs.

AB  - The land application of livestock manure has been widely acknowledged as a beneficial approach for nutrient recycling and environmental protection. However, the impact of residual antibiotics, a common contaminant of manure, on the degradation of organic compounds and nutrient release in Eutric Regosol is not well understood. Here, we studied, how oxytetracycline (OTC) and ciprofloxacin (CIP) affect the decomposition, microbial community structure, extracellular enzyme activities and nutrient release from cattle and pig manure using litterbag incubation experiments. Results showed that OTC and CIP greatly inhibited livestock manure decomposition, causing a decreased rate of carbon (28%-87%), nitrogen (15%-44%) and phosphorus (26%-43%) release. The relative abundance of gramnegative (G-) bacteria was reduced by 4.0%-13% while fungi increased by 7.0%-71% during a 28 -day incubation period. Co -occurrence network analysis showed that antibiotic exposure disrupted microbial interactions, particularly among G- bacteria, G + bacteria, and actinomycetes. These changes in microbial community structure and function resulted in decreased activity of urease, fi-1,4-N-acetyl-glucosaminidase, alkaline protease, chitinase, and catalase, causing reduced decomposition and nutrient release in cattle and pig ma

AB  - Aims We tested the establishment success of grassland species in the presence or absence of zoochory by livestock and identified the traits associated with successful establishment. Location Hortobagy National Park, Hungary. Methods In six restored species-poor grasslands we established two species-rich 4 m x 4 m source plots per site in 2013. One source plot was managed by extensive cattle grazing ("zoochory on"), the other one was fenced and protected from grazers ("zoochory off"). We monitored the vegetation development in the source plots (2014-2018), and the establishment success of sown species (2016-2018) in adjacent dispersal plots in four, 20-m-long strips per source plot in a total of 960 dispersal plots. We calculated community-weighted means of thirteen plant traits related to regeneration and competitive ability. The effect of grazing, year, distance from source plots, grazing-year and grazing-distance interactions on population and trait dynamics in the source and dispersal plots were analysed with generalized linear mixed-effect models. Results Although grazing reduced the cover and flowering success of sown species in the source plots, the number of successful establishment events was higher in dispersal plots next to grazed source plots. The sown species were the most abundant in plots adjacent to source plots, but occurred at all monitored distances. Zoochory favoured perennial plants with high specific leaf area (SLA), low leaf dry matter content (LDMC), short stature, light seeds, early flowering period, high clonal index and anemochory index. Conclusions We showed that species that can colonize the matrix with and without zoochory have contrasting trait syndromes. In grazing-adapted ecosystems, fencing source populations of target species does not always seem to be a good option. It was a good tool for increasing the cover and flowering success of the sown species in the short run, but it significantly decreased their chance to colonize the surrounding area in the long run.

AB  - Simple Summary Throughout the world, the ruminant diet is based on conventional feedstuffs, which their price constantly fluctuates, and their use presents a concurrence to human nutrition. The use of alternative feed resources seems to be a solution to reduce charges and diversify ruminants' diet. Olive cake and cactus cladodes are two alternative feed resources that are recommended to be used in ruminant feed. However, their effect on the bacterial community of ruminants is not widely investigated. This study aims to evaluate the effect of olive cake and cactus cladodes on the ruminal microbial ecosystem and meat fatty acids of goat kids. The incorporation of these feedstuffs did not change the bacterial abundance and diversity. Goat kids' rumen liquor seemed to be able to adapt to alternative feed resources incorporation. The introduction of olive cake and cactus cladodes slightly affect meat fatty acids without a negative effect. Thus, ruminants seem to have the ability to adapt to the alternative feed resources digestion, and their use as a feed could diversify feed and reduce feed cost. The olive cake (OC) and the cactus cladodes (CC) are two alternative feed resources widely available in the southern Mediterranean region that could be used in ruminants' diet. Their impact on the rumen bacterial ecosystem is unknown. This work aims to evaluate their effects on the microbial community and meat fatty acids of goat's kids. Forty-four goat kids were divided into four groups receiving diets with conventional concentrate, or 35% OC, or 30% CC, or 15% OC, and 15% CC. After 3 months, these animals were slaughtered, and the rumen liquor and longissimus dorsi and semimembranosus muscles samples were collected. Animals receiving a control diet had rumen liquor with high acidity than test groups (p < 0.001). Test rumen liquor was more adapted to digest efficiently their matching diet than control liquor (p < 0.05). These feedstuffs did not affect rumen bacteria abundance and alpha diversity (richness, evenness, and reciprocal Simpson indexes), and these results were confirmed by beta-diversity tests (NMDS plot, HOMOVA, PERMANOVA). The test diets slightly affected the individual fatty acids of meat (p < 0.05) without effect on fatty acids summaries, indexes, and ratios. Thus, these alternative feed resources could take place in goat kids' diet to diversify their feed and to reduce feed costs.

AB  - The geographic range of tick populations has expanded in Canada due to climate warming and the associated poleward range shifts of their vertebrate hosts. Abiotic factors, such as temperature, precipitation, and snow, are known to directly affect tick abundance. Yet, biotic factors, such as the abundance and diversity of mammal hosts, may also alter tick abundance and consequent tick-borne disease risk. Here, we incorporated host surveillance data with high-resolution environmental data to evaluate the combined impact of abiotic and biotic factors on questing Ixodes scapularis abundance in Ontario and Quebec, Canada. High-resolution abiotic factors were derived from remote sensing satellites and meteorological towers, while biotic factors related to mammal hosts were derived from active surveillance data that we collected in the field. Generalized additive models were used to determine the relative importance of abiotic and biotic factors on questing I. scapularis abundance. Combinations of abiotic and biotic factors were identified as important drivers of abundances of questing I. scapularis. Positive and negative linear relationships were found for questing I. scapularis abundance with monthly mean precipitation and accumulated snow, but no effect was found for the relative abundance of white-footed mice. Positive relationships were also identified between questing I. scapularis abundance with monthly mean precipitation and mammal species richness. Therefore, future studies that assess I. scapularis should incorporate host surveillance data with high-resolution environmental factors to determine the key drivers impacting the abundance and geographic spread of tick populations and tick-borne pathogens.

AB  - Globally, aquaculture has shown the potential to boost economic activity and enhance food security. However, controversy exists around large-scale finfish farming, with objections centred around potential environmental issues (especially eutrophication). Given this, the effects of a trial dusky kob (Argyrosomus japonicus) fish farm established in Richards Bay Estuary on the macrobenthic community were studied from 2016-2018. Water quality, sediment nutrient levels and macrobenthic community data were collected along a gradient away from the fish farm for twelve months during fish farm operations and nine months after operations ceased. Results show that high nutrient concentrations at the fish farm site caused low dissolved oxygen concentrations, confirming sediment eutrophication in the immediate vicinity. The macrobenthic community structure revealed a separation between fish farm sites and those further away, which confirmed the localised effect of fish farming on the benthic community. Opportunistic taxa such as Pilargidae and Spionidae polychaetes, including Sigambra spp. and Prionospio spp., dominated at the fish farm sites. Nevertheless, a measured, long-term reversal of this process was observed during the recovery period. The study concluded that fish farm activities had a localised and reversible impact on the benthic habitat quality and the macrobenthic community.

AB  - Herbivorous rodents in boreal, alpine and arctic ecosystems are renowned for their multi-annual population cycles. Researchers have hypothesised that these cycles may result from herbivore-plant interactions in various ways. For instance, if the biomass of preferred food plants is reduced after a peak phase of a cycle, rodent diets can be expected to become dominated by less preferred food plants, leading the population to a crash. It could also be expected that the taxonomic diversity of rodent diets increases from the peak to the crash phase of a cycle. The present study is the first to use DNA metabarcoding to quantify the diets of two functionally important boreal rodent species (bank vole and tundra vole) to assess whether their diet changed systematically in the expected cyclic phase-dependent manner. We found the taxonomic diet spectrum broad in both vole species but with little interspecific overlap. There was no evidence of systematic shifts in diet diversity metrics between the phases of the population cycle in either species. While both species' diet composition changed moderately between cycle phases and seasons, these changes were small compared to other sources of diet variation-especially differences between individuals. Thus, the variation in diet that could be attributed to cyclic phases is marginal relative to the overall diet flexibility. Based on general consumer-resource theory, we suggest that the broad diets with little interspecific overlap render it unlikely that herbivore-plant interactions generate their synchronous population cycles. We propose that determining dietary niche width should be the first step in scientific inquiries about the role of herbivore-plant interactions in cyclic vole populations.
   This study investigates the diets of two key boreal rodents through DNA metabarcoding to evaluate whether their food intake varies systematically with their multi-annual population cycles. The findings suggest that diet changes related to these cycles are marginal compared to overall diet flexibility and suggest that the broad diets, with little interspecific overlap, render it unlikely that herbivore-plant interactions generate their synchronous population cycles.image

AB  - IntroductionBurrowing activities of plateau pikas cause widespread bare patches in alpine meadows on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, affecting the plant community composition and forage production. However, it is not clear how these bare patches influence the main forage composition in alpine meadows. MethodsTherefore, we investigated the plant communities in bare patches (BP) and neighboring control plots (CK) in alpine meadows in Maqu county in the Gannan region of China. ResultsOur results showed that plant communities in the CK plots differed from those in the BP plots. The sedge cover, number of sedge species and number of grass species were all significantly higher in the CK plots compared to the BP plots. However, grass cover and its dry weight were significantly higher in the BP plots. Grass cover and the grass dry weight in the BP plots were 1.859 times and 1.802 times higher than that in the CK plots across the five sites, respectively. Grasses also had a significantly higher cover and dry weight than sedge in the BP plots, grass cover was 66.5 times higher than the sedge cover, and the grass dry weight was 68.242 times that of the sedge dry weight. Therefore, bare patches resulting from plateau pika burrowing activity significantly increase the grass/sedge ratio in alpine meadows. DiscussionA potential explanation is that grasses have a stronger reproductive potential than sedges in bare soil. This has implications for pasture yields since grasses have a higher biomass per unit area compared to sedges in alpine meadows.

AB  - Carrion acts as a hotspot of animal activity within many ecosystems globally, attracting scavengers that rely on this food source. However, many scavengers are invasive species whose impacts on scavenging food webs and ecosystem processes linked to decomposition are poorly understood. Here, we use Australia as a case study to review the extent of scavenging by invasive species that have colonised the continent since European settlement, identify the factors that influence their use of carcasses, and highlight the lesser-known ecological effects of invasive scavengers. From 44 published studies we identified six invasive species from 48 vertebrates and four main groups of arthropods (beetles, flies, ants and wasps) that scavenge. Invasive red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), domestic dogs (Canis familiaris), feral pigs (Sus scrofa), black rats (Rattus rattus) and feral cats (Felis catus) were ranked as highly common vertebrate scavengers. Invasive European wasps (Vespula germanica) are also common scavengers where they occur. We found that the diversity of native vertebrate scavengers is lower when the proportion of invasive scavengers is higher. We highlight that the presence of large (apex) native vertebrate scavengers can decrease rates of scavenging by invasive species, but that invasive scavengers can monopolise carcass resources, outcompete native scavengers, predate other species around carcass resources and even facilitate invasion meltdowns that affect other species and ecological processes including altered decomposition rates and nutrient cycling. Such effects are likely to be widespread where invasive scavengers occur and suggest a need to determine whether excessive or readily available carcass loads are facilitating or exacerbating the impacts of invasive species on ecosystems globally.

AB  - Urban ecosystems are expanding rapidly, significantly altering natural landscapes and impacting biodiversity. Here we explore seasonal variation in mammal diversity using environmental DNA (eDNA) from soil samples collected during winter and summer across 21 urban parks in Detroit, Michigan. We estimated gamma (regional), alpha (local) and beta (compositional change) diversity to determine if seasonal shifts, reflecting winter scarcity and summer abundance in mammal community composition and human activity, could be detected using eDNA. We expected that larger parks would exhibit greater diversity and higher seasonal turnover, consistent with the species-area relationship (SAR) and hypothesised that increased summer resource availability would lead to decreased network density as species disperse more broadly. We found that urban parks show subtle, park-specific changes in community composition influenced by both ecological and anthropogenic factors, with species including striped skunk, brown rat and groundhog responsible for the observed seasonal variation. Consistent with the SAR, larger parks supported higher species richness and diversity. Ecological network analysis, focusing on metrics such as clustering coefficient and network density, revealed a decrease in the overall connectivity and cohesiveness of species interactions from winter to summer, supporting our hypothesis of broader species dispersal during resource-rich periods. Notably, human DNA was prevalent in all parks, alongside detections of pig and cow eDNA, potentially reflecting human disturbance and anthropogenic food inputs. Our findings underscore the efficacy of eDNA analysis in capturing urban mammal community dynamics, the impact of human activities on biodiversity and its potential as a valuable tool for urban ecological research. Ultimately, enhancing monitoring capacity aids in conservation and urban planning efforts that will promote human-wildlife coexistence and preserve the socio-ecological benefits stemming from biodiversity across cityscapes.

Aqu & iacute; exploramos la variaci & oacute;n estacional en la diversidad de mam & iacute;feros utilizando ADN ambiental (eDNA) de muestras de suelo recolectadas durante el invierno y el verano en 21 parques urbanos de Detroit, Michigan. Estimamos la diversidad gamma (regional), alfa (local) y beta (cambio composicional) para determinar si los cambios estacionales-que reflejan la escasez en invierno y la abundancia en verano en la composici & oacute;n de la comunidad de mam & iacute;feros y la actividad humana-pueden detectarse mediante eDNA. Esper & aacute;bamos que los parques m & aacute;s grandes mostraran una mayor diversidad y una mayor rotaci & oacute;n estacional, de acuerdo con la relaci & oacute;n especie-& aacute;rea (SAR), y postulamos que el aumento de la disponibilidad de recursos en verano conducir & iacute;a a una disminuci & oacute;n en la densidad de la red a medida que las especies se dispersan m & aacute;s ampliamente. Encontramos que los parques urbanos muestran cambios sutiles y espec & iacute;ficos en la composici & oacute;n de la comunidad, influenciados tanto por factores ecol & oacute;gicos como antropog & eacute;nicos, siendo especies como la mofeta rayada, la rata parda y la marmota responsables de la variaci & oacute;n estacional observada. Consistentemente con la SAR, los parques m & aacute;s grandes presentaban una mayor riqueza y diversidad de especies. El an & aacute;lisis de la red ecol & oacute;gica, que se enfoc & oacute; en m & eacute;tricas tales como el coeficiente de agrupamiento y la densidad de la red, revel & oacute; una disminuci & oacute;n en la conectividad y cohesi & oacute;n general de las interacciones entre especies del invierno al verano, lo que respalda nuestra hip & oacute;tesis de una dispersi & oacute;n m & aacute;s amplia durante los per & iacute;odos de abundancia de recursos. Es relevante que se detectara ADN humano en todos los parques, junto con evidencias de eDNA de cerdo y vaca, lo que podr & iacute;a reflejar la perturbaci & oacute;n humana y los insumos alimenticios de origen antropog & eacute;nico. Nuestros hallazgos destacan la eficacia del an & aacute;lisis de eDNA para captar la din & aacute;mica de las comunidades de mam & iacute;feros urbanos, el impacto de las actividades humanas en la biodiversidad y su potencial como herramienta valiosa para la investigaci & oacute;n ecol & oacute;gica urbana. En & uacute;ltima instancia, mejorar la capacidad de monitoreo contribuye a los esfuerzos de conservaci & oacute;n y planificaci & oacute;n urbana, promoviendo la coexistencia entre humanos y vida silvestre, y preservando los beneficios socioecol & oacute;gicos que aporta la biodiversidad en los entornos urbanos.

AB  - Monsoon evergreen broad-leaved forests (MEBFs) represent one of the most species-rich and structurally complex vegetation types, and one of the most widely distributed forests in Yunnan Province, Southwest China. However, they have yet to undergo a comprehensive analysis on their community diversity, spatial differentiation patterns, and underlying drivers across Yunnan. Based on extensive field surveys during 2021-2024 with 548 MEBF plots, this study employed the Unweighted Pair Group Method for forest community classification and Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling for ordination and interpretation of community-environment association. A total of 3517 vascular plant species were recorded in the plots, including 1137 tree species, 1161 shrubs, and 1219 herbs. Numerical classification divided the plots into 3 alliance groups and 24 alliances: (1) Castanopsis-Schima (Lithocarpus) Forest Alliance Group (16 alliances), predominantly distributed west of 102 degrees E in central-south and southwest Yunnan; (2) Castanopsis-Machilus (Beilschmiedia) Forest Alliance Group (6 alliances), concentrated east of 101 degrees E in southeast Yunnan with limited latitudinal range; (3) Castanopsis-Camellia Forest Alliance Group (2 alliances), restricted to higher-elevation mountainous areas within 103-104 degrees E and 22.5-23 degrees N. Climatic variation accounted for 81.1% of the species compositional variation among alliance groups, with contributions of 83.5%, 57.6%, and 62.1% to alliance-level differentiation within alliance groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Precipitation days in the driest quarter (PDDQ) and precipitation seasonality (PS) emerged as the strongest predictors of community differentiation at both alliance group and alliance levels. Topography and soil features significantly influenced alliance differentiation in Groups 2 and 3. Collectively, the interaction between the monsoon climate and topography dominate the spatial differentiation of MEBF communities in Yunnan.

AB  - Heterospecific coprophagy. i.e., the consumption of excreta of other species, is reported and documented for the first time for Iberian wild goat Capra pyrenaica Schinz, 1838 and is discussed in light of the nutritional composition of the excreta. Two adult female goats were observed consuming guano of rock dove Columba livia Gmelin, 1789 in March 2021 in the Natural Park of Guara. The chemical composition and feed value of the dove guano consumed by goats was analyzed using standard methods of food analysis. The guano had moderate energy content and high concentrations of nitrogen-compounds that are convertible into protein. It was also rich in macronutrients such as calcium, phosphorus, sodium and sulfur, some of which (namely phosphorus) may be deficient for goats in calcareous environments such as the study area. High levels of sodium and possibly of guanine can cause hedonistic responses to salty and umami flavors that may contribute and reinforce this feeding habit. The guano was affected by desiccation and aging resulting from outdoor exposure, which might have also decreased its degree of pathogenicity. We hypothesize that female Iberian wild goats could be stimulated by guano in the second half of their pregnancy period, when their protein requirements increase. Heterospecific coprophagy has been documented in a wide range of mammals indicating it may be an important feeding activity, but it is still poorly described and understood. Its causes, consequences and relevance should deserve more attention to better understand their feeding ecology. This has to be faced under a multidisciplinary approach.

AB  - We investigated fungal communities in oak wounds to determine how fungal species richness and community composition changes depending on the age of wounds. The sampling of wood cores was carried out from 10-, 20-, 30-, 40-, and 50-year-old wounds. The fungal community was analyzed using high-throughput sequencing of ITS2 rDNA. Sequence analysis showed the presence of 534 fungal OTUs, which were 83.4% Ascomycota, 16.3% Basidiomycota, and 0.3% Mucoromycota. The fungal OTU richness changed over time: it increased as compared between 10- and 20-year-old wounds, remained similar in 20- to 40-year-old wounds, and decreased in 50-year-old wounds. The fungal community composition also changed over time with the largest differences detected between 10-year-old and older wounds (p < 0.001). The most common representatives of Basidiomycota were Laetiporus sulphureus (34.7%), Mycena galericulata (17.0%), and Cylindrobasidium evolvens (6.5%), and the most common of Ascomycota were Aposphaeria corallinolutea (13.6%), Sclerostagonospora cycadis (7.6%), and Cadophora malorum (5.8%). In conclusion, oak wounds of different ages were colonized by a high diversity of fungi including oak-associated species. Fungal communities in oak wounds underwent qualitative and quantitative changes over time, which led to the gradual shift from fungal generalists in young wounds to oak specialists in older wounds.

AB  - Mercury is a known potent neurotoxin. The biogeochemical cycle of mercury in the remote Antarctic region is still poorly understood, with Polar climate change contributing added complexity. Longitudinal biomonitoring of mercury accumulation in Antarctic marine megafauna can contribute top-down insight into the bio-physical drivers of wildlife exposure. The bioaccumulative nature of organic mercury renders high trophic predators at the greatest risk of elevated exposure. Humpback whales represent secondary consumers of the Antarctic sea-ice ecosystem and an ideal biomonitoring species for persistent and bioaccumulative compounds due to their extended life-spans. This study provides the first results of mercury accumulation in humpback whales, and places findings within the context of mercury accumulation in both prey, as well as six other species of Antarctic marine megafauna. Combined, these findings contribute new baseline information regarding mercury exposure to Antarctic wildlife, and highlights methodological prerequisites for routine mercury biomonitoring in wildlife via non-lethally biopsied superficial tissues.

AB  - AimThe relationship between body size and trophic position (BS-TP) typically exhibits a positive correlation in aquatic foodwebs, but the strength of this relationship is contingent on ecosystem type and climate. Different hypotheses have been proposed to elucidate climate and ecosystem type effects on the BS-TP relationship for ray-finned fish. However, our understanding of whether such a relationship evolved in a correlated fashion, spanning various climates and ecosystem types, remains limited.LocationTemperate and tropical marine and freshwater ecosystems.Time PeriodPresent to millions of years ago.Major Taxa StudiedRay-finned fish.MethodsWe used a phylogenetic tree and TP and BS data of more than a thousand freshwater and marine ray-finned fishes, from distinct climates and ecosystems, to investigate patterns on macroevolutionary time scales of the evolutionary correlation of BS and TP. As part of our investigation, we also ran analyses excluding herbivores and detritivores from the dataset, then further focusing solely on carnivores.ResultsWe found distinct patterns of the BS-TP evolutionary correlation for different climates and ecosystems. The evolutionary correlation between BS and TP was significant for all ecosystem type-climate combinations, except for tropical freshwater ecosystems. The results remained consistent even after accounting for phylogenetic uncertainty and when excluding herbivores and detritivores from the analysis.Main ConclusionsWe found a weaker evolutionary correlation between BS and TP in tropical freshwater ecosystems. These findings are consistent with the stronger BS-TP relationship between extant taxa in temperate climates compared to the tropics, illustrating how evolutionary dynamics might have influenced the trophic structure of fish and contributed to shaping macroecological patterns of the BS-TP relationship. Our findings suggest that limitations that hinder evolutionary integration between BS and TP might be primarily attributed to energetic constraints imposed by temperature and the availability of C-rich food resources at the base of the foodweb.

AB  - Accurate prediction of fluctuations of wildlife local number of individuals is crucial for effective population management to minimise human -wildlife conflicts. Climate, habitat, food availability, and density dependence are among the main factors influencing mammalian population dynamics. In southern Europe, precipitation and temperature, particularly during summer have been suggested as key factors affecting wild boar ( Sus scrofa L.). However, there is uncertainty regarding the role of these factors and the mechanisms driving population fluctuations. This study utilized long-term data of wild boar populations from 14 study sites collected for 23 years in Catalonia, Spain, to analyse the factors that drive population density and growth rate. Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMM) explained respectively, 94 % and 65 % of the density and growth rate variability. Spring precipitation in both current and previous year, female weight, and forest cover (particularly above 60 %) were directly associated with higher wild boar densities and population growth rates. The interaction between crop cover and total annual precipitation also played a significant role in determining population density. Higher densities were linked to lower population growth in the following year, likely due to a density -dependent process. These results suggest that the expected decrease in rainfall linked with global warming may limit the availability of natural resources and potentially slow wild boar population growth. Nevertheless, wild boar can exploit alternative anthropogenic food sources, potentially leading to an increase of human -wildlife conflicts. Therefore, incorporating management policies aimed at restricting wild boar access to human food sources is key for controlling their reproductive output. Additionally, landscape management strategies targeted at diminishing refuge and resource availability in regions experiencing high wild boar impact are essential for contributing to sustainable coexistence between wild boars and human populations.

AB  - The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) - also called the "third pole" - is an ideal area to study the long-term relationship between people and the environment due to its sensitivity to both climate change and anthropogenic activities. Qinghai Lake in the north-eastern QTP is considered a key site to explore this issue. Fossil pollen and fungal spores extracted from lake sediments are effective proxies of palaeoecological evolution and ancient anthropogenic activities, but rely on the modern studies of pollen and fungal spores for an accurate interpretation of the fossil record. In this study, 36 surface-sediment samples from Qinghai Lake were collected from different water depths for pollen and fungal spore analyses to explore the modern characteristics of assemblages and dispersion of pollen and fungal spores. Our results show that the modern pollen assemblages of Qinghai Lake are mainly dominated by Artemisia, Cyperaceae, Poaceae, and Chenopodiaceae, with similar pollen assemblages across the lake, while pollen concentrations show a significant enrichment towards the sedimentary centres of the lake. The modern pollen assemblages reflect the characteristics of the vegetation communities and land use in the basin well. The percentages of Artemisia and Chenopodiaceae pollen are significantly higher in the lake surface-sediment samples than those from topsoil samples of the basin, while percentages of Cyperaceae pollen are lower than those in the topsoil samples. Rivers are an important vector for transporting pollen of intrazonal vegetation, including Cyperaceae, Poaceae, and Hippophae, into Qinghai Lake. Additionally, Cerealia Poaceae pollen (>37 mu m) is an effective indicator of farming activities in the Qinghai Lake basin. Fungal spores have higher heterogeneity in their percentages and concentrations from different sampling sites, with Glomus spp. and Delitschia spp. being more abundant near the lakeshore, while other fungal spores, including Sordaria spp., Sporormiella spp. Pleospora spp., Coniochaeta spp., Savoryella spp., and Urocystis sp., having higher percentages and concentrations towards the centre of the lake, with the particle size of the fungal spores being an important factor affecting their transportation and deposition in the lake. This study provides essential data on modern processes and a theoretical basis for accurately interpreting fossil pollen and fungal spore records from lake sediments on the QTP.

AB  - Natural selection drives how organisms allocate resources among competing demands such as growth, reproduction, and survival. In ferns, where reproductive and vegetative organs share developmental pathways, these trade-offs may be particularly strong under environmental disturbance. This study investigates how the rare fern Ophioglossum vulgatum allocates resources between vegetative growth and reproduction in response to vegetation removal (mowing) and simulated herbivory (clipping). A field experiment was conducted in wet meadow and peatland habitats in central Poland using a factorial design. Four treatments were applied: control, clipping, mowing, and clipping combined with mowing. Across 10 transects, 533 ramets were marked and monitored. Biometric measurements included leaf blade area, sporophore length, number of sporangia, and plant height. Data were analyzed using two-way ANOVA with clipping and mowing as fixed factors. Key results: Mowing significantly reduced plant height and leaf blade area, but only in unclipped plants (significant clipping x mowing interaction). Clipping alone, simulating herbivory, had no significant direct impact on any of the measured traits, although its interaction with mowing revealed important effects. Control plots exhibited the greatest allocation to reproduction, with larger sporophores and more sporangia. All treatments reduced reproductive output compared to controls, while vegetative performance remained stable or increased. Ramet abundance increased across all treatments, suggesting resilience through clonal propagation. These findings suggest that O. vulgatum exhibits trait-specific and context-dependent responses to disturbance. Reproductive traits are more sensitive than vegetative growth, and their suppression under mowing may limit reproductive success in managed habitats. Conservation strategies should account for both short-term physiological responses and long-term demographic processes. Management practices, particularly mowing, should be carefully timed and scaled to avoid unintended negative effects on reproduction in rare ferns such as O. vulgatum.

AB  - Restoring native woodlands to areas where they have been lost is a key element for tackling the nature and climate crises. Natural regeneration offers the potential to achieve this cheaply and at scale, but browsing ungulates like deer can inhibit this or alter the pattern of regeneration. This issue is particularly pronounced in the Scottish Highlands, a heavily deforested region with high deer numbers.We describe the work of the 60,000 ha landscape restoration partnership, Cairngorms Connect, in speeding up natural woodland expansion. We use 30 years of regeneration monitoring to show a consistent, large-scale expansion of native woodland, largely through natural regeneration alongside deer culling, without the use of fences. This was achieved across the partnership, despite differing management histories and land-managing organisations (comprising two statutory agencies, one private landowner and one non-governmental organisation).During peak periods of woodland expansion, the area of new woodland (i.e. exceeding 100 trees per hectare) increased by 1.2%, 1.7%, 2.7% and 6.0% annually in the four landholdings' regeneration zones, equating to a total of approximately 164 ha annually of new woodland.Natural regeneration is however patchy and hard to predict. Higher levels of management intervention may be needed to increase species that are rarer, more palatable or further from seed sources; we recommend long-term field trials to inform this, such as those underway in Cairngorms Connect. Further research should develop techniques for remote sensing of woodland expansion, verified against field data and combined with the development of process-based models to enable us to predict the outcomes of different management scenarios.Synthesis and applications. We show that collaborative deer management across multiple adjoining landholdings can achieve rapid landscape-scale native woodland expansion with minimal need for planting or fencing. Our results show the power of monitoring regeneration directly, to inform deer management for an area. We demonstrate that by uniting over a shared vision, organisations with differing management approaches and histories can build understanding alongside landscape-scale ecological restoration.

AB  - The distribution of the Japanese serow (Capricornis crispus) has recently expanded to low-elevation areas. However, there is little ecological information available for this species in such areas. This study aimed to elucidate the feeding habits of the Japanese serow in the Ome Hills, central Japan, a low-elevation area characterized by the dominance of evergreen broad-leaved trees in the shrub layer. Through the analysis of 115 fecal samples collected between 2019 and 2020, our findings revealed that Japanese serow consistently foraged on monocot leaves and dicot leaves and stems throughout the year. Furthermore, a detailed examination of feeding signs indicated a preference for graminoids in both coniferous plantations and deciduous broad-leaved forests across all seasons.

AB  - More people in the world depend on water buffalo for their livelihoods than on any other domesticated animals, but its genetics is still not extensively explored. The 1000 Buffalo Genomes Project (1000BGP) provides genetic resources for global buffalo population study and tools to breed more sustainable and productive buffaloes. Here we report the most contiguous swamp buffalo genome assembly (PCC_UOA_SB_1v2) with substantial resolution of telomeric and centromeric repeats, similar to 4-fold more contiguous than the existing reference river buffalo assembly and exceeding a recently published male swamp buffalo genome. This assembly was used along with the current reference to align 140 water buffalo short-read sequences and produce a public genetic resource with an average of similar to 41 million single nucleotide polymorphisms per swamp and river buffalo genome. Comparison of the swamp and river buffalo sequences showed similar to 1.5% genetic differences, and estimated divergence time occurred 3.1 million years ago (95% CI, 2.6-4.9). The open science model employed in the 1000BGP provides a key genomic resource and tools for a species with global economic relevance.

AB  - Context Aerial shooting is an important tool for managing feral pig damage to agricultural and biodiversity assets because it can rapidly reduce population densities over large areas. It should also be valuable for reducing host population densities in the event of an emergency animal disease incursion. However, recent tracking studies have not alleviated concerns that the intense disturbance caused by aerial shooting might cause pigs to disperse from target areas.Aims We investigated the responses of feral pigs to nine aerial shooting operations conducted at five large and divergent sites in south-eastern Australia.Methods We fitted 71 pigs with GPS tracking collars and monitored changes in their behaviour following exposure to aerial shooting operations that lasted between 1 and 11 days. Repeated exposure of some individuals provided 105 distinct samples. We examined the following three key traits: the location and size of activity ranges, daily activity and movement rates, and daily activity cycles.Key results We found inconsistent results between sexes and among operations. However, only one pig left the target area after shooting began. This pig did not return.Conclusions The fine-scale behaviour of pigs subjected to aerial shooting is likely to vary because of a complex interplay of social, environmental, and operational factors. Behaviour changes observed in this study were unlikely to cause the dispersal of feral pigs or their impacts.Implications Given our results, and those of previous studies, we believe that aerial shooting should continue to be used as a key method for managing feral pig populations and should also be considered for emergency animal disease response operations.

AB  - Establishing genetic diversity in the population is an essential first step for the sustainable conservation of valuable genetic resources under threat of extinction. Two local goat breeds, Kalofer long-haired (KLH) and Bulgarian screw-horned long-haired (BSHL), were genotyped using a panel of 14 microsatellite markers to determine their population structure and differentiation. The overall mean number of alleles was 8.82, higher in BSHL (9.71) as compared with KLH (7.92). The Ho and He values were almost equal for BSHL (0.75; 0.76, respectively) and KLH goats (0.74; 0.76, respectively). The value of the coefficient of population differentiation (FST) was very low (0.024), indicating only 2% genetic differentiation between the two goat breeds. The structure and PCoA analyses revealed considerable overlap between the two breeds, although some flocks of each breed differentiated from the common genetic pool. The results obtained in the present study can serve to differentiate purebred animals that are the basis of a selection process and a breeding strategy with a view to the conservation of these two local goat breeds.

AB  - Increased fire activity due to climate change may impact the successional dynamics of boreal forests, with important consequences for caribou habitat. Early successional forests have been shown to support lower quantities of caribou forage lichens, but geographic variation in, and controls on, the rates of lichen recovery has been largely unexplored. In this study, we sampled across a broad region in northwestern Canada to compare lichen biomass accumulation in ecoprovinces, including the Saskatchewan Boreal Shield, the Northwest Territories Taiga Shield, and Northwest Territories Taiga Plains, divided into North and South. We focused on the most valuable Cladonia species for boreal and barren-ground caribou: Cladonia mitis and C. arbuscula, C. rangiferina and C. stygia, and C. stellaris and C. uncialis. We developed new allometric equations to estimate lichen biomass from field measurements of lichen cover and height; allometries were consistent among ecoprovinces, suggesting generalizability. We then used estimates of lichen biomass to quantify patterns of lichen recovery in different stand types, ecoprovinces, and with time following stand-replacing fire. We used a hurdle model to account both for the heterogeneous nature of lichen presence (zero inflation) and for the range of abundance in stands where lichen was present. The first component of the hurdle model, a generalized linear model, identified stand age, stand type, and ecoprovince as significant predictors of lichen presence. With a logistic growth model, a measure of lichen recovery (time to 50% asymptotic value) varied from 28 to 73 yr, dependent on stand type and ecoprovince. The combined predictions of the hurdle model suggest the most rapid recovery of lichen biomass across our study region occurred in jack pine in the Boreal Shield (30 yr), while stands located in the Taiga Plains (North and South) required a longer recovery period (approximately 75 yr). These results provide a basis for estimating future caribou habitat that encompasses some of the large variation in fire effects on lichen abundance and vegetation types across the range of boreal and barren-ground caribou in North America.

AB  - Aim We assessed the role of mowing machinery and endozoochory by migratory sheep as dispersal vectors in semi-natural grasslands by comparing the species compositions and traits of species found in the vectors to the regional above-ground vegetation and soil seed bank. Furthermore, we discuss how their interplay may affect the conservation of semi-natural grasslands. Location Rhon Mountains, central Europe. Methods Plant material from mowers (n = 12 from one date) and dung samples from migratory sheep (n = 39 from 13 dates) were collected and the dispersed plant species were determined using the emergence method. We compared the species compositions to the regional above-ground vegetation and seed bank using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and indicator species analysis. Furthermore, we compared functional traits of the dispersed species to traits of non-dispersed species of the regional species pools by calculating log-response ratios and performing metaregressions. Results While 43 species were shared between the vectors, the vegetation compositions differed from each other. Mower samples were more similar to the above-ground vegetation whereas dung samples were more similar to the seed bank. Mowers and sheep endozoochory favoured the dispersal of species with different traits and phenologies. Species with small seed sizes were prevalent in both vectors. Mowers were less selective concerning most traits, but favoured high-growing grasses such as Alopecurus pratensis and Trisetum flavescens. Sheep dung samples contained less grasses and more palatable species, such as Urtica dioica. Mowers were most selective concerning phenology, whereas endozoochory by migratory sheep also included late-flowering species. Conclusion Sheep endozoochory and mowing machinery are complementary dispersal vectors favouring species with differing functional traits. Sheep endozoochory enables dispersal of species that have unfavourable traits (e.g. low releasing heights) or phenologies for dispersal by mowing machinery. To ensure the dispersal of a high number of plant species in semi-natural grasslands, the interplay of different vectors should be considered.

AB  - The mechanisms causing native species displacement by invasive species can be challenging to identify. We used survey data to demonstrate a local extinction of a native gastropod (Pomacea paludosa) from a Florida wetland coincident with invasion of a non-native gastropod (Pomacea maculata). We then examined the potential for P. maculata to displace P. paludosa. Two field experiments examined effects of densities and heterospecific interactions on juvenile P. paludosa growth in situ and lab and mesocosm experiments explored chemically-mediated interactions between the species. Field experiments produced variable results; evidence for reduced P. paludosa growth in the presence of P. maculata was found under higher nutrient conditions with fast snail growth rates, but growth inhibition disappeared under oligotrophic conditions. Resource reduction was not seen in the field experiments. Juvenile P. paludosa did not avoid mucus of P. maculata and did not reduce feeding in response to chemical cues. Nevertheless, exposure to mucus and waterborne cues of P. maculata reduced P. paludosa growth by 53% relative to conspecific cue exposure. In mesocosms juvenile P. paludosa growth was significantly negatively correlated with exposure to adult P. maculata waterborne cues. Stronger effects were evident when waterborne cues were combined with mucus at low exposure (20%). We documented the first apparent local extinction of P. paludosa by P. maculata. We found no evidence for competition, but the results collectively pointed to an effect of direct chemical inhibition that could be important at field scales and at low invasive densities.

AB  - Climate change and escalating land-use transformations pose a significant threat to global biodiversity by disrupting natural habitats. The Asiatic wild ass (Equus hemionus), a near-threatened species, faces various pressures across its Asian range. This study employs a niche modeling approach to assess suitable habitats for the Asiatic wild ass at both the global population and sub-population levels. The analysis integrates the impacts of climate scenarios and land use change across three temporal periods: past, present, and future. To investigate the uncertainty of climate models for the Asiatic wild ass habitat, we used two climate models, CMIP5 and CMIP6, at both global and sub-population levels. Niche overlap models were developed to examine patterns of niche similarity among sub-populations. The results demonstrate a severe decline in both suitable habitat area and the number of viable patches for all sub-populations. Projections reveal that the Mongolian wild ass and Indian wild ass endure the highest levels of isolation and habitat loss, alongside the extinct Syrian wild ass. Sub-population models often predict larger distributions compared to global population models using the same inputs. The outputs of the models indicate a severe decline in suitable habitat, underscoring the necessity of accounting for both ecological and conservation perspectives to understand species distribution dynamics. Our study highlights the need to consider both global population and sub-population levels in climate change assessments. These models provide essential guidance for conservation strategies by identifying suitable habitats and sites for reintroduction. Identifying habitat patches as refuges for large herbivores amidst land-use changes and climate fluctuations is crucial. Incorporating these patches into conservation planning is imperative for preserving biodiversity.

AB  - Ecosystems worldwide are under increasing threat. We applied a standardized method for assessing the risk of ecosystem collapse, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Ecosystems, to coral reefs in the Western Indian Ocean (WIO), covering 11,919 km(2) of reef (similar to 5% of the global total). Our approach combined indicators of change in historic ecosystem extent, ecosystem functioning (hard corals, fleshy algae, herbivores and piscivores) and projected sea temperature warming. We show that WIO coral reefs are vulnerable to collapse at the regional level, while in 11 nested ecoregions they range from critically endangered (islands, driven by future warming) to vulnerable (continental coast and northern Seychelles, driven principally by fishing pressure). Responses to avoid coral reef collapse must include ecosystem-based management of reefs and adjacent systems combined with mitigating and adapting to climate change. Our approach can be replicated across coral reefs globally to help countries and other actors meet conservation and sustainability targets set under multiple global conventions-including the Convention on Biological Diversity's post-2020 global biodiversity framework and the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals.

AB  - In Southwestern Yukon, ice patches have shown substantial retreat since the Little Ice Age (1600-1900 AD) in response to warming trends. These ice patches support unique alpine wetlands that have formed habitats for diverse flora and fauna over millennia. With ice retreat, pristine bryophyte populations are exposed beneath accumulated ancient dung. Given that bryophytes have been shown to survive extreme conditions including ice entombment and can regenerate from viable cells, emergent ice margin bryophyte and dung samples from the Granger and Gladstone ice patches were assayed for regrowth potential under growth chamber conditions. Diaspore (spore/fragment) generation of species found in the original subfossil material was indicated in 68 percent of assays, emphasizing the cyclical establishment of ancient ice patch vegetation. One of the oldest samples, dating 4036 calibrated years BP from the Gladstone ice patch margin, showed remarkable bryophyte generation from diaspores in dung. These Yukon ice patches form reservoirs of cryopreserved biota and have a critical role in maintaining alpine diversity, which provides summer refuge for caribou and other alpine fauna. Ice margin fluctuations, which bury and release populations through time, are part of a complex revegetation sequence in alpine regions that has followed deglaciation.

AB  - Coastal dunes in Northwestern Europe were subject to substantial scrub expansion during the past decades, a process often considered as a major problem for conservation management. This paper explores this process in De Westhoek nature reserve (Belgium), focussing on the three major constituents of the early scrub: Salix repens, Hippophae rhamnoides and Ligustrum vulgare. We study changes in dominance pattern between 1953 and 2010 based on vegetation maps and the demography of these species based on growth ring counting. We relate this data to the edaphic factors soil moisture and soil age. Early scrub development occurred in three phases: (1) rapid, mainly secondary scrub expansion after release of grazing pressure, (2) a main shift in relative abundance of the three main species, and (3) further succession into tall scrub and woodland along with local scrub decay. Edaphic factors play a major role in vegetation dynamics, but their relative importance diminishes along with landscape ageing. Simultaneously, the outcome of competitive interaction between scrub species, in which population demography plays a key role, gains importance. Primary and secondary scrub development seem to converge in terms of dominance patterns of S. repens, H. rhamnoides and L. vulgare. Spontaneous decay of mainly L. vulgare offers an opportunity for dune managers for the restoration of herbaceous dune vegetation with high conservation value.

AB  - 1. Agroforestry systems provide opportunities to reduce the trade -off between agricultural production and biodiversity, for example by enhancing a diverse community of species potentially acting as natural pest control agents. While management of agroforestry systems is intensifying across the globe, we lack insights into the impact of management intensity on pest levels and natural pest control, especially along broad management gradients and as compared with nat- ural forests.2. We assessed the impact of management intensity on major insect pests (the coffee blotch miner, the serpentine leaf miner, the coffee leaf skeletonizer and damage by other free-feeding herbivores) and natural pest control by parasitoid wasps across sixty sites in the centre of origin of Arabica coffee in southwestern Ethiopia. Within this region, coffee is growing along a broad management gradi- ent ranging from little or no management in the natural forest to intensively man- aged commercial plantations.3. In the wet season, pest levels were largely similar in the natural forest, semi-forest and semi-plantation systems, whereas pests reached outbreak densities in the most intensively managed plantation system. In contrast, management intensity did not significantly affect pest levels in the dry season. The insect pests differed in their seasonal dynamics, consistently declined with elevation and were largely unaffected by shade levels. Parasitism rate of the coffee blotch miner was lower, and the parasitoid community was distinct, in the most intensively managed plan- tation system.4. Synthesis and applications : Our findings support the hypothesis that the weaker top -down control by parasitoids in the intensively managed plantation sites leads to higher pest levels, and that- at least for some pest species- there is a threshold in the effect of management intensity on pest levels and natural pest control. It is important to consider such non-linear relationships to maintain or enhance the sustainability of agroforestry systems during management intensification.

AB  - The cold desert ecosystem of the north-western Himalaya in India's is considered to be the most vulnerable region to climate change. In this region, Juniperus macropoda Boisser grows across an altitudinal gradient and is highly sensitive to biotic, physiographic, and climatic factors. Keeping this in view, the present study aimed at ascertaining the response of Juniperus macropoda to changing climatic conditions. To achieve the target of the study, the area (elevation ranges from 3525 to 4150 m asl) was divided into thirteen elevation ranges in the cold desert of Lahaul valley (Himachal Pradesh). The NDVI change detection map from 1994-2017 revealed an increase in the area under the vegetation in the NDVI range of 0-0.15 (240%) and 0.15-0.30 (32%), which indicated the emergence of grasses and new recruits in the area. An increase in the minimum and maximum temperature during monsoon and post-monsoon season correlated positively with the emergence of the recruits in a significant manner. Furthermore, a decline in rainfall during the monsoon period was also recorded which bears a significant positive correlation with the establishment of recruits. However, the increase in the precipitation during winter resulted in a positive effect on the emergence of recruits. The biophysical parameters, like average height, diameter as well as the average age of the dominant trees showed a declining trend with the elevation. However, the age histogram revealed that the majority of the establishment occurred around 1900 and between 1975-2010. The tree ring analysis of J. macropoda revealed that the species is shifting upward at a rate of 3.91 m year(-1). Besides this, the area is experiencing the impact of climate change resulting in an increase in the area under vegetation and migration towards the higher elevation, and many species of lichens were also found to invade the bare rock.

AB  - The relative effect of top-down versus bottom-up forces in regulating and limiting wildlife populations is an important theme in ecology. Untangling these effects is critical for a basic understanding of trophic dynamics and effective management. We examined the drivers of moose (Alces alces) population growth by integrating two independent sources of observations within a hierarchical Bayesian population model. We used one of the largest existing spatiotemporal data sets on ungulate population dynamics globally. We documented a 20% population decline over the period examined. There was negative density-dependent population growth of moose. Although we could not determine the mechanisms producing density-dependent suppression of population growth, the relatively low densities at which we documented moose populations suggested it could be due to density-dependent predation. Predation primarily limited population growth, except at low density, where it was regulating. After we simulated several harvest scenarios, it appeared that harvest was largely additive and likely contributed to population declines. Our results highlight how population dynamics are context dependent and vary strongly across gradients in climate, forest type, and predator abundance. These results help clarify long-standing questions in population ecology and highlight the complex relationships between natural and human-caused mortality in driving ungulate population dynamics.

AB  - No single studies on the Burmese Red Serows, a little known bovid to date yet considered as nationally endangered species, have been conducted in Bangladesh. As part of a systematic wildlife inventory and monitoring project, this study utilized 48 camera traps to elucidate their occurrence, activity pattern and possible sympatric association with other artiodactyls species inhabiting Baraiyadhala National Park. The study found 25 independent serow events with relative abundance index (RAI) of 0.89. The number of individuals seems low, but this is by far the country's stronghold population. The Red Serows are mostly nocturnal and showed moderate temporal activity with barking dear (triangle 1 = 0.59) and wild boar (triangle 1 = 0.62) in this area. Anthropogenic pressures due to tourists (RAI = 4.8) and poachers (RAI = 1.7) were highly evident and must have negative impact on overall wildlife of the national park. The study suggests similar studies in adjacent protected area (Hazarikhil Wildlife Sanctuary), habitat protection and restoration program, and awareness raising program targeting forest dependent communities for long term conservation of this species.

AB  - A relative lack of standardised long-term monitoring data often limits the ability of African conservancies to quantify their efficacy to protect wildlife. In this study, we combined eight 2-km long transects surveyed monthly between October 2017 and March 2020 (total 240 transects sampled) with a hierarchical multi-species and multi-season distance sampling modelling framework to: (1) estimate monthly density of an ensemble of 10 different large herbivores and (2) understand how species respond to changes in vegetation productivity and time across the Naboisho Conservancy in the Greater Mara Ecosystem, Kenya. We documented a total of 55,298 individuals from 6830 animal groups. The median coefficient of variation for all density estimates was 27.67%. On average, number of groups was higher at intermediate levels of vegetation productivity. We found that in general, populations of large herbivores remained stable in the conservancy during the study period, except for wildebeest which decreased in density. We showed that multi-species monitoring frameworks can be used to understand how species abundance changes across space and time, providing indications as to how they are responding to environmental dynamics or management prescriptions-both of which are valuable tools for under-resourced wildlife conservancies.

AB  - Translocation and captivity are important tools for conservation biology and wildlife management. Understanding the movement ecology of animals following their release in novel terrain is critical to predicting the success of wildlife restoration efforts. Mountain caribou have high conservation value - efforts to restore their populations across western Canada involve hundreds of millions of dollars in science, monitoring, and management activity. Here, we examined the movements of adult female caribou (N = 36) following their translocation to, and release from, a maternity pen ('penned caribou') and compared these movements to animals that were not translocated ('unpenned caribou', N = 22). A maternity pen is a temporary holding facility, within the animals' existing range, that enables them to bear and raise their young in the absence of predators and with augmented resources. Penned and unpenned animals had similar home range sizes (1052.2 and 1314.6 km(2), respectively, P = 0.46) though penned animals moved through the landscape in a faster yet less directed manner. We found some evidence that memory may improve the efficiency of space use. Home ranges with higher quality habitats tended to be smaller than home ranges with poorer quality habitats irrespective of penning status. Penned animals ranged at lower elevation (similar to 150 m) than unpenned animals, particularly in spring and early winter. For penned animals, we did not detect evidence of homing back to the original capture site. The best predictor of how caribou will use the landscape appears to be proximity to the location of the release site. To maximize the fitness of released caribou, future plans for maternity pens and captive breeding programs need to consider the management of food, predators, and habitat across the 1000-2000 km(2) that will form the home range near the release site.

AB  - Disease plays a major role in shaping wildlife populations worldwide, and changes in landscape conditions can significantly influence risk of pathogen exposure, a threat to vulnerable wild species. Three viruses that cause hemorrhagic disease affect cervid populations in the USA (Odocoileus hemionus adenovirus, bluetongue virus, and epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus), but little is known of their distribution and prevalence in wild populations. We explored the distribution and co-occurrence of seroprevalence of these three pathogens in southern mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus fuliginatus), a subspecies of conservation concern and a harvested species native to southern California, to evaluate the distribution of exposure to these pathogens relative to landscape attributes. We found that habitat type, level of development, and proximity to livestock may affect hemorrhagic disease seroprevalence in southern mule deer. Continued monitoring of hemorrhagic disease-causing viruses in areas where deer are in proximity to cattle and human development is needed to better understand the implications of future outbreaks in wild populations and to identify opportunities to mitigate disease impacts in southern mule deer and other cervid species.

AB  - Biodiversity in ecosystems is crucial in providing ecosystem services and their stability and resilience. However, most studies supporting the benefits of biodiversity in crop health were studied at the cultivar scale, generally without specifying the resistance mechanisms involved in the resistance of crops to pests. Thus, it is unclear if phytochemical diversity is one of those resistance mechanisms and whether the ecosystem patterns and processes in which phytochemical diversity is involved can be replicated or adapted to the management of sustainable agroecosystems. Here, I review the roles of phytochemical diversity in natural ecosystems and determine if they can be helpful in the management of agroecosystems. I briefly review (a) the spatial and temporal structure of phytochemical diversity in ecosystems and its effect on plant consumers; (b) how that diversity is generated and maintained; and (c) the current or potential role of phytochemical diversity in agroecosystems. The ??-, ??-, and ??-phytochemical diversities are very high in ecosystems and landscapes; phytochemical diversity gets displayed in dynamic mosaics of mixtures of secondary metabolites that vary in their concentration and composition within and among individuals, populations, or species. Phytochemical diversity is fostered by evolutionary or coevolutionary processes, mainly under an arms-race scenario. The patterns and processes of phytochemical diversity are idiosyncratic depending on the identity of the interacting species and the local biotic and abiotic environment; thus, to copy them to industrial agroecosystems is hardly viable. However, five recommendations in which phytochemical diversity could be helpful in agroecosystem management are made.

AB  - Habitat selection of ungulates is influenced by various factors, with human interactions playing a significant role. Human disturbances through hunting strongly affect ungulate behaviour, often forcing them to modify their habitat choices by avoiding areas where the risk from humans outweighs other habitat benefits. Gaining insights into these dynamics of human-wildlife interactions is essential for reducing conflicts between hunting objectives and wildlife conservation efforts. Here, we used GPS tracking data of 32 female red deer Cervus elaphus to derive resource selection functions, analysing habitat selection of animals with both hunting and no-hunting zones within their home range in Berchtesgaden National Park, Germany.Red deer habitat selection differed distinctly between hunting and no-hunting zones. In the hunting zone, red deer more strongly selected closed forests, indicating a priority for safety. This pattern was particularly strong during daylight hours (i.e. the primary time of hunting) during which they also greatly reduced their movement. During night-time, when hunting risk was absent, red deer strongly selected open habitats and increased their movement rate. Conversely, red deer consistently selected open habitats and had similar movement rates during both day and night in the no-hunting zone, reflecting a preference for foraging grounds when not influenced by hunting. Our results highlight red deer's ability to distinguish between and adapt to areas of varying risk within their home range.These insights are critical for targeted wildlife management and conservation. On the one hand, they demonstrated that hunting can be strategically used as a management tool to control red deer habitat use, reducing their presence and thus potentially their impact on specific areas. On the other hand, the finding that hunting distinctly influences red deer habitat selection and movement highlights the value of no-hunting zones for the conservation of natural behaviour of ungulate populations.

AB  - The capacity of soils to store organic carbon (SOC) is vital for agricultural productivity. Soil microorganisms exert a critical role in carbon (C) flow and potentially influence C balance through the decomposition of plant and microbial dead biomass. However, the connection between the microbial degradation potential of plant-derived and microbial-derived C and soil organic carbon sequestration (SOCSR) under organic and inorganic nitrogen (N) fertilization treatments remains largely unexplored using metagenomics. In this study, metagenomics was used to investigate the effects of 4 years inorganic (N1: 250 kg N ha-1 yr-1 and N3: 450 kg N ha-1 yr-1) and organic N (O1: N1 + 11,250 kg ha-1 yr-1 sheep manure and O3: N1 + 18,750 kg ha-1 yr-1 sheep manure) fertilizer application on plant biomass decomposition genes, microbial biomass decomposition genes, and microbial properties related to different sources of C decomposition (species composition and diversity). Furthermore, the study explored the relationship between organic matter decomposition genes, microorganisms, and SOCSR. The results revealed that compared with N1 treatment, the increased application of inorganic N fertilizer (N3) significantly enhanced the abundance of genes related to plant and microbial biomass decomposition and microbial diversity involved in SOC decomposition, resulting in reduced SOC content. Conversely, the increased application of organic N fertilizer (O1 and O3) had a minor effect on the abundance of genes related to different sources of C decomposition and C decomposing microbial diversity, but reduced microbial entropy (the ratio of microbial biomass carbon to SOC) and increased SOC content. The random forest model highlighted that plant biomass decomposition genes and bacterial community composition were important factors affecting SOCSR. The Mantel test also indicated that the genes involved in the decomposition of lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose were closely related to SOCSR. These findings highlighted that increased inorganic N fertilizers greatly enhanced the microbial capacity for SOC decomposition, resulting in reduced SOC accumulation. While the increased application of organic N fertilizer increased SOC stability and reduced the mineralization potential of SOC, contributing to SOCSR. Overall, these findings provide a greater understanding of the relationship between soil C turnover and microbial C-degrading potential under short-term fertilization. And in a long time, they may have important implications for global strategies aimed at increasing SOCSR to restore fertility and facilitate sustainable agricultural development.

AB  - Short-lived nonnative species that become invasive are major agents of change in the American West, and they may interact with fire to have compounding negative effects on ecosystem function. As public lands come under increasing stress from invader-fire interactions, managers need tools that deplete nonnative propagules at meaningful temporal and spatial scales. The pre-emergent herbicide indaziflam, which has been approved for use in natural areas, achieves multi-year control of Bromus tectorum (cheatgrass) and other short-lived nonnative species, while leaving co-occurring, established perennials largely intact. Here we explore how pre-fire management with indaziflam shapes plant community assembly post-fire. We ask whether indaziflam (1) maintains good efficacy against the target species Bromus tectorum, Bromus japonicus, and Alyssum simplex in the first growing season post-wildfire, as well as short-lived introduced species more generally; (2) exhibits nontarget effects on short-lived native species; and (3) supports recovery of long-lived native species. Indaziflam was highly effective in controlling all three target species in both burned and unburned areas, revealing its potential to break the invader-fire cycle. However, short-lived native species were also suppressed, either in burned areas only (richness), or in burned and unburned areas (percent cover). As found in other systems, indaziflam had no negative effects on long-lived native species. These findings highlight potential trade-offs in adopting indaziflam as a tool, with its use likely to be extremely effective in highly invaded systems already depauperate of native propagules, but requiring more caution and, if resources allow, attendant restoration plans (e.g., reseeding with desirable natives) in more intact natural areas.

AB  - In recent years, wild boar (Sus scrofa) populations have increased rapidly, causing serious problems such as crop damage and disease transmission. In the present study, we built an individual-based model to explore how heterogeneous landscapes and the interactions of wild boars and hunters affect wild boar population control. The simulated wild boars in the model move on a heterogeneous landscape. To make the movement more realistic, we included randomness in the simulated boar behavior. The simulated hunters either walk to move one site during a one-time step or jump to move multiple sites at once. Simulation results showed that the randomness positively contributed to the increase in population size, while the remaining variables contributed negatively. The randomness had the greatest impact on population size, followed by the landscape heterogeneity and the hunting success probability. On the other hand, the jumping movement probability had the least effect. Interestingly, the effect of jumping on the population size could be understood as a result of two effects cancelling one another; the hunters are trapped in the preferred area, and the hunters move to another area without removing all simulated boars gathered in the preferred area. Furthermore, we briefly mentioned which ecological approaches can be used to control wild boar population growth with regard to our simulation results and proposed some ideas to improve the model and make it more realistic.

AB  - Cellulose is an essential component of plant cell walls, and one of the major constituents of soil organic matter. Decomposition of cellulose, mediated by microorganisms, is critical to the sustainable development of arable soils. However, how exogenous cellulose addition, as a surrogate for organic material amendment, influences the diversity and community compositions of soil microorganisms and their network complexity remains largely unknown. To bridge this knowledge gap, we conducted a microcosm experiment incubated with soils that had been subjected to long-term mineral or organic fertilization. Cellulose addition increased the cumulative CO2 emission in all treatments, with the highest value found in the pig manure amended soils. Cellulose addition significantly reduced the alpha diversity of bacteria and fungi across all fertilization treatments, with a more pronounced effect observed for fungi. Moreover, cellulose addition strongly altered bacterial community structure by increasing the relative abundance of copiotrophic bacteria such as Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria while reducing that of oligotrophic bacteria (e.g., Chloroflexi). Compared with no-fertilizer treatment, the influence of cellulose addition on bacterial and fungal community structure was stronger in long-term mineral or organic fertilized soils. Cellulose addition altered the relative abundance of bacterial and fungal functional groups by generally enriching microbes involved in chemoheterotrophy and suppressing those involved in methylotrophy, pathotroph, saprotroph-symbiotroph, and saprotroph-pathotroph. In addition, cellulose addition decreased soil microbial complexity and the number of potential keystone species, but did not change the key role of Chloroflexi in soil microbial network. Overall, our results demonstrated that cellulose addition decreased soil microbial diversity and network complexity, with possible short-term negative consequences for ecosystem functioning in Ultisols.

AB  - The diversity of dragonflies on an island is strongly influenced by habitat degradation, as well as the size and distance from the mainland. Therefore, this study aims to analyze the species diversity of dragonflies in the Sangihe Islands, North Sulawesi, Indonesia. It was carried out in five types of habitats namely forests, waterfalls, dams, agricultural land, and settlements. In each habitat, four-line transects with a length of 100 m each were made and placed around the river. The results showed 6 families which included 32 species and 3020 individuals. Libellulidae is the family with the highest number of species. Furthermore, the dominant species in the suborders Anisoptera and Zygoptera were Orthetrum pruinosum and Rhinocypha frontalis , respectively. Forests, waterfalls, and dams tend to have the highest species richness and diversity index compared to other habitats. Based on the results, the diversity of dragonflies at the observation site is strongly influenced by the complexity of the vegetation and environmental factors, including temperature and humidity. The presence of the families Chlorocyphidae, Calopterygidae, and Platycnemididae in each of the studied habitats indicates that the water quality is still very good and supports the life of dragonflies.

AB  - Roads obstruct wildlife movements, and wildlife-vehicle collisions are a hazard to both animals and humans. Wildlife and transportation managers often consider reducing the speed limit to reduce wildlife-vehicle collisions, but there is little empirical data to support or refute this measure. We experimentally reduced the nighttime speed limit from 70 to 55 mph on six stretches of highway that cross mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) winter range or migration paths. Drivers consistently reduced their speeds, but only by 3-5 mi/h. Reduced speed limit did not make it any easier for deer to cross the road, indicating no benefit for habitat connectivity. At winter sites, the number of deer-vehicle collisions was not affected by the reduced speed limit whereas at migration sites, collisions were modestly lower under the reduced speed limit. Given the small reduction in vehicle speeds, it is not surprising that there was little benefit of reduced speed limit for deer or people. We conclude that reduced nighttime speed limit is not an effective way to reduce wildlife-vehicle collisions or make roads more permeable to wildlife due to poor compliance from motorists.

AB  - Miombo is the most extensive ecosystem in southern Africa, being strongly driven by fire, climate, herbivory, and human activity. Soils are major regulating and supporting services, sequestering nearly 50% of the overall carbon and comprising a set of yet unexploited functions. In this study, we used next-generation Illumina sequencing to assess the patterns of bacterial soil diversity in two pioneer Miombo species, Brachystegia boehmii and Brachystegia spiciformis, along a fire gradient, in ferric lixisol and cambic arenosol soils. In total, 21 phyla, 51 classes, 98 orders, 193 families, and 520 genera were found, revealing a considerably high and multifunctional diversity with a strong potential for the production of bioactive compounds and nutrient mobilization. Four abundant genera characterized the core microbiome among plant species, type of soils, or fire regime: Streptomyces, Gaiella, Chthoniobacter, and Bacillus. Nevertheless, bacterial networks revealed a higher potential for mutualistic interactions and transmission of chemical signals among phylotypes from low fire frequency sites than those from high fire frequency sites. Ecological networks also revealed the negative effects of frequent fires on the complexity of microbial communities. Functional predictions revealed the core "house-keeping" metabolisms contributing to the high bacterial diversity found, suggesting its importance to the functionality of this ecosystem.

AB  - Worldwide, coral reefs are facing risk from climate change. The Western Indian Ocean (WIO) harbours about 16% of global coral reefs with highly reef-dependent local communities. Coastal protection and food security depend on effective conservation management, which requires understanding species abundances. Here, we explore how fish group distribution and abundance across the WIO, categorized by their trophic function, are explained by oceanographic connectivity, sea surface temperature (SST), and chlorophyll a. We designed a proportional oceanographic connectivity metric describing the relative strength of connectivity between all WIO coral reefs and each survey site. We created statistical models for four trophic groups: grazers and detritivores, herbivorous excavators, corallivores, and primary piscivores across 51 sites in the WIO. We show that SST and chlorophyll a are strong predictors of all trophic fish groups and that the proportional oceanographic connectivity metric improved the model predictions significantly for grazers and detritivores and excavators. For excavators, peak abundances were predicted at medium connectivity, and for grazers and detritivores, at low and medium connectivity, suggesting that larvae dispersal predominates at a local scale. Decision making should include connectivity for efficient conservation area prioritization, for which our proportional oceanographic connectivity metric is a valid and useful parameter.

AB  - The saola is one of the most elusive large mammals, standing at the brink of extinction. We constructed a reference genome and resequenced 26 saola individuals, confirming the saola as a basal member of the Bovini. Despite its small geographic range, we found that the saola is partitioned into two populations with high genetic differentiation (FST = 0.49). We estimate that these populations diverged and started declining 5,000-20,000 years ago, possibly due to climate changes and exacerbated by increasing human activities. The saola has long tracts without genomic diversity; however, most of these tracts are not shared by the two populations. Saolas carry a high genetic load, yet their gradual decline resulted in the purging of the most deleterious genetic variation. Finally, we find that combining the two populations, e.g., in an eventual captive breeding program, would mitigate the genetic load and increase the odds of species survival.

AB  - Water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) is the mainstay of milk production in Asian countries including India. However, the hot climate of the country remains the biggest bottleneck to exploit the potential of this species. Therefore, a study was conducted to assess the effect of heat ameliorative measures on microclimate, thermal comfort, and behavior of Murrah buffalo heifers during summer. Buffalo heifers (n = 24) between the age of 15 and 20 months with a mean body weight of 363.75 +/- 11.27 kg were randomly grouped into four treatments based on their age and body weight. The heifers kept in the shed without any cooling served as CON (control), while the animals of group CJ were tied with a cooling jacket. The buffalo heifers of the CJF group were subjected to the cooling jacket with forced air ventilation, whereas the intermittent (10 min at 2-h intervals) sprinkling followed by forced air ventilation was practiced in group SF between 900 and 1800 h throughout the experiment. The microclimatic variables were low in the sheds of groups CJ, CJF, and SF than the CON. The physiological responses such as rectal temperature, skin temperature, respiration rate, and pulse rate were reduced in groups CJ, CJF, and SF than the CON at 1400 h. The serum cortisol was less in the CJF and SF than those of CON group. The animals of the CJ, CJF, and SF groups spent more time for feeding and rumination with less frequent longer bouts. The extended periods of lying followed by shorter standing and idling were observed in groups CJ, CJF, and SF when compared with the CON. It may be therefore concluded that cooling jacket and intermittent sprinkling in combination with forced air ventilation might be helpful in improving the micro-environment, thermal comfort, and behavior of buffalo heifers particularly under tropical climates during summer.

AB  - Anoa (Bubalus spp.) is a protected endemic species on the Sulawesi Island. An assessment of its habitat is needed to maintain the conservation, especially for the forage plants consume. Therefore, this study aims to determine the types, abundance, and diversity of the available forage plants for Anoa in the Abdul Latief Forest Park. The study was carried out using checkered lines with a descriptive approach in three blocks, including station I as protection block, station II as utilization block, and station III as collection block. The checkered line method contains three repetitions in three blocks with a total area of 1.8 ha. Data analysis was carried out using the Shannon-Wienner variability formula, Margalef wealth index, Evenness abundance, and dominance index. Based on the results, six plants were identified as Anoa feed, including Ficus racemosa L., Elatostema integrifolium (D. Don) Wedd., Nephrolepis sp., Begonia sp., Scleria multifoliata Boeck., and Alpinia sp. Furthermore, the leaf is the most consumed part of the plant by Anoa, and the E. integrifolium (D. Don) Wedd. is the forage plant with the highest abundance value of 49,167 (ind ha-1) in the protection block. Meanwhile, for the diversity value, each block was in a low category at 0.88, 1.28, and 1.44, respectively. Based on the index value of species wealth, the highest value was observed in the collection block; hence more species were discovered in this block than the other two blocks. However, Elatostema integrifolium (D. Don) Wedd. showed a dominance index in the protection block. This study affects the conservation of Anoa in the area to be continued by observing the biodiversity utilization, which is too burdensome without regard to sustainability.

AB  - A study was made of the features of the soil cover of solonetz complexes in different parts of the pasture of an average sheep farm in the dry steppe zone in the Manych river basin in the conditions of dissected relief. It has been established that several types of soil cover can be distinguished on the territory of the pasture that differ in the degree of transformation of the profile of different components of the solonetz complex under the influence of intensive grazing. It is shown that the heterogeneity of the soil cover is due to the uneven impact of grazing, which, in turn, is determined both by the degree of remoteness from the farm and by the characteristics of the vegetation cover in different parts of the pasture. The areas with a well-pronounced complexity of the soil cover and a high proportion of solonetzes, dominated by grass-wormwood associations, are subject to the greatest pasture load. A tendency to a reduction in the thickness of the AJ and SEL horizons of light chestnut soils and solonetzes was noted as the pasture load increased. In the soil cover of feather grass areas of pastures, the share of solonetzes is much lower, which can be associated with a short-term pasture load on these soils.

AB  - Livestock grazing in grasslands regulates the multifunctionality of those ecosystems and has an adverse effect on soil carbon (C) dynamics and fractions. However, our understanding of grazing-induced changes in soil microbial community and their links to soil organic C (SOC) fractions is limited. By using a long-term grazing experiment in desert steppe, we examined impacts of different grazing intensity on the diversity and composition of soil microbial community and their potential contribution to SOC content and fractions. The results showed that 15-year grazing reduced total SOC (TSOC), albeit not significant, but induced a notable decrease in both labile and recalcitrant SOC fractions, especially under high grazing intensity. Soil prokaryotic communities were not significantly impacted by grazing intensity. However, we observed that sensitive operational taxonomic units (OTUs), identified by indicator taxa analysis, grouped in distinct modules that reflected the different grazing intensities, suggesting that groups of microbes may cluster together and respond to grazing intensity. Association networks of prokaryotic OTUs and organic C fractions showed that SOC fractions were significantly related to rare taxa, indicating that grazing practice may act as a kind of environmental filtering and strongly affected soil microbial rare taxa and thereafter SOC fractions. Together, our findings suggest that grazing intensity did not change total microbial community and TSOC but affected SOC fractions by altering rare taxa. Overall, our results indicated that soil C fractions and rare microbial taxa were more sensitive to grazing intensity, which could act as indicator of variations in ecosystem functions in the semi-arid desert steppe.

AB  - Fire has shaped Australia?s diverse mammal fauna for millennia. However, ongoing changes to fire regimes threaten native mammal populations, and a significant conservation challenge is to understand and promote desirable forms of pyrodiversity (variation in fire regimes). A way forward is to quantify how different aspects of pyrodiversity influence whole mammal assemblages and produce dynamic maps of species distributions to inform conservation. We aimed to determine and map how spatial and temporal variation in fire regimes correlates with a diverse mammal assemblage comprising macropods, microbats, rodents, small marsupials and a monotreme. We built species distribution models for 17 species against fire, climate and environmental covariates in fire-prone woodlands of semi-arid Australia. Spatial measures of fire included the area, diversity and configuration of landscape elements, and temporal measures included time since fire and fire frequency. Native mammals showed a variety of responses to pyrodiversity. Microbats were more likely to occur as time since fire increased, whereas rodents were correlated with recently burned areas. Small dasyurid marsupials were correlated with the area of older post-fire age-classes, while western grey kangaroo occurrence was positively associated with high diversity of post-fire ages. Our new approach, using predictive models to map mammal distributions in relation to spatial and temporal variation in fire regimes, provides outputs that managers can use to improve conservation planning. This enables the positive and negative effects of fire to be better understood and will assist in achieving desirable forms of pyrodiversity that meet the needs of whole mammal assemblages.

AB  - The conversion of forest into grassland can induce differentiation in the functional morphology of resilient species. To assess this effect, we have chosen a dung beetle Dichotomius problematicus, as a model species. We established 20 sampling points distributed along a transect for a forest and grassland located in the Podocarpus National Park in Ecuador. Four pit-fall traps were baited with pig feces per sample point and were left open for 48 h. We sexed and measured 13 morphological traits of 269 individuals. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling was carried out to evaluate the influence of habitat and sexual dimorphism on the traits. We applied a principal component analysis to evaluate the morphological features that best explain the differences between land use and sexual dimorphism. We used generalized linear models to evaluate the explanatory variables: habitat and sexual dimorphism with respect to morphological traits. Five traits contributed over 70% body thickness, Pronotum width, Pronotum length, Head width and Elytra length, following the results of a principal component analysis. Both habitat and sex influence traits. In the forest, the individuals are larger than grassland likely due to available resources, but in grassland, the structures in charge of the burial process head, protibia are larger, displaying a strong pronotum and possible a greater reproductive capacity given by spherecity. These patterns of changes in the size of beetles and their structures could reflect the conservation state of an ecosystem.

AB  - Charophyte stands represent valuable ecosystems threatened by eutrophication-related phytoplankton and epiphyte blooms. The mechanisms allowing the persistence of charophytes in eutrophic environments are important but poorly studied. We analyzed the benthic primary production and respiration, and inorganic nitrogen (N) fluxes in a Chara contraria stand within a eutrophic estuarine system (Curonian Lagoon) via light and dark intact core incubations. Rates were contrasted with those measured in adjacent unvegetated sediments. Additionally, O-2 production was measured in fragments of C. contraria and in the associated community of epiphytes, whereas O-2 respiration and ammonium (NH4+) excretion rates were measured in incubation of amphipods (Pontogammarus robustoides) alone. The results from core incubations suggest high primary production and respiration within charophyte stands, resulting in pronounced daily O-2 variations in the overlaying water. The incubations of charophyte fragments and associated epiphytes indicate that the latter supports a major fraction of the benthic primary production. The large production of dinitrogen in the dark indicates the occurrence of denitrification, which is suppressed in the light due to primary producers-bacteria competition. On a daily basis, the charophyte stand was a sink for inorganic N via assimilative NH4+ uptake and a dark nitrate sink via denitrification. Interestingly, active NH4+ excretion by the abundant amphipods supported nearly 40 % of the N uptake by the primary producers. We speculate that amphipods continuously feed on epiphytes growing on charophytes, favouring C. contraria persistence and recycling large amounts of N via herbivory and excretion that are immediately re-used by benthic primary producers. This grazing, excretion and assimilation loop may represent an example of macrofauna-macrophyte mutual facilitation and a mechanism easing C. contraria competition under eutrophic conditions.

AB  - 1. Floral plantings adjacent to crops fields can recruit populations of natural enemies by providing flower nectar and non-crop prey to increase natural pest regulation. Observed variation in success rates might be due to changes in the unseen community of endosymbionts hosted by many herbivorous insects, of which some can confer resistance to natural enemies, for example, parasitoid wasps. Reduced insect control may occur if highly protective symbiont combinations increase in frequency via selection effects, and this is expected to be stronger in lower diversity systems.
   2. We used a large-scale field trial to analyse the bacterial endosymbiont communities hosted by cereal aphids Sitobion avenae collected along transects into strip plots of barley plants managed by either conventional or integrated (including floral field margins and reduced inputs) methods. In addition, we conducted an outdoor pot experiment to analyse endosymbionts in S. avenae aphids collected on barley plants that were either grown alone or alongside one of three flowering plants, across three time points.
   3. In the field, aphids hosted up to four symbionts. The abundance of aphids and parasitoid wasps was reduced towards the middle of all fields while aphid symbiont species richness and diversity decreased into the field in conventional, but not integrated, field-strips. The proportion of aphids hosting different symbiont combinations varied across cropping systems, with distances into the fields, and were correlated with parasitoid wasp abundances.
   4. In the pot experiment, aphids hosted up to six symbionts. Flower presence increased natural enemy abundance and diversity, and decreased aphid abundance. The proportion of aphids hosting different symbiont combinations varied across the flower treatment and time, and were correlated with varying abundances of the different specialist parasitoid wasp species recruited by different flowers.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Floral plantings and flower identity had community-wide impacts on the combinations of bacterial endosymbionts hosted by herbivorous insects, which correlated with natural enemy diversity and abundance. We recommend that integrated management practices incorporate floral resources within field areas to support a more functionally diverse and resilient natural enemy community to mitigate selection for symbiont-mediated pest resistance throughout the cropping area.

AB  - Southern Africa's Greater Cape Floristic Region (GCFR) - a hotspot of biological diversity and palaeoanthropological evidence for modern human evolution - is a climatically complex region where broad climatic gradients influence the relative importance of plant photosynthetic types in local vegetation. This mix of photosynthetic pathways imprint an isotopic signature on palaeo-records, thereby allowing for the reconstruction of historical climate and vegetation. Here, we use vegetation plot data, coupled with the photosynthetic-type affinities of plant genera, to relate their relative cover to bioclimatic drivers and use these to create spatial distribution models of C3 and C4 grasses and CAM shrubs across the contemporary GCFR. We then use palaeodistribution modelling, drawing on downscaled climate models for the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), to hindcast the LGM distributions of photosynthetic types for the GCFR and its then-exposed offshore areas. In addition, we construct a model to account for the effect of lower atmospheric CO2 concentration ([CO2]) during the LGM on the competitive interactions between C3 and C4 grasses and use this model to hindcast relative C4grass cover across the glacial-era GCFR. Our palaeodistribution models suggest that, even though there were some reductions in CAM cover and shifts in C3-/C4-dominated grass layers between the LGM and Holocene, these were mostly localised, with changes at the regional scale being relatively muted. For C3/C4 grasses, distributional shifts were even more subtle once sub-ambient glacial [CO2] was accounted for. Our hindcasts of glacial, [CO2]adjusted grass cover show agreements and inconsistencies with various sedimentary and herbivore-diet records in the palaeo-archive: both lines of evidence suggest the dominance of C3 species in the strongly winter-rainfall western GCFR; in the eastern GCFR, with muted rainfall seasonality, hindcasts of relative C3:C4 cover and 613C signals from palaeo-records vary, with greater disparities between them. The lack of significant upheavals in the distribution of photosynthetic types suggests that the GCFR presented a relatively stable and dependable resourcescape for hunter-gatherer populations through the glacial-interglacial cycle of the LGM-Holocene transition. Our maps of relative C3-/C4-grass and CAM-shrub cover provide a reasonable surrogate for relative biomass of different photosynthetic types in local vegetation at a landscape scale and depict an independent estimate of carbon isoscapes across the GCFR - under both an interglacial (Holocene) and glacial (terminal Pleistocene) climate - against which palaeo-records can be assessed.

AB  - Achieving global targets for ecosystem restoration necessitates the development of effective restoration approaches. Current restoration approaches focus primarily on mitigating abiotic stresses or supplementing propagules to restore foundation species that support associated species by 'engineering' local habitats. Although keystone predators can strongly affect foundation species in natural ecosystems via trophic cascades and are often diminished in degraded ecosystems, they are traditionally neglected in efforts to restore foundation species.Here, we investigated how a keystone predator (Scylla serrata) might affect the restoration of a foundational plant (Scirpus mariqueter) in a degraded salt marsh. In a series of restoration experiments, we examined the effects of proximity to existing Scylla burrows, as well reintroducing Scylla, on the establishment of planted Scirpus in restoration areas. Furthermore, we tested if Scylla affected Scirpus via non-consumptive effects in experiments that controlled Scylla's consumption of grazers.We found that planted Scirpus suffered less grazing and achieved higher density in areas closer to existing Scylla burrows where Scylla predation on grazers was stronger. Consistently, reintroduction of Scylla reduced grazing on Scirpus and increased its density by 360%. These positive effects of Scylla on Scirpus were driven by consumptive effects that reduced the abundance of grazers and by non-consumptive effects that inhibited the herbivory by grazers.Synthesis and applications. These results demonstrate that incorporation of keystone predators, including both their consumptive and non-consumptive effects, into restoration designs can greatly enhance the restoration of foundation species. Our study thus highlights the value of co-restoring keystone predators and foundation species. Given that predators are depleted in many ecosystems, this co-restoration approach may be broadly applicable.

AB  - Farmland biodiversity have experienced a steep decline over recent decades. Various conservation measures, including EU agri-environmental schemes (AES), have been designed to prevent further biodiversity loss. Despite the AES were criticized for limited benefits for biodiversity, the existing conservation evidence demonstrated some AES, such as seed-rich strips (SRS), can have a positive effect on overall biodiversity. However, evidence of the effectiveness of SRS during winter is largely missing in Eastern Europe or it is based on single-species evaluations. In our study, we investigate the effects of SRS on several taxa typical of the farmland (i.e., farmland birds, European hare, roe deer and small mammals) during winter, when these species may suffer from a lack of food sources. More specifically, we evaluated the effect of spatial location (hedges, forests, and open fields), time in the season (early and late winter), and area (Single Large or Several Small analysis, i.e., "SLOSS analysis") of SRS on species richness and abundance of birds and mammals. SRS showed higher species richness and abundance than control transects, except for roe deer. The largest differences in abundance and species richness of farmland birds between the SRS and the controls were found in the fields. The highest abundance of European hare and small mammals were found in SRS located in the fields. Ordination analysis indicated that several bird species preferred SRS. Moreover, different birds occurred in strips adjacent to open fields, hedges, and forest, indicating that the landscape context of SRS can affect its use by different bird species. We found a significant decrease in the abundance of farmland birds and declining farmland species during late winter in the SRS, but not in the controls, suggesting the SRS may be depleted of seeds towards the end of winter. Finally, the SLOSS analysis indicated there was no clear difference in species richness between small-to-large and large-to small strips accumulation, but the pooled abundance of all birds and mammals was generally higher at a few large rather than many small patches of the same cumulative size. Our findings suggest that SRS are a simple and cost-effective measure for farmland biodiversity conservation. Even relatively small SRS are used by many species and therefore should be promoted. SRS careful planning (e.g., location of SRS within the landscape and the choice of seed mixtures) can improve their effectiveness for biodiversity conservation.

AB  - Rangeland monitoring aims to determine whether grazing management strategies meet the goals of sustainable resource utilization. The development of sustainable grazing management strategies requires an understanding of the manner in which grazing animals utilize available vegetation. In this study, we made use of livestock tracking, in situ observations and Sentinel-2 imagery to make rangeland scale observations of vegetation conditions in a semi-arid environment, to better understand the spatial relationships between vegetation conditions and sheep movement patterns. We hypothesized that sheep graze more selectively under low stocking rates-resulting in localized overgrazing. We also assessed the importance of image spatial resolution, as it was assumed localized effects of grazing will be best explained by higher resolution imagery. The results showed that livestock tend to congregate along drainage lines where soils are deeper. The findings demonstrate how the spatial analysis of remotely sensed data can provide a landscape-scale overview of livestock movement patterns. This study illustrates that high-resolution normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data can be used as a grazing management tool to determine the spatial variability of productive areas across the semi-arid Upper Karoo rangelands and identify preferred grazing areas.

AB  - Woody encroachment in southern African savanna has been partly attributed to rising atmospheric [CO2] fertilising the growth of C-3 trees but less so that of competing C-4 grasses. However, growth conditions (resource availability, competition, rooting space and herbivory) must be suitable for the effects of elevated CO2 (eCO(2)) to be realised. This research investigated the interactions between the positive effect of eCO(2) on tree seedling growth and limitations imposed by drought, herbivory and competition with C-4 grasses. Seedlings of the prolific encroaching C-3 tree Vachellia karroo were grown at ambient (400 ppm) or eCO(2) (800 ppm) in Open-Top Chambers and exposed to a variety of stresses typical of savanna systems. Photosynthetic, growth and allocation responses to eCO(2) and other treatments were determined. Unsurprisingly, we show strong growth and water-saving responses of V. karroo seedlings to eCO(2) when in the absence of competition and herbivory. However, the addition of either grass competition or simulated herbivory in the first season of growth significantly moderated this stimulation, while neither drought nor shading diminished the eCO(2) effect relative to similarly treated plants grown at ambient [CO2]. Synthesis. We demonstrate that eCO(2)-induced C-3 stimulation in encroaching savanna species such as V. karroo will be inconsistent across time and space. This research does not detract from the suggestion that increasing atmospheric CO2 is implicated in woody encroachment, but rather that eCO(2) benefits to C-3 tree seedlings are only realised when growth conditions are suitable. Inconsistencies in eCO(2) response will translate into spatial and temporal variation in seedling responses to eCO(2) and CO2-driven woody encroachment, explaining some of the variability observed in woody encroachment across geographical regions and resource and herbivore gradients.

AB  - Recommendations to use deer-excluding fencing as a method to reduce blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis Say) in residential settings are based primarily upon studies excluding deer from large areas (>= 3.5 hectares), often in undeveloped woodland settings. Evidence is still needed on the efficacy of deer-excluding fences for tick management at smaller suburban residential properties common to tick-endemic areas of the northeastern United States. We measured I. scapularis abundance at 16 fenced and 16 unfenced properties in Fairfield County, Connecticut, Westchester County, New York, and Washington County, Rhode Island. Overall, adult and nymphal I. scapularis encounter rates (ticks per sampling meter) were slightly higher on unfenced properties compared to within fenced properties, but differences were not significant (P > 0.05). Among fenced properties alone, tick encounter rates were significantly higher in areas immediately outside of fences compared with inside of fences for nymphs (P = 0.005), but not for adults (P > 0.05). Prevalence of tick pathogen infection with Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, Borrelia miyamotoi, Babesia microti, Babesia odocoilei, or Anaplasma phagocytophilum did not differ significantly between fenced and unfenced properties (P > 0.05). Irrespective of fencing, adult tick abundance was higher at properties with stonewalls, dense herbaceous ecotone vegetation, and an absence of bird feeders. Nymphal tick encounter rates were associated with stonewalls, an absence of bird feeders, and presence of dense herbaceous understory vegetation. Household survey data revealed that deer were observed within some fenced areas. Our findings do not provide strong evidence that deer-excluding fences at properties smaller than 3.5 hectares surpress blacklegged ticks.

AB  - Understanding the main factors driving the evolution of mating systems is a major goal of behavioral ecology. In ungulates, the transition from forests to open habitats and the accompanying clustered spatial distribution of females are thought to have promoted an evolutionary shift from monogamy to polygyny. However, no field-based studies to date have tested in the field whether such changes in ecological conditions promote a shift from monogamy to polygyny. We investigated mating systems of the Japanese serow, which is an evolutionarily ancestral and solitary species among caprids, living in the area with subalpine forest and alpine meadows over 7 years. We evaluated the effects of habitat characteristics on mating systems using within population comparisons. In this site, females form solitary territories in subalpine forests but group territories in alpine meadows. Males defended most of their home ranges as territories, and both social monogamy (29.6%; one male with one female) and polygyny (70.4%; one male with 2-5 females) were observed. Males in alpine meadows formed mating units with more females, whereas males in subalpine forests formed mating units with single females. We show that open habitats promote the transition from social monogamy to polygyny and a higher degree of social polygyny. Our findings suggest that the main factor affecting the mating system is the spatial dispersion of females (solitary territory or group territory), which depends on habitat structure (closed or open).Significance statementThe Japanese serow is an ungulate that mainly inhabits forests and is assumed to possess the ancestral social systems for caprids, such as solitary and monogamous with territory. We found that open habitats, such as alpine meadows, promote the transition from monogamous to polygynous territory in the Japanese serow. In the study site, alpine meadows promote the transition from solitary territory to group territory of females. Thus, our results suggest that the main factor affecting the mating system is the spatial dispersion of females (solitary or group territory), which depends on habitat structure (subalpine forests or alpine meadows). Our findings provide evidence for a social evolutionary pattern in caprids, whereby the spread of forest-dwelling ancestors into open mountains promote evolution from social monogamy to polygyny.

AB  - We live in a world characterized by biodiversity loss and global environmental change. The extinction of large carnivores can have ramifying effects on ecosystems like an uncontrolled increase in wild herbivores, which in turn can have knock-on impacts on vegetation regeneration and communities. Cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) serve important ecosystem functions as apex predators; yet, they are quickly heading towards an uncertain future. Threatened by habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict and illegal trafficking, there are only approximately 7100 individuals remaining in nature. We present the most comprehensive genome-wide analysis of cheetah phylogeography and conservation genomics to date, assembling samples from nearly the entire current and past species' range. We show that their phylogeography is more complex than previously thought, and that East African cheetahs (A. j. raineyi) are genetically distinct from Southern African individuals (A. j. jubatus), warranting their recognition as a distinct subspecies. We found strong genetic differentiation between all classically recognized subspecies, thus refuting earlier findings that cheetahs show only little differentiation. The strongest differentiation was observed between the Asiatic and all the African subspecies. We detected high inbreeding in the Critically Endangered Iranian (A. j. venaticus) and North-western (A. j. hecki) subspecies, and show that overall cheetahs, along with snow leopards, have the lowest genome-wide heterozygosity of all the big cats. This further emphasizes the cheetah's perilous conservation status. Our results provide novel and important information on cheetah phylogeography that can support evidence-based conservation policy decisions to help protect this species. This is especially relevant in light of ongoing and proposed translocations across subspecies boundaries, and the increasing threats of illegal trafficking.

AB  - We tested small mammal (SM) community response to the influence of seasonal floods and habitat transformation in a temporal zone meadow (west Lithuania). The habitat transitioned from a natural flooded meadow in 2008-2012 to a mowed and pastured area in 2020. SM were trapped in late summer to autumn using lines of 25 traps (145 in total), the number of trapping sessions being one or several per year. We tested the hypotheses that: (1) any reaction to the multiple disturbances is species-specific, that is, the relative abundance of SM species and their proportion in the community differs with respect to the flood magnitude and habitat transformation, and (2) at the guild level, disturbances favor habitat generalists, thereby changing the characteristics of SM community. The average relative density of SM was 20.25 individuals per 100 trap nights (range 7.56-40.67), with 4-year-long cyclical changes of density observed. In separate years, we recorded from 4 to 9 species; Shannon's diversity index varied from 0.46 to 2.19, with expressed change of the dominant species. Habitat generalist species were favored, while habitat specialists were disadvantaged. As the meadow transformation progressed, unfavored states in the SM community prevailed, with excessive numbers of granivore and herbivore species present. Our study suggests that multiple disturbances may lead to an increase in relative abundance, species richness, and diversity within the SM assemblages.

AB  - This study presents the distribution and abundance of key species of the vulnerable marine ecosystems (VMEs) 'Coral gardens' and 'Sea pen and burrowing megafauna' in Skagerrak and the Norwegian trench. It is based on 543 bycatches from 2017-2021, and 35 ROV dives from 2016-2017. Bycatches were used to indicate distribution and relative abundance of the VME key species while ROV observations provided information on colony densities, associated fauna and damages. Four sea pen species were recorded. Funiculina quadrangularis and Kophobelemnon stelliferum were widely distributed and most abundant below 200 meters. The few records of Pennatula phosphorea were mainly from shallower than 100 meters, and the rare Balticina finmarchica primarily occurred below 200 meters. The ROV videos confirmed the pattern from the bycatches, however, colony densities were much higher, and the sea pen Virgularia mirabilis recorded in high abundances was not present in bycatches. The coral garden key species Isidella lofotensis, endemic to Norway, had a restricted area of occurrence confirmed by both methodologies. The restricted distribution makes it particularly vulnerable. Fishing activities overlap with the VMEs distribution and the observations of sea pen skeletons and the coral predatory anemone Ptychodactis patula are indicative of pressure from bottom trawl fishing.

AB  - Mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) are important economically, culturally, and recreationally to the Pueblo of Santa Ana in central New Mexico, USA. Studies of habitat selection improve our understanding of mule deer ecology in central New Mexico and provide the Tribe with valuable information for management of mule deer. We used global positioning system telemetry-collar data collected on mule deer around the Pueblo of Santa Ana to create resource selection functions from proximity-based habitat predictors using a generalized linear mixed model. We created separate resource selection functions for females and males during summer and winter at different times of the day. Season generally had a greater effect on mule deer habitat use than the time of day. Female and male mule deer selected for similar habitats but were sexually segregated in their summer distributions. These findings are consistent with results from other locations where mule deer partitioned habitat similarly between seasons and sexes. Supported models reaffirm accepted patterns of habitat selection for mule deer to the Pueblo of Santa Ana where local results were lacking. Our results can help managers identify locations in and around the Pueblo of Santa Ana where future development such as highway expansion are likely to conflict with mule deer activity and locations where habitat enhancement projects such as adding water sources can have the greatest effect for the deer population.

AB  - Resource partitioning is crucial for the coexistence of colonial herons, as it allows multiple species to share the same habitat while minimising competition. This study took advantage of a natural experiment in 2006 and 2007 when Black-crowned Night Herons were prevented from breeding at Lake Fetzara in the first year due to the presence of a feral cat. This event provided valuable insight into the spatial and temporal dynamics of nest site selection among coexisting heron species, which consisted of Cattle Egrets (Ardea ibis), Little Egrets (Egretta garzetta) and Squacco Herons (Ardeola ralloides). After the cat was removed, egg-laying began in the core areas of the colony and gradually spread to the periphery. Species that initiated nesting early selected mid-elevation sites near the tree trunk, which likely offered protection from both ground and aerial predators, while also providing some shielding from solar radiation and strong winds. These early selected sites featured larger branches, which conferred greater nest stability. Vertical stratification was evident among the heron species; however, contrary to long-standing assumptions, it was not directly related to body size. Both vertical and horizontal stratification were observed, with nests progressively moving higher and further from the tree trunk as the breeding season advanced. The following year, Black-crowned Night Herons displaced other species to lower heights and positions further from the trunk, highlighting the significant influence of interspecific interactions on nest site selection. This study underscores the complex interplay between nest site selection, biotic interactions and abiotic factors in heron colonies, emphasising the importance of resource partitioning in maintaining species coexistence in densely populated breeding sites.

AB  - Questions Evaluating seed production as a community function in species-rich temperate grasslands, we asked: (a) do ancient and restored grasslands differ in the composition of seed-producing species; (b) do seed-producing species of ancient and restored grasslands differ in their functional traits and habitat origin of their species; and (c) how does seed production change during the season considering management and is seed production different for the whole community and for the subset of species occurring in both types of grasslands? Location White Carpathian Mountains (Czech Republic). Methods We assessed the species composition of flowering and fruiting species and collected propagule samples from three ancient and three restored grasslands. From the measured parameters, we estimated seed production for particular fruiting species. We combined these reproductive parameters with data on plant traits and plant status. Results Flowering species in restored grasslands produced three times higher seed numbers and three times lower seed mass than flowering species in ancient grasslands. At ancient sites, most seeds belonged to meadow specialist species; at restored sites, seeds of ruderal and generalist species prevailed. Prior to mowing, in both grassland types the seed-producing species were characterised by a high capability of clonal reproduction, high leaf dry matter content, and wind pollination. After mowing, seed-producing species were insect-pollinated species at ancient sites. This reflects the dominance of grasses before mowing and of forbs after mowing. Conclusions Higher seed number, lower seed mass and lower reliance on pollinators in restored grasslands indicate a different ecosystem functionality related to these parameters, in comparison with ancient grasslands. Specifically, seeds act as source for generative regeneration of resident species while resources for pollinators and seed herbivores are reduced. This maintains a differentiation of restored and ancient grasslands not only in terms of species composition but also in their effect on other trophic levels.

AB  - Contact between wild animals and farmed livestock may result in disease transmission with huge financial, welfare and ethical consequences. Conflicts between people and wildlife can also arise when species such as wild boar (Sus scrofa) consume crops or dig up pasture. This is a relatively recent problem in England where wild boar populations have become re-established in the last 20 years following a 500-year absence. The aim of this pilot study was to determine if and how often free-living wild boar visited two commercial pig farms near the Forest of Dean in southwest England. We placed 20 motion-sensitive camera traps at potential entry points to, and trails surrounding, the perimeter of two farmyards housing domestic pigs between August 2019 and February 2021, covering a total of 6030 trap nights. Forty wild boar detections were recorded on one farm spread across 27 nights, with a median (range) of 1 (0 to 7) night of wild boar activity per calendar month. Most of these wild boar detections occurred between ten and twenty metres of housed domestic pigs. No wild boar was detected at the other farm. These results confirm wild boar do visit commercial pig farms, and therefore, there is potential for contact and pathogen exchange between wild boar and domestic pigs. The visitation rates derived from this study could be used to parameterise disease transmission models of pathogens common to domestic pigs and wild boars, such as the African swine fever virus, and subsequently to develop mitigation strategies to reduce unwanted contacts.

AB  - The contribution of herbivores to ecosystem nutrient fluxes through dung deposition has the potential to, directly and indirectly, influence ecosystem functioning. This process can be particularly important in nutrient-limited ecosystems such as alpine systems. However, herbivore dung content (carbon, C; nitrogen, N; phosphorus, P; potassium, K) and stoichiometry (C/N) may differ among species due to differences in diet, seasonality, body type, feeding strategy, and/or digestive system with consequences for soil biogeochemistry. Here we explore how species, body size, and seasonality may result in differences in dung stoichiometry for four alpine herbivores (chamois, sheep, horse, and cattle). We found that herbivore dung nutrient content often varies among species as well as with body size, with the dung of small herbivores having larger C, N, and P faecal content. Seasonality also showed marked effects on faecal nutrient content, with a general pattern of decreasing levels of faecal P, N and an increase of C/N as the summer progresses following the loss of nutrient value of the vegetation. Moreover, we showed how herbivores play an important role as natural fertilizers of C, N, and P in our study area, especially cattle. Our study highlights the importance of considering the relative contribution of different herbivores to ecosystem nutrient fluxes in management practices, especially with ongoing changes in wild and domestic herbivore populations in alpine ecosystems.

AB  - Methane (CH4) emission in livestock arises from enteric fermentation (EnF) and manure management (MM). This study develops the country-specific CH4 emission factors (EFs) in both EnF and MM for domestic water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) and estimates total CH4 emission in Nepal using Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Tier 2 methodology. Seasonal field data were collected on morphological characteristics, feed characteristics, and manure management practices of the buffalo. The buffalo population was divided into five age groups, and at least 35 buffalo individuals were measured from each age group in the Hilly and Plain regions of Nepal in the winter and summer seasons. Buffalo adult male (BAM) had the highest body weight of 530 +/- 53 kg in the plain region and 514 +/- 65 kg in the Hill region. Similarly, the weight of buffalo calf (BC) was 91 +/- 25 kg in the plain region and 77 +/- 26 kg in the Hill region. For different age groups of buffalo, EnF EFs ranged from 34 +/- 8 to 90 +/- 10 kg CH4 head(-1) year(-1) and MM EFs ranged from 2.5 +/- 0.5 to 7.5 +/- 0.5 kg CH4 head(-1) year(-1). The estimated EnF and MM EFs of buffalo were not statistically different by region (p > 0 .05). The total CH4 flux from buffalo was 347.8 Gg year(-1) in Nepal, contributing 322.2 Gg year(-1) from EnF and 25.6 Gg year(-1) from MM. The country-specific EFs are highly recommended for precise computing of the national emissions and carrying out mitigation action.

AB  - Layers 12 and 13 of the Chongphadae Cave site located northwest of the central part of the Korean Peninsula include human fossils, fireplaces, a great number of lithic artefacts, and mammal remains. These layers represent new evidence for the paleoenvironment, human occupation, and activities in this region during the late MIS 3 and MIS 2, associated with global cold and dry climate, respectively. Most of lithic artefacts collected are flake tools. Raw material selection, lithic reduction technology, and lithic industry represent peculiar local characteristics. Our analysis of faunal assemblages also suggests that the Chongphadae region had a rich ecosystem capable of forming a diverse mammalian fauna including ungulates (mainly deer and horses) during this period. It is likely that the mosaic landscapes, including grasslands, forests, rivers, and wetlands, provided a favorable environment for humans, as well as mammals and plants, and the occupants of the site actively hunted and gathered in a relatively temperate environment. Our study suggests that the central Korean Peninsula was not severely affected by global dry and cold events such as LGM, although it was a somewhat humid and cold environment during the late MIS 3 and MIS 2. The central Korean Peninsula may have existed as an unknown refugium (or area of endemism) in northeastern Asia during this time.

AB  - Land abandonment may decrease biodiversity but also provides an opportunity for rewilding. It is therefore necessary to identify areas that may benefit from traditional land management practices and those that may benefit from a lack of human intervention. In this study, we conducted comparative field surveys of butterfly occurrence in abandoned and inhabited settlements in 18 regions of diverse climatic zones in Japan to test the hypotheses that species-specific responses to land abandonment correlate with climatic niches and habitat preferences. Hierarchical models that unified species occurrence and habitat preferences revealed that negative responses to land abandonment were associated with species that have cold climatic niches and use open habitats, suggesting that species negatively impacted by land abandonment will decline more due to future climate warming. Maps representing species gains and losses due to land abandonment, which were created from the model estimates, showed similar geographical patterns, but some areas exhibited high species losses relative to gains. Our hierarchical modelling approach was useful for scaling up local-scale effects of land abandonment to a macro-scale assessment, which is crucial to developing spatial conservation strategies in the era of depopulation.

AB  - White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) are aesthetically and economically important to landowners in Texas. Winter diets are heavily dependent upon browse species because of a decrease in herbaceous production during periodic winter droughts. Our objective was to determine the influence of winter progression on nitrogen and fiber concentration as well as in vitro organic matter disappearance (using white-tailed deer rumen inoculum) of six browse species of moderate to high dietary importance to whitetailed deer in north-central Texas. We also measured protein-precipitable phenolic concentrations because of their potential influence on digestion kinetics. We collected leaf and stem tips during prefrost, midwinter, and late-winter periods from four properties in the Cross Timbers and Prairies of Texas over 2 years. Browse nutritive value differed between years and there was an interaction between species and period for all nutritive values. Nitrogen and in vitro true digestibility decreased with winter progression, as browse nutritional value decreased rapidly after the first freeze when most species shed leaves. Protein-precipitable phenolics demonstrated species-by-year and species-by-period interactions. The decrease in nitrogen and increase of fibrous constituents, in combination with the presence of biologically active tannins, considerably reduced digestibility during late winter. These results indicate a need for vegetational species diversity to meet whitetailed deer nutritional requirements during the fall and winter.

AB  - Changing climatic conditions is a perpetual circumstance for mankind. In this study, we investigate local environmental and climatic changes near Kangerlussuaq, west Greenland. Our reconstruction is based on a lake sediment core and methods include chemical proxies and a palynological analysis. The investigated site is located 15 km from the Aasivissuit Inuit summer hunting ground, which has been in use for caribou hunting for more than 2000 years. The presented climatic reconstruction covers the time from c. 560 CE to present time. We identify three distinct periods of climate regimes: From c. 560-1100 CE conditions were stable, warm and humid, and summer temperatures were 1.5-2 degrees C warmer than today. 1100-1600 was a period of cooler and very arid conditions with more sea ice, corresponding to the Neoglacial cooling. In this period, we detect two wildfire events and subsequent temporary caribou abandonment of the area. From 1600 to present we find increasingly warmer conditions with more precipitation and less extensive sea ice cover, gradually approaching today's climate regime in Kangerlussuaq. We review the existing literature regarding the Aasivissuit summer hunting ground, which was first used concurrently with the detected cooling. Despite climatic deterioration, the hunting ground was regularly in use throughout the Neoglacial and onwards, with peak hunting intensity in the early 1700s. The detected wildfires and reindeer abandonment are interpreted to be localized events at the coring site and did not affect the hunting ground. Our findings highlight the resilience of the Inuit hunters to climatic changes as well as the advantages and limitations of local environmental reconstructions.

AB  - Tropical cyclones (i.e. hurricanes, typhoons) cause large pulse fluxes of leaves that have not undergone senescence (i.e. green litter) to forest soils, with consequences for biogeochemical cycling. Energy and mineral nutrient concentrations of green litter are higher than the naturally senesced litter, likely affecting rates of decomposition and nutrient release, as well as the structure and composition of detrital food webs, but these effects have not been well quantified. During the typhoon 'Hagubit', we collected green and senesced litter from three common urban greening species, and then conducted a 316-day field experiment to evaluate substrate quality affected the trophic multifunctionality of soil faunal communities and ultimately elemental release from the decomposing litter. Nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), sodium (Na), calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) were released at significantly higher rates from green litter than senesced litter. Aluminium (Al), manganese (Mn) and iron (Fe) displayed a net accumulation during litter decomposition, and the immobilization of these elements was significantly higher in green than senesced litter. Litter substrate chemistry directly affected the release rates of elements, but its influence was stronger in decomposing senesced litter compared to green litter. Detritivores dominated green and senesced litter faunal communities relative to predators, omnivores and herbivores, and these distinct fauna functional groups showed significantly positive correlation during decomposition, but soil fauna trophic multifunctionality was significantly higher in green litter and stimulated the release of elements. These findings suggest that typhoons dramatically alter the dynamics of nutrient release during litter decomposition, and the influences are mediated in part by its substrate quality and changes in soil fauna trophic multifunctionality, which has significant implications for the magnitude and timing of soil nutrient availability after typhoon disturbances.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

AB  - Traditional transect survey methods for forest antelopes often underestimate density for common species and do not provide sufficient data for rarer species. The use of camera trapping as a survey tool for medium and large terrestrial mammals has become increasingly common, especially in forest habitats. Here, we applied the distance sampling method to images generated from camera-trap surveys in Dja Faunal Reserve, Cameroon, and used an estimate of the proportion of time animals are active to correct for negative bias in the density estimates from the 24-hour camera-trap survey datasets. We also used multiple covariate distance sampling with body weight as a covariate to estimate detection probabilities and densities of rarer species. These methods provide an effective tool for monitoring the status of individual species or a community of forest antelope species, information urgently needed for conservation planning and action.

AB  - Our limited knowledge about the ecological drivers of global arthropod decline highlights the urgent need for more effective biodiversity monitoring approaches. Monitoring of arthropods is commonly performed using passive trapping devices, which reliably recover diverse communities, but provide little ecological information on the sampled taxa. Especially the manifold interactions of arthropods with plants are barely understood. A promising strategy to overcome this shortfall is environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding from plant material on which arthropods leave DNA traces through direct or indirect interactions. However, the accuracy of this approach has not been sufficiently tested. In four experiments, we exhaustively test the comparative performance of plant-derived eDNA from surface washes of plants and homogenized plant material against traditional monitoring approaches. We show that the recovered communities of plant-derived eDNA and traditional approaches only partly overlap, with eDNA recovering various additional taxa. This suggests eDNA as a useful complementary tool to traditional monitoring. Despite the differences in recovered taxa, estimates of community alpha- and beta-diversity between both approaches are well correlated, highlighting the utility of eDNA as a broad scale tool for community monitoring. Last, eDNA outperforms traditional approaches in the recovery of plant-specific arthropod communities. Unlike traditional monitoring, eDNA revealed fine-scale community differentiation between individual plants and even within plant compartments. Especially specialized herbivores are better recovered with eDNA. Our results highlight the value of plant-derived eDNA analysis for large-scale biodiversity assessments that include information about community-level interactions.

AB  - Biocultural conservation approaches recognise the relationships between nature and humans, and arc built on local cultural perspectives. Hawai'i has been described as a model for biocultural conservation, and a biocultural approach can be applied in endangered ecosystems such as tropical dry forests that are often found in human settlement areas. The extent of native tropical dry forest cover remaining in Hawai'i is as low as 1% on some islands, with 45% of the tropical dry forest plant species at risk of extinction. Despite the long-running relationship of tropical dry forests with 'Indigenous people and local communities', there has been little assessment of the potential social -ecological outcomes of a biocultural approach to tropical dry forest restoration. Two Hawaii forest restoration projects, located within Kalipalehu and Auwahi, have been excluding ungulates and removing alien plant species for >20 years, and have applied biocultural approaches. Drawing on these two sites as case-studies, we explore the motivations for, and components of, a biocultural approach, and highlight four categories (ecological, social, cultural, and spiritual) of biocultural measures of success. We show that a biocultural approach to restoration can provide purpose and meaning to a person's relationship to place, and can transform conservation biology through Indigenous perspectives. We also address challenges and provide recommendations to those interested in engaging in a biocultural approach.

AB  - Sexual selection has resulted in some of the most elaborate traits seen in animals, many of which are used as weapons. These weapons can be incredibly diverse, even within species. Such morphological variation has largely been attributed to the environment in which individuals are reared and their genetics. However, variation in weapon form could also be the result of a weapon wearing out from usage. This mechanism has received relatively little attention. In this study, we demonstrate that sexually selected weapons can wear out from repeated use, providing experimental evidence that weapon usage can contribute to the diversity of weapon shapes observed within species. In a second experiment, we demonstrate that having a worn-out weapon decreases an individual's fighting ability. This finding illustrates that the shape of a weapon can have an important role in determining contest outcomes. Overall, these results suggest that individuals are limited in the number of times they can effectively use their weapons, which may be one factor (among others) influencing how frequently an animal engages in a fight.

AB  - PurposeThe biotransformation of livestock manure by black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) provides a new way for the resource utilization of manure, while the efficient utilization of BSFL frass fertilizers needs further research.MethodsThis study applied different types of organic fertilizers originated from pig and chicken manure into soil for maize cultivation, including natural composts (PNC, CNC), fresh frass after BSFL transformation (PBF, CBF), and BSFL frass composts (PBC, CBC).ResultsThe application of fresh frass and frass composts reduced soil pH, while increased the electrical conductivity, available nitrogen (AN), available phosphorus (AP), available potassium (AK) and NO3--N contents, as well as enzyme activities (urease, phosphatase and sucrase) in soil. For two manure groups, frass composts treated-soil exhibited higher NO3--N and AN levels than their respective fresh frass treated-soil, but had lower AP contents. Besides, the application of fresh frass and frass composts remarkably stimulated the plant height, total nitrogen (TN) and total potassium (TK) contents of maize seedling than CK. Moreover, fertilizer application had no significant influence on soil bacterial richness or diversity, but dramatically altered the microbial community structure. Compared to CK and natural composts treatments, fresh frass and frass composts fertilizers enhanced the abundances of certain beneficial microbes (e.g., Sphingomonas, Lysobacter, Gemmatimonas, Bryobacter and Pseudomonas) in soil, probably contributing to their better effects on improving soil available nutrients and crop growth.ConclusionsOverall, pig manure sourced-BSFL frass composts had better effects on promoting maize seedling growth than fresh frass, while no significant differences were observed between chicken manure sourced-frass composts and fresh frass.

AB  - Ecosystems world-wide experience changes in species composition in response to natural and anthropogenic changes in environmental conditions. Research to date has greatly improved our understanding of how species affect focal ecosystem functions. However, because measurements of multiple ecosystem functions have not been consistently justified for any given trophic group, it is unclear whether interpretations of research syntheses adequately reflect the contributions of consumers to ecosystems. Using model communities assembled in experimental microcosms, we examined the relationship between four numerically dominant detritivore species and six ecosystem functions that underpin fundamental aspects of carbon and nitrogen cycling above- and below-ground. We tested whether ecosystem responses to changes in detritivore identity depended upon species trait dissimilarity, food web compartment (aboveground, belowground, mixed) or number of responses considered (one to six). We found little influence of detritivore species identity on brown (i.e. soil-based) processes. Only one of four detritivore species uniquely influenced decomposition, and detritivore species did not vary in their influence on soil nitrogen pools (NO3- and NH4+), or root biomass. However, changes in detritivore identity influenced multiple aboveground ecosystem functions. That is, by serving as prey, ecosystem engineers and occasionally also as herbivores as well as detritivores, these species altered the strength of aboveground predator-herbivore interactions and plant-shoot biomass. Yet, dissimilarity of detritivore functional traits was not associated with dissimilarity of ecosystem functioning. These results serve as an important reminder that consumers influence ecosystem processes via multiple energy channels and that food web interactions set important context for consumer-mediated effects on multiple ecosystem functions. Given that species are being lost, gained and redistributed at unprecedented rates, we can anticipate that changes in species identity will have additional ecosystem consequences beyond those predicted by species' primary functional role.

AB  - Biodiversity science encompasses multiple disciplines and biological scales from molecules to landscapes. Nevertheless, biodiversity data are often analyzed separately with discipline-specific methodologies, constraining resulting inferences to a single scale. To overcome this, we present a topic modeling framework to analyze community composition in cross-disciplinary datasets, including those generated from metagenomics, metabolomics, field ecology and remote sensing. Using topic models, we demonstrate how community detection in different datasets can inform the conservation of interacting plants and herbivores. We show how topic models can identify members of molecular, organismal and landscape-level communities that relate to wildlife health, from gut microbes to forage quality. We conclude with a future vision for how topic modeling can be used to design cross-scale studies that promote a holistic approach to detect, monitor and manage biodiversity.

AB  - Biased research and conservation efforts result in some faunal groups (e.g., small felids) being understudied, and hence these groups are often declining without adequate knowledge to manage for threat reduction. The Pallas's cat (Otocolobus manul) occurs across central and western Asia with declining populations and the largest population is likely in Mongolia. A potential threat to this felid is livestock encroachment across its range, including within protected areas, yet we lack a clear understanding of the impact of livestock husbandry on this cat. We used motion-sensitive camera data from 216 sites in 4 study areas in western Mongolia to study the occurrence probability of Pallas's cat in relation to habitat characteristics and occurrence of livestock, and conducted a local assessment within a strictly protected area where we obtained the highest number of detections. We estimated a relatively low occupancy (0.33 +/- 0.10), which is associated with sites with natural vegetation, steeper slopes, and greater prey abundance. Occupancy also increased with increasing livestock occurrence, particularly large herds of sheep and goats. Such co-occurrence was partially adjusted by diel activity segregation, presumably to limit direct encounters. Our results suggest that the preferred habitat by Pallas's cat in the study region coincides with areas encroached by livestock. The Pallas's cat's habitat is specialized and its dependence on areas that are increasingly used for grazing may eventually threaten the cat with habitat degradation, prey depletion, predation by dogs, and poisoning from pest control. Relevant conservation actions should regulate livestock encroachment within protected areas and improve grazing regimes. The Pallas's cat is an indicator species of mountainous and steppe ecosystems in central Asia; hence, further research towards the preservation of its populations would also benefit other key species across its range.

AB  - The deposition of faeces, pellets or non-ingested remains resulting from the feeding activities of humans and animals has led to the considerable accumulation of remains, including bones, seeds, vegetative remains of plants and other tissues at archaeological and palaeontological sites worldwide. Using a microhistological technique, we examined the ancient droppings (palaeofaeces) of wild herbivores found at the Los Conitos archaeological site in the Valle de Potrerillos in the Andes of Argentina. Our method enabled us to identify the plant taxa eaten by herbivorous mammals that lived in the region during the late Holocene. The site yielded plant macro-remains of wild and domesticated plant taxa, including seeds, endocarps, leaves and stems which are associated with human occupation of the valley since at least ca. 2,300 bp. We found only wild plants in the palaeofaeces, and their frequency varied throughout the 2,000 years of the sequence. One of the key discoveries of this study was the detection of micro-remains of the trees Neltuma flexuosa (algarrobo) and Schinus sp., especially in archaeological contexts from before 1,000 bp. The lack of micro-remains from domesticated plants in the wild herbivore droppings allows various environmental possibilities to be considered. The scarcity of annual herbs grazed by wild herbivores could indicate the continuous rather than only seasonal presence of this fauna in the area. This is relevant to the main prey, which the pre-Hispanic human communities hunted, Lama guanicoe, the guanaco. This investigation helps to reconstruct the landscape of the past from an archaeobotanical perspective, discussing interactions between plants, animals and humans and considering the recent deterioration of these plant communities, mainly from human activities. The main vegetation was scrub with shrubs from ten families together with some cacti and grasses.

AB  - Ecosystem and livelihood sustainability of small-scale farmers in Eastern Africa are often challenged by climate change and unsustainable land use practices. Little is known on the small-scale temporal processes of cropping systems in relation to long-term climatic conditions. To understand the climatic influence on the cropping patterns, and its implications to wildlife/elephant conservation, our study used a combination of time-series datasets on crop and climate as well as geo-spatial layers spanning more than three decades. To validate the information analyzed from secondary data, we carried out participatory observation and interviews, whereby about 5% of village households were selected along an altitudinal gradient of Rombo area, Tanzania. We generated land use change maps using Geographical Information System (ArcGIS 10.4) and used Spearman's correlation analysis to assess the influence of rainfall, temperature, and crop yield on the observed longitudinal changes in the crop types and other land use patterns both within and across altitudinal gradients. We found that perennial crops like coffee and banana concentrated in upper agro-ecological zones, with a clear division line above 1230 masl while seasonal crops like maize and beans were mostly cultivated in lowlands (below 1230 masl). The results further showed that coffee yields significantly declined with higher average annual minimum temperatures over the last 16 years. Within the same time period, there was a disproportionate shift from coffee to seasonal crop cultivation such as maize and beans. Elephant numbers declined by about 38%, while human settlement area increased by 28% over the last 30 years. We conclude that changes in land use and shifts in climate and cropping patterns have important implications for elephant conservation and sustainability of the ecosystem in Rombo area, Tanzania.

AB  - In forest management settings, disturbance resets forests to earlier successional stages, typically improving forage conditions for mule deer. Examining how forest disturbance influences mule deer behavior is important for guiding forest and wildlife management. We used GPS collar data collected between 2017 and 2019 from 136 adult female mule deer in three populations throughout western Montana, United States, to investigate how disturbance from burns (wildfire and prescribed fire) and timber harvest influenced three aspects of space-use behaviors: (1) probability of migration from winter range to summer range, (2) home range (second-order) selection by migrants on summer range, and (3) within-home range (third-order) selection. We hypothesized that deer would maximize use of disturbances during summer for nutritional benefits, predicting that deer with higher proportionate disturbance in their winter home range would be less likely to migrate away from those disturbances during summer. We predicted that migrants would select disturbances at the second and third orders. We found that proportionate disturbance in winter home ranges had no effect on the probability of migration. Among migrants, deer generally selected burns, timber harvests, and open-canopy habitat at the second order in all study areas, with particularly strong selection for 6- to 15-year-old disturbances. At population levels, selection for disturbances ceased at the third order. At individual levels, however, third-order selection for burns increased with availability, whereas selection for harvests decreased, suggesting burns may satisfy more resource needs than harvests. Our results emphasize how space-use fidelity constrains mule deer habitat selection. During summer, adherence to migratory strategies constrains the habitat available for second-order selection, preventing deer from exploiting disturbances that would otherwise be available had they remained resident in wintering areas. Second-order selection then determines disturbance availability within home ranges, affecting third-order behaviors. Although variance in selection behaviors among individuals was high, population-level patterns were remarkably similar among study areas, suggesting these responses may be generalizable to mule deer throughout the northern Rocky Mountains. Forest management practices like timber harvest, prescribed burns, and wildfire management within higher elevation areas of summer range used by migrants could yield the greatest nutritional benefits for mule deer.

AB  - Wildlife mortality due to collisions with vehicles (roadkill) is one of the predominant negative effects exerted by roads on many wildlife species. Reducing roadkill is therefore a major component of wildlife conservation. Roadkill is affected by various factors, including road attributes and traffic volume. It is theorized that the effect of traffic volume on roadkill probability should be unimodal. However, empirical evidence for this theory is lacking. Using a large-scale roadkill database of 18 wildlife species in Israel, encompassing 2846 km of roads over 10 years, we explored the effects of traffic volume and road attributes (e.g., road lighting, verge vegetation) on roadkill probability with a multivariate generalized linear mixed model. A unimodal effect of traffic volume was identified for the striped hyena (Hyaena hyaena), whereas 5 species demonstrated a novel quadratic U-shaped effect (e.g., golden jackal [Canis aureus]). Four species showed a negative linear effect (e.g., wild boar [Sus scrofa]). We also identified varying effects of road attributes on roadkill. For instance, road lighting and roadside trees decreased roadkill for several species, whereas bus stops and concrete guardrails led to increased roadkill. The theorized unimodal effect of traffic volume may only apply to large, agile species, and the U-shaped effect could be related to intraspecies variability in traffic avoidance behavior. In general, we found that both high-traffic and low-traffic roads can pose a high mortality risk for wildlife. It is therefore important to monitor roadkill on low-traffic roads and adapt road attributes to mitigate roadkill. Road design for effective roadkill mitigation includes reducing the use of concrete guardrails and median barriers where possible and avoiding dense bushes in verge landscaping. These measures are complemented by employing wildlife detection systems, driver warnings, and seasonal speed reduction measures on low-traffic roads identified as roadkill hotspots.

AB  - Simple Summary Long-term monitoring of the Alpine musk deer (AMD, Moschus chrysogaster) population is essential in any human-dominated landscape as their population is globally showing a declining trend due to high deforestation rates, hunting pressure, and human disturbance. In view of that, the AMD population was monitored in Xinglong Mountain Nature Reserve (XMNNR), as their past high-density distribution areas, northwest of China, using a camera trap between September 2018 and August 2020. The results showed that AMD strongly spatial temporal avoids livestock but gradually adjusts to human activities. Compared to the previous report, AMD distributes artificial forests that are not confined to the areas reported but also cover other potential areas.
   Comprehension of whether human and livestock presence affects wildlife activity is a prerequisite for the planning and management of humans and livestock in protected areas. Xinglong Mountain Nature Reserve (XMNNR) in northwest China, as a green island in a semi-arid mountain ecosystem, is one of the scattered and isolated areas for Alpine musk deer (AMD), an endangered species. AMD cohabits their latent habitat area with foraging livestock and humans. Hence, habitat management within and outside the distribution areas is crucial for the effective conservation of AMD. We applied camera traps to a dataset of 2 years (September 2018-August 2020) to explore seasonal activity patterns and habitat use and assess the impacts of AMD habits in XMNNR. We investigated AMD responses to livestock grazing and human activities and provided effective strategies for AMD conservation. We applied MaxENT modeling to predict the distribution size under current conditions. The activity patterns of the AMD vary among seasons. The optimum habitat average distance to cultivated land ranges of AMD (150 similar to 3300 m during grass period/100 similar to 3200 m during withered grass period), distances to the residential area ranges (500 similar to 5700 m during the grass period/1000 similar to 5300 m during the withered grass period), elevation ranges (2350 similar to 3400 m during the grass period/2360 similar to 3170 m during the withered grass period), aspect ranges (0 similar to 50 degrees and 270 similar to 360 degrees), normalized vegetation index ranges (0.64 similar to 0.72 during the grass period/0.14 similar to 0.60 during the withered grass period), and land cover types (forest, shrub, and grassland). Results present that the predicted distributions of AMD were not confined to the areas reported but also covered other potential areas. The results provide evidence of strong spatial-temporal avoidance of AMD in livestock, but gradually adjusting to human activities. These camera trap datasets may open new opportunities for species conservation in much wider tracts, such as human-dominated landscapes, and may offer guidance and mitigate impacts from livestock, as well as increase artificial forest planting and strengthen the investigation of the potential population resources of AMD.

AB  - Mega-herbivore or elephant fences aim to prevent target animals (here: African savanna elephant Loxodonta africana, giraffe Giraffa giraffa) from crossing while allowing others, often with the intention to protect an area against elephants-for conservation, economic or research purposes. However, little is known about mega-herbivore fence effectiveness and impact on non-target species, for example impact on meso-herbivore movement, or fence avoidance. We hypothesised that mega-herbivore fences are effective in excluding mega-herbivores, whereas other species remain unaffected. We tested this hypothesis by comparing mammalian species abundance in (i) full exclosures, (ii) mega-herbivore exclosures and (iii) open plots. These plots were part of the Lapalala Elephant Landscape Experiment (LELE) project in Lapalala Wilderness, South Africa. Systematic dung pile recording and animal track counts-supported with video footage from camera traps-were used to quantify species-specific animal abundance using generalised linear mixed-effect models. The dung piles showed no difference in the abundance of non-target species between mega-herbivore exclosures and open plots, while target species were successfully excluded. Interestingly, we found fewer tracks of large non-target herbivores, such as plains zebra (Equus quagga) and greater kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros) crossing mega-herbivore fences compared to open plots, indicating that some individuals avoided crossing the mega-herbivore fence lines. We suggest that this avoidance is due to a combination of species-specific vigilance and deterrence of large specimens. Further research is needed to determine whether this avoidance persists over time, and if the absence of large non-target animals affects ecosystem functioning. Mega-herbivore fences are an effective means to prevent the movement of target species. However, some individuals of non-target species also avoid crossing these fences, likely large animals due to the minimum height of the fence. We recommend monitoring the movement of species once elephant fences are erected, and to increase minimum fence height if non-target species are affected.

AB  - Background There is considerable interest in the suitability of the farm-flock Katahdin hair sheep breed for large-scale extensive range sheep production systems. Flocking behavior or "flockability", a measure of gregariousness, is critical for sheep to produce in extensive, herded management systems. An evaluation of the Katahdin breed in a Western U.S. range environment compared to the traditional range-adapted Rambouillet breed is underway. The objective was to compare the flockability of range-reared Katahdin ewes to Rambouillet ewes during the summer grazing season using GPS collars. Flockability was measured by how far a ewe was dispersed from the centroid of the study flock and the total daily distance traveled compared to the study flock. Results Complete GPS coordinates were available from 23 Rambouillet and 29 Katahdin ewes in 2023 and five Rambouillet and five Katahdin ewes in 2024. Study groups were managed in bands of 800-1,000 ewes with lambs. During the day, the Katahdin breed had a farther dispersion from the study flock centroid for one of the study groups (P < 0.05), the Rambouillet breed was more dispersed for one study group (P < 0.05), and the breeds did not differ for one study group (P > 0.05). The effect size, measured using Cohen's d, was small for all groups. The daily distance traveled was farther for the Rambouillet breed in two study groups (P < 0.05) when compared to the Katahdin breed, but did not differ for the other study group (P > 0.05). The effect size was low regardless of significance. When individual ewes were compared, both breeds had ewes that were either closer or farther away from the flock centroid (P < 0.05) or ewes that traveled farther or shorter daily distance (P < 0.05). Conclusions The Katahdin breed was similar in flockability to the traditional, range-adapted Rambouillet breed, indicating that the Katahdin breed is well suited for grazing in an extensive range environment. This study indicates the Katahdin breed exhibits favorable behavioral characteristics to flock well in large-scale extensive range systems and provides an opportunity for Western U.S. producers interested in incorporating this breed into their flock.

AB  - Both intensive farming of paddy field crops and conventional farm management techniques have been a major cause of environmental issues in recent years. A more ecosystem-based, sustainable agricultural methodology should be utilized to help solve this dilemma. However, the joint effects of landscape and farming on arthropod communities in paddy fields are unexplored. In eco-friendly paddy fields, we postulate the arthropod diversity to be higher in fields that use ecosystem-based methods. In this study, we collected arthropods monthly using a blower-vac during the first rice crop of 2019 in Taiwan. A total of 53,522 individuals of 14 orders, 96 families, and 445 morphospecies were collected. All arthropods were identified into four functional groups. The result showed that insect communities are different between sustainable and conventional fields. Results showed that sustainable fields had a higher abundance of arthropod fauna than conventional fields. It was also apparent that the arthropod community changed along with the developmental growth of rice and in different areas. Three functional groups, viz., herbivores, parasitoids, and detritivores, present the best model when the farming type was assigned as the fixed effect, while the predator reveal the best model when the farming type, landscape, and their interaction were assigned as the fixed effects. The arthropod communities have also been affected by the surrounding landscape. This study reveals that both agricultural management and landscape can have a joint effect on arthropod communities in paddy fields.

AB  - Benthic macroinvertebrates are a major ecological group in freshwater ecosystems, exhibiting diverse adaptations depending on their habitat. Based on these characteristics, studies using benthic macroinvertebrate communities for aquatic ecosystem health assessments are currently being conducted worldwide, primarily focusing on lotic ecosystems such as rivers, and estuaries. However, due to the significant environmental changes caused by water flow affecting water quality, food sources, and microhabitats, it is essential to develop indices specialized for lentic ecosystems, which have different flow characteristics, to accurately evaluate their health. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a wetland health assessment index using benthic macroinvertebrates. Preliminary indicators were selected from domestic and international health assessment methods, and final indicators were chosen based on their correlation with water quality status, applicability in Korea, redundancy between indicators, and their reflection of wetland characteristics. The verification of each indicator was performed using benthic macroinvertebrate community data from 37 wetlands, while water quality data were used from wetland assessments conducted from 2018 to 2022. Evaluation scores were calculated based on the cumulative distribution function, reflecting the distribution of data for each indicator. The final indicators included the number of taxa, total individual density, the number and percentage of OCH (Odonata, Coleoptera, Hemiptera) taxa and individual density, non-insect taxa (%), Chironomidae spp. individual density (%), functional feeding groups (FFGs), and habitat-oriented groups (HOGs), with a total of eight indicators selected. We developed an index to effectively assess Korean wetland health, providing a foundational resource for health evaluations in Korea.

AB  - Within carnivore guilds, dominant competitors (e.g., lions, Panthera leo) are limited primarily by the density of prey, while subordinate competitors (e.g., African wild dogs, Lycaon pictus) have been limited by the density of dominant competitors. Historically, the fitness and population density of subordinate competitors have not been tightly linked to prey density. However, populations of large herbivores have declined substantially across sub-Saharan Africa due to human impacts, and where prey depletion is severe, fitness costs for competitive subordinates may begin to outweigh the benefits of competitive release. Using long-term intensive monitoring of African wild dogs in Zambia's Luangwa Valley Ecosystem (LVE), we tested the effects of prey depletion on survival and reproduction. We hypothesized that African wild dog fitness would be lower in prey-depleted areas, despite lower lion densities. Our study area included four contiguous regions that varied in protection level, prey density, and lion density. We fit Bayesian Cormack-Jolly-Seber and closed-capture models to estimate effects on survival and population density, and generalized linear models to estimate effects on reproductive success. We found that the LVE is a stronghold for African wild dogs, with an estimated median density of 4.0 individuals/100 km(2). Despite this high density, survival and reproduction differed among regions, and both components of fitness were substantially reduced in the region with the lowest prey density. Anthropogenic prey depletion is becoming an important limiting factor for African wild dogs. If prey depletion (or any other form of habitat degradation) becomes severe enough that its fitness costs outweigh the benefits of competitive release, such changes can fundamentally alter the balance between limiting factors for competitively subordinate species.

AB  - The gut microbiota plays a critical role in plant digestion, nutrient absorption, and ecological adaptation in herbivores. However, how gut microbiota and diet jointly influence ecological niche differentiation in sympatric species remains unclear. Here, we use metagenomic sequencing and plant trnL (UAA) fragment sequencing to examine the gut microbiota and dietary composition of sympatric Tibetan argali (Ovis ammon hodgsoni) and blue sheep (Pseudois nayaur) in the Kunlun Mountains of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Despite inhabiting similar environments, the two species harbor distinct microbial compositions and functional profiles. Interestingly, higher dietary diversity does not correspond to higher microbial diversity. Tibetan argali, despite having a simpler diet, possesses a more diverse and flexible gut microbiome. In contrast, blue sheep show broader dietary preferences and stronger microbial metabolic adaptation to glycan biosynthesis and metabolism. These findings reveal significant associations between gut microbiota composition, function, and diet, supporting a microbial contribution to trophic niche differentiation. Our results highlight distinct microbial-dietary strategies in sympatric herbivores and underscore the role of the gut microbiome in ecological adaptation and species coexistence.

AB  - The spread of Covid-19 has reduced human intervention in aquatic ecosystems, which has shown a discernible improvement in air and water quality. Ganges River, being a historical, economic and cultural icon of India providing multiple ecosystem services as industrial, provisioning, regulatory and cultural services, constitutes an important habitat for Gangetic Dolphin (Platanista gangetica). The surfacing of dolphins in Ganga river is patchy and unpredictable. The present study unravels 25 different chemical, microbiological, biological and meta-genomics of most abundant bacteria at dolphin surfacing sites in Ganges water during October 2017 February 2018 and January 2021 to elicit the impact of Covid-19 lock down at the Garhmukteshwar (28.7601 degrees N, 78.1437 degrees E) stretch in Hapur district of Uttar Pradesh, India. The most abundant bacteria at dolphin surfacing site was Bacillus subtilis in February 2018 which was replaced by Aeromonas sp. in January 2021. The zooplankton community was dominated by rotifers during pre-Covid period however the dominance pattern recorded a shift towards larger herbivorous crustacean species during Covid -19 lock down. Overall bacterial count decreased whereas Chl a level increased during the lock down. The total zooplankton abundance did not show a significant difference, but relative proportion of larger herbivorous crustacean zooplankton increased in January 2021 samples. The present results convincingly establish effects of shutdown on chemical, metagenomics and biological components of the riparian ecosystem and the information of micro to mesoplanktonic community may be useful for characterizing dolphin surfacing sites, enhancing existing water quality monitoring efforts and also for human epidemiological studies associated with recreational use of Ganga water.

AB  - Hybridization in antelope species has been widely reported in South African national parks and provincial reserves as well as on private land due to anthropogenic effects. In a closed management setting, hybridization may occur due to the crossbreeding of closely related species with unequal sex ratios, resulting in either sterile or fertile offspring. In this study, we used molecular techniques to evaluate the risk of anthropogenic hybridization between blesbok (Damaliscus pygargus phillipsi) and red hartebeest (Alcelaphus buselaphus caama) in an isolated group that purposely included the two species with unequal sex ratios (one red hartebeest male and 19 male and female blesbok). Genetic analysis based on microsatellites confirmed the presence of seven hybrid individuals. Mitochondrial analysis verified that hybridization occurred between blesbok females and the red hartebeest male. STRUCTURE and NEWHYBRIDS classified the hybrids as F1. It is suspected that the hybrid individuals were sterile as the males had undeveloped testes and only F1 hybrids were detected. Thus, the risk of hybridization between these two species may be limited in the wild. In captive settings, genetic monitoring should be included in management plans for blesbok and red hartebeest to ensure that the long-term consequences of wasted reproductive effort are limited.
   A genetic investigation of hybridization between blesbok and red hartebeest determined that offspring are sterile. These results support that the risk of hybridization between blesbok and red hartebeest may be limited in the wild and would result in wasted reproductive effort.image

AB  - Caribbean coral reefs are experiencing a shift to algal dominance at the expense of stony corals. Determining the factors leading to algal phase shifts is crucial for assuring the survival of Caribbean coral reefs. In this study, factors controlling the growth of the abundant brown macroalgae Dictyota spp. were investigated by varying herbivory pressure (caging) and nutrients (fertilizer addition) on coral reefs near St. Thomas (US Virgin Islands). Experiment 1 measured Dictyota heights and percent cover at 3 sites (11-20 m depth) and showed no growth response to nutrient addition and a weak negative response to herbivory. To confirm results of Experiment 1, a caging and nutrient manipulation (Experiment 2) was conducted at one site (14 m depth) using the dependent variable Dictyota biomass. A strong negative response of growth to nutrient addition was shown, presumably because of nutrient inhibition, and an equally negative response to herbivory (loss of similar to 50% biomass over 21 d). The inhibitory effect of fertilization on growth was confirmed in a third experiment that showed increasing biomass loss over 4 treatment levels of increasing fertilizer addition (0 [ambient], 5, 10, 20 g). Overall, Dictyota was not nutrient limited at any sites, and was weakly controlled by herbivore populations. Factors responsible for Dictyota abundance on Caribbean reefs may reflect decreased herbivory caused by overfishing and reductions in coral cover and do not appear to be affected by recent changes in nitrogen or phosphorus load. This study reinforces the need for conservation and management of herbivores in coral reef ecosystems, to mitigate the effects from anthropogenic stressors.

AB  - Diet is an important factor that provides valuable information on resource partitioning among carnivores and helps in understanding the dynamics of coexistence and competition between species. We investigated the food habits and dietary partitioning among three sympatric carnivores viz., snow leopard Panthera uncia, Tibetan wolf Canis lupus chanco, and red fox Vulpes vulpes through analysis of their scats in the Karakoram Wildlife Sanctuary (WS) in Nubra, Trans-Himalaya. Both morphological and DNA-based identification was used to establish species identity of the field-collected scats followed by micro-histological examination of prey hairs in 350 scats. Snow leopard diet was majorly contributed by wild ungulates (48.34%) including blue sheep Pseudois nayaur, ibex Capra ibex siberica and Ladakh urial Ovis vignei vignei, and livestock (42.81%) in terms of biomass contribution with frequent consumption of Myricaria sp, while the Tibetan wolf predominantly relied on livestock (67.2%) to fulfill its dietary requirement. The diet of red fox mostly included small mammals (56.78%) and livestock carrions (28.31%) along with significant consumption of plant matter. Wolves showed a wider (0.51) dietary niche breadth compared to snow leopards (0.47) and red foxes (0.30), and showed high dietary overlap (0.72) with snow leopards. Comparable niche breadth and dietary overlap between snow leopard and Tibetan wolf may be a result of limited wild prey or differential use of resources at spatial and temporal scales which requires further investigation. Notable contribution of livestock in the carnivore diet unfolds a serious concern that may lead to aggravated carnivore-human interactions and increased risk of disease transmission to carnivores. We therefore recommend a comprehensive study on multi-dimensional niche parameters of predator-prey interactions along with strengthening conservation efforts to improve wild prey populations and their habitats in the region.

AB  - How animals use their range can have physiological, ecological, and demographic repercussions, as well as impact management decisions, species conservation, and human society. Fidelity, the predictable return to certain places, can improve fitness if it is associated with high-quality habitat or helps enable individuals to locate heterogenous patches of higher-quality habitat within a lower-quality habitat matrix. Our goal was to quantify patterns of fidelity at different spatial scales to better understand the relative plasticity of habitat use of a vital subsistence species that undergoes long-distance migrations. We analyzed a decade (2010-2019) of GPS data from 240 adult, female Western Arctic Herd (WAH) caribou (Rangifer tarandus) from northwest Alaska, U.S.A. We assessed fidelity at 2 spatial scales: to site-specific locations within seasonal ranges and to regions within the herd's entire range by using 2 different null datasets. We assessed both area and consistency of use during 6 different seasons of the year. We also assessed the temporal consistency of migration and calving events. At the scale of the overall range, we found that caribou fidelity was greatest during the calving and insect relief (early summer) seasons, where the herd tended to maximally aggregate in the smallest area, and lowest in winter when the seasonal range is largest. However, even in seasons with lower fidelity, we found that caribou still showed fidelity to certain regions within the herd's range. Within those seasonal ranges, however, there was little individual site-specific fidelity from year to year, with the exception of summer periods. Temporally, we found that over 90% of caribou gave birth within 7 days of the day they gave birth the previous year. This revealed fairly high temporal consistency, especially given the spatial and temporal variability of spring migration. Fall migration exhibited greater temporal variability than spring migration. Our results support the hypothesis that higher fidelity to seasonal ranges is related to greater environmental and resource predictability. Interestingly, this fidelity was stronger at larger scales and at the population level. Almost the entire herd would seek out these areas with predictable resources, and then, individuals would vary their use, likely in response to annually varying conditions. During seasons with lower presumed spatial and/or temporal predictability of resources, population-level fidelity was lower but individual fidelity was higher. The herd would be more spread out during the seasons of low-resource predictability, leading to lower fidelity at the scale of their entire range, but individuals could be closer to locations they used the previous year, leading to greater individual fidelity, perhaps resulting from memory of a successful outcome the previous year. Our results also suggest that fidelity in 1 season is related to fidelity in the subsequent season. We hypothesize that some differences in patterns of range fidelity may be driven by seasonal differences in group size, degree of sociality, and/or density-dependent factors. Climate change may affect resource predictability and, thus, the spatial fidelity and temporal consistency of use of animals to certain seasonal ranges.

AB  - The hog deer (Axis porcinus) is an endangered cervid with drastic population declines. There are 2 recognized subspecies of hog deer: A. p. porcinus, ranging from Punjab Province in Pakistan, Nepal, and the Northern part of India to Myanmar, and A. p. annamiticus found in Indo-China, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam. The current geographic range of A. p. annamiticus is still ambiguous. We analyzed variation in the mitochondrial DNA control region (mtDNA CR) to investigate the intra-species structure, differentiation, and demographic history of hog deer from Cambodia (Kratie Province), which we compared with the populations from India and Thailand. We also generated divergence time estimates using a concatenated dataset of complete Cyt b and partial CR. The CR data showed that Cambodian hog deer are genetically differentiated from the mainland Indian and Thai populations, forming a distinct basal clade. The time of divergence indicates that the Cambodian lineage split from the other 2 hog deer lineages around 0.51 Mya, during the Late Pleistocene. The results also suggest strong phylogeographic structure among hog deer: lineage A extends from Terai Arc (foothills of the Himalayas) to Assam, India (A. p. porcinus), lineage B from Manipur, India to Thailand (A. p. annamiticus), and lineage C is only known from Kratie Province, Cambodia. Lineage A exhibited a higher level of genetic diversity than lineages B and C, with recent demographic stability. Thus, the hog deer population in Kratie Province appears to be a distinct lineage that should be treated as an evolutionarily significant unit.

AB  - Neltuma alba is a tree whose seeds were probably dispersed by now -extinct animals. Currently, its fruits are consumed by foxes, guanacos, donkeys, and goats, which may scarify the seeds during ingestion, thereby enhancing germination. However, these animals might damage the cotyledons when chewing the fruits, potentially reducing the survival and growth of the plants, although this occurs infrequently. We hypothesize that mechanical scarification of seeds increases their germination but does not affect the survival and growth of the plants. Our objective was to evaluate the effects of mechanical scarification on seed germination and subsequent plant survival. We scarified the seeds by sanding them before sowing them in a nursery with daily watering for six months. Subsequently, the plants were transplanted to the field, where they received daily watering for six months, biweekly watering for the next twelve months, and no watering for the following two years. Seed scari - fication significantly increased germination by 1.5 times: 58 and 39% germination in scarified and non -scarified seeds, respectively. Scarification did not significantly affect plant survival. Survival rates were 93, 67, 67, and 26% at the end of the first, second, third, and fourth years, respectively. Similarly, scarification did not signifi - cantly affect plant height, with plants reaching heights of 28, 59, 74, and 118 cm in the first, second, third, and fourth years, respectively. Understanding the limiting factors for the reproduction of endangered plants in the Atacama Desert is crucial for proposing effective conservation actions.

AB  - Context. Understanding habitat suitability for feral animals across a landscape is important for conservation planning because the spatial and temporal availability of water provides critical limits to native biodiversity and the processes that threaten it. Previous attempts to support management actions on feral pig populations through predictions of population abundance, distribution and seasonal resource constraints have been confounded by a lack of knowledge, classification and mapping of waterholes - which are critical to their survival. Aims. In this paper, we aimed to apply a waterhole classification scheme for feral pig management to address gaps in our understanding of water and food availability through space and time, at scales relevant to feral animal movement and resource use. Methods. We utilise an attribute-based waterhole classification scheme for ecosystem-based management by defining a waterhole typology of feral pig habitat suitability and applying it spatially. Key results. Five attributes (water permanence, predictability of inundation, oceanic influence, dominant vegetation and shading) reflect many of the critical requirements for feral pig habitat in northern Australia. The attributes directly relate to the environmental constraints that exert population and behavioural pressure on feral pigs. These attributes were applied spatially in a specific hierarchy to group waterholes into 21 types. Conclusions. A waterhole typology that characterises within the context of their suitability for feral pig populations is foundational for systematic adaptive management and monitoring programs that aim to reduce the impact of threatening processes on freshwater ecosystems. Implications. Refining the mapping of important feral pig habitat variables (water and food) will greatly improve modelling approaches that aim to support data-driven management approaches, such as connectivity analysis and estimating population dynamics to inform culling programs. Here we demonstrate a significant increase in overlap with known feral pig distributions using a much smaller mapped effective management area when compared with previous best available spatial products.

AB  - The importance of cascading effects of grasshopper predators on plant biomass involving grasshoppers in grassland ecosystems appears variable. A constraint of most grasshopper trophic cascade studies to date is that they examine responses of a single grasshopper species, while grasshopper feeding guilds could affect whether a trophic cascade is observed. As grasslands are grass dominated, grass feeding grasshoppers generally have stronger impacts on plant biomass than mixed grass and forb feeding species indicating that trophic cascades should be observed more commonly with grass feeding species. Grasshopper feeding preference could have important implications for predicting the outcome of grasshopper predator-prey interactions. I conducted similar experiments in two years with different grasshopper feeding guilds, grass feeding and mixed grass and forb feeding, to examine the importance of cascading predator effects at a grass dominated prairie site. For both experiments, treatments consisted of invertebrate removal, herbivore only, and herbivore plus predator treatments. There was no indication of a trophic cascade with high densities of a mixed feeding grasshopper species in a year with lower biomass production. Although plant regrowth following herbivory can weaken the appearance of trophic cascades, a trophic cascade on grass biomass was evident with high densities of a grass feeding grasshopper during a year with higher biomass production. As a result, plant preference appears to impact the importance of cascading effects of predators on plant biomass in this system.

AB  - Herbivorous insect assemblages are functionally diverse, with each species exploiting plant tissues in different ways. Availability and palatability of plant tissues influence the diversity and composition of herbivorous insect assemblages. However, few studies have compared herbivorous insect assemblages and their ecological correlates across multiple plant species within the same plant community. Here, we sampled insect assemblages from the canopies of 1060 plants belonging to 36 woody species in two mixed Mediterranean forest stands. 401 insect species were classified as herbivores and grouped into sucker or chewer guilds. We explored differences in the diversity and composition of each insect guild across plant species, and tested their relationships with plant leaf traits, abundance or phylogeny, and explored whether the structures of plant-herbivorous insect networks depended on any of the studied plant traits. Plant identity accounted for the highest proportion of variation in the composition of each insect guild. Plant species abundance showed a positive effect on both insect guilds' diversity. Suckers' diversity was higher in plant species with deciduous leaves and low SLA, while the composition was more similar between phylogenetically closer plant species. Chewers diversity increased with the leaf area, while plants with similar LA, leaf nitrogen, SLA and distinct leaf habit showed more similar assemblages. Similarly, closely related angiosperms showed similar chewer assemblages. Plant-insect interaction networks present a modular structure, in which plants belonging to the same module tend to be related and share more sucker species. We add to the evidence supporting the role of plant species features as filters for structuring their associated herbivore insect assemblages.

AB  - Broad-scale ecological research on species distributions commonly presumes that the correlative relationships discovered are stationary over space. This is an assumption of most species distribution models (SDMs) that combine observations of species occurrence with environmental characteristics to understand current ecological correlates and to predict distributions based on those relationships. However, ecological relationships may vary spatially because of changes in the environment (i.e., resource availability) or the organism itself (i.e., local adaptation). Discovering this within-species variation typically requires dense datasets over large geographic areas, which are now being provided by the recent proliferation of open-access biodiversity occurrence records. Using nearly 4000 sampling locations from an open-access, state-wide camera-trapping project, we explore the space-varying effects of covariates on the distribution of four mammal species at two scales: region-specific and fine resolution, with the latter estimated using spatially varying coefficients (SVC) models, to understand the scale of spatial variation in ecological relationships. Among the four species tested, the ecological relationships for two were best explained with the regional models, equivocal results for one species, while the SVC model had superior fit and predictive performance for the final species (white-tailed deer, Odocoileus virginianus). Spatial nonstationarity was more common in relationships with landscape composition characteristics, such as housing density, than in landscape configuration metrics, such as patch richness density. One of the most appealing results of an SVC approach is not only the improved predictions across large landscapes but also understanding how animals are responding to the environment differently at the management unit level. For example, we found that deer's spatially varying relationship with forest cover was best explained by an interactive effect of deer management units (i.e., differences in deer populations) and predator pressure. These findings lead to a new hypothesis about how deer may be differentially using forested environments across space and could be a promising area of future research. Given sufficient data, accounting for nonstationarity in SDMs can show large-scale ecological patterns while also detecting local level changes in animal ecology in areas small enough that management or protection can be readily implemented.

AB  - Climate change has been regarded as a major factor affecting the geographic distribution of many endemic rare species on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Tibetan antelope, an endemic rare wildlife, is identified as a national first-class protected wild animal in China. To explore the impacts of human activities and climate change on the spatial distribution pattern of Tibetan antelope, the MaxEnt model was used to simulate the potential distribution of Tibetan antelope under four Shared Socio-economic Pathways in 2050s and 2070s and combined the modelling results of the main forage plants considering the food chains. The results showed that the environment indicators, e.g., elevation, mean temperature of wettest quarter, slope, mean temperature of warmest quarter, landcover, max temperature of warmest month, precipitation of driest month, Stipa capillata, Oxytropis ochrocephala, human influence intensity, were the main factors controlling the distribution of Tibetan antelope. The potential distributions of Tibetan antelope and their 10 forage plants were significantly different under future climate scenarios such as expanding, contracting and shifting. The mean elevation of suitable habitats for Tibetan antelope all increased under the four future scenarios compared with current value. There were protection gaps for Tibetan antelope. Considering the long-distance migration, the integrity of the ecosystem including Qiangtang National Nature Reserve, Altun National Nature Reserve, and Kekexili National Nature Reserve would be established for Tibetan antelope. Our findings will provide important references for the protection and investigation of Tibetan antelope.

AB  - This study evaluated the influence of Amazonian ecosystems, during the dry and rainy seasons, on the composition of the livers of water buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis) raised in the Eastern Amazon in extensive and intensive systems. The results showed that the total lipid content was affected by location and season. Total cholesterol, alpha-tocopherol and gamma-tocopherol were influenced by the interaction between ecosystems, location and seasonal periods. Animals raised in pastures had higher levels of omega-3, while those in confinement had higher levels of omega-6. Amazonian ecosystems influenced the nutritional values of buffalo livers, with better results in the extensive system.The diet offered to animals has a great influence on the composition of tissues and, consequently, the quality. The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of Amazonian ecosystems, in the dry and rainy periods of the year, on the composition of cholesterol, tocopherols, beta-carotene and the fatty acid profile of the livers of water buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis) reared in the Eastern Amazon, in an extensive or intensive system. Total lipid content was influenced by the location and time of year (p < 0.05). Ninety-six male water buffaloes were used (12 per sampling period), aged between 24 and 36 months, with average weights of 432 kg (end of the rainy season) and 409 kg (end of the dry season). Total cholesterol, alpha-tocopherol and gamma-tocopherol influenced the relationship between extensive vs intensive ecosystems, location, periods and the interaction between the location and period of the year (p < 0.05). Animals raised in a pasture ecosystem had the highest values of omega-3, and those raised in confinement, the highest values of omega-6 (p < 0.05). The proportions of n-6/n-3 and hypocholesterolemia (7.14) and hypercholesterolemia (3.08%) (h/H) were found in greater amounts in animals raised in confinement (p < 0.05). The atherogenic index (AI) had a higher value in the rainy season, in animals raised in Santarem (2.37%), with no difference between pasture and feedlot ecosystems, except in animals raised in the rainy season in Nova Timboteua, with a lower AI (1.53%). The thrombogenicity index (TI) was higher in the livers of confined animals (0.32%) and lower (0.18%) in those raised in Nova Timboteua (rainy season). Amazonian ecosystems influence the nutritional values of buffalo liver, with the best nutritional values in animals in the extensive system.

AB  - Herbivore distributions and abundance are shifting because of climate change, leading to intensified grazing pressure on foundation species such as seagrasses. This, combined with rapidly increasing magnitudes of change in estuarine ecosystems, may affect seagrass resilience. While the overall resilience of seagrasses is generally well-studied, the timeframes of recovery has received comparatively little attention, particularly in temperate estuaries. We investigated how the recovery time (RT) of seagrass is affected by simulated grazing in a southwestern Australian estuary. Whilst excluding swans, we simulated different grazing intensities (25, 50, 75, and 100% removal from 1 m(2) plots) at four locations in the Swan-Canning Estuary, Western Australia during summer and tracked the recovery of seagrass over 3 months, using seagrass cover as the main measure of recovery. We found that seagrass recovered within 4-6 weeks from the lower grazing intensities (25 and 50%) and 7-19 weeks from the higher grazing intensities (75 and 100%) across the estuary. Increased grazing intensity led to not only longer recovery times (RTs), but also greater variability in the RT among experimental locations. The RT from the higher grazing intensities at one location in particular was more than double other locations. Seagrass recovery was through vegetative mechanisms and not through sexual reproduction. There was a significant grazing treatment effect on seagrass meadow characteristics, particularly belowground biomass which had not recovered 3 months following grazing. As the pressure of climate change on estuarine environments increases, these quantified RTs for seagrass provide a baseline for understanding grazing pressure as a singular disturbance. Future work can now examine how grazing and other potentially interacting pressures in our changing climate could impact seagrass recovery even further.

AB  - The border region between Austria, the Czech Republic, and Germany harbors the most south-western occurrence of moose in continental Europe. The population originated in Poland, where moose survived, immigrated from former Soviet Union or were reintroduced after the Second World War expanded west- and southwards. In recent years, the distribution of the nonetheless small Central European population seems to have declined, necessitating an evaluation of its current status. In this study, existing datasets of moose observations from 1958 to 2019 collected in the three countries were combined to create a database totaling 771 records (observations and deaths). The database was then used to analyze the following: (a) changes in moose distribution, (b) the most important mortality factors, and (c) the availability of suitable habitat as determined using a maximum entropy approach. The results showed a progressive increase in the number of moose observations after 1958, with peaks in the 1990s and around 2010, followed by a relatively steep drop after 2013. Mortality within the moose population was mostly due to human interactions, including 13 deadly wildlife-vehicle collisions, particularly on minor roads, and four animals that were either legally culled or poached. Our habitat model suggested that higher altitudes (ca. 700-1,000 m a.s.l.), especially those offering wetlands, broad-leaved forests and natural grasslands, are the preferred habitats of moose whereas steep slopes and areas of human activity are avoided. The habitat model also revealed the availability of large core areas of suitable habitat beyond the current distribution, suggesting that habitat was not the limiting factor explaining the moose distribution in the study area. Our findings call for immediate transboundary conservation measures to sustain the moose population, such as those aimed at preventing wildlife-vehicle collisions and illegal killings. Infrastructure planning and development activities must take into account the habitat requirements of moose.

AB  - The Persian fallow deer or Mesopotamian fallow Deer (Dama mesopotamica, Brook 1875), a species of significant ecological importance, had faced the threat of extinction in Iran. One conservation strategy involved the translocation of Persian deer to enclosed areas across Iran, where they were afforded protection from external threats and provided with essential care by human caretakers. While human caretakers diligently attend to their needs and mitigate external threats, climate variables may now become critical factors affecting population dynamics in enclosed areas. This study aims to assess the similarity in climate niches between the original area (Dez and Karkheh) of the Persian deer species and 11 newly enclosed areas. To achieve this, we employed climate data and ecological niche modeling (ENM) techniques to assess the variations in climate among 12 areas. We utilized the environmental equivalency test to determine whether the environmental spaces of area pairs exhibit significant differences and whether these spaces are interchangeable. Extrapolation analyses were also constructed in the next steps to explore climatic conditions in original fallow deer habitats that are non-analogous to those in other parts of Iran. Our results reveal significant disparities in climate conditions between the original and all translocated areas. Based on observations of population growth in specific enclosed areas where translocated deer populations have thrived, we hypothesize that the species may demonstrate a non-equilibrium distribution in Iran. Consequently, these new areas could potentially be regarded as part of the species' potential climate niche. Extrapolation analysis showed that for a significant portion of Iran, extrapolation predictions are highly uncertain and potentially unreliable for the translocation of Persian fallow deer. However, the primary objective of translocation efforts remains the establishment of self-sustaining populations of Persian deer capable of thriving in natural areas beyond enclosed areas, thus ensuring their long-term survival and contributing to preservation efforts. Evaluating the success of newly translocated species requires additional time, with varying levels of success observed. In cases where the growth rate of the species in certain enclosed areas falls below expectations, it is prudent to consider climate variables that may contribute to population declines. Furthermore, for future translocations, we recommend selecting areas with climate similarities to regions where the species has demonstrated growth rates.

AB  - Gap dynamics facilitate recruitment of late-successional species such as northern white-cedar (Thuja occidentalis L.). For this reason, harvests that result in partial rather than complete canopy removal have been suggested for cedar. However, success of regenerating cedar following partial harvests is uncertain, especially where there is heavy browsing by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus Zimmerman) or snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus). Efforts to understand how partial harvests and browsing interact to affect natural regeneration of cedar have been limited. We inventoried partially harvested stands along a gradient of 1-11 years since harvest in New Brunswick, Canada, in an area where deer frequently overwinter. Cedar regeneration was negatively influenced by browsing, but positively influenced by years since harvest and sapling basal area. Cedar seedling survival was assessed over a 2-year period and found to be primarily a function of height at initial measurement, with little influence of browsing. Annual vertical gain of cedar seedlings (a surrogate for height growth) decreased with increasing years since harvest and was influenced by distance from gap edge. In gaps, vertical gain increased with distance to gap edge, while distance to gap edge had a negative influence on vertical gain of seedlings in the matrix (between-gap areas). Many tagged cedar seedlings disappeared prior to remeasurement. These were likely completely consumed by browsers, limiting our ability to determine relative influences of partial harvest and browsing on cedar regeneration. We conclude that partial harvests, as applied in this study, increase cedar abundance and vertical gain, but browsing may necessitate seedling protection. We suggest monitoring to confirm sufficient cedar regeneration in partially harvested stands, using exclosures where browsing is a concern, and retaining or at least delaying removal of seed-bearing cedar overstory trees until regeneration has reached heights safe from browsing.

AB  - The management of infectious wildlife diseases often involves tackling pathogens that infect multiple host species. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a prion disease that can infect most cervid species. CWD was detected in reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) in Norway in 2016. Sympatric populations of red deer (Cervus elaphus) and moose (Alces alces) are at immediate risk. However, the estimation of spillover risk across species and implementation of multispecies management policies are rarely addressed for wildlife. Here, we estimated the broad risk of CWD spillover from reindeer to red deer and moose by quantifying the probability of co-occurrence based on both (1) population density and (2) habitat niche overlap from GPS data of all three species in Nordfjella, Norway. We describe the practical challenges faced when aiming to reduce the risk of spillover through a marked reduction in the population densities of moose and red deer using recreational hunters. This involves setting the population and harvest aims with uncertain information and how to achieve them. The niche overlap between reindeer and both moose and red deer was low overall but occurred seasonally. Migratory red deer had a moderate niche overlap with the CWD-infected reindeer population during the calving period, whereas moose had a moderate niche overlap during both calving and winter. Incorporating both habitat overlap and the population densities of the respective species into the quantification of co-occurrence allowed for more spatially targeted risk maps. An initial aim of a 50% reduction in abundance for the Nordfjella region was set, but only a moderate population decrease of less than 20% from 2016 to 2021 was achieved. Proactive management in the form of marked population reduction is invasive and unpopular when involving species of high societal value, and targeting efforts to zones with a high risk of spillover to limit adverse impacts and achieve wider societal acceptance is important.

AB  - After the last glacial, the Carpathian Basin was repopulated from either eastward or northward colonisation routes for various species; one of these was the emblematic member of the European megafauna, the red deer, Cervus elaphus. We analysed 303 red deer individuals from the middle of the region, in seven Hungarian game reserves, at ten microsatellite loci (C01, C229, T26, T108, T123, T156, T172, T193, T501, T507), to investigate the genetic diversity of these subpopulations. We discovered high levels of genetic diversity of red deer subpopulations; allelic richness values ranging 4.99-7.01, observed heterozygosity 0.729-0.800, polymorphic information content 0.722-0.806, and Shannon's information index 1.668-2.064. Multi-locus analyses indicated population admixtures of various degrees that corresponded to geographical location, and complex genetic structures were shown by clustering. Populations in the south-western and the north-eastern parts of the region formed two highly separated groups, and the red deer from populations in between them were highly admixed (in western Pannonia/Transdanubia, where the Danube flows into the Carpathian Basin). This pattern corresponds to the distribution of mitochondrial as well as Y-chromosome lineages. Assignment tests showed that a large fraction of individuals (29.4%) are found outside of their population of origin, indicating that the dispersal of red deer is rather common, which could be expected considering the life course of the species.

AB  - Spatiotemporal variation in predation risk arises from interactions between landscape heterogeneity, predator densities and predator hunting mode, generating landscapes of fear for prey species that can have important effects on prey behaviour and ecosystem dynamics. As widespread apex predators, humans present a significant source of risk for hunted animal populations. Spatiotemporal patterns of risk from hunters can overlap or contrast with patterns of risk from other predators. Human infrastructure can also reshape spatial patterns of risk by facilitating or impeding hunter or predator movement, or deterring predators that are themselves wary of humans. We examined how anthropogenic and natural landscape features interact with hunting modes of rifle hunters and mountain lions Puma concolor to generate spatiotemporal patterns of risk for their primary prey. We explored the implications of human-modified landscapes of fear for Columbian black-tailed deer Odocoileus hemionus columbianus in Mendocino County, California. We used historical harvest records, hunter GPS trackers and camera trap records of mountain lions to model patterns of risk for deer. We then used camera traps to examine deer spatial and temporal activity patterns in response to this variation in risk. Hunters and mountain lions exhibited distinct, contrasting patterns of spatiotemporal activity. Risk from rifle hunters, who rely on long lines of sight, was highest in open grasslands and near roads and was confined to the daytime. Risk from mountain lions, an ambush predator, was highest in dense shrubland habitat, farther from developed areas, and during the night and crepuscular periods. Areas of human settlement provided a refuge from both hunters and mountain lions. We found no evidence that deer avoided risk in space at the scale of our observations, but deer adjusted their temporal activity patterns to reduce the risk of encounters with humans and mountain lions in areas of higher risk. Our study demonstrates that interactions between human infrastructure, habitat cover and predator hunting mode can result in distinct spatial patterns of predation risk from hunters and other predators that may lead to trade-offs for prey species. However, distinct diel activity patterns of predators may create vacant hunting domains that reduce costly trade-offs for prey. Our study highlights the importance of temporal partitioning as a mechanism of predation risk avoidance.

AB  - A list of coral reef fish species of Huaguang Reef was compiled in 2023 using hand fishing, diving fishing, underwater video, and eDNA detection, combined with historical data from 1979 and archival records from the South China Sea Fisheries Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Fisheries Sciences for the years of 1998, 1999, 2003, and 2005. Successional characteristics of coral reef fishes through time were also explored. The findings revealed: (1) A total of 299 coral reef fish species were identified in Huaguang Reef, categorized into 2 classes, 16 orders, and 56 families, with Perciformes exhibiting the highest species count (234), constituting 78.26% of all species. (2) In comparison to the period of 1979-2005, there was a reduction in the number of species at the order and family levels in 2023 at Huaguang Reef. Both the average taxonomic distinctness (Delta+) and the variation in taxonomic distinctness (Lambda+) exhibited a declining trend, indicating disturbances in the fish ecosystem. (3) The proportion of herbivorous fish at Huaguang Reef remained relatively stable in 2023 compared to the 1979-2005 period. Notably, the similarity coefficient of herbivorous fish was the highest among different feeding types, signifying a degraded state of the Huaguang Reef habitat. (4) In contrast to the 1979-2005 period, a significant decline was observed in large-sized and carnivorous fish species at Huaguang Reef in 2023. The low similarity coefficients for both categories, with undiscovered fish species accounting for 58.49% and 45.76% of their respective taxa in the total list, respectively, suggested a notable impact of overfishing on coral reef fishes. The succession patterns revealed in this study provide a theoretical foundation for advancing the sustainable development of coral reef fish resources in the Xisha Islands and offer valuable insights for the protection and management of coral reef fishes.

AB  - Successful cumulative effects management is fundamental for conservation policy and practice. We investigated the application of a carrying capacity (CC) model as a cumulative effects management tool for bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis canadensis) in British Columbia, Canada, where CC is defined as the natural limit of a sustainable population that is set by the availability of resources in the environment. We estimated winter CC using forage availability across winter ranges, weighted by relative selection by sheep and a safe use factor, and divided by overwinter forage requirements to determine how many sheep the landscape can support. We explored application of our model to decision-making about new industrial projects or conservation activities in a cumulative effects context. Cumulative effects include both positive and negative contributions to animal populations and we simulated the potential positive outcomes of burning to increase bighorn sheep carrying capacity in our study area. Our results show that carefully planned conservation actions could generate a 5% increase in CC (i.e., from 493 to 519 sheep). Robust tools and scientific techniques that are capable of quantifying multiple impacts and conservation actions and that consider spatial processes over long temporal scales, such as the CC model presented, should be applied to help inform decisions about how to better manage cumulative habitat change and achieve conservation objectives.

AB  - In their article in this journal, "Regional impacts of agricultural land use history on forest vegetation and soils: Comparing primary and post-agricultural forests in Northern New Jersey", Kelly and Ray (2023) present on page 3 these white-tailed deer density estimates for New Jersey: "historic low densities (<= 3.9 deer/km2) to current high densities in New Jersey (>= 15 deer/km2)." These density estimates are not adequately sourced and not consistent with the density estimates presented in this correspondence. Their statement suggests that the current average deer density is at minimum nearly four times (3.85) the "historic" level. Use of the term "historic" is somewhat confusing because the authors are referring to the deer density of 1948-1973. Typically, the term refers to precontact, pre-settlement, or precolonial. One of the authors suggests in an article referenced in this article that the 1948-1973 New Jersey deer density is comparable with average densities for the precolonial period. However, the New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station estimated that typical pre-settlement deer habitat could support 15-21 deer per square mile (5.8-8.1 deer/km2). This correspondence provides sources for relevant data and a discussion of the "historic" Kelly and Ray (2023) data. Analysis of this data suggests that the statement in their article could be restated as ranging from historic, precolonial densities at the high end of around 8.1 deer/km2 to recent densities of around 11 deer/km2 in 2018 and as 8.3 deer/km2 in 2015. Instead of asserting that the current average New Jersey deer density is at minimum almost four times the historic density, it could be asserted based on this analysis that a recent New Jersey average deer density was roughly near the high end of the historic pre-settlement estimated density when primary forests prevailed. Similarly, using the precolonial estimate from a paper referenced by one of these authors, the recent United States white-tailed deer population is in the range of precolonial estimates.

AB  - Crown shapes of common European urban tree species differ from tree species to tree species and are modified by the age of a tree and its local environment. A tree's crown shape has a great influence on the crown volume and thus on the ecosystem service provision of a tree such as the shade area or the shade density. We used the data of 3852 tree individuals from eight German cities and the crown shape data of 528 trees for the species Acer platanoides, Acer pseudoplatanus, Aesculus hippocastanum, Fraxinus excelsior, Platanus x acerifolia, Robinia pseudoacacia and Tilia cordata to analyze tree structural dimensions and the crown volume and shade dependency on a tree's crown shapes. Ovoid (57% of all tree individuals) and spherical (24%) crown shapes were mostly observed. However, columnar shape was observed for light-demanding R. pseudoacacia in close proximity of objects. The greatest shade areas were measured for spherical shape and the highest shade density for ovoid shape. Logistic regression analysis showed significant effects of age and distance to objects on crown shapes. Significant probability of crown shapes was found for different tree species, e.g., A. hippocastanum strongly showed half-ellipsoid crown shapes.

AB  - Grotta Polesini is one of the most famous paleontological and archaeological sites of central Italy, which testifies to its human occupation during the Lateglacial. The site comprises a cave system where systematic excavation campaigns have been carried out since the 1950s. In 1974, 656 mammal remains were collected but never studied. This fossil collection is here described for the first time through taxonomic and stable isotope analyses of the enamel of selected mammal teeth. The aim is to reconstruct the paleoenvironmental and climatic conditions of the site and to offer new information on terrestrial ecosystems during the Lateglacial in central Italy. The faunal assemblage studied herein, in addition to other species reported in previous works, suggests cold climate conditions. We also describe a right radius of an adult individual of Homo sapiens, increasing the human fossil record of the site. Carbon isotope data point to a scenario dominated by C3 plants in open and dry habitats, such as grasslands and steppes, in accordance with the pollen data from central Italy. The oxygen isotope data suggest the use of water resources with a local origin, i.e. local precipitation and surface waters with a provenance from the nearby Apennine chain. The ecology of the taxa influenced the oxygen isotope values, especially in the case of semi-obligate to non-obligate drinker species.

AB  - Fishery bycatch is a serious threat to several protected, endangered, and threatened species (PETs), requiring urgent action to develop and implement conservation measures. This study performs an Ecological Risk Assessment for the Effects of Fishing (ERAEF) using a spatially and temporally Productivity-Susceptibility Analysis (PSA) to calculate the potential risk to great shearwaters (Ardenna gravis) from direct interaction with the metiers of the artisanal tuna fishing fleet at the Bay of Biscay (baitboats and trollers). The PSA incorporates productivity attributes based on the Fecundity Factor Index; and susceptibility attributes calculated from the species spatio-temporal abundance patterns obtained developing density surface models and distribution and intensity of fishing activity based on pooled Vessel Monitoring System and logbook data. The PSA shows an overall moderate risk to great shearwaters by the artisanal tuna fishery also revealing that baitboats are less risky than trollers (risk score of 3.12 +/- 0.09 and 2.70 +/- 0.05, respectively). Spatially, the likelihood of presence of high potential risk areas was associated with prey availability for both the PET and the commercial fish species. The systematic, repeatable, and standardized ERAEF followed in this study can be used to advice for ecosystem-based fisheries management to improve management measures for reducing bycatch of PETs around the world.

AB  - Many potential mechanisms promote species coexistence, but we know little about their relative importance. To compare multiple mechanisms, we modeled a two-trophic planktonic food web based on mechanistic species interactions and empirically measured species traits. We simulated thousands of possible communities under realistic and altered interaction strengths to assess the relative importance of three potential drivers of phytoplankton and zooplankton species richness: resource-mediated coexistence mechanisms, predator-prey interactions, and trait trade-offs. Next, we computed niche and fitness differences of competing zooplankton to obtain a deeper understanding of how these mechanisms determine species richness. We found that predator-prey interactions were the most important driver of phytoplankton and zooplankton species richness and that large zooplankton fitness differences were associated with low species richness, but zooplankton niche differences were not associated with species richness. However, for many communities we could not apply modern coexistence theory to compute niche and fitness differences of zooplankton because of conceptual issues with the invasion growth rates arising from trophic interactions. We therefore need to expand modern coexistence theory to fully investigate multitrophic-level communities.

AB  - Models of population dynamics are a central piece for harvest management, allowing managers to evaluate alternative strategies and to identify uncertainty. Here we present a density-dependent population dynamics model that can be used in conjunction with adaptive management to optimize big game management, designed to use data commonly collected by state and provincial wildlife agencies. We review a case study for white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in North Dakota, USA, where we evaluate how harvest composition and monitoring frequency affect the maximum sustainable yield (MSY). Data were obtained from winter aerial surveys and hunter questionnaires over six years between 2009 and 2019. Harvest composition moderately skewed towards antlered individuals (37.5% antlerless deer and 62.5% antlered deer, i.e., antlerless:antlered harvest ratio = 0.6) resulted in a harvest rate of 0.2, which translates to a long-term harvest that is more than double that obtained if the harvest composition matched the population composition. However, given environmental uncertainty, we recommend that managers adopt a harvest strategy that is at least 10-15% lower than the maximum sustainable yield to buffer against environmental variability. Despite the fact that contrasting monitoring schemes resulted in similar optimal harvest rates, we illustrated how adopting an adaptive harvest strategy (i.e., where harvests change with population size) affords lower risks of overexploitation than a static strategy in which populations are assessed only occasionally. An adaptive harvest strategy features resilience allowing harvested populations to return to equilibrium even after substantial perturbation events. (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Moult, the process of replacing old feathers with new, is a critical event in the annual cycle of all bird species. In the Curonian Lagoon, situated in the south-eastern Baltic Sea, recreational activities and shipping lanes occur in close proximity to the staging areas of waterfowl. Knowledge on the habitat use of these birds however is scant. In this study, we combined visual observations, satellite telemetry and the distribution of macrophytes to study habitat use by moulting herbivorous mute swans (Cygnus olor) and analysed how the localities of the swans depended on the distribution of macrophyte habitats and anthropogenic activities. Our data highlighted the most important swan staging areas within the Lithuanian part of the Curonian Lagoon, this specifically being mostly shallow areas (<1-metre depth) with diverse and high-density coverage of submerged vegetation dominated by charophytes and pondweeds. The submerged macrophyte habitats in water depths of 1-2 m and stands of clasping-leaf pondweeds were considered less important for swans. Our results showed that mute swans exploited only half the most suitable habitat areas for feeding. Based on indirect assessment of the relationship between the abundance of swans and disturbance by kitesurfing and boating, we discuss possible impacts on their moulting grounds. Knowledge on both selection of moulting grounds and habitat use by waterbirds is necessary for effective management and biodiversity conservation.

AB  - The grass carp is one of the most important herbivore consumers in aquatic ecosystems and plays key roles in controlling macrophyte abundance. To assess the trophic role of grass carp and their potential grazing pressure on macrophytes in their native range, we quantified their relative abundance (RA), diet composition and trophic niches in two major tributaries and the central delta of the Pearl River using a fish capture survey, high-throughput analysis of the 18S rDNA sequences of their gut contents, and stable isotope analysis. The grass carp RA variation among the sampling regions was explained most by river discharge range. The RA was the highest in the West River with high discharge range, and the lowest in the central delta with low discharge range. The grass carp fed primarily on Streptophyta (relative read abundance: 0.40 +/- 0.33) and facultatively on Arthropoda, Rotifera, Ascomycota, and Chlorophyta. The Streptophyta proportion increased from the tributaries to the central delta. Such variation contributed most to the dietary difference among regions. Grass carp belonged to the second trophic level. The position and size of isotopic niche of grass carp differed among regions, and their niche breadth decreased from the tributaries to the central delta, as indicated by the corrected standard ellipse areas (SEAs) and the Bayesian SEAs. The regional differences in hydrological regime and grass carp RA probably affected the macrophyte distribution. The availability of macrophytes likely further contributed to the regional difference in the Streptophyta proportion in grass carp diet.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the influence of different production ecosystems, three in native and cultivated pastures (extensive), at two seasons of the year (dry and rainy), and one in confinement (intensive) in the Eastern Amazon, on the mineral content of buffalo liver raised on these ecosystems. Twelve male buffalo (n = 12), aged between 24 and 36 months, slaughtered in commercial slaughterhouses, were used in each of the ecosystems considered: Marajo; Lower Amazon; Cultivated Pasture, and in confinement system, Para, Brazil. Approximately 5 g of liver was collected, stored and frozen until lyophilization. Samples were analyzed for mineral content based on inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICPOES) readings. The relationship between extensive ecosystems and an intensive production system (p < 0.05) in the values of potassium (K), iron (Fe), copper (Cu), manganese (Mn) and barium (Ba) was evaluated. The different ecosystems studied influenced (p < 0.05) the mineral values found in the liver of buffaloes raised in the ecosystems, for sodium (Na), K, calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), sulfur (S), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn) and barium (Ba). The period of the year interacted with the values of Na, K, S and Cu; however, an interaction of local vs. period of the yer was observed for the values of K, Mg, P, S and Cu. It can be concluded that the buffalo liver is an excellent source of minerals and can be included in the human diet and that the ecosystem the animals are raised influences its content.

AB  - Agricultural expansion and overgrazing are globally recognized as key contributors to accelerated soil degradation and surface erosion, with direct consequences for land productivity, and environmental health. Measured impacts of livestock grazing on soil physical properties and ground cover are absent in soil loss models (e.g., Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation, RUSLE) despite significant impacts to surface erosion. We developed a novel model that captures changes to ground cover and soil properties (permeability and structure) as a function of grazing intensity (density, duration, history, and stock type), as well as soil clay and water contents. The model outputs were integrated within RUSLE to calculate a treaded soil erodibility (Ktr) and grazed cover factors (Cgr) at seasonal timescales (3-month windows) to account for variability in soil moisture content, grazing practices, vegetation growth and senescence, and rainfall. Grazed pastures and winter-forage paddocks exhibit distinct changes in soil erodibility and soil losses, which are most pronounced for wet soils when plant cover is reduced/ minimal. On average, typical pasture grazing pressures increase soil erodibility by 6% (range = 1?90%), compared to 60% (18?310%) for intensive winter forage paddocks. Further, negligible ground cover following forage crop grazing increases surface erosion by a factor of 10 (?31) relative to grazed pastures, which exhibit soil losses (? = 83 t km-2 yr- 1; range = 11.6 to 246) comparable to natural uncropped catchments (100?200 t km-2 yr- 1). Exacerbated soil losses from winter forage-crop paddocks (? = 1,100 t km-2 yr- 1) arose from significant degradation of soil physical properties and exposing soils directly to rainfall and runoff. We conclude that proactive decisions to reduce treading damage and avoid high-density grazing will far exceed reactive practices seeking to trap sediments lost from grazed lands.

AB  - Managing protected areas (PAs) requires measurable indicators to assess effectiveness. The status of populations and guilds of multiple species are potential indicators that should be useful in biodiversity-rich tropical countries. We quantified such indicators using data from an intensive camera trap survey of seven sites at the forestfarmland interface of Kerinci Seblat National Park, Sumatra, Indonesia. Surveys between 2014 and 2016 covered 671 camera locations set along habitat gradients comprising primary to degraded forest and lowland to sub-montane forest. We ran Bayesian multi-species occupancy models that incorporated landscape covariates and patrol intensity to generate four population parameters: relative abundance, probability of habitat use, species richness and detection probability. Model-derived beta coefficients summarized at the guild-level were extrapolated using detailed spatially-explicit data on landscape covariates to produce multi-guild occurrence maps to explore the role of habitats in supporting multiple overlapping functional groups. From 55,856 trap nights, we recorded 33 species from six guilds: carnivores; frugivores; granivores; herbivores; insectivores; and omnivores. All guilds were negatively correlated with elevation and positively correlated with primary forest. Five areas with high multi-guild overlap were identified and recommended for increased protection and other conservation measures, such as increasing the frequency of SMART patrols. Our data-driven guild-level approach for improving conservation practice has high relevance to other biodiversity-rich countries. Further utility of this guild approach, with potential future refinement and improvement, should greatly assist PA managers with improving area-based conservation effectiveness, such as higher patrol frequencies and or prioritizing wildlife, and habitat and ecosystem inventory, under-pinned by enhanced research, and cost-efficient budget allocation.

AB  - Mycobacterium bovis, a member of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC) and non-tuberculous Mycobacteria (NTM), may infect wild and domestic mammals, including humans. Although cattle are the main hosts and spreaders of M. bovis, many wildlife hosts play an important role worldwide. In Argentina, wild boar and domestic pigs are considered important links in mammalian tuberculosis (mTB) transmission. The aim of this work was to investigate the presence of M. bovis in wild pigs from different regions of Argentina, to characterize isolates of M. bovis obtained, and to compare those with other previously found in vertebrate hosts. A total of 311 samples from wild pigs were obtained, and bacteriological culture, molecular identification and genotyping were performed, obtaining 63 isolates (34 MTC and 29 NTM). Twelve M. bovis spoligotypes were detected. Our findings suggest that wild pigs have a prominent role as reservoirs of mTB in Argentina, based on an estimated prevalence of 11.2 +/- 1.8% (95% CI 8.0-14.8) for MTC and the frequency distribution of spoligotypes shared by cattle (75%), domestic pigs (58%) and wildlife (50%). Argentina has a typical scenario where cattle and pigs are farm-raised extensively, sharing the environment with wildlife, creating conditions for effective transmission of mTB in the wildlife-livestock-human interface.

AB  - Tropical savannah ecosystems exhibit high biodiversity, encompassing a range of megafauna, including elephants, lions, ungulates, birds, and insects. While substantial research has been conducted on the ecological dynamics of eastern and southern African savannahs, West African savannahs, particularly within the semi-arid Sudanian and Sahelian biomes, remain understudied. This study assesses the spatial distribution and habitat utilization of 15 large mammal species (mostly ungulates but also three primates and the elephant Loxodonta africana) in Comoe<acute accent>-Le<acute accent>raba National Park, southwestern Burkina Faso, over the period 2010-2018. Data collection employed line transect surveys to estimate ungulate populations, while the Minimum Convex Polygon (MCP) method quantified interannual variations in species occupancy. General Linear Models (GLM) assessed the effects of time and species identity on minimum occupied area. Results indicated no significant temporal variation in species distribution; however, species-specific effects suggested differential habitat preferences. Despite overall spatial stability, variations in poaching indices may have influenced localized species persistence. The reappearance of Loxodonta africana in 2018 underscores the necessity of protecting water-associated habitats and maintaining ecological connectivity. Findings emphasise the need for targeted conservation strategies to sustain biodiversity and mitigate anthropogenic pressures in West African savannahs.

AB  - Legume crops such as faba bean (Vicia faba L.) have been underrepresented in conventional cropping systems in Europe for decades for economic reasons, even though faba bean is a native crop and suitable to diversify local cropping systems. While the environmental benefits that go along with faba bean cropping are well established, there is a gap of knowledge on the effects faba bean may have on biodiversity and associated ecosystem services, such as natural biocontrol in agricultural landscapes. The aim of the present field study was to quantify neighbourhood effects of faba bean on densities of vegetation- dwelling natural biocontrol agents and herbivores in adjacent winter wheat. Densities of predators, herbivores, parasitized aphids (mummies) and leaf damage by the cereal leaf beetle (CLB) were assessed by repeated visual counts in conventionally managed winter wheat crops. In winter wheat adjacent to faba bean, total predator density was higher than in wheat adjacent to winter wheat, independent of the observation period. This effect was not reflected in the predator-prey ratio though. The total density of mummies and parasitism rate were not affected by the neighbouring faba bean crop. Predator density decreased towards the field centre. CLB leaf damage and yield were not affected by the neighbouring crop. All densities were affected by the observation period. The effects were measurable in spite of the external management such as insecticide application, which had a negative effect on both predator and herbivore densities. The present study sheds first light on faba bean effects on natural biocontrol agents in conventionally managed agro-ecosystems. While few, effects were measurable, which shows the need for further research on the association of faba bean cropping with the ecosystem service natural biocontrol.

AB  - The Saiga antelope (Saiga tatarica) is one of the few megafauna species from the mammoth steppe still living today. Currently, saiga are classified as critically endangered, persisting only in small areas of Central Asian steppe and desert ecosystems. The species is divided into two subspecies: Saiga tatarica mongolica and Saiga tatarica tatarica. In this study, we have for the first time characterized the genetic diversity of the Mongolian saiga (S. t. mongolica) using both mitochondrial DNA and microsatellite markers. We also analysed S. t. tatarica specimens in order to genetically compare both subspecies. The mitochondrial control region was sequenced for a total of 89 individuals: 20 skin, 53 umbilical cord, three placentae and a muscle sample from S. t. mongolica, and a total of 12 hair samples from S. t. tatarica. Additionally, 19 microsatellites developed for saiga antelope were also screened. Our results revealed that the Mongolian saiga presents very low genetic diversity at the mitochondrial level, with no shared mitochondrial haplotype between the two subspecies. Low genetic diversity is also present at the autosomal level, with most loci having low heterozygosity (Ho/He) and a low number of alleles per locus. Despite the low genetic diversity, we found no separation between the subpopulations in Mongolia, indicating that conservation corridors are actually promoting contact between different herds. Our results validate current conservation efforts and inform the implementation of new measures to increase the viability of the S. t. mongolica subspecies.

AB  - Understanding the spatio-temporal distribution of ungulates is important for effective wildlife management, particularly for economically and ecologically important species such as wild boar (Sus scrofa). Wild boars are generally considered to exhibit substantial behavioral flexibility, but it is unclear how their behavior varies across different conservation management regimes and levels of human pressure. To analyze if and how wild boars adjust their space use or their temporal niche, we surveyed wild boars across the core and buffer zones (collectively referred to as the conservation zone) and the transition zone of a biosphere reserve. These zones represent low and high levels of human pressure, respectively. Specifically, we employed a network of 53 camera traps distributed in the Schaalsee UNESCO Biosphere Reserve over a 14-month period (19,062 trap nights) and estimated circadian activity patterns, diel activity levels, and occupancy of wild boars in both zones. To account for differences in environmental conditions and day length, we estimated these parameters separately for seven 2-month periods. Our results showed that the wild boars were primarily nocturnal, with diurnal activity occurring dominantly during the summer months. The diel activity patterns in the two zones were very similar overall, although the wild boars were slightly less active in the transition zone than in the conservation zone. Diel activity levels also varied seasonally, ranging from 7.5 to 11.0 h day(-1), and scaled positively with the length of the night (R-2 = 0.66-0.67). Seasonal occupancy estimates were exceptionally high (point estimates ranged from 0.65 to 0.99) and similar across zones, suggesting that the wild boars used most of the biosphere reserve. Overall, this result suggests that different conservation management regimes (in this case, the zoning of a biosphere reserve) have little impact on wild boar behavior. This finding is relevant for wildlife management in protected areas where possibly high wild boar densities could interfere with conservation goals within these areas and those of agricultural land use in their vicinity.

AB  - 1. Conversion of land for settlements and agriculture is increasing globally and can influence wildlife space use. However, there is limited research to identify the thresholds of land-use change that incur wildlife avoidance and how these thresholds might vary across levels of selection.
   2. We evaluated multi-level avoidance thresholds of elk Cervus canadensis impacted by residential development and irrigated agriculture across the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem in Idaho, Montana and Wyoming. Using GPS data from 765 elk in 21 herds, we estimated habitat selection in relation to development and agriculture at three levels (home range selection, within home range selection and movement path selection). Next, using individual selection covariates and associated measures of land-use availability, we used functional-response models to evaluate how selection varied based on availability, and in turn, to estimate avoidance thresholds.
   3. We found individual and level-specific variation in elk responses to environmental factors. Elk exhibited stronger responses (either selection or avoidance) when selecting home range locations (i.e. second-order selection) than when selecting areas within home ranges (i.e. third-order selection) or selecting movement paths (i.e. fourth-order selection). Importantly, elk avoidance of development and agriculture changed as the amount of land in these categories changed. Across all levels of selection elk exhibited neutral selection for human development at low levels of availability (<1.1%-2.2% developed) but avoided areas that were >1.1%-2.2% developed. Conversely, elk selected positively for irrigated agriculture at low to moderate levels of availability (<52.0%-66.2% agriculture) but exhibited neutral selection in areas that were >52.0%-66.2% agriculture.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Elk avoidance of low levels of human development suggests conservation efforts such as restrictions on future development or conservation easements could focus on areas that are still below 2% developed. Additionally, because elk selection was strongest at the landscape scale, conservation actions that are based on information about the overall landscape structure may be most impactful. Our results highlight the importance of understanding variability in wildlife habitat selection at multiple levels, particularly in relation to land-use change, and highlight how functional response modelling can help inform landscape conservation.

AB  - Climate change is a mounting global issue, but its consequences will be variable across regions. Tropical species are hypothesized to have reduced climatic adaptability and plasticity. Yet, relative to temperate species, less is understood about how they will respond to climate change. Rising temperature and atmospheric CO2 could impact plant-herbivore systems directly by altering species traits or abundances, or the effects could be indirect by altering the strength and direction of the relationships that govern organismal strategies and interactions. Using open-top chambers in a Neotropical wet forest, we applied a full-factorial combination of active warming and CO2 fertilization to investigate the above-ground, short-term effects of climate change on plant-herbivore interactions in a common Neotropical shrub, Piper generalense. We aimed to answer two main questions: (1) Could climate change alter plant-herbivore systems through direct effects on plant growth rate, chemical defense, and/or insect herbivore damage rate? and (2) Could climate change affect plant-herbivore systems indirectly by altering (a) the strength of plant resource allocation trade-offs between growth and defense or (b) the effectiveness of plant chemical defense against herbivory? None of the microclimate treatments had direct effects on plant growth, chemical defense, or herbivore damage. However, we did observe a positive relationship between growth and chemical defense in treatments mimicking climate-change conditions, which partially supports the growth-differentiation balance hypothesis. We did not detect any effects of treatments on the effectiveness of plant chemical defense against herbivory. It appears that, in this system, increased CO2 concentration and temperature may cause indirect, cascading consequences, even where direct effects are not observable. We recommend more climate-change experiments addressing multi-trophic interactions that focus not only on the direct responses of organisms but also on the ways in which climate change can restructure the relationships that govern complex biotic systems.

AB  - This study examined the factors influencing wild boar population density in Slovakia from 2013 to 2023, focusing on biometeorological, demographic, and ecological variables. Linear regression models were used to analyze spring population figures and the number of hunted animals across eight self-governing regions. Following the African swine fever outbreak in 2019, population dynamics changed significantly. The number of wild boars hunted increased while population densities decreased, particularly in the Presov, Kosice, and Banska Bystrica regions. Biometeorological factors, including monthly air temperature and precipitation, significantly influenced wild boar density at the national level, with soil temperature at a 5 cm depth playing a key role regionally. Demographic factors, such as road network and human population densities, also impacted wild boar populations, with road network density being the most important. Ecological factors, including the presence of brown hares, common pheasants, and grey wolves, had varying effects across regions. Grey wolf predation and interspecies competition were particularly significant in mountainous, less urbanized areas. The joint influence of biometeorological and demographic factors was higher in regions affected by African swine fever. This study highlights the complex interactions between environmental, demographic, and ecological factors and provides insights into more effective wildlife management strategies aimed at the sustainable management of wild boar populations. It advocates for a regionally tailored, integrated approach that considers the influence of biometeorological, demographic, and ecological factors, while also addressing the risks associated with epidemics, such as African swine fever.

AB  - Biological invasions represent one of the main threats to biodiversity and a recognized economic burden worldwide; the issue has been included in the conservation agenda such as the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). Brazil is a signatory country of the CBD; however, the number of alien species records in its territory is continuously rising. To evaluate the invasive alien species (IAS) policy in Brazil, we reviewed the legislation delineating historical trends to identify potential gaps and avenues for improvement. We consulted several websites using keywords related to invasions in order to track legal instruments such as laws, decrees and regulations. We classified the documents regarding their main aims with regard to IAS, taxon and environment of interest. We found 85 legal instruments in force related to IAS published in the federal sphere up to October 2021, with decrees being the most common type. Most documents were classified as 'control' and 'prevention' and were related to all taxa and environments. Two species (wild boar Sus scrofa and golden mussel Limnoperna fortunei) have more specific legislation, probably due to their conspicuous economic impacts. We discuss policy gaps and their implications for the efficient management and prevention of new IAS introductions to the country.

AB  - ContextCarnivores influence the spatial heterogeneity of biogeochemical processes in ecological communities through predation and the deposition of animal carcasses, and these processes may lead to positive feedback loops that influence large-scale patterns of nutrient cycling.ObjectivesWe assessed whether ambush predator foraging impacted soil chemistry and plant forage quality, and then scaled these effects to the landscape to assess whether carnivores contribute to heterogeneity in resource distributions.MethodsWe measured total nitrogen (N) and N stable isotope composition (delta N-15) of soils and plants at 172 ungulate carcasses killed by mountain lions in the Yellowstone Ecosystem, USA. We measured kill rates and estimated the probability of a mountain lion foraging in any location to scale their carrion contributions to the landscape.ResultsCarcasses altered total nitrogen N and delta N-15 of soils and plants, and changes in delta N-15 suggested that plants absorbed significant N from carcasses. On average, plant delta N-15 at kill sites increased by 2.3 milles (parts per thousand), which is large compared to the 6.3 parts per thousand range of variation in local plants across xeric and mesic systems. We conservatively estimated that resident mountain lions in our study area annually contributed the carrion mass of a blue whale, or 44.1 kg of carrion and 1.4 kg of N per km(2). We also determined that mountain lion foraging was concentrated in just 4% of our study system.ConclusionsAmbush carnivore foraging may contribute to landscape-scale heterogeneity in nutrient distributions, and set the stage for positive feedback loops between carnivores and prey that drive biogeochemical processes.

AB  - Secondary forests are increasingly important components of human-modified landscapes in the tropics. Successional pathways, however, can vary enormously across and within landscapes, with divergent regrowth rates, vegetation structure and species composition. While climatic and edaphic conditions drive variations across regions, land-use history plays a central role in driving alternative successional pathways within human-modified landscapes. How land use affects succession depends on its intensity, spatial extent, frequency, duration and management practices, and is mediated by a complex combination of mechanisms acting on different ecosystem components and at different spatial and temporal scales. We review the literature aiming to provide a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying the long-lasting effects of land use on tropical forest succession and to discuss its implications for forest restoration. We organize it following a framework based on the hierarchical model of succession and ecological filtering theory. This review shows that our knowledge is mostly derived from studies in Neotropical forests regenerating after abandonment of shifting cultivation or pasture systems. Vegetation is the ecological component assessed most often. Little is known regarding how the recovery of belowground processes and microbiota communities is affected by previous land-use history. In published studies, land-use history has been mostly characterized by type, without discrimination of intensity, extent, duration or frequency. We compile and discuss the metrics used to describe land-use history, aiming to facilitate future studies. The literature shows that (i) species availability to succession is affected by transformations in the landscape that affect dispersal, and by management practices and seed predation, which affect the composition and diversity of propagules on site. Once a species successfully reaches an abandoned field, its establishment and performance are dependent on resistance to management practices, tolerance to (modified) soil conditions, herbivory, competition with weeds and invasive species, and facilitation by remnant trees. (ii) Structural and compositional divergences at early stages of succession remain for decades, suggesting that early communities play an important role in governing further ecosystem functioning and processes during succession. Management interventions at early stages could help enhance recovery rates and manipulate successional pathways. (iii) The combination of local and landscape conditions defines the limitations to succession and therefore the potential for natural regeneration to restore ecosystem properties effectively. The knowledge summarized here could enable the identification of conditions in which natural regeneration could efficiently promote forest restoration, and where specific management practices are required to foster succession. Finally, characterization of the landscape context and previous land-use history is essential to understand the limitations to succession and therefore to define cost-effective restoration strategies. Advancing knowledge on these two aspects is key for finding generalizable relations that will increase the predictability of succession and the efficiency of forest restoration under different landscape contexts.

AB  - Catastrophic losses (ca. 95%) of seagrass and increased environmental degradation have occurred during the past decade in the Indian River Lagoon (IRL) estuary on the US Atlantic coast of Florida. Changes were observed in the abundance of 2 closely related sparid fishes in these estuarine waters based on fishery-independent monitoring efforts over 22 yr: sea bream Archosargus rhomboidalis significantly increased, while sheepshead A. probatocephalus simultaneously declined. These abundance trends and a northward expansion of sea bream into areas where they had never been documented were associated with an annual minimum water temperature increase of approximately 1.5 degrees C, an annual mean water temperature increase of 0.9 degrees C, and an annual mean salinity increase of 7.6 ppt. Lost seagrass habitat was often replaced by species belonging to the attached macroalgae genus Caulerpa or remained bare. Our findings suggest that sea bream, a tropical herbivore, are expanding poleward into the northern IRL, which may further negatively impact the potential recovery of sheepshead populations via competition. Furthermore, observed declines in seagrasses and populations of dependent species, including sheepshead, will likely continue if anthropogenic perturbations persist or expand. Long-term monitoring is essential for the timely detection of population changes and range shifts to better refine direct fisheries management of existing species and determine the potential need for management of recently expanding fish species should new fisheries emerge. Effective monitoring also allows for more proactive restoration of critical habitats and water conditions to minimize further adverse effects on fishes and other estuarine biota.

AB  - Many infectious pathogens are shared through social interactions, and examining host connectivity has offered valuable insights for understanding patterns of pathogen transmission across wildlife species. African buffalo are social ungulates and important reservoirs of directly-transmitted pathogens that impact numerous wildlife and livestock species. Here, we analyzed African buffalo social networks to quantify variation in close contacts, examined drivers of contact heterogeneity, and investigated how the observed contact patterns affect pathogen invasion likelihoods for a wild social ungulate. We collected continuous association data using proximity collars and sampled host traits approximately every 2 months during a 15-month study period in Kruger National Park, South Africa. Although the observed herd was well connected, with most individuals contacting each other during each bimonthly interval, our analyses revealed striking heterogeneity in close-contact associations among herd members. Network analysis showed that individual connectivity was stable over time and that individual age, sex, reproductive status, and pairwise genetic relatedness were important predictors of buffalo connectivity. Calves were the most connected members of the herd, and adult males were the least connected. These findings highlight the role susceptible calves may play in the transmission of pathogens within the herd. We also demonstrate that, at time scales relevant to infectious pathogens found in nature, the observed level of connectivity affects pathogen invasion likelihoods for a wide range of infectious periods and transmissibilities. Ultimately, our study identifies key predictors of social connectivity in a social ungulate and illustrates how contact heterogeneity, even within a highly connected herd, can shape pathogen invasion likelihoods.

AB  - Group living confers crucial survival and reproductive advantages for individuals, with group size, composition and resource availability affecting individual fitness, sociality and behaviour. Both sociodemographic and anthropogenic factors influence behaviour. For example, social organization and individual characteristics shape time budgets and affect the distribution of affiliative and aggressive interactions. Cattle, Bos taurus, are social ungulates, but the majority of cattle research is conducted on farms and may not be an accurate representation of their more naturalistic social structures. We investigated the relationships between sociodemographic factors (sex, dominance and group size), anthropogenic factors (supplementary provisioning) and social behaviours in free-ranging, feral cattle. We analysed social relationships (dominance, affiliation, aggression and global social network values) for cattle living in five mixed-sex groups (ranging from 9 to 63 animals per group). We found that more dominant cattle had more affiliative partners, performed allogrooming for longer and performed more affiliation. Females received more affiliation than males and males directed affiliation preferentially towards females, with 258 male-to-female interactions and 145 male-to-male interactions. Females performed less aggression in larger groups, and animals in provisioned groups received more aggression. Our results indicate that cattle group social organization has important sex-specific effects on its members. These social dynamics highlight the importance of understanding the distribution of interactions in mixed-sex groups and how sociodemographic factors can asymmetrically influence behaviour.

AB  - Livestock depredation is the primary driver of wolf-human conflict worldwide, threatening wolf conservation and impacting human livelihoods. Most countries implement relevant compensation programs, which are however rarely accompanied by proactive husbandry practices vetted with scientific research. We investigated the influence of husbandry practices on wolf depredation losses for 70 sheep/goat and 68 cattle herds with quantitative modeling of data from semi-structured interviews of livestock farmers along a livestock damage gradient in NW Greece. Sheep/goat herds were better protected than cattle herds in seven preventive measures and annual losses of sheep/goat livestock units were three times lower than losses of cattle livestock units in our study area. Furthermore, according to national compensation data from Greece, costs paid for cattle have doubled in recent years, whereas they have been cut in half for sheep/goats. Our modeling identified three core preventive measures that significantly reduced wolf depredation risk for both herd types, namely increased shepherd surveillance, systematic night confinement, and an adequate number of livestock guardian dogs (optimal ratio was 3 Greek guardian dogs per 100 sheep/goats and 7 guardian dogs per 100 cattle). Keeping young livestock in enclosures and not abandoning livestock carcasses in pastures were additional effective preventive measures for cattle herds. Our study provides evidence to inform the subsidizing policy put forth in the Common Agricultural Policy of the European Union. It can also serve to inform or revise wildlife-livestock conflict mitigation policy in countries challenged with the competing goals of conserving large carnivores while maintaining traditional grazing regimes.

AB  - Aim An increasing number of exotic plants and their biological control agents are being introduced into new regions. Therefore, it is necessary to study their interactions and to manage the future directions of plant invasions under different scenarios of temperature rise. Location China. Method We investigated the distribution patterns of the two most prevalent invasive aquatic plants in the world, Alternanthera philoxeroides and Eichhornia crassipes, at a large scale and studied the interactions of both invasive plants with their respective biological control agents, Agasicles hygrophila and Neochetina eichhorniae, in response to different scenarios of temperature rise. Results Both plants performed better in warmer climates in common garden experiments. However, large populations of A. philoxeroides occurred only in the temperate zone because this species experienced competitive exclusion from E. crassipes and suppression due to A. hygrophila herbivory in tropical and subtropical areas. Moreover, in both subtropical zones, where the two plants and A. hygrophila co-occur, and the temperate zone, where only A. philoxeroides occurs at present, A. hygrophila herbivory and the competition from E. crassipes hindered the performance of A. philoxeroides. Moreover, in the extreme high-temperature environment, A. philoxeroides performance improved, while E. crassipes performance worsened. In addition, the combination of N. eichhorniae herbivory and competition from A. philoxeroides also reduced the performance of E. crassipes, but E. crassipes still dominated when in competition with A. philoxeroides. Main conclusions Our results indicate that climate warming and the introduction of herbivores do not alter the interspecific relationship between E. crassipes and A. philoxeroides. Moreover, our study suggests that under climate warming, E. crassipes will replace A. philoxeroides as the dominant species in some communities in warm temperate zones, though extremely high-temperature events will slow this replacement process.

AB  - Background: Heat stress (HS) presents significant challenges to water buffalo breeding, particularly in harsh environments like southern Iraq. HS adversely impacts physiological and behavioral aspects in dairy buffaloes, leading to economic losses in productivity and welfare. Interventions such as acetaminophen and vitamin C supplementation have been suggested to alleviate HS impacts due to their anti -stress and anti-inflammatory characteristics. Methods: This study was conducted in Al-Chibayish Marshes southern Iraq and aimed to evaluate the effects of acetaminophen and vitamin C combination (AVC) on heat -stressed dairy buffalo. Sixteen lactating buffaloes were divided into four treatments. One treatment received regular water (control), while other treatments were given water mixed with AVC at a dose of 500g/1000 liters for 3, 5, and 7 consecutive days per week, respectively, over 30 days. Environmental (temperature, humidity, and THI) and physiological data (body temperature, respiration rate, and pulse rate) were recorded daily, while feed and water consumption were recorded weekly. Results : Buffaloes experienced significant HS, with temperatures reaching up to 53.2 degrees C and corresponding THI values ranging from 88.05 to 99.31. AVC administration for 5 consecutive days led to increased feed intake by 1.15 kg daily per treatment and decreased water consumption by 16.43 liters daily per treatment compared to the control. Additionally, rectal temperature, respiration rate, and heart rate showed progressive improvement during the second and third weeks, with the most notable improvement observed in the fourth week of the study. These improvements in vital signs and behavioral traits indicate the ability of AVC to improve thermoregulation and reduce heat stress impact. Conclusion : The investigation highlights the potential of AVC supplementation showing a promise in alleviating HS effects on dairy buffaloes by positively influencing physiological and behavioral parameters. Further research is needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and optimize supplementation strategies for enhancing buffalo welfare and productivity under heat stress.

AB  - Global climate changes are affecting organisms and their interactions in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, such as the increase in temperature and CO2 concentration. Herbivory interaction is a very important part of nutrient cycle and energy flow in freshwater ecosystem, and climate changes may directly or indirectly affect aquatic plants, aquatic herbivores and their interactions. In this study, we explored the effects of the rising temperature, elevated CO2 concentrations and herbivory by an herbivorous snail (Radix auricularia L.) on a submerged plant (Vallisneria natans L.). Our results showed that herbivory, temperature, and CO2 had specific effects on snail and plant growth, statistically there was only one interaction-a reduction in leaf number. Under different experimental conditions, snail herbivory always has negative effects on biomass accumulation and growth of V. natans. Moreover, the increases in temperature also inhibited its growth. Snail herbivory reduced the content of total carbon and total nitrogen of V. natans in all treatments, while the total phenols content increased. Our findings indicate that the rising temperature, elevated CO2 concentrations and herbivory have interactive effects on the growth and stoichiometry of submerged macrophytes, but further research is needed between aquatic plants and aquatic herbivores to aid prediction the impact of climate change on freshwater ecosystems.

AB  - The largest remaining populations of the endangered huemul deer (Hippocamelus bisulcus) are believed to be concentrated in the remote, rugged and largely uninhabited glacial valleys and fjords surrounding the Southern Patagonian Ice Field that lie within Chile's Bernardo O'Higgins National Park. On the Park's northwestern edge is Bernardo Fjord, an area home to the world's largest known breeding population of huemul. We present a demographic study of this population and examine its population trends since 2004. We conducted huemul transect surveys on-foot during 16 expeditions to Bernardo Fjord from October 2014 to March 2020, during which we spent a total of 254 days in the field and documented 284 observations of huemul. This coastal population of huemul exhibited higher female proportions (mean 0.64 +/- SD 0.05), lower fawn:female ratios (mean 0.18 +/- SD 0.23 in March and mean 0.22 +/- SD 0.07 in November), and similar group sizes (mean 1.77 +/- 1.06 SD individuals) to previous studies. Huemul densities in Bernardo Valley encountered from 2016 to 2019 were 60% lower than densities observed in a previous study from 2004 to 2008. We produce a 2019 huemul population estimate for Bernardo Fjord of 84 (+/- SD 7) individuals including 44 observed individuals and 40 (+/- SD 10) individuals estimated to be undetected by our surveys, which comprises 6-8% of the IUCN global population estimate. Two of the surveyed sectors - Bernardo Valley and Pampa - are of critical conservation importance, given that the 5 km(2) Pampa is home to 42% of the total huemul population and 41% of the fawn population of Bernardo Fjord. We examine potential drivers of this population decline, which may include poor recruitment, predation and high incidences of foot disease exacerbated by climatic conditions, and we offer recommendations for the conservation, monitoring and management of this and other coastal huemul populations.

AB  - Hosting 1460 plant and 126 vertebrate endemic species, the Great Escarpment (hereafter, Escarpment) forms a semi-circular "amphitheater" of mountains girdling southern Africa from arid west to temperate east. Since arid and temperate biota are usually studied separately, earlier studies overlooked the biogeographical importance of the Escarpment as a whole. Bats disperse more widely than other mammalian taxa, with related species and intraspecific lineages occupying both arid and temperate highlands of the Escarpment, providing an excellent model to address this knowledge gap. We investigated patterns of speciation and micro-endemism from modeled past, present, and future distributions in six clades of southern African bats from three families (Rhinolophidae, Cistugidae, and Vespertilionidae) having different crown ages (Pleistocene to Miocene) and biome affiliations (temperate to arid). We estimated mtDNA relaxed clock dates of key divergence events across the six clades in relation both to biogeographical features and patterns of phenotypic variation in crania, bacula and echolocation calls. In horseshoe bats (Rhinolophidae), both the western and eastern "arms" of the Escarpment have facilitated dispersals from the Afrotropics into southern Africa. Pleistocene and pre-Pleistocene "species pumps" and temperate refugia explained observed patterns of speciation, intraspecific divergence and, in two cases, mtDNA introgression. The Maloti-Drakensberg is a center of micro-endemism for bats, housing three newly described or undescribed species. Vicariance across biogeographic barriers gave rise to 29 micro-endemic species and intraspecific lineages whose distributions were congruent with those identified in other phytogeographic and zoogeographic studies. Although K & ouml;ppen-Geiger climate models predict a widespread replacement of current temperate ecosystems in southern Africa by tropical or arid ecosystems by 2070-2100, future climate Maxent models for 13 bat species (all but one of those analyzed above) showed minimal range changes in temperate species from the eastern Escarpment by 2070, possibly due to the buffering effect of mountains to climate change.
   Climatic variation over space and time has shaped the evolution of different groups of mountain-associated bats across the Great Escarpment of southern Africa, leading to species and intraspecific lineages whose distributions are closely associated with different biomes and biogeographic features. At least three new species have recently been described or await formal taxonomic description. Notwithstanding the effect of habitat loss and degradation, future climate models show that the eastern Escarpment of southern Africa may act as an important buffer against climate change for mountain bats.image

AB  - Herbivore-plant interactions are fundamental processes shaping ecosystems, yet their study is challenged by their complex connections within broader ecosystem processes, requiring a nuanced understanding of ecosystem dynamics. This study investigated the relationship between nutrient availability and insect herbivory in the Australian Wet Tropics. Our objectives were threefold. Firstly, to understand what factors influence nutrient availability for plants and herbivores across the landscape; secondly, to investigate how trees of different species respond to nutrient availability; and thirdly, to unravel how the relationships between resources and plant chemistry affect herbivory. We established a network of 25 study sites covering important abiotic gradients, including temperature, precipitation, and geology. Employing a hierarchical modelling approach, we assessed the influence of climate and geology on resource availability for plants, primarily in the form of soil nutrients. Then, we explored the influence of the above factors on the interaction between herbivory and foliage chemistry across three widespread rainforest tree species, comparing how these relationships emerged across genera. Our findings suggest an overarching influence of climate and geology over soil chemistry, foliar nitrogen, and insect herbivory, both directly and indirectly. However, individual constituents of soil fertility showed equivocal influences on spatial patterns of foliage chemistry once site geological origin was accounted for, suggesting a questionable relationship between individual soil nutrients and foliar composition. We have demonstrated that herbivore-plant interactions are complex dynamics regulated by an intricate web of relationships spanning different biogeochemical processes. While our results provide some support to the notion that herbivory is affected by resource availability, different species growing under the same conditions can show differing responses to the same resources, highlighting the importance of identifying specific limiting factors rather than simpler proxies of resource availability.

AB  - Preventing invasion of exotic species into urban forests is important for sustaining native species diversity. In Japan, Ligustrum lucidum, an invasive tree, has become widespread in urban areas. Here, we investigated the spread of L. lucidum in a semi-natural, urban shrine forest to infer which native species' preferred habitats may be affected. L. lucidum was most abundant near the artificially created forest edge where canopy trees are pruned regularly. Spatial distribution of L. lucidum overlapped with those of two native species (Cinnamomum japonicum, Quercus glauca), but was segregated from the other three native species. We also compared leaf functional traits between L. lucidum and the native species to infer functional niche overlap. L. lucidum exhibited greater plasticity of leaf functional traits compared to native species and its leaf functional traits were similar with Ci. japonicum, Ilex rotunda and Q. glauca, but not with Camelia japonica and Ternstroemia gymnanthera. Our results suggest that, currently, the preferred habitat and realized functional niche of L. lucidum overlaps with those of Ci. japonicum and Q. glauca. High plasticity of leaf functional traits contributing to shade tolerance may allow L. lucidum to expand its spatial distribution in this forest, affecting other native species in the future. Our results emphasize the importance of removing invasive species during early stages of invasion while their distribution is still relatively confined and negative effects on native species are limited.

AB  - Seagrass meadows are natural carbon storage hotspots at risk from global change threats, and their loss can result in the remineralization of soil carbon stocks and CO2 emissions fueling climate change. Here we used expert elicitation and empirical evidence to assess the risk of CO2 emissions from seagrass soils caused by multiple human-induced, biological and climate change threats. Judgments from 41 experts were synthesized into a seagrass CO2 emission risk score based on vulnerability factors (i.e., spatial scale, frequency, magnitude, resistance and recovery) to seagrass soil organic carbon stocks. Experts perceived that climate change threats (e.g., gradual ocean warming and increased storminess) have the highest risk for CO2 emissions at global spatial scales, while direct threats (i.e., dredging and building of a marina or jetty) have the largest CO2 emission risks at local spatial scales. A review of existing peer-reviewed literature showed a scarcity of studies assessing CO2 emissions following seagrass disturbance, but the limited empirical evidence partly confirmed the opinion of experts. The literature review indicated that direct and long-term disturbances have the greatest negative impact on soil carbon stocks per unit area, highlighting that immediate management actions after disturbances to recover the seagrass canopy can significantly reduce soil CO2 emissions. We conclude that further empirical evidence assessing global change threats on the seagrass carbon sink capacity is required to aid broader uptake of seagrass into blue carbon policy frameworks. The preliminary findings from this study can be used to estimate the potential risk of CO2 emissions from seagrass habitats under threat and guide nature-based solutions for climate change mitigation.

AB  - As impacts on the Mediterranean Sea are expected to grow in the future, especially with climate change, habitat degradation, and displacement of native species by non-indigenous species (NIS), the investigation of significant alterations to trophic levels in this diverse marine habitat is important. Analysis of stable isotopes from targeted consumers has previously been shown to reliably reflect that of primary producers, thus enabling us to describe and highlight potential shifts in the food web of a particular ecosystem. In this study, we used delta 13C values of essential amino acids (AA) in order to examine the dietary composition of established non-native, Lessepsian fish migrants in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea compared to that of the same fish species from their original population in the Gulf of Aqaba, Red Sea. Our data show that a clear variance in carbon isotopic signatures exists in food sources consumed by the same species between the different environments, with the exception of the classic herbivore, Siganus rivulatus (Forsskal & Niebuhr, 1775), whose very similar isotopic patterns reflect the algal source they predominantly consume in both locations. With the results of this research, we propose that Lessepsian fishes with the ability to maintain their nutritional patterns, though not necessarily that of their original food source, will acclimatize better in their new habitat. Consequences of flourishing Lessepsian fish populations include a further tropicalization of the Eastern Mediterranean Sea and the likely restructuring of local food webs.

AB  - Competition with livestock over forage resources has been identified as a potential threat to the survival of the African wild ass (Equus africanus) in the Danakil ecosystem (Eritrea). The Messir Plateau is an important breeding area for the African wild ass but also hosts cattle, sheep, goats, donkeys, and camels. Locations and fecal samples of African wild ass and livestock were collected in dry and rainfall months. Stable carbon isotopes [delta C-13 parts per thousand] in fecal samples were used to assess diet composition and overlaps with domestic herbivores. Fecal samples also were used to assess the nutritional quality of African wild ass and domestic donkey diets. During the dry months, African wild ass were concentrated in the northern section of the Messir Plateau, approximately 9 km from the permanent water source, and overlapped spatially with local livestock. During the rainfall months, African wild ass dispersed throughout the Messir Plateau (124 km(2)) when a high number of livestock, particularly cattle from the highlands with herders, were concentrated in the northern section. During the rainfall months, the northern section had relatively better vegetation cover and access to seasonal water. The grass contribution to the diet of the African wild ass in both dry and rainfall months overlapped significantly with that of domestic donkeys and cattle. In rainfall months, the percent fecal nitrogen and phosphorus contents of African wild ass were significantly lower than those of domestic donkey samples. The lower nutrient levels in fecal samples of African wild ass during rainfall months may be due to their displacement from the northern sector by the high number of immigrant highland cattle with people. Our work provides evidence as to how the presence of domestic herbivores, particularly cattle, may negatively impact the nutrient level of wild equids and threaten the survival of the critically endangered African wild ass.

AB  - Large Greenland sharks (Somniosus microcephalus) are captured as bycatch in northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis) bottom trawls by becoming stuck in the Nordm & oslash;re grid system. Grid systems do not easily exclude Greenland sharks due to their large size (up to 6 m in length). Thus, an additional or modified bycatch reduction device (BRD) should be considered to promote a quick escape. Two experimental BRD systems were designed and tested to facilitate the escape of large-sized Greenland sharks: 1) a large escape opening at the grid (increased from 113 to 250 cm) and 2) a sieve panel with a large escape opening before the traditional grid system. Catch rates (kg tow(-1)) and size selectivity were compared between the experimental and traditional treatments. Results for the large escape opening treatment versus the traditional gear showed no difference in northern shrimp catch rates (P-value = 0.237), however size selectivity was different between treatments (P-value = 0.033) with a slight reduction for large length sizes. Conversely, the catch rates of northern shrimp were significantly reduced for the sieve panel treatment (18% reduction; P-value < 0.001) but showed no difference in size selectivity (P-value = 0.388) across all length classes. No Greenland sharks were observed during sea trials, and total bycatch was minimal. In conclusion, the large escape opening showed promise as a technique to reduce megafauna bycatch, such as Greenland shark, by providing a large escape area while having minimal effects on northern shrimp catch. However, the sieve panel treatment, as tested, likely loses too much northern shrimp to be considered in the fishery.

AB  - Anthropogenic activities continue to degrade natural montane ecosystems globally. Bats communities are altered by these changes. We analyzed how bats are affected by human-induced habitat changes by comparing the bat species diversity and functional diversity in undisturbed forest habitats and disturbed forest habitats of the Afromontane biome of Cameroon. We recorded 244 individuals from 13 species in the undisturbed forest, while 233 individuals from 16 species were recorded in the disturbed forest. Bat diversity was higher in disturbed habitats (D = 0.84) than undisturbed habitats (D = 0.67). Jackknife 1 species richness estimator suggests 21.53 species for the disturbed forest and 19.30 in the undisturbed forest. Closed-space forager insectivorous bats made up nearly half of the species in the undisturbed forest, but this dropped to 25% in the disturbed forest, meanwhile, edge-space foragers increased in the disturbed forest. Bat community analyses by ordination revealed a distinct bat community composition between the two forest types, demonstrated as a significant difference in diversity between the two forest types. The distribution of Rousettus aegyptiacus, Myonycteris angolensis, Hipposideros cf. ruber, and Micropteropus pusillus contribute the most to the difference in bat community composition between the two forest types. Edge and open-space species were likely to benefit from additional resources provided by the disturbed area, by expanding their range and distribution. However, this may not compensate for the decline in the population of forest species caused by the loss of pristine forests, thus measures to conserve montane forest remnants should be of utmost significance.

AB  - Social interactions are fundamental properties of gregarious species, helping to establish dominance hierarchies and maintain social bonds within groups. Cattle, Bos taurus, are social ungulates which engage in affiliative and agonistic relationships with other individuals. Although there are approximately 1.5 billion cattle on the planet, the opportunity to research cattle behaviour in free-ranging groups is rare, as there are few feral populations worldwide. Cattle engage in positive social behaviours such as allogrooming, where one individual licks the body of another. The relationship between affiliative behaviours and other individual characteristics (such as sex and dominance status) are frequently studied in other gregarious species, but are largely undetermined in cattle. To investigate the relationships between sex, dominance status and allogrooming, we observed a mixed-sex feral cattle herd in Hong Kong, recording dominance interactions and allogrooming events. The hierarchy was linear and stable, consisting of 22 adult males and 33 adult females. We found that dominant females received more allogrooming than subordinate females, but subordinate females did not perform it more. Males performed allogrooming more towards females than other males, but females groomed both sexes equally. Sex affected dominance position, with males obtaining higher status than females, but not all females were subordinate to males. These preferential allogrooming patterns improve our knowledge of sex-specific interactions and help us to understand the dynamics of agonistic and affiliative behaviours in multimale, multifemale ungulate groups. Studying a free-ranging feral population provides us with a unique insight into ungulate behavioural patterns and the evolution of cattle social behaviours.

AB  - Sex-based differences in physiology, behaviour and demography commonly result in differences in disease prevalence. However, sex differences in prevalence may reflect exposure rather than transmission, which could affect disease control programmes. One potential example is chronic wasting disease (CWD), which has been observed at greater prevalence among male than female deer. We used an age- and sex-structured simulation model to explore harvest-based management of CWD under three different transmission scenarios that all generate higher male prevalence: (1) increased male susceptibility, (2) high male-to-male transmission or (3) high female-to-male transmission. Both female and male harvests were required to limit CWD epidemics across all transmission scenarios (approximated by R-0), though invasion was more likely under high female-to-male transmission. In simulations, heavily male-biased harvests controlled CWD epidemics and maintained large host populations under high male-to-male transmission and increased male susceptibility scenarios. However, male-biased harvests were ineffective under high female-to-male transmission. Instead, female-biased harvests were able to limit disease transmission under high female-to-male transmission but incurred a trade-off with smaller population sizes. Synthesis and applications. Higher disease prevalence in a sex or age group may be due to higher exposure or susceptibility but does not necessarily indicate if that group is responsible for more disease transmission. We showed that multiple processes can result in the pattern of higher male prevalence, but that population-level management interventions must focus on the sex responsible for disease transmission, not just those that are most exposed.

AB  - This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Nervilia nipponica Makino (mukago-saishin) that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the International Biological Flora: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to the environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history, conservation and global heterogeneity.
   Nervilia nipponica is a small, stoloniferous, seasonally dormant herb that grows in the understorey of evergreen forests in the humid subtropical zone of central and western Japan, with a few outlying populations on Jeju Island in South Korea. Its northern extent is defined by the 0 degrees C winter isotherm, and its occurrence is also limited by site aspect and incline. It is a weak competitor that occupies species-poor microsites in which bare ground and leaf litter predominate. Plant numbers tend to decline as percentage ground cover of surrounding understorey vegetation increases.
   The inflorescence sprouts from a short-lived, subterranean tuber in late spring and leaf-flush occurs after fruit-set. However, most tubers do not flower in any one annual growth cycle. Long-term monitoring of individually marked plants suggests that tubers are resource-limited and that flowering constrains future genet growth. Nervilia nipponica is exclusively autogamous and has a strong capacity for vegetative propagation. The species is genetically depauperate but exhibits significant differentiation between populations, which comprise clonal clusters in phalanx formation.
   The level of mycorrhizal infection differs between plant parts and through successive phenological stages. Stable isotope signatures indicate that the species is partially mycoheterotrophic, with fungal partners supporting growth particularly at lower light intensities. Despite this, falling light availability associated with forest succession can lead to population decline.
   Populations tend to be small and prone to extirpation, but the species is probably under-recorded as a result of its ephemeral emergence above-ground and inconspicuous habit. Management interventions likely to benefit the species at the site level include thinning dense forest canopy and removing encroaching ground cover.

AB  - Grassland plant diversity has been observed with divergent responses in grazing experiments around the world. However, the dominant role of nitrogen (N) availability in controlling this global variation has not been well explored, impeding our capacity to formulate effective strategies for preserving grassland plant diversity. Here, we synthesized data from 306 grazing experiments that measured plant diversity and soil N content across global grasslands. Overall, grazing reduced plant diversity by 7.63%, with substantial variations observed across the dataset. Our study revealed that these contrasting effects were best explained by soil N change. Plant diversity under enhanced soil N showed a strong increase in response to grazing. We found that lower grazing intensity and higher background N deposition could collectively enhance soil N, thereby promoting diversity. These results suggest that while avoiding high grazing intensity is crucial in maintaining biodiversity of grazed grasslands, it alone is not sufficient. In regions with lower N deposition (< 500 mg N m-2 yr-1), additional management strategies that target improving soil fertility are needed. Our analysis propounds that local environmental conditions should be incorporated into decision-making of grassland biodiversity conservation, or ignoring this may lead to counterproductive impacts.

AB  - Free-ranging cats are invasive species threatening biodiversity worldwide. They may also impose an environmental risk to humans and livestock through the transmission of zoonotic diseases. We investigated antibody levels against Toxoplasma gondii in free-ranging cats and black rats (definitive and representative intermediate hosts) by ELISA and determined their relationships with landscape environmental factors on Tokunoshima Island, Japan, the Natural World Heritage site. We found a higher seroprevalence (>70%) in both cats and black rats in landscapes where the cattle barn density was high. This was consistent with higher density of rats revealed in our trapping survey. The spatial scale of landscape factors affecting infection was broader in cats (1 km buffer radius) than in black rats (100 m buffer radius). Both cats and rats showed an increasing trend in optical density (OD) values with increasing body weight and landscape cattle barn density, suggesting that the antibody concentration increases as the chance of exposure to T. gondii in the environment increases. Thus, management actions to stop humans from feeding cats and to control rat populations without using cats are both necessary to reduce the human health risk as well as to conserve endangered species on the island.

AB  - Estimating the abundance and density of mountain ungulates is difficult because of rugged and remote terrain, high elevations, and rapidly changing weather. Helicopter surveys could overcome these problems, but researchers have seldom applied helicopter-based survey methods at large spatial scales in mountain terrain. We used helicopters to count introduced Himalayan tahr (Hemitragus jemlahicus) at 117 plots, each of 4 km(2), in New Zealand's Southern Alps during 2016-2019. The sampling frame was 7,844 km(2) and we located the plots at the vertices of an 8-km grid superimposed over the sampling frame (i.e., a systematic random sampling design). We conducted 3 repeat counts at each plot during summer-autumn. We used the repeat counts to estimate tahr abundance and density, corrected for imperfect detection, using a dynamic N-mixture model for open populations. We estimated the population of tahr in the sampling frame using design-based, finite sampling methods and model-based inference procedures. The mean estimated density of tahr on each plot varied from zero to 31.7 tahr/km(2). The mean densities of tahr varied among management units, ranging from 0.3 to 10.7 tahr/km(2), and exceeded specified intervention densities in 6 of the 7 management units. The total design-based estimate of tahr abundance in the sampling frame was 34,500 (95% CI = 27,750-42,900), with a coefficient of variation (CV) of 0.11. The corresponding model-based estimate of total abundance was similar (34,550, 95% CI = 30,250-38,700) but was substantially more precise (CV = 0.06) than the design-based estimate. The precision of the estimates for the individual management units was also better than that of the design-based estimates, with CVs of <0.20 for all but 1 management unit. Our study provides a repeatable method for sampling mountain ungulates. More generally, robust estimation of abundance and density of mountain ungulates is possible by combining aerial surveys and open population models with an objective, probabilistic sampling design.

AB  - The ecological impacts of invasive mammals are widely documented around the world. In New Zealand, fencing designed to exclude non-native mammals is used for conservation and restoration efforts. The Orokonui Ecosanctuary is a 307-hectare coastal Otago reserve (Dunedin, New Zealand) that is surrounded by mammal-exclusion fencing. The goal of the present study was to investigate how excluding mammals and including (native) animals inside the Orokonui Ecosanctuary fence has influenced ground- and litter-dwelling beetle (Coleoptera) abundance, diversity, and community composition. We hypothesised that beetle abundance, diversity, and community composition would be different whether the beetles sampled were from sites inside the fence or outside the fence. Beetles were extracted from the litter and soil of six sites (three inside, three outside) two times (once in winter, once in summer). The abundance, diversity, species composition, size distribution, and trophic guild distribution of beetles inside and outside the fence and between seasons were compared. Our results suggest that sites inside the fence harbour a greater abundance and diversity of beetles. We found a high abundance of native beetles both inside and outside the Orokonui Ecosanctuary's fence. Further research may find evidence that the fenced sanctuary is providing a 'halo effect' whereby native beetles thriving within the Orokonui Ecosanctuary are spreading out into the surrounding landscape and also outcompeting introduced beetles.

AB  - Artificial light at night (ALAN) is exerting growing pressure on natural ecosystems, but its impact on biological interactions remains unclear. This study aimed to assess how ALAN influences leaf functional traits and herbivory in two prevalent street tree species (Styphnolobium japonicum (L.) Schott and Fraxinus pennsylvanica) through field surveys and paired experiments in the urban areas of Beijing, China. We found that ALAN led to increased leaf toughness and decreased levels of leaf herbivory. Additionally, ALAN showed species-specific effects on leaf nutrients, size as well as defense substances. The findings illustrate that ALAN can significantly alter some key functional traits and ecological processes (nutrient cycling, energy flow). In general, we suggest that high ALAN intensity will be detrimental to the energy flow from urban plants to higher trophic levels, posing a potential threat to the maintenance of biodiversity (e.g., arthropod diversity, bird diversity) in urban ecosystems.

AB  - Revegetating abandoned agricultural lands is vital to restoring critical ecological functions and services. Natural regeneration, whereby vegetation regrows via the seeds already present within the landscape, has shown to be an effective approach to restoring large agricultural areas, although more research is required to understand the regenerative capacity of the various seed sources. Here, we investigate the regenerative capacity of old-fields of semi-arid floodplains of eastern Australia in a year-long seedling emergence experiment. We examined the germinable seed banks from three potential propagule sources (soil, leaf litter, and animal scats) collected across 24 field sites, comprising 12 old-fields and 12 adjacent remnant vegetation patches, distributed across four regions. Soil seed banks stored the most germinable species of the three seed bank types, although these were dominated largely by annual herbaceous species. High abundances of seedlings emerged from scat samples, indicating that native animals, such as kangaroos and emus, play a role in transporting seeds in these landscapes. Finally, leaf litter stored the most germinable propagules of woody species, therefore, representing a vital mechanism for woody vegetation regeneration. There were few differences in emerging seedling assemblages in terms of species richness, abundance or composition between seed banks of old-fields and adjacent remnant vegetation, suggesting that old-field seed banks have a high level of resilience. Our findings suggest that these seed banks can make an important contribution to natural regeneration of these old-fields, but mainly with respect to understory and midstory species, with overstory tree species mostly absent from these seed sources.

AB  - Melia azedarach is a fast-growing broad-leaved deciduous species native to Japan, and in recent years it has been regarded as a promising silvicultural tree species. The objective of this study was to clarify the factors controlling the growth of the target species in the field. Thirty-three research sites were established in western Japan, where stem diameter at ground level (D0) and at 1.2 m in height (D) and tree height (H) were measured every year, to compare the annual growth rates of individual trees. The stand age ranged from 1 to 8 years at the end of 2021. The mortality rate of each study site in 3 years after planting was higher when the mean temperature in the coldest month, January, was low. When this temperature is below 0 degrees C, the rate is higher than approximately 0.3. Analysis using general linear mixed models revealed that fertilizer application and the type of planted area (abandoned farmland) positively affected the annual growth rates of D0, D and H (zD0, zD and zH, respectively). The presence of an animal barrier positively affected zD0 and zH. Temperature in August and precipitation between July and August had a positive and negative effect on zD, respectively, whereas temperature in June had positive effect on zH. These findings can help to promote efficient silviculture by identifying good planting sites and management plans. Abandoned farmland is considered to be a prospective planting site, compared with forest.

AB  - We trapped, anesthetized, and fit 16 female feral swine (Sus scrofa) with Global Positioning System (GPS) collars in Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GRSM) to develop predictive summer and winter models for more effective population control efforts. Given the highly diverse habitat and topography in GRSM and the spatial extent of our dataset, we employed Step Selection Function (SSF) to evaluate resource selection at the 3(rd)-order level and Resource Selection Function (RSF) models at the 2(nd)-order level for both summer and winter seasons. The summer SSF and RSF models suggested relatively similar levels of selection, whereas the winter models differed by method. We created a straightforward consensus model to better visualize the agreement and constraints of each set of models. In summer, feral swine used lower slopes regardless of elevation, especially those closer to human-dominated spaces such as along paved and gravel roadways. In winter, feral swine maintained preference for lower slopes but preferred oak-dominated forest areas and selection for human development was less than in summer. Wildlife managers can use these models to better focus feral swine surveillance and management in GRSM. Managers can identify areas of high use by season and plan control activities that are both accessible and highly efficient. The combination and consensus framework presented here can be applied to other systems where species' habitat selection may result in incongruous results across different levels of selection or seasons of interest.

AB  - In Argentina, wild pigs (Sus scrofa) are represented by wild boars and feral pigs. These populations inhabit a wide territory due to natural dispersion and human translocation. Previous studies in other countries have detected crossbreeding between the different morphotypes, even with domestic pigs. This crossing can lead to introgression of improved traits in the wild population, which would increase the invasive potential and, therefore, the damage to native ecosystems. The aim of this work was to obtain the patterns of genetic variability throughout its current distribution in Argentina, in order to elucidate genetic relationships between wild boar and feral pig populations through the molecular marker control region. For this purpose, studies of genetic variability and population structure were carried out using 377 sequences from Argentinian wild pigs. The high values of haplotype and nucleotide diversity (Hd = 0.866 and pi = 0.00959) obtained, and the cluster analyses (SAMOVA and BAPS) could indicate mixing between wild pigs and/or with domestic pigs. The star-like shapes observed in the haplotype network and neutral tests (Fu's Fs and Tajima's D) are consistent with a recent population expansion, supporting previous reports that indicate crossbreeding increases invasive potential.

AB  - Multiple large-bodied species went extinct during the Pleistocene. Changing climates and/or human hunting are the main hypotheses used to explain these extinctions. We studied the causes of Pleistocene extinctions in the Southern Levant, and their subsequent effect on local hominin food spectra, by examining faunal remains in archaeological sites across the last 1.5 million years. We examined whether climate and climate changes, and/or human cultures, are associated with these declines. We recorded animal abundances published in the literature from 133 stratigraphic layers, across 58 Pleistocene and Early Holocene archaeological sites, in the Southern Levant. We used linear regressions and mixed models to assess the weighted mean mass of faunal assemblages through time and whether it was associated with temperature, paleorainfall, or paleoenvironment (C3 vs. C4 vegetation). We found that weighted mean body mass declined log-linearly through time. Mean hunted animal masses 10,500 years ago, were only 1.7% of those 1.5 million years ago. Neither body size at any period, nor size change from one layer to the next, were related to global temperature or to temperature changes. Throughout the Pleistocene, new human lineages hunted significantly smaller prey than the preceding ones. This suggests that humans extirpated megafauna throughout the Pleistocene, and when the largest species were depleted the next-largest were targeted. Technological advancements likely enabled subsequent human lineages to effectively hunt smaller prey replacing larger species that were hunted to extinction or until they became exceedingly rare.

AB  - Metabarcoding of environmental DNA (eDNA) is now widely used to build diversity profiles from DNA that has been shed by species into the environment. There is substantial interest in the expansion of eDNA approaches for improved detection of terrestrial vertebrates using invertebrate-derived DNA (iDNA) in which hematophagous, sarcophagous, and coprophagous invertebrates sample vertebrate blood, carrion, or faeces. Here, we used metabarcoding and multiple iDNA samplers (carrion flies, sandflies, and mosquitos) collected from 39 forested sites in the southern Amazon to profile gamma and alpha diversity. Our main objectives were to (1) compare diversity found with iDNA to camera trapping, which is the conventional method of vertebrate diversity surveillance; and (2) compare each of the iDNA samplers to assess the effectiveness, efficiency, and potential biases associated with each sampler. In total, we collected and analysed 1759 carrion flies, 48,686 sandflies, and 4776 mosquitos. Carrion flies revealed the greatest total vertebrate species richness at the landscape level, despite the least amount of sampling effort and the fewest number of individuals captured for metabarcoding, followed by sandflies. Camera traps had the highest median species richness at the site-level but showed strong bias towards carnivore and ungulate species and missed much of the diversity described by iDNA methods. Mosquitos showed a strong feeding preference for humans as did sandflies for armadillos, thus presenting potential utility to further study related to host-vector interactions.

AB  - The global challenges of biodiversity loss and persistent poverty and inequality, which interact and shape each other at the local scale, require new strategies to improve human well-being and conserve biodiversity. In South Africa, inclusive and transformative conservation approaches are gaining support, which is of particular importance given the challenging history of conservation during the colonial and apartheid eras. The Dinokeng Game Reserve was created to conserve biodiversity and combat poverty in adjacent communities. However, human-elephant conflict and community development challenges have led to unproductive conservation trade-offs. We developed a Theory of Change for Living in Harmony that can help policymakers, conservation organisations and local communities to find better solutions. To develop the Theory of Change, we assessed the visions and perspectives towards (elephant) conservation and socio-economic development among both people living inside (owners/direct beneficiaries) and outside (community/indirect beneficiaries) the reserve. The study revealed common ground among stakeholder groups in ranking elephant benefits, as well as a collective acknowledgement of the importance of moral values in conservation decision making. However, the benefits of living within or adjacent to an elephant reserve differed considerably across stakeholder groups. Accordingly, different but not mutually exclusive solutions were suggested, including investments in multi-level good governance, education and capacity building, active community engagement and development, reserve expansion, and promoting the reserve's integrated conservation model. This Theory of Change aims to support common ground between stakeholders, with critical feedback loops that reduce barriers and enable conditions for coexistence. It promotes conservation strategies that are socially relevant and widely supported, can create mutually beneficial outcomes for elephants, biodiversity, and multiple stakeholders, and can be applied to other species or ecosystems in general, with specific elements being tailored to those circumstances.

AB  - Periodontitis is a polymicrobial biofilm-induced inflammatory disease associated with a dysbiotic microbial community and severely affects the health and welfare of animals. However, little is known regarding the dental microbiota associated with this disease in goats. In this study, we used high-throughput sequencing, network analysis, and predicted functions to investigate the microbiota of clinically healthy goats and those with periodontitis and identify possible pathogens and proteins associated with the disease. Dental microbiomes of goats with periodontitis were richer, and network analyses showed that the number of negative interactions was higher in the networks of animals with periodontitis. Based on the interrelationships, Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium, and Prevotella were suggested to play an important role in the dental microbiota associated with goat periodontitis. Protein families linked to translation, cytoplasmatic translation, and rRNA processing were more abundant in the dental microbiota of goats with periodontitis. In conclusion, the dental biofilm microbiota associated with goat periodontitis seems to be dysbiotic and has significant antagonistic interactions, which discriminate healthy animals from diseased animals and highlight the importance of key bacteria. Thus, these novel findings contribute to the evolution of knowledge regarding the etiopathogenesis of goat periodontitis and possibly to the development of periodontitis control measures.

AB  - Two new African minnow species, Enteromius cerinus sp. nov. and Enteromius ruforum sp. nov., are described for science from the Angadiko River, a left-bank sub-affluent of first order of the Nepoko River, draining the north-eastern part of the Okapi Wildlife Reserve (OWR). Both new species belong to the group of Enteromius for which the last unbranched dorsal-fin ray is flexible and underrated. Within this morphological group, both are most similar to Enteromius kamolondoensis, especially in life colour pattern characteristics. However, Enteromius cerinus sp. nov. differs from E. kamolondoensis by its low number of circumpeduncular scales, 10-11 (vs. 12), low maximum body depth, 22.8%-25.7% standard length (Ls) (vs. 26.1%-30.0%), and long anterior and posterior barbel lengths, 32.6%-35.3% head length (LH) (vs. 23.6%-27.2%) and 41.6%-43.9% LH (vs. 30.3%-34.9%), respectively. Further, E. ruforum sp. nov. is also easily distinguished from E. kamolondoensis by its high maximum body depth, 30.6%-33.3% Ls (vs. 26.1%-30.0%), and small, isometric, eye diameter, 26.2%-28.0% LH (vs. 29.1%-31.9%). A barcoding study (mtDNA, cytochrome oxidase subunit I [COI]) revealed that specimens of both new species form lineages well differentiated from those of other available species. As such, (i) E. cerinus sp. nov. diverges from E. kamolondoensis by a K2P genetic distance (GD) of 10.3% and (ii) E. ruforum sp. nov. by a K2P GD of 11.2%. To the present day, the fish fauna of the left-bank sub-affluents of the Nepoko River, in general, remains poorly known or undocumented. Unfortunately, at the same time, multiple anthropogenic impacts are affecting this fauna, such as (i) the destruction of habitats along the river banks for agriculture and fishing and (ii) the use of illegal fishing practices, such as fishing with plant-based ichthyotoxins during ecopage, which is combined with dam building. As a result of the demographic growth, this ecopage results in overfishing and thus is threatening both new species in particular, but all other co-occurring fish species as well. Both new species, E. cerinus sp. nov. and E. ruforum sp. nov., should thus be considered Vulnerable (VU) according to IUCN criterion D2. It is therefore hoped that their discovery highlights the urgent need for a better protection and further in situ exploration of the reserve's freshwater (fish) biodiversity, in general, and that of those small sub-affluents, in particular.

AB  - The spatiotemporal behavior of game species may play a critical role in their survival throughout the hunting season. Where humans are the most dominant predators, avoidance of landscape features that allow hunter access to hunting grounds can be key to increasing survival. However, in Sweden there is limited knowledge about how hunters impact populations through selection of behavioral traits. In this system, hunting pressure is generally high and approximately 30% of the moose Alces alces population is harvested per year. To test for differences in habitat selection in relation to survival under varying levels of hunting pressure in this long-lived game species, we analyzed 10 years of individual-based movement data of adult male and female moose in southern Sweden. We used integrated Step Selection Functions (iSSF) to analyze habitat selection in four consecutive time periods (before the rutting season, during the rut, during the first three weeks of the hunting season and the following three weeks). We matched habitat selection coefficients of individual animals with their fate and tested for behavioral differences between 'harvested' and 'non-harvested'male and female moose in each period. Our findings indicate that hunters may select for sex-specific behavioral traits in habitat selection by adult moose. We found that hunters harvested male moose that selected for higher NDVI during the rut, suggesting personality-driven hunting mortality in male moose. In contrast, in female moose, the mortality risk increased with selection for shorter distance to roads during the hunting season, suggesting selection for behavioral traits by hunters. Our findings indicate that current harvest practices for moose result in a selection for sex-specific behavioral traits. Our study highlights the complex dynamics of survival in a long-lived species under high hunting pressure, revealing how sex-specific habitat selection may impact mortality risk by hunters and, in return, might influence population management.

AB  - Snowpack dynamics have a major influence on wildlife movement ecology and predator-prey interactions. Specific snow properties such as density, hardness, and depth determine how much an animal sinks into the snowpack, which in turn drives both the energetic cost of locomotion and predation risk. Here, we quantified the relationships between five field-measured snow variables and snow track sink depths for widely distributed predators (bobcats Lynx rufus, cougars Puma concolor, coyotes Canis latrans, wolves C. lupus) and sympatric ungulate prey (caribou Rangifer tarandus, white-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus, mule deer O. hemionus, and moose Alces alces) in interior Alaska and northern Washington, USA. We first used generalized additive models to identify which snow metrics best predicted sink depths for each species and across all species. Next, we used breakpoint regression to identify thresholds of support for the best-performing predictor of sink depth for each species (i.e. values wherein tracks do not sink appreciably deeper into the snow). Finally, we identified 'danger zones,' wherein snow impedes the mobility of ungulates more than carnivores, by comparing sink depths relative to hind leg lengths among predator-prey pairs. Near-surface (0-20 cm) snow density was the strongest predictor of sink depth across species. Thresholds of support occurred at near-surface snow densities between 220-310 kg m(-)(3) for predators and 300-410 kg m(-)(3) for prey, and danger zones peaked at intermediate snow densities (200-300 kg m(-)(3)) for eight of the ten predator-prey pairs. These results can be used to link predator-prey relationships with spatially explicit snow modeling outputs and projected future changes in snow density. As climate change rapidly reshapes snowpack dynamics, these danger zones provide a useful framework to anticipate likely winners and losers of future winter conditions.

AB  - Elephants influence the structure and composition of African woodlands and, sometimes, damage cultivated trees in farms of local communities. Here, we evaluate the impact of elephant debarking on cultivated cashew trees (Anacardium occidentale) as the friction between farmers and elephant conservation is increasing. We quantified the effects of elephant debarking on tree survival, crown defoliation, and nut production by visiting elephant-damaged farms with cashew trees (n=47 farms) along Sasawara National Forest (Tanzania). We also compared defoliation and nut production with nearby control trees (undamaged) in a paired designed. Our results reveal that elephants debarked a significant proportion of trees (36% of farms had some cashew trees damaged by elephants, with a mean of 17.3% damaged trees per farm), with a preference for medium-large tree sizes (> 20 cm of diameter at breast height). Tree mortality due to elephants was 4 trees (4.2% of the affected trees), which represents around 0.1% of the total number of trees in the affected farms. In the year of damage, elephant debarking caused no effect on defoliation whereas nut production was reduced only in trees with very high intensity of damage (> 60% of trunk circumference affected). However, a year after the damage, both defoliation and nut production were negatively affected but this effect was strongly dependent on the intensity of damage and tree diameter. These results may help reduce the social discomfort of cashew farmers and contribute to enhance human-elephant coexistence. However, further studies should analyze the future vulnerability of damaged trees to fires, pathogens or pests.

AB  - Hair tubes are one of the most effective tools for sampling small-mammal assemblages. Despite their efficiency, they can be damaged by wildlife. We quantified wildlife-induced disturbance of hair-tube sampling in the Monte Pisano mountain system in Italy. At each site we tied 2 tubes together to form a hair trap and placed them in 3 different areas. We measured disturbances by counting the number of hair traps disturbed and identified the species that caused damage with cameras. Although approximately 27% (n = 164/600) of hair traps were disturbed, 2 hair traps/site allowed us to collect data from 97% of site checks from undisturbed and retrieved hair traps. Wild boars (Sus scrofa) were attracted to hair traps by olfactory and acoustic signals and caused the most disturbances. Displaced tubes detected a similar number of hairs and number of species as undisturbed tubes; species richness estimates that include retrieved displaced tubes should provide reliable data. To avoid data loss when conducting hair-trap monitoring, we suggest using >= 2 hair traps per site.
   In this study, wildlife-induced disturbance of hair-tube sampling of small mammals was quantified in Monte Pisano mountain system (Italy). Wild boar caused the most disturbance to the sampling tubes. To avoid data loss when conducting hair-tube monitoring, we suggest using at least 2 hair traps per site, and displaced tubes that are retrieved should provide reliable data. image

AB  - Boars with high reproduction, wide distribution, and adaptability have great potential to conflict with human interests. Malayer County, in Hamedan Province, is one of the economic hubs of grape production and related products in Iran. Considering that the county's economic growth is based on this horticultural product, this study was conducted to detect conflict-prone areas in different land use/cover (LULC) types and landforms. The ensemble model of attack risk was developed using single tree and regression models and 10 topographic, vegetation, and human variables. The significant difference between conflict/non-conflict points in the LULC and landform maps was checked using the Chi-square test. The results showed a significant difference in the occurrence of conflict in different LULC classes (P < 0.05). The NDVI, the distance from spring, and the distance from vineyards were the three variables with the greatest effect in all models. The widest niche-breadth conflict in the LULC and landform types belonged to gardens and u-shaped valleys (B1 = 0.60, B2 = 0.95; B1 = 0.35, B2 = 0.91, respectively Those gardens in deeply incised streams and u-shaped valleys have the highest potential for conflict (65.68%). Based on the findings, in the event of a conflict, those arrangements of structural elements of the land landscape are effective, which increase the species' accessibility to the vineyards while providing security. In this study, long and permanent vegetation such as groves can increase the vulnerability of marginal orchards and agricultural lands. Programs to reduce the conflict with wild boars should be based on local adaptations, prey relations, the improvement of traditional cultivation, and securing the vineyards in Malayer County.

AB  - Aim Animal migrations influence ecosystem structure, dynamics and persistence of predator and prey populations. The theory of migratory coupling postulates that aggregations of migrant prey can induce large-scale synchronized movements in predators, and this coupling is consequential for the dynamics of ecological communities. The degree to which humans influence these interactions remains largely unknown. We tested whether creation of large resource pulses by humans such as seasonal herding of reindeer Rangifer tarandus and hunting of moose, Alces alces, can induce migratory coupling with Golden Eagles, Aquila chrysaetos, and whether these lead to demographic consequences for the eagles. Location Fennoscandia. Methods We used movement data from 32 tracked Golden Eagles spanning 125 annual migratory cycles over 8 years. We obtained reindeer distribution data through collaboration with reindeer herders based on satellite tracking of reindeer, and moose harvest data from the national hunting statistics for Sweden. We assessed demographic consequences for eagles from ingesting lead from ammunition fragments in moose carcasses through survival estimates and their links with lead concentrations in eagles' blood. Results In spring, eagles migrated hundreds of kilometres to be spatially and temporally coupled with calving reindeer, whereas in autumn, eagles matched their distribution with the location and timing of moose hunt. Juveniles were more likely to couple with reindeer calving, whereas adults were particularly drawn to areas of higher moose harvest. Due to this coupling, eagles ingested lead from spent ammunition in moose offal and carcasses and the resulting lead toxicity increased the risk of mortality by 3.4 times. Main conclusions We show how migratory coupling connects landscape processes and that human actions can influence migratory coupling over large spatial scales and increase demographic risks for predators. We provide vital knowledge towards resolving human-wildlife conflicts and the conservation of protected species over a large spatial and temporal scale.

AB  - Use of dens during winter is an important strategy for American black bears (Ursus americanus) for both energy conservation and reproduction; and occupancy of suitable den sites has implications for reproductive fitness. Denning strategies may change as a result of changing climatic conditions and habitat loss. Black bears occupy arid environments in the eastern Sierra Nevada and the western ranges of the Great Basin Ecosystem. Our objectives were to identify: (1) which physical characteristics of habitat influenced selection of den sites at multiple spatial scales and (2) which environmental factors influenced timing of entrance and exit of dens by females and males. We evaluated selection of den sites by black bears at three spatial scales (300, 1000, and 4000 m) from 2011 to 2022. Terrain ruggedness was important for selection of den sites at all spatial scales. Within a 300-m buffer from the den, bears selected den sites with rugged terrain, lower horizontal visibility, and greater canopy cover, resulting in more concealment and protection than that of the surrounding environment. Within 1000- and 4000-m buffers around each den, bears selected den sites with rugged terrain, northern aspects, and steep slopes. At the 4000-m scale, we observed interactions between sex with slope and distance to roads; females selected den sites on steeper slopes and closer to roads than did males. Females remained in the dens longer than males by entering earlier in the autumn and exiting later in the spring. Male bears exited their dens earlier with increasing consecutive days above freezing temperatures, but that relationship was weak for females. Knowing what characteristics are important for selection of den sites, and influence timing of denning, will be important for understanding how shifting climatic patterns will affect bears, particularly in arid environments that may be prone to wider fluctuations in climatic drivers of denning in the future.

AB  - The Arabian oryx (Oryx leucoryx, Pallas 1777) once roamed the Middle Eastern deserts, but went extinct in the wild by 1972. More than 30 years after re-introduction programs were implemented the oryx is still classified as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. Its poor reproductive performance was determined to be nutrition-related, and the availability of tannin-rich acacia browse has been crucial for the oryx in compensating for unpredictable grass production. Faecal N (FN) is an ubiquitous estimate of nutritional status, but its interpretation depends on dietary tannins that bind with proteins in the gastro-intestinal tract. Using three captive male oryx fed diets varying in the percentage of tannin-rich Acacacia tortilis pods, we demonstrated that dietary polyethylene-glycol binding tannins (PEG-b-T) were partly recovered in faeces and that faecal PEG-b-T represented qualitative evidence of browsing. Faecal PEG-b-T and FN were positively correlated, but we found no relationship between the dietary percentages of acacia pods, dietary protein, PEG-b-T, in vitro dry matter digestibility, and FN. Beyond the effect of dietary tannins, where the provision of crude protein and energy are sufficient for maintenance, efficient urea recycling might compromise the value of FN as an estimate of dietary status in oryx.

AB  - Predation is an important factor that influences the behavior of prey species. When approached by a predator, individuals must make escape decisions that may be sensitive to the level of perceived risk. Both predator size and prey group size influence vulnerability and may influence this assessment. If fish perceive larger predators as a greater threat, differences in predator size should reflect differences in their antipredator response. Group size may also influence antipredator response in congregated fish. We investigated the flight initiation distance (FID) of differently sized groups of dusky damselfish (Stegastes nigricans) to measure their antipredator response to varying sizes of artificial stimuli. We found no effect of shoal size on FID, indicating that damselfish risk assessment is not influenced by group size. However, we did find that stimulus size interacted with starting distance (SD) to affect FID, with damselfish distinguishing between stimulus sizes at shorter SD but not at longer SD. Adjustment of FID in response to varying stimuli indicates that damselfish risk assessment is plastic, and consequently, antipredator responses may be adaptable in changing ocean ecosystems. Because damselfish are herbivores that feed on algae in coral reefs, understanding factors affecting their assessment of risk is important to understanding the overall ecosystem structure. These behavioral responses could be significant in the context of anthropogenic activities, mainly overfishing, which shifts community composition by disproportionately removing larger top predators.

AB  - The dry forest of parroquia Cazaderos located in the southwest of Ecuador, has become a fragile and vulnerable ecosystem due to its productive activities, such as, the traditional use of the forest for goat grazing. In light of this problem, the objective of the present research was to characterize the ecosystem services offered by the forest. The proposed methodological approach was founded on the classification of ecosystem services based on the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment framework. From this classification, it was determined that the dry forest provides supply, regulation and cultural ecosystem services in parroquia Cazaderos. In the supply services, the following were characterized: the supply of fresh water for human consumption, non-timber forest products (medicinal, oils, fibers, dyes and crafts) and timber forest products with endemic and representative species of the dry forest. As regulation services, areas with surface water recharge potential and riparian protection areas were characterized. As cultural services, cultural heritage, feeling of belonging, ecotourism, and scenic beauty were characterized. In this sense, it is concluded that the dry forest is an ecosystem with potential for the provision and maintenance of these services, making it essential to implement protection and conservation actions.

AB  - The extinction of a species is a key demographic event often signalling major climatic, ecological and/or evolutionary shifts that can be investigated using the fossil record. In that context, radiocarbon (14C) dating has become a popular tool to time and test for scenarios of extinction that can inform on how species respond to past and future ecosystem changes. We develop CRIWM, a method for estimating extinction (and arrival) time from time series of 14C dates while accounting for probability density functions (PDF) deriving from 14C calibration. The sister method GRIWM assumes normal chronometric errors and is inappropriate for 14C chronologies as PDFs are often non-Gaussian and multi-modal. Compared to GRIWM, CRIWM reduces by 4-fold the gap between true and estimated extinction times and the width of the confidence intervals, and is less sensitive to sample size, dating errors and the temporal distribution of specimens in a species' fossil record. We build the R package Rextinct with three user-friendly functions for computing CRIWM and GRIWM, and the PDF moments, modes and intercepts of 14C calibrations. CRIWM and GRIWM accept time series comprising only 14C dates or observations (fossils, sightings) dated by multiple chronometric methods, and calibration curves for fossils sampled in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres and marine environments. For both methods, we implement two different estimators of extinction time whether they are reliant on a p-value (original conceptualization) or not (novel). CRIWM and Rextinct are robust tools to time extinction and arrival events using 14C chronologies spanning the entire Holocene to 50,000 calendar years Before Present, and can be used to investigate demographic phenomena queried through the fossil record such as migrations, domestications and extirpations.

AB  - Impalas, elephants, and other ungulates demonstrate a "hierarchy of fear" toward their predators, most fearing the "King of Beasts" (lions). Quantifying how fearfully prey react to one predator versus another is critical to fully comprehend each predator's impact on the ecosystem, but this has proven difficult to predict. Using automated camera-speaker systems, we demonstrate the ready feasibility of experimentally quantifying the fear the African ungulate community manifests toward lions, African wild dogs, and cheetahs.
   Experiments have begun demonstrating that the fear (antipredator behavioral responses) large carnivores inspire in ungulates can shape ecosystem structure and function. Most such experiments have focused on the impacts of either just one large carnivore, or all as a whole, rather than the different impacts different large carnivores may have in intact multi-predator-prey systems. Experimentally testing the relative fearfulness ungulates demonstrate toward different large carnivores is a necessary first step in addressing these likely differing impacts. We tested the fearfulness ungulates demonstrated to playbacks of lion (Panthera leo), African wild dog (Lycaon pictus), cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) or non-predator control (bird) vocalizations, in Greater Kruger National Park, South Africa. Ungulates ran most to lions, then wild dogs, and then cheetahs, demonstrating a very clear hierarchy of fear. Those that did not run looked toward the sound more on hearing large carnivores than controls, looking most on hearing lions. Notably, prey species-specific population level kill rates by each predator did not predict the patterns observed. Our results demonstrate that different large carnivores inspire different levels of fear in their ungulate prey, pointing to differing community-level impacts, which we discuss in relation to the ongoing worldwide decline and loss of large carnivores.

AB  - Wildlife numbers are declining globally due to anthropogenic pressures. In Namibia, however, wildlife populations increased with policy instruments that allow private ownership and incentivize their sustainable use. Antithetically, this resulted in increased resource competition between humans and wildlife and triggered conflicts among various stakeholder groups. This paper summarizes the results of a qualitative exploration of conflicts in wildlife management in Namibia's Kunene Region, adjacent to Etosha National Park. We conducted a workshop and expert interviews with stakeholders from relevant sectors. Our qualitative research sheds light on societal conflicts over wildlife that originate from diverging interests, livelihood strategies, moral values, knowledge holders, personal relations and views on institutional procedures. We frame our insights into conflicting human-wildlife interactions with theoretical concepts of social-ecological systems, ecosystem services and ecosystem disservices and open the floor for quantitative assessments. Overall, our results may present a suitable way of understanding biodiversity conflicts in a theoretical way.

AB  - 1. Plant-microbial-herbivore interactions play a crucial role in the structuring and maintenance of plant communities and biodiversity, yet these relationships are complex. In grassland ecosystems, herbivores have the potential to greatly influence the survival, growth and reproduction of plants. However, few studies examine interactions of above- and below-ground grazing and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) mycorrhizal symbiosis on plant community structure. 2. We established experimental mesocosms containing an assemblage of eight tallgrass prairie grass and forb species in native prairie soil, maintained under mycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal conditions, with and without native herbivorous soil nematodes, and with and without grasshopper herbivory. Using factorial analysis of variance and principal component analysis, we examined: (a) the independent and interacting effects of above- and below-ground herbivores on AM symbiosis in tallgrass prairie mesocosms, (b) independent and interacting effects of above- and below-ground herbivores and mycorrhizal fungi on plant community structure and (c) potential influences of mycorrhizal responsiveness of host plants on herbivory tolerance and concomitant shifts in plant community composition. 3. Treatment effects were characterized by interactions between AM fungi and both above-ground and below-ground herbivores, while herbivore effects were additive. The dominance of mycorrhizal-dependent C-4 grasses in the presence of AM symbiosis was increased (p < 0.0001) by grasshopper herbivory but reduced (p < 0.0001) by nematode herbivory. Cool-season C-3 grasses exhibited a competitive release in the absence of AM symbiosis but this effect was largely reversed in the presence of grasshopper herbivory. Forbs showed species-specific responses to both AM fungal inoculation and the addition of herbivores. Biomass of the grazing-avoidant, facultatively mycotrophic forb Brickellia eupatorioides increased (p < 0.0001) in the absence of AM symbiosis and with grasshopper herbivory, while AM-related increases in the above-ground biomass of mycorrhizal-dependent forbs Rudbeckia hirta and Salvia azurea were eradicated (p < 0.0001) by grasshopper herbivory. In contrast, nematode herbivory enhanced (p = 0.001) the contribution of Salvia azurea to total biomass. 4. Synthesis. Our research indicates that arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis is the key driver of dominance of C-4 grasses in the tallgrass prairie, with foliar and root herbivory being two mechanisms for maintenance of plant diversity.

AB  - Concurrent expansion of grassland habitat in the Americas and first appearances of immigrant taxa to Mexico via the Great American Biotic Interchange (GABI) during the Late Miocene to Early Pliocene suggest a possible link between the timing of migrations and changes in the environmental conditions. However, the causes and environmental context of GABI migrations are not well understood. This study examined the stable isotope compositions of tooth enamel samples of the Yepomera fauna from western Chihuahua, Mexico, to explore environmental conditions of this region between 4.99 and 5.23 Ma, just after the arrival of C-4 plants in North and South America and before the first major migration of GABI. At Yepomera, there was distinct niche partitioning into C-3 diets, mixed diets, and C-4 diets. Despite expectations, no niche partitioning between equid species (Dinohippus mexicanus, Nannippus aztecus, Astrohippus stockii, and Neohipparion eurystyle) can be determined from carbon isotope ratios. The enamel carbon and oxygen isotope data suggest a relatively dry, open habitat dominated by either savanna or grassland, with a substantial C-4 vegetation component and a warmer and somewhat wetter climate than today. These reconstructions are consistent with a rise in C-4 biomass before 5.23 Ma and suggest that the conditions needed for growth of C-4 vegetation were prevalent in this region of Mexico. Future work along the GABI migration route will lead to a more complete understanding of the ecologic responses to changing climate and faunal interchange events.

AB  - Dendroecology is an effective way to measure the radial growth of plants under different environmental conditions, since the results may provide implications for plantations management. In this study, we examined the growth response of planted shrub Hippophae rhamnoides on different slope aspects and scattered distributed natural Caragana opulens to climate in the western Loess Plateau. The results show that insufficient precipitation from April to June is the main limiting factor of planted H. rhamnoides growth in the western Loess Plateau. On different slope aspects, the H. rhamnoides was susceptible limited by precipitation and drought stress on shady slopes than sunny slopes, with precipitation model explaining 53.0 % of radial growth variation on shady slopes and 30.6 % of growth variation on sunny slopes. Planting density is the main reason for the above phenomenon. Sufficient precipitation and moderate planting density (around 3300 shrubs per hectare) may mitigate the limitations of drought on planted H. rhamnoides growth. In addition, the growth of natural C. opulens was less affected by precipitation and drought stress compared to the planted H. rhamnoides in same region, precipitation and drought model explaining only 14.6 % and 10.5 % of growth variation, respectively, this may promotion appropriately as a suitable afforestation species in the western Loess Plateau. Therefore, the slope aspects, planting density, as well as the limiting factors and time on growth of plantation species should be full considered to vegetation restoration in the future, and thereby, improve the stability and sustainable development of plantation forests in the western Loess Plateau.

AB  - Deep-sea precious corals in the octocoral family Coralliidae are among the dominant benthic megafauna at depths of 300-600 m on seamounts of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands and lower Emperor Seamount Chain. Pleurocorallium secundum and Hemicorallium laauense were once abundant enough on these seamounts to support a targeted coral fishery in the 1960s and 1970s. Significant trawl finfish fisheries were also occurring in the same time frame on the same seamounts. Because they had high enough abundance to support a targeted fishery for two decades, these two coralliid species must have been a key component of the baseline community on these seamounts. Therefore, they provide an ideal indicator species for testing effects of large-scale disturbance and potential for recovery in deep-sea coral and seamount communities. Using AUVs and submersibles, we explored seamounts outside the US EEZ that are still actively fished by trawl, seamounts within the US EEZ that were historically trawled but have been protected since the establishment of the EEZ, and seamounts that have never been trawled, to determine population distributions and colony sizes for the targeted coral species. P. secundum had only one individual on actively trawled seamounts and occurred in low abundance on most Recovering seamounts. H. laauense was present in a few areas in Recovering and Still Trawled seamounts. Colony size dis-tributions for H. laauense showed a smaller median size on Recovering and Still Trawled seamounts compared to the Never Trawled sites. P. secundum had a slightly smaller median colony size on the Recovering Seamounts than on the Never Trawled seamounts. These results indicate a reduction in abundance for both species in disturbed areas with some unexpected potential for recovery on protected seamounts. Recovery was uneven among sites and species with SE Hancock and Koko showing the largest populations of H. laauense among the Recovering and Still Trawled seamounts, respectively. P. secundum showed much less recovery, with its largest population on Bank 11 in the Recovering seamounts. Kammu, one of the primary seamounts of the coral fishery, had only a single coralliid observed. The other primary target, Yuryaku, had a small number of coralliids in a steeply sloped area. These two Still Trawled seamounts do not appear to be able to recover under the current levels of fishing pressure.

AB  - The topicality of our research topic is justified by the significant change in traditional grassland management in the grassland areas of the Pannonian Basin. Due to several factors, the proportion of fallow grassland, and in parallel of over-exploited pastures, is continuously increasing. In the medium term (11 years), the effects of fallowing (Z), annual mowing (M), mowing and grazing (meadow treatment M + G), and permanent overgrazing (OG) as treatments on the population structure of grassland plants were investigated in a semi-natural grassland community in the Solonyec soil. It was found that the lowest degradation rates in the studied grassland biotope were obtained for the treatment presenting the utilisation pattern of mowing the main grassland phytomass followed by sheep grazing of the coltgrass. The highest degradation levels, which threatened the condition of the grassland community, were measured for the treatment presenting overgrazing with sheep at the end of the experimental period.

AB  - Understanding population connectivity and genetic diversity is of fundamental importance to conservation. However, in globally threatened marine megafauna, challenges remain due to their elusive nature and wide-ranging distributions. As overexploitation continues to threaten biodiversity across the globe, such knowledge gaps compromise both the suitability and effectiveness of management actions. Here, we use a comparative framework to investigate genetic differentiation and diversity of manta rays, one of the most iconic yet vulnerable groups of elasmobranchs on the planet. Despite their recent divergence, we show how oceanic manta rays (Mobula birostris) display significantly higher heterozygosity than reef manta rays (Mobula alfredi) and that M. birostris populations display higher connectivity worldwide. Through inferring modes of colonization, we reveal how both contemporary and historical forces have likely influenced these patterns, with important implications for population management. Our findings highlight the potential for fisheries to disrupt population dynamics at both local and global scales and therefore have direct relevance for international conservation of marine species.

AB  - We studied the effects of agricultural land use history on present-day forest conditions at large spatial and temporal scales. We used historic forest maps from the late 1800s to document the spatial extent of primary and post-agricultural forest cover in the 8080 km(2) area of northern New Jersey outside the coastal plain, measuring the structure and composition of their vegetation and soils in 72 paired plots, and comparing the responses to agricultural land use history across regional and landscape-level environmental gradients. We estimated a 25% net increase in forest cover from the late 1800's to 2015, with a 26% decline in primary forests during the same time. As little as 5-14% of the land area of some ecoregions are occupied by primary forests today. Post-agricultural forests comprise >46% of total forest cover and up to 72-77% in some ecoregions. Forest vegeta-tion and soils differed significantly in the two forest types, with 8-11x greater invasive shrub and liana cover in post-ag forests, 2-5x more invasive species than native species, and reduced tree regeneration in seedling and sapling size classes (37-63%). Post-ag forest soils had a higher pH and associated base mineral concentrations (Ca, Mg), lower nutrients (NH4, %N), electrical conductivity and organic content (%C, % organic matter), and changes to soil texture (lower % sand, higher % silt and clay). Variation in these changes across large spatial and temporal scales showed few to no relationships with bedrock/surface geology, glacial history, soils, topography, forest age class or integrity metrics, indicating the robustness of these changes across a wide range of envi-ronmental contexts and conditions. Comparisons to past primary forest conditions in the same region (1948-1973) showed even greater deficits in tree regeneration and increases in invasive abundance in post-ag forests than present-day comparisons suggested. The results indicate the significance of agricultural history as a major driver of long-term and large-scale forest change. Greater protection of primary forests is needed along with prioritizing the respective needs of these different forest land use history types for stewardship and restoration in the future.

AB  - Insectivorous predators, including birds and bats, play crucial roles in trophic cascades. However, previous research on these cascades has often relied on permanent predator exclosures, which prevent the isolation of specific effects of birds and bats, given their different activity patterns throughout the day. Moreover, limited knowledge exists regarding the variations in individual effects of these predators under different biotic and abiotic conditions, such as changes in elevation. To address these uncertainties, our study aimed to investigate the distinct effects of bats and birds on arthropod densities in foliage and herbivory damage in lowland and highland rainforests of Papua New Guinea (PNG). Predator exclosures were established for one month to exclude diurnal or nocturnal predators across 120 saplings (ca. 2.5-4 m tall) selected from two lowland and two highland forests (i.e., 30 saplings per study site) along the Mt. Wilhelm transect in PNG. Arthropods were collected and measured, and herbivory damage was analyzed at the end of the experiment. Birds significantly reduced arthropod densities by 30%, particularly in arthropods longer than 10 mm, regardless of elevation. Additionally, both birds and bats appeared to mitigate herbivory damage in highland forests, with protected saplings displaying up to 189% more herbivory. Our results support previous studies that have demonstrated the ability of insectivorous predators to reduce leaf damage through the control of arthropods. Furthermore, our approach highlights the importance and necessity of further research on the role of seasons and elevations in trophic cascades.

AB  - Marine protected areas (MPAs), particularly large MPAs, are increasing in number and size around the globe in part to facilitate the conservation of marine megafauna under the assumption that large-scale MPAs better align with vagile life histories; however, this alignment is not well established. Using a global tracking dataset from 36 species across five taxa, chosen to reflect the span of home range size in highly mobile marine megafauna, we show most MPAs are too small to encompass complete home ranges of most species. Based on size alone, 40% of existing MPAs could encompass the home ranges of the smallest ranged species, while only < 1% of existing MPAs could encompass those of the largest ranged species. Further, where home ranges and MPAs overlapped in real geographic space, MPAs encompassed < 5% of core areas used by all species. Despite most home ranges of mobile marine megafauna being much larger than existing MPAs, we demonstrate how benefits from MPAs are still likely to accrue by targeting seasonal aggregations and critical life history stages and through other management techniques.

AB  - Public support is often instrumental for restoring large mammals to landscapes where they have been extirpated. Effective conservation planning likely often hinges on wildlife managers understanding and reflecting the values and beliefs of their constituencies. Yet, comparative views of wildlife managers and the public or key interest groups are largely untested. As a prelude to developing a management plan for reintroduced bison (Bison bison) in Yukon, Canada, we compared views of the public, hunters, and wildlife managers, using a pre-tested questionnaire with most questions based on a 5-point Likert scale. We tested whether managers differed with respect to their values and beliefs pertaining to bison management compared to the public and hunters. Additionally, we used a Potential for Conflict Index(2) approach to assess the acceptability of potential management actions by these three groups to hypothetical scenarios. Our main findings were that (i) respondents with higher anthropocentric and ecocentric views of bison were more accepting of population growth; (ii) respondents that believed bison or hunters had created ecological or social impacts were less accepting of an increased bison population; (iii) means differed significantly between groups for most questions, with key differences being a lack of acceptability of "doing nothing" as a management option by the public, and "reducing harvest opportunities" by hunters-however, there were few polarized views on bison management options; and (iv) PCI2 values were often moderate (0.21-0.50) within groups, indicating a lack of consensus on views about the acceptability of management options. A low degree of consensus between or within groups is a hallmark of a potential for conflict, and revealing low levels of consensus between and within groups can facilitate understanding where increased communication between managers and their constituencies is needed. Our research provides a case study of wildlife managers in the Yukon and demonstrates that they reflect reasonably well the public and hunters regarding bison management. This is likely because Yukon bison managers are an inclusive group that is largely community based. That said, there were often significant differences in the degree to which all three groups agreed on bison management options. Within the context of species conservation planning, similar research can provide an important test on congruence between views of wildlife managers and their constituencies. We recommend similar assessments when key decisions need to be made by wildlife managers, particularly on potentially volatile issues that may not be broadly supported.

AB  - Biological invasions have modified habitat structure, forcing changes in ecosystem functions. Structural complexity modulates diversity and trophic pathways, but the roles of invasive species in mediating coral reef habitat attributes and trophic effects are poorly understood. We investigated the influence of invasive corals on reef structural complexity and their implications on reef fish trophic structure. To assess habitat complexity and trophic relationships, we used a digital probe to map reef rugosity and characterized benthic cover and fish abundances by video and visual estimates. We calculated a coral skeleton complexity index (for individual invasive and native colonies) by building high-resolution three-dimensional models with photogrammetry techniques. The study was conducted between February 2018 and March 2019 in Cascos Reef, located on the east coast of Brazil. We reveal that the complex morphology of the invasive coral Tubastraea spp. skeleton had a significant positive effect on reef rugosity, contributing to substrate complexity at a sub-metric scale. However, this likely did not promote reef fish diversity but altered the assemblage structure patterns, demonstrated by a negative relationship between coral colony complexity index and abundance of trophic groups such as roving herbivores and omnivores and a positive relationship with planktivores. Thus, our findings support that habitat attribute modification promoted by invasive corals can influence the benthos-fish dynamic, promoting some fish groups to the detriment of others, with pervasive implications for ecosystem functions. Global changes are increasing invasions worldwide, enhancing the need for effective policies for regulation and management to ensure human well-being and ecosystem services.

AB  - Numerous studies have shown that warming advances spring phenology in various ecosystems. However, few studies explicitly consider the effect of food web structure, e.g. food chain length (FCL), and most studies have focused on temperate systems. We investigated the effect of vernal warming on the spring phenology of a key herbivore, Daphnia galeata (hereafter Daphnia), and its prey, phytoplankton, in subtropical shallow aquatic mesocosms in the presence and absence of the planktivorous fish Aristichthys nobilis, simulating food chains with two or three trophic levels. The warming effect on the timing of the spring phytoplankton peak varied with the FCL. Warming led to the disappearance of the phytoplankton peak in the 2-level systems but resulted in an extensive, delayed phytoplankton peak in the 3-level systems. Irrespective of the FCL, warming did not significantly advance the timing of the Daphnia peak, although Daphnia recruited earlier under warm conditions. Both warming and FCL significantly reduced the size of the Daphnia peak. Our study suggests that spring warming affects the plankton spring phenology in subtropical shallow lakes, but the response patterns depend on the food web structure.

AB  - Livestock grazing is among the most intensive land-use activities in grasslands, and can affect plant communities directly or indirectly via grazing-induced soil legacies. Under climate change, grasslands are threatened globally by recurrent drought. However, the extent to which drought influences grazing-induced soil legacy effects on plant biomass production and community composition remains largely unexplored. We grew five naturally co-occurring plant species (three dominants and two subordinates) in mixed communities in a glasshouse experiment in live and sterilized soil that had or had not been subjected to 19 years of grazing; these plant communities were then exposed to a subsequent drought. We tested the treatment effects on plant community biomass, proportional above-ground biomass of individual species, arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal root colonization, and soil nutrient availability. Under drought-free conditions, soils from grazed plots produced significantly higher plant above-ground and total community biomass compared to soils from ungrazed plots. In contrast, plant above-ground and total community biomass were similar between grazed and ungrazed soils under drought conditions. Similarly, soils from grazed plots increased the proportional biomass of dominant species but decreased the proportion of subordinate species; however, the proportional biomass of dominant and subordinate species was similar between grazed and ungrazed soils under drought conditions. Soil NO3--N in grazed soil was significantly higher compared to ungrazed soil. Drought dramatically increased soil NO3--N in sterilized soil and had a more pronounced increase in grazed soil than in ungrazed soil. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal root colonization from grazed soil was lower compared to ungrazed soil. Drought significantly increased the soil available phosphorus concentration, as well as plant community AM fungal root colonization. Synthesis. Our study suggests that drought can neutralize positive grazing effects on plant community biomass production via altered plant-soil interactions. Also, we found that drought can alleviate the negative effects of grazing legacies on subordinate species by reducing competitiveness of dominant species. Our study provides new insights for understanding the underlying mechanisms of grazing effects on grassland productivity under climate change.

AB  - ContextAbiotic filtering, including environmental and dispersal filtering, is frequently observed resulting in reduced diversity and more similar species assemblages following habitat fragmentation. Nonetheless, the significance of competitive exclusion is often underestimated.ObjectivesWe investigated the dominant assembly process among termite communities on land-bridge islands, focusing on species known for their high territoriality. We hypothesized that competitively superior species tend to dominate more favorable habitats, such as larger and less isolated islands. Consequently, we anticipated lower diversity and greater similarity in species assemblages than would be expected.MethodsTermite communities were surveyed using standardized transects on 24 islands. We quantified the standardized effects of island area and isolation on taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity by comparing observed patterns with randomly generated communities (i.e., stochastic process). A phylogenetic generalized linear mixed model (PGLMM) was conducted to examine species-specific responses to environmental factors and competition intensity (i.e., heterospecific abundance).ResultsWe found that taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity were lower than expected on larger and less isolated islands, suggesting that competitive exclusion was the dominant mechanism shaping termite communities in TIL. PGLMM showed that two fungus-growing species with larger body sizes increased with competition intensity, while other species exhibited negative responses. Notably, the abundance of fungus-growing species showed sharper increase with island area and decrease with isolation compared to other feeding groups. These findings demonstrate that competitively superior species prefer high-quality habitats and are more sensitive to habitat fragmentation.ConclusionsOur study highlights the significance of competitive exclusion in shaping termite communities and emphasizes the need to consider both competitive and niche difference among species or functional groups when predict changes in community structure and biodiversity loss resulting from habitat fragmentation.

AB  - Understanding how foundation species recover from disturbances is key for predicting the future of ecosystems in the Anthropocene. Coral reefs are dynamic ecosystems that can undergo rapid declines in coral abundance following disturbances. Understanding why some reefs recover quickly from these disturbances whereas others recover slowly (or not at all) gives insight into the drivers of community resilience. From 2006 to 2010 coral reefs on the fore reef of Moorea, French Polynesia, experienced severe disturbances that reduced coral cover from similar to 46% in 2005 to <1% in 2010. Following these disturbances, coral cover increased from 2010 to 2018. Although there was a rapid and widespread recovery of corals, reefs at 17 m depth recovered more slowly than reefs at 10 m depth. We investigated the drivers of different rates of coral recovery between depths from 2010 to 2018 using a combination of time-series data on coral recruitment, density, growth, and mortality in addition to field experiments testing for the effects of predation. Propagule abundance did not influence recovery, as the density of coral recruits (spat <6 months old) did not differ between depths. However, mortality of juvenile corals (<= 5 cm diameter) was higher at 17 m, leading to densities of juvenile corals 3.5 times higher at 10 m than at 17 m depth. Yet, there were no differences in the growth of corals between depths. These results point to an early life stage bottleneck after settlement, resulting in greater mortality at 17 m than at 10 m as the likely driver of differential coral recovery between depths. We used experiments and time-series data to test mechanisms that could drive different rates of juvenile coral mortality across depths, including differences in predation, competition, and the availability of suitable substratum. The results of these experiments suggested that increased coral mortality at 17 m may have been influenced by higher intensity of fish predation, and higher mortality of corals attached to unfavorable substratum. In contrast, the abundance of macroalgae, a coral competitor, did not explain differences in coral survival. Our work suggests that top-down processes and substratum quality can create bottlenecks in corals that can drive rates of coral recovery after disturbance.

AB  - Road infrastructure has severely affected the environment and wildlife. Understanding and mitigating these effects are essential conservation measures. This study aimed to evaluate fatal wildlife-vehicle collisions along an 80-km stretch of the Tapir Rocha highway (RS-040). Fieldwork was carried out between August 2015 and March 2019. Once a week, two observers were driven along the highway at an average speed of 40 km/h. All dead vertebrate sightings were investigated to document the species, carcass condition, and locations along the roadway. In total, 2,371 wild, domestic and unidentified dead animals were assessed and categorized into 137 species. The most affected classes were mammals (n = 1,223), and birds (n = 704). The most affected wild species were white-eared opossums (Didelphis albiventriss, n = 559), black-and-white tegus (Salvator merianae, n = 129), and coypus (Myocastor coypus, n = 102). The carcass exposure assessments indicated that many (n = 637) animal deaths occurred the night before our arrival and that nocturnal species may also be more vulnerable to roads. Roadkill sightings peaked in the spring (34%) and summer (25%), probably due to reproductive activity and juvenile dispersal. Seasonal variations included a 50% reduction in reptile roadkill rates in autumn winter compared to spring-summer, and a 20-percentage-point increase in the number of mammal road deaths in the winter. Thermally restricted reptile activity, and seasonal changes in carnivore food habits may explain these respective findings. Although most of the road deaths affected abundant and widely distributed species, a decrease in these populations may eventually become a conservation concern.

AB  - This study aimed to elucidate the factors contributing to the limited presence of Cheilotoma musciformis in Poland, with a specific focus on soil characteristics affecting both vegetation and insect populations. It examined how soil enzyme activity influences the occurrence of Ch. musciformis in the xerothermic grasslands of Southern Poland. Sites inhabited by the beetle were typically subject to extensive grazing by farm animals or recent bush clearance, contrasting with control plots situated on unused or overgrazed xerothermic grasslands. Soils in beetle-inhabited sites exhibited significantly higher levels of enzyme activity, total organic carbon, and total nitrogen, along with lower pHKCl compared to control sites. These findings suggest the beetle's reliance on extensively grazed xerothermic grasslands. Given that grazing practices influence the behavior of preferred host plant species, effective protection planning for Ch. musciformis-inhabited grasslands should carefully consider changes in soil biochemical properties and vegetation structure. This work attempts to find the reasons for the rather limited range of occurrence of Cheilotoma musciformis in Poland, based on soil properties, which affects both the plant cover and the entomofauna. The aim of the study was to assess the influence of soil enzyme activity on the occurrence of Ch. musciformis in xerothermic grasslands in Southern Poland. The sites inhabited by the beetle were most often extensively grazed by farm animals or had recently been cleared of bushes. The control plots were in wasteland. The soils of most sites with Ch. musciformis were characterized by significantly higher activity of the tested enzymes and higher content of total organic carbon and total nitrogen, as well as lower pHKCl compared to the control sites. The higher enzymatic activity of soils in sites with the beetle than in the control sites may indicate the dependence of the occurrence of this beetle on the presence of patches of extensively grazed xerothermic grasslands. Grazing influences the behavior of preferred host plant species. Therefore, when planning active protection of xerothermic grasslands inhabited by Ch. musciformis, changes in the biochemical properties of the soil and vegetation structure should be taken into account.

AB  - The habitat of Cinnamomum travancoricum, a critically endangered endemic vascular plant that thrives at high altitudes (1,500-3,500 m asl) and in moist environments (600-850 hPa) in Western Ghats (WG), is shrinking due to climate change (CC), increase in herbivore populations, urbanization, and over-exploitation of C. travancoricum. Cinnamomum travancoricum's current habitat and predictive range shift were modeled using MaxEnt for 2030, 2050, and 2070 CE under two emission scenarios: Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5. The 19 WorldClim bioclimatic variables, including slope, aspect, elevation data, and 16 spatially dispersed-species-occurrence points, were used to predict the potential distribution. Jackknife test identified `isothermality', `mean diurnal range', and `precipitation of the driest month' as the most impactful variables for modeling the habitat and range shift. This MaxEnt model was accurate with an area under curve (AUC) value of 0.995. This ecological model predicted a substantial range contraction in suitable habitats, with `highly suitable' and `moderately suitable' habitats shrinking by 100% in RCP 8.5, confirming that C. travancoricum is highly vulnerable to the effects of CC, making it one key species for conservation in WG. The present study suggests the restoration of existing protected areas, creation of specialized reserves, habitat connectivity, and further education towards local communities as the key adaptation strategies for conservation.

AB  - Permafrost-agroecosystems include all cultivation and pastoral activities in areas underlain by permafrost. These systems support local livelihoods and food production and are rarely considered in global agricultural studies but may become more relevant as climate change is increasing opportunities for food production in high latitude and mountainous areas. The exact locations and amount of agricultural production in areas containing permafrost are currently unknown, therefore we provide an overview of countries where both permafrost and agricultural activities are present. We highlight the socioecological diversity and complexities of permafrost-agroecosystems through seven case studies: (1) crop cultivation in Alaska, USA; (2) Indigenous food systems and crop cultivation in the Northwest Territories, Canada; (3) horse and cattle husbandry and Indigenous hay production in the Sakha Republic, Russia; (4) mobile pastoralism and husbandry in Mongolia; (5) yak pastoralism in the Central Himalaya, Nepal; (6) berry picking and reindeer herding in northern Fennoscandia; and (7) reindeer herding in northwest Russia. We discuss regional knowledge gaps associated with permafrost and make recommendations to policy makers and land users for adapting to changing permafrost environments. A better understanding of permafrost-agroecosystems is needed to help sustainably manage and develop these systems considering rapidly changing climate, environments, economies, and industries.

AB  - This study characterizes the abundance and richness of longhomed beetles (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae and Disteniidae) collected in the canopy of a dry tropical lowland forest in Panama. The nine tree species sampled included Enterolobium cyclocarpum (Jacq.) Griseb. (Fabaceae), Pseudobombac septenatum (Jacq.) Dugand (Mal vaceae), Luehea seemannii Triana & Planch. (Malvaceae), Cordia alliodora (Ruiz. & Pay.) Oken (Boraginaceae), Castilla elastica Sesse ex Cerv. (Moraceae), Anacardium excelsum (Bertero & Balb. ex Kunth) Skeels (Anacardiaceae), Cecropia peltata L. (Urticaceae). Zuelania guidonia (Sw.) Britton & Millsp. (Flacourtiaceae) and Ficus insipida Willd. (Moraceae). A total of 227 specimens of Cerambycidae and Disteniidae were collected. The most abundant species was Trestonia pulcherrima Dillon and Dillon, 1946 (23%), followed by Compsibidion vanum (Thomson, 1867) (16%). The greatest abundance and richness of beetles were recorded in the canopy of L. seemannii (90 individuals = 39%). The presence of these beetles in the forest canopy is associated with their general preference for large trees, highly complex foliar canopy architecture, and the availability of resources for the development and feeding of larvae and adults. Synchronization with plant phenology may explain the greater abundance and richness observed in L. seemannii.

AB  - The return of large carnivores to areas with strong anthropogenic impact often results in conflicts among different interest groups. One cause of conflict is that large carnivores compete with humans for wild game species. In Scandinavia, the recolonization of wolves (Canis lupus) and brown bears (Ursus arctos) has important ramifications for the harvest of an ungulate species with high economic and recreational value, the moose. We estimated wolf and brown bear predation rates on moose (Alces alces) relative to harvest, natural causes of death, and vehicle collisions within 20 wolf territories. We used data on multi-season kill rates of wolves and brown bears on moose combined with wolf territory sizes and estimates of the population density of brown bears and moose. Wolf predation rate on moose was not related to the density of moose, wolf pack size, nor kill rate but was positively related to wolf density and strongly negatively related to the abundance of moose within wolf territories. Estimated annual wolf and brown bear predation rates averaged 8.6% (range 2.8%-16.9%) and 2.3% (range 0%-12.7%) respectively, among wolf territories, whereas estimated annual harvest rates averaged 17.5% (range 8.1%-33.1%). In wolf territories with relatively high bear densities, the combined predation rates from wolves and brown bears exceeded harvest rates. Across wolf territories, harvest rates were not related to wolf predation rates or to the combined predation rates from wolves and brown bears, indicating that large carnivore predation and harvest were not compensatory to each other at this spatial level. The recolonization of these large carnivores in the Scandinavian boreal forest ecosystem may have small to significant consequences for the sustainable management of moose populations depending on the local conditions of both wolves, brown bears, and moose. Comparison of annual mortality rates for moose in our study in Scandinavia with corresponding data from areas with lower anthropogenic impact (Alaska) shows lower total mortality rates in Scandinavia. This likely results from a different age and sex composition of moose killed by wolves and brown bears versus harvest, in combination with a significant difference in the relative importance of these mortality factors between areas.

AB  - Acquiring demographic data for moose (Alces alces) can be difficult because they are solitary in nature, they prefer densely vegetated and mountainous habitats, and they often occur at low density. Such data, however, are essential for long-term population monitoring, evaluating management practices, and effective conservation. Winter aerial surveys are the standard method for estimating moose population parameters, but they can be logistically challenging, expensive, and subject to sightability correction, which necessitates the capture of study animals for initial model development. Herein, we demonstrate a noninvasive alternative approach for estimating population parameters of moose in northern Yellowstone National Park, where aerial surveys were attempted but proved ineffective. We determined individual moose genotype and sex using microsatellite polymerase chain reaction amplification of DNA extracted from fecal pellets, integrated ancillary pellet sample data (i.e., metadata) in genotype analysis to aid in the identification of matching genotypes, and used spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) modeling to estimate sex-specific density and abundance. We collected 616 samples over 3 consecutive winters (Dec 2013-Apr 2016) and within 2 sampling occasions each winter. We recorded 514 captures of 142 individual moose (69 males, 73 females). Overall density ranged between 0.062 moose/km(2) and 0.076 moose/km(2) and averaged 0.034/km(2) for females and 0.033/km(2) for males. Abundance estimates were 150 moose in 2013 (female = 76, 95% CI = 55-105; male = 74, 95% CI = 54-103), 186 in 2014 (female = 95, 95% CI = 63-142; male = 91, 95% CI = 60-138), and 160 in 2015 (female = 79, 95% CI = 58-108; male = 81, 95% CI = 59-110). Average population sex ratio was 0.99 males/female. We demonstrate that SECR analysis of fecal DNA genotypes, using metadata in genotype analysis to help identify matching moose genotypes, is a promising alternative method for estimating sex-specific density and abundance of a low-density moose population in a mountainous and forested landscape.

AB  - Simple Summary Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for COVID-19, primarily spreads among humans, but there have been cases of transmission between humans and animals, as well as some instances of animal-to-animal transmission. Several zoos have reported cases of large cats such as tigers and lions, gorillas, and other animal species testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, presumably due to contact with humans. White-tailed deer (WTD) are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and are prevalent throughout the United States with a high population density. Separately, there is limited research and reporting on the susceptibility of bison, elk, and other wildlife species to SARS-CoV-2. This study determines the SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence for various captive wildlife, elk, and bison, across different regions in the United States, using several serological tests. The presence of neutralizing antibodies to the virus in cheetahs, gorillas, lions, hippopotamuses, elk, and bison indicates that they are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. This highlights the importance of continuous monitoring of the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in various species that come into close contact with humans.Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for COVID-19, has been found to infect various domestic and wild animal species. In this study, convenience serum samples from 575 bison, 180 elk, and 147 samples from various wildlife species collected between 2020 and 2023 from several regions in the United States were analyzed for the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. Two commercial ELISA assays based on the inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (sVNT) or the nucleocapsid protein (N-ELISA) of SARS-CoV-2 were used. Positive samples from the sVNT were additionally evaluated using a conventional virus neutralization test (VNT). Our results indicated that 1.2% of bison, 2.2% of elk, and 4.1% of the other wildlife species serum samples were seropositive in the sVNT, whereas 4.2% of bison, 3.3% of elk, and 1.4% of the other captive wildlife species serum samples tested positive by the N-ELISA. Among the sVNT serum samples, two samples from bison, one sample from elk, and five serum samples from other wildlife species (one cheetah, one gorilla, two lions, and one hippopotamus) had neutralizing antibody titers in the VNT, indicating these species are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. These findings highlight the importance of broad surveillance efforts for the effective monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 in non-human hosts.

AB  - Direct and indirect impacts by invasive animals on plants and other animals through predation and competition have been evidenced in many ecosystems. For instance, the rabbitfish Siganus rivulatus, originating from the Red Sea, is now the most abundant species in costal habitats of South-Eastern Mediterranean Sea where it overgrazes algae. However, little is known about its impacts on microbes through release of metabolic wastes and feces. We used a mesocosm experiment to test the effect of S. rivulatus on planktonic and benthic microbial communities. Excretion of dissolved nutrients by fish resulted in higher concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (NH4, NO2/NO3). This increase in availability of N was associated with higher N content in macroalgae, higher biomass of phytoplankton, higher abundance of bacterioplankton and shift in the structure of planktonic bacterial communities. The feces released mostly under the shelters where the fish rest at night, led to significant increases in diversity of sediment bacterial communities and shifts in their structure. The impact of S. rivulatus on planktonic microbes was related to the indirect bottom-up effect induced by excreted dissolved nutrients while its effect on benthic microbes was due to the direct release of both organic matter and microbes present in feces. Overall, this first evidence of the impacts of invasive species on planktonic and benthic microbes highlights that ongoing changes in fish biodiversity could have ecosystem-wide consequences.

AB  - In Poland, bovine tuberculosis (BTB) is most often detected in cattle, although some cases have also been reported in pigs and in other non-domestic species. BTB is believed to be mainly present in the Bieszczady region, in the south-eastern part of the country. The present study analyses the practical applications of the law regarding the eradication of tuberculosis among European bison in Poland, as well as the influence of legal rules in species conservation effects. Its aim is to present and evaluate the effectiveness of legal provisions in selected cases of BTB detected in European bison. The analysis highlights key "critical points" in the management of cases of BTB in European bison, which resulted from the problematic interpretation and application of the existing legal provisions. Findings indicate that before the Animal Health Law, the eradication of BTB in European bison in Poland was not regulated clearly enough by the applicable laws in force prior to 2021. This posed a threat to an effective reintroduction strategy for bison based on creating larger metapopulations and maintaining small, isolated reservoir herds (breading centers) for fallback in the case of infectious disease. It should be emphasized that in the current legal system, there is no doubt that a District Veterinary Officer has the competence to prevent and control tuberculosis in European bison.

AB  - The leopard Panthera pardus is in range-wide decline, and many populations are highly threatened. Prey depletion is a major cause of global carnivore declines, but the response of leopard survival and density to this threat is unclear: by reducing the density of a dominant competitor (the lion Panthera leo) prey depletion could create both costs and benefits for subordinate competitors. We used capture-recapture models fitted to data from a 7-year camera-trap study in Kafue National Park, Zambia, to obtain baseline estimates of leopard population density and sex-specific apparent survival rates. Kafue is affected by prey depletion, and densities of large herbivores preferred by lions have declined more than the densities of smaller herbivores preferred by leopards. Lion density is consequently low. Estimates of leopard density were comparable to ecosystems with more intensive protection and favourable prey densities. However, our study site is located in an area with good ecological conditions and high levels of protection relative to other portions of the ecosystem, so extrapolating our estimates across the Park or into adjacent Game Management Areas would not be valid. Our results show that leopard density and survival within north-central Kafue remain good despite prey depletion, perhaps because (1) prey depletion has had weaker effects on preferred leopard prey compared to larger prey preferred by lions, and (2) the density of dominant competitors is consequently low. Our results show that the effects of prey depletion can be more complex than uniform decline of all large carnivore species, and warrant further investigation.

AB  - High-quality ground-truth data are critical for developing reliable Earth Observation (EO) based geospatial products. Conventional methods of collecting these data are either subject to an unknown amount of human error and bias or require extended time in the field to complete (i.e., point-intercept assessments). Digital photograph classification (DPC) may address these drawbacks. In this study, we first assess the performance of a DPC method developed through licensed software to estimate ground cover percentage (%) of bright lichens, a critical caribou forage in fall and winter when other food resources are scarce. We then evaluate the feasibility of replicating this workflow in an open-source environment with a modified U-net model to improve processing time and scalability. Our results indicate that DPC is appropriate for generating ground-truth data in support of large-scale EO-based lichen mapping within the boreal forests of eastern Canada. Our final open-sourced classification model, Lichen Convolutional Neural Network (LiCNN), is comparably accurate yet more efficient than the licensed workflow. Therefore, the LiCNN approach successfully addresses the mentioned shortcomings of conventional ground-truth data collection methods efficiently and without the need for specialized software.

AB  - The question of how local adaptation takes place remains a fundamental question in evolutionary biology. The variation of allele frequencies in genes under selection over environmental gradients remains mainly theoretical and its empirical assessment would help understanding how adaptation happens over environmental clines. To bring new insights to this issue we set up a broad framework which aimed to compare the adaptive trajectories over environmental clines in two domesticated mammal species co-distributed in diversified landscapes. We sequenced the genomes of 160 sheep and 161 goats extensively managed along environmental gradients, including temperature, rainfall, seasonality and altitude, to identify genes and biological processes shaping local adaptation. Allele frequencies at putatively adaptive loci were rarely found to vary gradually along environmental gradients, but rather displayed a discontinuous shift at the extremities of environmental clines. Of the 430 candidate adaptive genes identified, only 6 were orthologous between sheep and goats and those responded differently to environmental pressures, suggesting different putative mechanisms involved in local adaptation in these two closely related species. Interestingly, the genomes of the 2 species were impacted differently by the environment, genes related to signatures of selection were most related to altitude, slope and rainfall seasonality for sheep, and summer temperature and spring rainfall for goats. The diversity of candidate adaptive pathways may result from a high number of biological functions involved in the adaptations to multiple eco-climatic gradients, and a differential role of climatic drivers on the two species, despite their co-distribution along the same environmental gradients. This study describes empirical examples of clinal variation in putatively adaptive alleles with different patterns in allele frequency distributions over continuous environmental gradients, thus showing the diversity of genetic responses in adaptive landscapes and opening new horizons for understanding genomics of adaptation in mammalian species and beyond.

AB  - Wild boar (Sus scrofa) seriously threatens agricultural production and rural livelihoods worldwide. Human-wild boar conflict has become an important research topic. We investigated the impact of wild boars on local livelihoods and rural community's responses to the impact, based on a case study in Fu'an City, Fujian Province, Southeast China. We conducted a questionnaire survey of 152 rural households in six villages of Fu'an City. Results demonstrated that the overall impact of wild boars on livelihoods was significant; however, there was impact heterogeneity depending on the mentioned factors. The impact lied on the scale of agricultural output value and the extent of livelihood dependency on susceptible crops. Different impacts resulted in discrepant countermeasures of rural households in dealing with wild boars. The magnitude of economic losses caused by wild boars to a great extent determined the selection of prevention measures. Rural households with more economic losses tend to adopt costly and effective prevention measures, such as fencing and human guarding. Recommendations were put forward to address the human-wild boar conflicts in China.

AB  - During predator-prey coexistence, prey species have developed anti-predator behavior to reduce predation risk. In terrestrial ecosystems, humans are the major predators of wild cervids (Cervidae, Cetartiodactyla, Mammalia) in regions where large carnivores have gone extinct due to anthropogenic persecution. Typical anti-predator behavior exhibited by wild cervids includes increasing nocturnality and vigilance. We investigated diel activity and vigilance in sika deer (Cervus nippon) in nonhunting areas using camera-trapping techniques, to determine whether human visitation (i.e., nonlethal effects) increases their nocturnality and vigilance. We established two study sites--inside (low risk) and outside (high risk) of a wildlife reserve at University of Tokyo Chichibu Forest, Saitama, Japan. We hypothesized that in sika deer, nocturnality and vigilance would increase at high-risk site (outside of the reserve), due to the high rate of human visitation. However, vigilance level and diel activity between the two study sites were not different. In female deer, vigilance increased in winter regardless of the site studied. Our findings suggest that hunting activities (e.g., drive hunting with dogs) outside of the studied areas triggered anti-predator behaviors, such as increased vigilance, in sika deer, although our studied sites were not designated as hunting area. Further studies need to elucidate what types of human activities and intensity levels trigger anti-predator behaviors by wild ungulates.

AB  - Urbanization is increasing worldwide, fragmenting, isolating or destroying native habitats with a subsequent loss of biodiversity, structural and compositional changes of biotic communities and weakening of the functioning of biological processes and ecosystem services. In urban ecosystems, terrestrial mammals provide important functions and services, but we do not have a synthesis of the impacts of urbanization on terrestrial mammals. Terrestrial mammals are vulnerable to habitat loss and modification caused by urbanization, thus we hypothesised that the abundance and diversity of mammals would decrease as urbanization progresses. In addition, due to the declining number of predators and thus to decreasing predation pressure in urban habitats, we assumed that herbivore and omnivore mammals would gain dominance. To clarify the inconsistency of previous urbanization studies on terrestrial mammals, we synthetized and re-evaluated published results by meta-analysis. Based on 50 rural-urban comparisons, terrestrial mammals were not significantly more abundant or diverse in rural than urban habitats. This was not only found at the community level, but also at the level of taxonomic groups (carnivores, marsupials, rodents), feeding habit (carnivorous, herbivorous or omnivorous species) or at the level of their interactions. Our results suggest that the studied urban-dwelling mammal species are probably well adapted to environmental conditions and pressures accompanied by urbanization via individual-level adaptation.

AB  - Cameras are important tools used to determine nest fate, identify predators and evaluate behaviour; however, they may impact the parameters they are used to measure, thereby biasing results. We evaluated the impact of cameras similar to 10 m from the nest on shorebird nest survival at the Canning River Delta, Alaska, 2017-2018 (n(control) = 122, n(camera) = 109) using a much larger sample size than in previous studies conducted in the Arctic and random assignments at nest discovery. We found no effect of camera presence at the nest on daily nest survival (model-averaged daily survival rate (DSR) 85% confidence interval (CI); control: 0.971-0.983, camera: 0.969-0.982). We suggest that nest survival studies of tundra-nesting birds should consider the use of cameras to minimize researcher disturbance, increase the accuracy of fate assignments, and broaden the ecological data collected (e.g. incubation behaviour, predator identification and non-anthropogenic non-predation disruption such as by caribou).

AB  - Subtropical monsoon grasslands in Asia are commonly in a fire-dominated state with tall grasses (> 2 m) that provide poor-quality forage for mammalian herbivores. In contrast, small patches of grazing lawns with short, nutritious grasses are sparsely distributed within these subtropical monsoon grasslands. Despite the importance of grazing lawns in providing high-quality forage for mammalian herbivores, the process of formation and maintenance of grazing lawns has not been studied in the monsoon grasslands of subtropical Asia. We conducted a large-scale multi-year experiment in subtropical monsoon grasslands within a protected area in Nepal to examine whether mowing tall grasses at different frequencies and spatial scales, along with the application of chemical fertilisers (urea or single superphosphate), could change tall grasslands into grazing lawns. We found that nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in grasses increased to levels exceeding the minimum maintenance requirements for ruminants in 3600 m(2) plots that were mown four times and fertilised. The concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus remained below the minimum maintenance level for ruminants in unfertilised and unmown plots and in small plots that were four-time mown and fertilised. The frequently mown plots exhibited a significant increase in the proportion of ground cover of lawn grass, from 1% to 3%, and a corresponding decrease in the proportion of ground cover of tall grasses, from 24% to 1%. These results supported our hypothesis that frequent mowing at a larger spatial scale with the addition of chemical fertilisers and grazing leads to the inception of grazing lawns that are favourable for wild herbivores. However, the persistence of the grazing lawns presents challenges due to the highly productive monsoon season and the functional extinction of large bulk grazers. To our knowledge, this is the first empirical study conducted in the subtropical monsoon grasslands of Asia to experimentally demonstrate the importance of active management for the initiation of grazing lawns. Our findings have important implications for the management of subtropical monsoon grasslands.

AB  - AimsSoil nematode are valuable biological indicators of soil health. Studying soil nematode communities helps understanding the responses of the structure and functional of soil food web to different fertilization methods.MethodsWe conducted a randomized group fertilization study in Lei bamboo forests using nine treatments: consisting of pig manure organic fertilizer (A), chicken manure organic fertilizer (B), cow manure organic fertilizer (C), and oilcake (D), organic fertilizer mixtures, AD, BD, CD as well as a formulated inorganic fertilizer (E), and there was no fertilization measure as control (CK). We investigated the effect of different fertilizer application on soil nematode community structure.ResultsExcept for treatments D and E, all fertilization methods increased the proportion of soil nematode community c-p 3-5. In D and CK treatments, the dominant trophic group of nematodes was bacterivores. However, in all other fertilization methods, the dominant trophic group was plant parasitic nematodes. Redundancy analysis showed that soil available phosphorus content was a significant factor affecting the composition of soil nematode communities, and soil total phosphorus content was a significant factor affecting nematode trophic groups. Fertilization could directly affect the composition of plant parasites, or indirectly affect plant parasites by affecting soil hydrolyzed nitrogen, available phosphorus, and bamboo shoot yield.ConclusionsOur study demonstrated that fertilization significantly increased bamboo shoot yield, and whether applying pig manure or oil cake significantly increased the diversity of soil bacterial communities. Soil available phosphorus content was a key factor affecting the composition and abundance of soil nematode community.

AB  - The grazing management of alpine meadows is very important for grassland health. In order to explore the optimal rest grazing period in cold season pasture of alpine meadows of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), the critical period of soil thawing-grass withering period (RP1), the later period of soil thawing-grass withering period (RP2), the initial period of grass regreening-grass withering period (RP3), the later period of grass regreening-grass withering period (RP4) and local traditional rest grazing (dominant plant height 5 cm-grass withering period) (RP5) was set in the Tianzhu alpine meadow on the eastern edge of the QTP. RP1 improved Gramineae and Cyperaceae coverage 140% and 37.80%, respectively, Cyperaceae aboveground biomass 58.52%, the total aboveground biomass 22.86%, and poisonous plants aboveground biomass was lower 29.39% than that in RP3. The Richness index and Shannon-Wiener index for the RP1 plant community were 12.12-24.72% and 2.46-19.75% higher than those in other rest grazing periods, respectively. The Simpson diversity index was 1.10% higher in RP1 than that in RP3, and the Pielou evenness index was 3.30% higher in RP1 than that in RP5. The neutral detergent fiber and acid detergent fiber contents of the plant increased with advanced rest grazing periods, being the highest in RP2. Crude protein, crude fat, and crude ash contents were the highest in RP5. The amount and digestible protein grazing capacities in RP1 were higher by 1.67-4.49 and 3.61-8.36 sheep units.ha(-1), respectively, than those in other rest grazing periods. RP1 rest grazing optimized the plant community structure, improved grassland productivity and plant community diversity, with a more stable plant community structure and higher grazing capacity. Therefore, the cold season pastures should be managed with a rest grazing in RP1 for the sustainable utilization of grassland ecosystem.

AB  - In northern Eurasia, large carnivores overlap with semi-domestic reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) and moose (Alces alces). In Scandinavia, previous studies have quantified brown bear (Ursus arctos) spring predation on neonates of reindeer (mostly in May) and moose (mostly in June). We explored if habitat selection by brown bears changed following resource pulses and whether these changes are more pronounced on those individuals characterised by higher predatory behaviour. Fifteen brown bears in northern Sweden (2010-2012) were fitted with GPS proximity collars, and 2585 female reindeers were collared with UHF transmitters. Clusters of bear positions were visited to investigate moose and reindeer predation. Bear kill rates and home ranges were calculated to examine bear movements and predatory behaviour. Bear habitat selection was modelled using resource selection functions over four periods (pre-calving, reindeer calving, moose calving, and post-calving). Coefficients of selection for areas closer to different land cover classes across periods were compared, examining the interactions between different degrees of predatory behaviour (i.e., high and low). Bear habitat selection differed throughout the periods and between low and high predatory bears. Differences among individuals' predatory behaviour are reflected in the selection of habitat types, providing empirical evidence that different levels of specialization in foraging behaviour helps to explain individual variation in bear habitat selection.

AB  - Arizona pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) population numbers have declined over the last century due to unregulated-harvest, population fragmentation, urban expansion, and habitat loss. Captive breeding, reintroductions, and translocations have helped to curb decline and boost population numbers of the endangered Sonoran subspecies (A. a. sonoriensis). To assess the effect of on-going management actions on the Sonoran subspecies, we collected multi-locus genotype data and performed tests of genetic differentiation and population structure in comparison to the non-endangered American subspecies (A. a. americana). We provide updated estimates of genetic diversity and relatedness to serve as a benchmark for future management toward further recovery of Sonoran pronghorn. Management actions have upheld distinction between the two subspecies in Arizona and stemmed further genetic diversity loss while avoiding an increase in inbreeding within the captive-bred Sonoran population.

AB  - BackgroundAnimal movement arises from complex interactions between animals and their heterogeneous environment. To better understand the movement process, it can be divided into behavioural, temporal and spatial components. Although methods exist to address those various components, it remains challenging to integrate them in a single movement analysis.MethodsWe present an analytic workflow that integrates the behavioural, temporal and spatial components of the movement process and their interactions, which also allows for the assessment of the relative importance of those components. We construct a daily cyclic covariate to represent temporally cyclic movement patterns, such as diel variation in activity, and combine the three components in a multi-modal Hidden Markov Model framework using existing methods and R functions. We compare the trends and statistical fits of models that include or exclude any of the behavioural, spatial and temporal components, and perform variance partitioning on the model predictions that included all components to assess their relative importance to the movement process, both in isolation and in interaction.ResultsWe apply our workflow to a case study on the movements of plains zebra, blue wildebeest and eland antelope in a South African reserve. Behavioural modes impacted movement the most, followed by diel rhythms and then the spatial environment (viz. tree cover and terrain slope). Interactions between the components often explained more of the movement variation than the marginal effect of the spatial environment did on its own. Omitting components from the analysis led either to the inability to detect relationships between input and response variables, resulting in overgeneralisations when drawing conclusions about the movement process, or to detections of questionable relationships that appeared to be spurious.ConclusionsOur analytic workflow can be used to integrate the behavioural, temporal and spatial components of the movement process and quantify their relative contributions, thereby preventing incomplete or overly generic ecological interpretations. We demonstrate that understanding the drivers of animal movement, and ultimately the ecological phenomena that emerge from it, critically depends on considering the various components of the movement process, and especially the interactions between them.

AB  - Recent advances in biotelemetry allow monitoring of large mammals with varying neck sizes across multiple ecological phases (e.g., summer survival, dispersal, winter habitat use). Current collar technologies allow for use on neonatal ungulates such as white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). However, assessment of the function and overall retention of recent technology is warranted. Our objectives were to evaluate the retention rates of collar designs, determine factors affecting retention (e.g., mass, sex), and assess global positioning system (GPS) collar function (e.g., fix success rate, mean linear error) on wild neonatal deer in grassland and forested habitat types. We fit 75 (39 females, 36 males) and 82 (33 females, 49 males) white-tailed deer fawns with expandable GPS collars of 2 different collar designs 2021 (V1) and 2022 (V2), respectively. Collar retention issues included caught on fences, broken collar, and premature expansion. Collar retention at 3 months of age was 88% and 91% in 2021 and 2022, respectively, declining to 41% and 59% by 1 year of age. Older fawns at capture were less likely to retain their collar, such that for every 1 day increase in fawn age at capture, the odds of collar failure increased by 52%. We found no evidence that sex or birth size affected retention. Fix success rate was high (similar to 97%) and showed no evidence of variation by canopy cover. However, location error was greater (beta = -7.7, 95% CI = -5.92--9.39) in forested ((x) over bar = 12.7 m) versus grassland ((x) over bar = 5.1 m) habitat type. Both collar designs (V1, V2) functioned well and would allow for assessing spring and summer survival and cause-specific mortality for fawns collared at birth. However, collar failures often occurred after 6 months of age, which may reduce sample sizes necessary to examine dispersal, migration, and first year survival. We recommend researchers consider their specific ecological questions (e.g., summer survival, dispersal) and account for potential retention issues (e.g., barbed-wire fences, thick cover) when determining sample size. We also recommend continued interaction with collar companies to refine collar designs and enhance function of neonatal expandable collars.

TI  - The MIS 3-2 environments of the middle Kolyma Basin: implications for the Ice Age peopling of northeast Arctic Siberia
T2  - BOREAS
LA  - English
AB  - The Kolyma region is historically famous for the unique finds of large Pleistocene fauna, yet, until very recently, absent of the time-corresponding occupation sites. Quaternary geology and palaeontology investigations (2013-2019) in the middle reaches of the Kolyma River (NE Yakutia) have delivered new evidence on the Last Glacial (MIS 4-2) to Early Holocene sub-arctic ecosystems and the past landscape dynamics retrieved from the fossiliferous bodies exposed from thawed grounds. The palaeoecology multi-proxies from the MIS 3 (55-24 ka) cryolithic formations document riparian, larch-dominated northern forests and open parklands with backwater channels, marshlands and lakes. The abundant skeletal remains of Pleistocene ungulates and carnivores, as well as relic flora point to long-term biomass-rich interstadial ecosystems and favourable Palaeolithic occupation habitats. Utilized animal bones, worked mammoth ivory and stone tools show the presence of pre-modern humans in the northeast Russian Arctic >45 000 years ago. Flaked mammoth tusks suggest persistence of settlement during the Last Glacial Maximum in xeric and extremely cold (sub)arctic tundra. The postglacial climate shifts triggered major environmental and hydrological transformations. The final Pleistocene/Early Holocene warming brought restructuring of the Last Ice Age landscape and vanishing of the periglacial tundra-steppe replaced by the present-day larch-dominated Siberian taiga. The mid-Last Glacial human ecology records from the geographical limits of northeast Siberia have fundamental relevance for the reconstructions of the time trajectories and the natural conditions of peopling of Beringia.

AB  - Maternal lineages of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) are recognized as important components of intra and interspecific biodiversity and help us to disclose the phylogeny and divergence times of many taxa. Species of the genus Capra are canonical mountain dwellers. Among these is the Siberian ibex (Capra sibirica), which is regarded as a relic species whose intraspecific classification has been controversial so far. We collected 58 samples in Xinjiang, China, and analyzed the mtDNA genes to shed light on the intraspecific relationships of the C. sibirica populations and estimate the divergence time. Intriguingly, we found that the mtDNA sequences of C. sibirica split into two main lineages in both phylogenetic and network analyses: the Southern lineage, sister to Capra falconeri, consisting of samples from Ulugqat, Kagilik (both in Xinjiang), India, and Tajikistan; and the Northern lineage further divided into four monophyletic clades A-D corresponding to their geographic origins. Samples from Urumqi, Sawan, and Arturk formed a distinct monophyletic clade C within the Northern lineage. The genetic distance between the C. sibirica clades ranges from 3.0 to 8.6%, with values of F-ST between 0.839 and 0.960, indicating notable genetic differentiation. The split of the genus Capra occurred approximately 6.75 Mya during the late Miocene. The Northern lineage diverged around 5.88 Mya, followed by the divergence of Clades A-D from 3.30 to 1.92 Mya during the late Pliocene and early Pleistocene. The radiation between the Southern lineage and C. falconeri occurred at 2.29 Mya during the early Pleistocene. Our results highlight the importance of extensive sampling when relating to genetic studies of alpine mammals and call for further genomic studies to draw definitive conclusions.

AB  - Implementation of nature into urban areas provides resting, breeding, watering, feeding and movement opportunities for urban wildlife, whose knowledge of spatial ecology is still incomplete. This article focuses on space use by urban wild boar Sus scrofa in the central part of the Bordeaux Metropolis (France). We used species distribution modelling to assess urban ecological niche of wild boars and to identify landscape features that they select or avoid. We created a database based on field surveys carried out on a sample of grid cells where evidence of boar presence was recorded. We used logistic regression models to predict wild boar presence in the study area. Our results showed that the probability of boar presence was driven by access to resources and modulated by avoidance of densely built-up areas. In contrast, urban boars appeared to be indifferent to habitat fragmentation and secondary roads. Finally, a large part of the urbanistic urban green frame of Bordeaux was likely to support wild boar. These results provide a first picture of the situation, but must be considered as a first stage of investigations on the spatial ecology of urban boars. They also need to be placed in a broader socio-ecological context. From a life science perspective, urban wild boars provide an excellent example of urban wildlife adaptation. However, human-wildlife coexistence also raises planning, management, socio-cultural and ethical issues. We argue that objectifying wildlife use of urban space is a prerequisite to implement meaningful management measures. With this in mind, we proposed and discussed a simple protocol that could be adapted to other species whose urban ranges are poorly known.

AB  - Size-structured differences in resource use stabilize species coexistence in animal communities, but what behavioral mechanisms underpin these niche differences? Behavior is constrained by morphological and physiological traits that scale allometrically with body size, yet the degree to which behaviors exhibit allometric scaling remains unclear; empirical datasets often encompass broad variation in environmental context and phylogenetic history, which complicates the detection and interpretation of scaling relationships between size and behavior. We studied the movement and foraging behaviors of three sympatric, congeneric spiral-horned antelope species (Tragelaphus spp.) that differ in body mass-bushbuck (26-40 kg), nyala (57-83 kg), and kudu (80-142 kg)-in an African savanna ecosystem where (i) food was patchily distributed due to ecosystem engineering by fungus-farming termites and (ii) predation risk was low due to the extirpation of several large carnivores. Because foraging behavior is directly linked to traits that scale allometrically with size (e.g., metabolic rate, locomotion), we hypothesized that habitat use and diet selection would likewise exhibit nonlinear scaling relationships. All three antelope species selected habitat near termitaria, which are hotspots of abundant, high-quality forage. Experimental removal of forage from termite mounds sharply reduced use of those mounds by bushbuck, confirming that habitat selection was resource driven. Strength of selection for termite mounds scaled negatively and nonlinearly with body mass, as did recursion (frequency with which individuals revisited locations), whereas home-range area and mean step length scaled positively and nonlinearly with body mass. All species disproportionately ate mound-associated plant taxa; nonetheless, forage selectivity and dietary composition, richness, and quality all differed among species, reflecting the partitioning of shared food resources. Dietary protein exhibited the theoretically predicted negative allometric relationship with body mass, whereas digestible-energy content scaled positively. Our results demonstrate cryptic size-based separation along spatial and dietary niche axes-despite superficial similarities among species-consistent with the idea that body-size differentiation is driven by selection for divergent resource-acquisition strategies, which in turn underpin coexistence. Foraging and space-use behaviors were nonlinearly related to body mass, supporting the hypothesis that behavior scales allometrically with size. However, explaining the variable functional forms of these relationships is a challenge for future research.

AB  - Estimation of changes in abundances and densities is essential for the research, management, and conservation of animal populations. Recently, technological advances have facilitated the surveillance of animal populations through the adoption of passive sensors, such as camera traps (CT). Several methods, including the random encounter model (REM), have been developed for estimating densities of unmarked populations but require additional information. Hierarchical abundance models, such as the N-mixture model (NMM), can estimate abundances without performing additional fieldwork but do not explicitly estimate the area effectively sampled. This obscures the interpretation of its densities and requires its users to focus on relative measures of abundance instead. Hence, the main objective of our study is to evaluate if REM and NMM yield consistent results qualitatively. Therefore, we compare relative trends: (i) between species, (ii) between years and (iii) across years obtained from annual density/abundance estimates of three species (fox, wild boar and red deer) in central Spain monitored by a camera trapping network for five consecutive winter periods. We reveal that NMM and REM provided density estimates in the same order of magnitude for wild boar, but not for foxes and red deer. Assuming a Poisson detection process in the NMM was important to control for inflation of abundance estimates for frequently detected species. Both methods consistently ranked density/abundance across species (between species trend), but did not always agree on relative ranks of yearly estimates within a single population (between years trend), nor on its linear population trends across years (across years trend). Our results suggest that relative trends are generally consistent when the range of variability is large, but can become inconsistent when the range of variability is smaller.

AB  - Context The population of introduced fallow deer (Dama dama) is thought to have increased exponentially across much of the island of Tasmania, Australia, since 2000. Historically, deer management decisions have relied on population trend data from vehicular spotlight surveys. Renewed focus on the contemporary management of the species requires development of more robust and precise population estimation methodology. Aims This study demonstrates two aerial survey methods - conventional counts by trained human observers, and thermal imaging footage recorded during the same flights - to inform future survey practices. Methods Conventional counts were carried out by three observers, two seated on the left side of the helicopter, and one on the right. A high-resolution thermal camera was fitted to the helicopter and was orientated to meet the assumptions of distance sampling methodologies. Both survey methods were used to generate deer population density estimates. Spatial distribution of deer was also analysed in relation to patches of remnant native vegetation across an agricultural landscape. Mark-recapture distance sampling was used to estimate density from human observer counts and provide a comparison to the distance sampling estimates derived from the thermal camera. Key results Human observer counts gave a density estimate of 2.7 deer per km(2), while thermal camera counts provided an estimate of 2.8 deer per km(2). Deer population density estimates calculated via both methods were similar, but variability of the thermal camera estimate (coefficient of variation (CV) of 36%) was unacceptably high. Human observer data was within acceptable bounds of variability (CV, 19%). The estimated population size in central and north-eastern Tasmania for 2019 approximated 53,000 deer. Deer were primarily congregated within 200 metres of the interface between canopy cover and open pasture. Conclusions The population density estimate provides a baseline for monitoring and managing the Tasmanian deer population. Human observer data was more precise than thermal camera data in this study, but thermal counts could be improved by reducing sources of variability. Implications Improvements for the collection of thermal imagery are recommended. Future control efforts may be more efficient if they preferentially target habitat edges at this time of year, paired with random or grid-based searches where population density is lower.

AB  - Indirect effects resulting from species sharing the same enemy can shape spatio-temporal variations in species occurrence. The strength of such effects remains poorly known in natural communities composed of species from different trophic levels interacting in heterogeneous landscapes. Benefiting from a well-known arctic vertebrate community and marked spatio-temporal variations in the density of key prey species, we examined the effects of direct predator-prey and indirect predator-mediated effects on species occurrence in the landscape. We found both positive effects of one prey (lemmings), as well as negative indirect effects of another prey (colonial nesting snow geese) on the occurrence of species (ground-nesting birds) belonging to different guilds and trophic levels but sharing a common predator (arctic fox). However, species using prey refuges available in the landscape were not or less affected by predator-mediated effects. Similarly, the smallest (a passerine) and the largest and most dangerous species (an owl) for the shared predator were not affected by these effects. Our study provides one of the rare empirical evidence of predator-mediated effects ascending the food web (i.e. negative indirect effect of an herbivore on avian predators) and underlines how habitat structure and species traits can modulate the strength of indirect effects in natural communities.

AB  - 1. Plants leave legacy effects in the soil they grow in, which can drive important vegetation processes, including productivity, community dynamics and species turnover. Plants at the same time also face continuous pressure posed by insect herbivores. Given the intimate interactions between plants and herbivores in ecosystems, plant identity and herbivory are likely to interactively shape soil legacies. However, the mechanisms that drive such legacy effects on future generations of plants and associated herbivores are little known.
   2. In a greenhouse study, we exposed 10 common grasses and non-leguminous forbs individually to insect herbivory by two closely related noctuid caterpillars, Mamestra brassicae and Trichoplusia ni (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) or kept them free of herbivores. We then used the soil legacies created by these plant individuals to grow a plant community composed of all 10 plant species in each soil and exposed these plant communities to M. brassicae, We measured conditioning plant biomass, soil respiration and chemistry of the conditioned soils, as well as individual plant, plant community and herbivore biomass responses.
   3. At the end of the conditioning phase, soils with herbivore legacies had higher soil respiration, but only significantly so for M. brassicae. Herbivore legacies had minimal impacts on community productivity. However, path models reveal that herbivore-induced soil legacies affected responding herbivores through changes in plant community shoot: root ratios. Soil legacy effect patterns differed between functional groups. We found strong plant species and functional group-specific effects on soil respiration parameters, which in turn led to plant community shifts in grass: forb biomass ratios. Soil legacies were negative for the growth of plants of the same functional group.
   4. Synthesis. We show that insect herbivory, plant species and their functional groups, all incur soil microbial responses that lead to subtle (herbivory) (plants and their functional group) effects in response plant communities and associated polyphagous herbivores. Hence, even though typically ignored, our study emphasizes that legacies of previous insect herbivory in the soil can influence current soil-plant-insect community interactions.

AB  - Introduction Megaprojects are strategically envisioned to boost regional development. Still, they drive ecosystem changes that generate ecological impacts in space and time beyond construction sites, particularly those established in rural regions, as their economic goals often trigger broader landuse changes. These distal ecological impacts are frequently overlooked, but their evaluation is critical to assess changes in ecosystem services that provide quality of life to the local people. To understand the effects on ecosystem services, this study analyzed both the proximal and distal impacts of the "Tren Maya" railroad megaproject.Methods Using InVest models, which provide spatial quantitative analysis using land use information, among other variables. We evaluated three ecosystem services: habitat quality, pollination, and carbon sequestration across the Yucat & aacute;n Peninsula, Mexico. We assessed historical (2002) and recent (2017) ecosystem services. We projected three scenarios to 2050: (a) future without train, land use change using previous trends, (b) proximal impacts of the Tren Maya, and (c) combined proximal and distal impacts of the Tren Maya.Results Results show significant declines of all evaluated ecosystem services in the three future scenarios, with the most pronounced reductions with distal impacts. Ecosystem types have different impacts, where tropical rainforests and tropical dry forest are the most affected. Geographically, the northwestern region of the Peninsula (the most populated) is more affected, while protected areas in the southern region mitigate some impacts.Discussion The analysis shows that distal impacts are more significant in the habitat quality than the other two ecosystem services evaluated. Our findings underscore the need for megaproject evaluations to incorporate both proximal and distal impacts to ensure sustainable development.

AB  - Urbanisation alters biodiversity patterns and threatens to disrupt mutualistic interactions. Aside from pollination, however, little is known about how mutualisms change in cities. Our study aimed to assess how urbanisation affects the protective mutualism between ants and aphids, investigating potential behavioural changes in mutualistic ants and their implications for aphids in urban environments. To do so, we studied the protective mutualism between the pink tansy aphid (Metopeurum fuscoviride) and the black garden ant (Lasius niger) along an urbanisation gradient in Berlin, Germany. In nine locations along this gradient, we measured aphid colony dynamics and proxies for parasitism, quantified the investment of ants in tending aphids and conducted behavioural assays to test the aggressiveness of ant responses to a simulated attack on the aphids. We found that aphid colonies flourished and were equally tended by ants across the urbanisation gradient, with a consistent positive density dependence between aphid and ant numbers. However, ants from more urbanised sites responded more aggressively to the simulated attack. Our findings suggest that this protective mutualism is not only maintained in the city, but that ants might even rely more on it and defend it more aggressively, as other food resources may become scarce and more unpredictable with urbanisation. We thereby provide unique insights into this type of mutualism in the city, further diversifying the growing body of work on mutualisms across urbanisation gradients.

AB  - The recent decline of Phragmites australis stands in the Mississippi River Delta is due, in part, to damage from herbivory by the non-native roseau cane scale, Nipponaclerda biwakoensis. In Louisiana, P. australis communities, known locally as roseau cane, protect the marsh ecosystem from erosion and storm-related impacts, stabilize shipping channels, and shield oil and inland infrastructure. Intense infestations by N. biwakoensis have contributed to widespread dieback of reeds in this region since 2016. Identifying suitable biological control agents from the source population is key to managing the invasive population of N. biwakoensis and protecting the delicate marsh ecosystem. Therefore, we used mitochondrial COI sequence data, drawn from collections of N. biwakoensis spanning the native and invasive range, to identify the origin of the established population in Louisiana and Texas. Network analysis using TCS 1.21 revealed a rich diversity of 57 unique COI haplotypes distributed across the native range in East Asia. Relationships among the sampled haplotypes indicate that N. biwakoensis was likely introduced to the United States from northeastern China. Specimens from the USA are nested among a group of haplotypes all originating from China, and the samples belong to a haplotype that was otherwise only collected in Beijing and Hebei. In contrast, modeling of habitat suitability based on host plant records from across East Asia, using MaxEnt 3.4.4, identified southeastern China as the best location to search for potential natural enemies to match the climatic conditions in the Mississippi River Delta. These two pieces of evidence provide critical guidance to focus future biological control efforts, and we discuss the importance of examining both genetic and environmental data when searching for potential biological control agents. Additionally, we identified two cryptic species of Nipponaclerda on Phragmites, one in Japan and another in Viet Nam. This research offers new depths of perspective on population structure for a rarely studied group of scale insects, the flat grass scales (Aclerdidae). Together the evaluation of scale insect genetics and ecological niche modeling will optimize foreign exploration efforts for biological control agents.

AB  - Coral reef ecosystems are exceptionally complex with a myriad of trophic pathways and consumer relationships. The application of stable isotopes (SIs) offers numerous advantages over traditional methods towards understanding these intricate systems. We summarise current knowledge derived from the rapidly increasing SI literature base and identify potential gaps and future directions for the use of SIs in coral reef ecosystem studies. Using topic modelling, a form of text mining, on 236 identified published works, we determined that SI research on coral reefs broadly falls into five major topics. (1) Organic matter dynamics: SI analyses (SIA) have quantified substantial variability in autochthonous (internal) and allochthonous (external) fluxes across coral reefs. (2) Holobiont metabolism: Coral nutrient acquisition, translocation and partitioning, and coral responses to various endogenous and exogenous factors have been explored through SIA. (3) Trophic niches: SIA has indicated that considerable variation in resource use facilitates co-occurrence of high densities of consumers, emphasising that many trophic categorisations on reefs are often too simplistic. (4) Fish diet variation and habitat connectivity: SIA has revealed how ontogenetic, larval and mobile predator movements link adjacent ecosystems. (5) Environmental drivers (both natural and anthropogenic): SIA can track anthropogenic nutrient inputs, revealing impacts of human-derived pollutants on reef systems. There are a number of important knowledge gaps, however. Few studies compare feeding strategies across guilds, and the literature is biased towards reef fish and hard corals. Furthermore, few studies examine multiple taxonomic groups in situ or consider multiple environmental drivers. Studies also tend to ignore the underlying, but potentially substantial, spatiotemporal variation in SI baselines as demonstrated from 741 mean SI values extracted from the literature, making inferences based on small variations in SI values problematic. Given that coral reefs face global decline, knowledge gaps need to be addressed while acknowledging the limitations of SIA; careful application of SIs can enhance the understanding of processes driving environmental change in these iconic marine ecosystems.

AB  - The vegetation phenology in pasture grasslands temporarily changes during the growing season due to the different physiological properties of broadleaf and cereal species. Determining their dynamics is required for maximal pasture utilization and sustainability. Widely used low-spatial resolution satellites are suitable for plains but are less effective in patchy landscapes. Therefore, the study's objectives are: (i) to determine the dynamic of cereals and broadleaf vegetation in arid grasslands using high-spatial resolution satellite imaging data, and (ii) to determine the influence of different grazing intensities on grassland vegetation phenology. The study site is in Migda LTER farm, the northern Negev, Israel. Fifty-three grassland plots, sized 10x10m, were located. Seventeen plots were grazed: six heavily (90 min. per plot), five moderately (60 min.), and six lightly (30 min.). A sheep and goats' herd of 120-130 animals grazed on these plots once a year between April to May, from 2019 to 2023. As a reference, fenced, ungrazed plots were located, mainly covered by cereals (Conserved). Imaging data from PlanetScope (R) was acquired (Spatial resolution: 3 m pixel- 1, Temporal: Once in three days, Spectral: RGB and NIR). Using a novel timeline analysis, based on normalizing the different treatments' NDVI by the Conserved values, yielded a three-phased result: a parabolic increase in fresh vegetation reflectance (FVR) from the treatment in the first and third phases, and a parabolic increase of FVR of the Conserved in the second phase. In most grazing treatments, phase duration and maximal NDVI were positively correlated to the rainfall amounts. Rehabilitation trends were calculated for the Lightly grazed, which was correlated to increased broadleaf biomass, while a degradation trend was found for the Heavily grazed. The findings indicate that a parabolic change takes place in vegetation composition in arid grasslands. The novel methodology we used can be adapted and utilized in other ecosystems.

AB  - Context The decline of the greater bilby (Macrotis lagotis), or Ngarlgumirdi (Yawuru), like other critical-weight range Australian mammals, is believed to be primarily due to the synergetic impacts of predation by feral cats and foxes, habitat disturbance caused by large introduced herbivores, and increases in the frequency and intensity of wildfires. Although it has been demonstrated that low-intensity prescribed burning mosaics in some habitats have the potential to benefit mammals, including Ngarlgumirdi, by creating habitat with sufficient vegetation cover, the contributions of specific fire-mosaic attributes to Ngarlgumirdi persistence remain unclear. Aims To elucidate the impacts of fire-mosaic attributes on the occupancy of Ngarlgumirdi on the Dampier Peninsula. Methods We used 2-ha sign-plot data collected by four Indigenous Ranger groups, in combination with 20 years of satellite-derived fire-history information to investigate the multiscale impacts of fire attributes on Ngarlgumirdi and feral cats (Felis catus) on the Dampier Peninsula in the West Kimberley region, a large, unfenced landscape in the most fire-prone section of the Ngarlgumirdi's current range. Key results We found that Ngarlgumirdi was more common in areas that had a higher proportion of habitat that had not burnt for at least 3 years, whereas feral cats were less prevalent in these areas. Similarly, Ngarlgumirdi was less likely to occur in landscapes affected by frequent fires, whereas cats were more common there. Conclusions Our findings have highlighted the importance of decreasing fire frequency and increasing the extent of long-unburnt habitats (>3 years) for preserving Ngarlgumirdi on the Dampier Peninsula and mitigating ecological damage inflicted by feral cats. Findings were consistent across spatial scales (1-, 3-, 5- and 10-km radius from each monitoring site). Implications These results have demonstrated the potential of fire management to increase native species resilience in the absence of direct feral cat control methods. Further, they support a recent cross-tenure initiative led by Traditional Owners to implement fire management that aims to reduce large, frequent high-severity wildfires and increase areas of long-unburnt vegetation on the Dampier Peninsula.

AB  - The impact of hunting can result in ungulates exhibiting a variety of avoidance behaviors. However, spatiotemporal information on hunters and ungulates, which is necessary to establish population control programs, is limited. Our study aimed to evaluate the impacts of culling pressure on the spatiotemporal avoidance behavior of female sika deer. We conducted camera trap surveys from May to November each year in 2019-2022 and investigated the influences of anthropogenic and topographic factors on the diurnal and nocturnal photographic frequencies of females. The findings of this study suggested that the logarithm of the accumulated culling intensity of gun culling, rather than trap culling, had a negative impact on the photographic frequency of sika deer females during daytime. In addition, females were photographed more frequently during the daytime by cameras in larger distances from the walking path and its entrance, suggesting that they also exhibited distinct spatiotemporal avoidance behavior in response to tourism. Therefore, during the daytime, females recognized anthropogenic disturbances and avoided risk-prone areas. Consequently, wildlife managers need to establish population control programs that make it difficult for ungulates to make spatiotemporal predictions regarding hunting activities.

AB  - In Mediterranean areas, severe drought events are expected to intensify in forthcoming years as a consequence of climate change. These events may increase physiological and reproductive stress of wild populations producing demographic changes and distribution shifts. We used retrospective life tables to understand demographic changes on a wild population after severe drought events. We studied the impact of two extreme events (2003 and 2005) on the population dynamics of our model species, the red deer (Cervus elaphus). During both years, population density was high (40 and 36 ind/100 ha, respectively). Thus, we reconstructed retrospectively the age structure of the female part of the population for the period 2000-2010 by using data of known-age individuals culled during the period 2000-2019 (n = 4176). Also, based on previous study results, we aimed to validate this methodology. Both extremely dry years, 2003 and 2005, produced marked and lasting cohort effects on population demography. Age pyramid the following years (2004 and 2006) revealed that the extreme drought caused the female fawn cohort to be similar or even smaller than the yearling cohort. Furthermore, these cohort effects were still perceptible 3 years after these severe events. Results agree with previous findings that showed a negative effect of severe drought events on female pregnancy rates and conception dates. Although simple, this study provides an empirical quantification of the demographic effects of severe drought events for a wild population which might be useful to understand future demographic changes under the context of climate change.

AB  - The roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) is Europe's most widespread ungulate, notable for its unique trait of embryonic diapause (delayed blastocyst implantation after mating) and an ongoing debate regarding how climate change affects its parturition timing. Given the relatively constant timing of the rut, roe deer could cope with advancing greening by adjusting its diapause end. Here, we bridge the gap on factors influencing roe deer's diapause by analysing 390 uteri from legally hunted roe deer females in Germany (2017-2020), which we macroscopically examined for the presence of visible embryonic tissue to retrospectively identify the diapause end date. By employing a marginal Cox proportional hazard model, we tested associations between female phenotypic attributes, environmental conditions and the probability of ending embryonic diapause prematurely. Our results confirmed that high-quality, well-conditioned and prime-aged females tend to terminate embryonic diapause earlier. We also demonstrated for the first time that on a population-averaged level, the growing season length in the year of conception significantly influences the diapause timing, even explaining the much-debated shifts in parturition dates in roe deer over the last seven decades. Increased knowledge of mechanisms involved in embryonic diapause may also help decipher embryo-maternal interactions in general, including in vitro fertilization.

AB  - Banteng (Bos javanicus) is listed as an endangered species because of a global population decline of at least 50% over the last 25 years. The Western Forest Complex (WEFCOM) of Thailand has been identified as a priority site for banteng population recovery, and Huai Kha Keang Wildlife Sanctuary (HKK) is the most important source site for this species within the WEFCOM. We have provided evidence and discussed banteng dispersal from HKK to Thung Yai Naresuan West Wildlife Sanctuary (TYW). We sampled an area of 147 km(2) in banteng habitat next to the border between HKK and TYW using camera traps. We divided the sampled area into four grid cells and placed camera traps during January to December 2022. We setup the camera traps near saltlicks and natural water sources, as important resources for banteng, to maximize capture probability. In total, 2835 trap days were obtained. Bantengs were captured in all seasons (RAI = 1.66), especially in dry dipterocarp forest, which contains the ground forage availability for banteng, and the low-slope area with elevation 600-700 m adjacent to the border between HKK and TYW. The results highlighted that banteng, which had never been reported in TYW before, appeared there for the first time. They most likely dispersed from the population source in HKK and settled in a habitat that is considered suitable for them. The habitat management and protection are significant for the future recovery of banteng populations in the TYW and the rest of protected areas in the WEFCOM.

AB  - Local ecological knowledge (LEK) of forage resources available in the forest is crucial in the sustainability of extensive grazing systems in the arid Chaco region. Here, we document goat farming management strategies of local peasants, assess their LEK about forage plants and evaluate the local perception related to pollination of native tree species. We used semi -structured interviews to obtain ethnoecological information and a cognitive approach to inquire about the plant species considered as fodder and their relative importance. Peasants listed a total of 48 ethnospecies (60 species from 23 botanical families) used as fodder. The most important forage plants in our study were Neltuma spp., Sarcomphalus mistol and Castela coccinea , which provide high quality fruits and also leaves as forage at different moments of the year. Local producers did not identify pollination as a key factor for the production of forage fruits, but they did emphasize the importance of climatic factors for fruit production. This ethnoecological information related to forage plants and factors that determine fruit production is important to understand peasant management systems that sustain local communities and play an important role in forest persistence.

AB  - The wild yak (Bos mutus) is a cold-tolerant herbivore native to the Tibetan Plateau and has been categorized as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources. Low population densities within currently fragmented habitats and unclear landscape conservation priorities warrant attention. Herein, we employed the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model using over 900 wild yak occurrence records to model wild yak habitat suitability. Our analysis revealed unprotected wild yak landscapes covering 30.79 % of the habitat area, indicating a conservation gap between protected areas (PAs) and wild yak habitats. To protect metapopulation dynamics and mitigate high risks of poaching, habitat degradation and fragmentation, resource competition, and degenerated genetic characterization of wild yaks in fragmented and degraded habitat, we identified eight habitat patches as landscape conservation units (LCUs) and 14 linkages among the LCUs, enhancing the connectivity between LCUs to decrease negative effects of genetic threats. A centrality analysis demonstrated that Changtang, Arjinshan, and Hoh Xil national nature reserves and their linkages are all critical for the maintenance of habitat connectivity. Here, we suggest that habitat- and LCU-specific conservation strategies should be highlighted during the establishment of PAs and transboundary cooperation. Ultimately, our results can assist conservationists and land managers in comprehending wild yak distribution, movement, and habitat requirements, as well as for the development of effective protection strategies. Furthermore, the combined modeling method (MaxEnt-Zonation-InVEST) could be utilized as a component for identifying conservation priorities and linkages between core patches for species and assessing the efficiency of PAs, core habitats, and corridors in achieving conservation goals. Our study can provide a framework in identifying priority conservation and connectivity between habitat patches to facilitate effectively conservation and genetic resilience for endangered species in fragmented habitats.

AB  - Dispersal is a key process in community assembly but is often considered separately from downstream assembly processes (e.g., competition, herbivory). However, dispersal varies by species and can interact with other assembly processes through establishment as species enter communities. Here, we sought to distinguish the role of dispersal in community assembly and its interaction with two biotic assembly processes: competition and herbivory. We used a tallgrass prairie restoration experiment that manipulated the competitive and herbivore environments while allowing for natural dispersal and establishment from a diverse regional species pool into areas of low diversity. Dispersal, competition, and herbivory all influenced local communities. By tracking the spread of four target species across the plots, we found interspecific and intraspecific differences in establishment patterns, with herbivores influencing the number of individuals present and the distances species moved. At the community level, only dispersal and competition significantly influenced alpha diversity, but all three processes additively influenced community composition. There was also evidence of herbivore-competition and herbivore-colonization trade-offs in our experiment. Some species that could tolerate herbivory were less likely to establish in competitive environments, while others that could tolerate herbivory were more likely to disperse greater distances. More work is needed to understand the contexts under which dispersal variation affects community assembly and its synergy with other processes.

AB  - In seasonal environments, animals should be adapted to match important life-history traits to when environmental conditions are optimal. Most animal populations therefore reproduce when resource abundance is highest to increase annual reproductive success. When facing variable, and changing, environments animals can display behavioural plasticity to acclimate to changing conditions. Behaviours can further be repeatable. For example, timing of behaviours and life history traits such as timing of reproduction may indicate phenotypic variation. Such variation may buffer animal populations against the consequences of variation and change.Our goal was to quantify plasticity and repeatability in migration and parturition timing in response to timing of snowmelt and green-up in a migratory herbivore (caribou, Rangifer tarandus, n = 132 ID-years) and their effect on reproductive success.We used behavioural reaction norms to quantify repeatability in timing of migration and timing of parturition in caribou and their plasticity to timing of spring events, while also quantifying phenotypic covariance between behavioural and life-history traits.Timing of migration for individual caribou was positively correlated with timing of snowmelt. The timing of parturition for individual caribou varied as a function of inter-annual variation in timing of snowmelt and green-up. Repeatability for migration timing was moderate, but low for timing of parturition. Plasticity did not affect reproductive success. We also did not detect any evidence of phenotypic covariance among any traits examined-timing of migration was not correlated with timing of parturition, and neither was there a correlation in the plasticity of these traits.Repeatability in migration timing suggests the possibility that the timing of migration in migratory herbivores could evolve if the repeatability detected in this study has a genetic or otherwise heritable basis, but observed plasticity may obviate the need for an evolutionary response. Our results also suggest that observed shifts in caribou parturition timing are due to plasticity as opposed to an evolutionary response to changing conditions. While this provides some evidence that populations may be buffered from the consequences of climate change via plasticity, a lack of repeatability in parturition timing could impede adaptation as warming increases.

AB  - Aim Determining the mechanisms by which climate change and human activities affect patterns of ecological specialization in different genetic units of the same species is crucial for developing local or regionally-based conservation solutions. This study uses species distribution models and genetic analysis to (1) identify the evidence of intraspecific differences in the population size and distribution of the three extant lineages (Sichuan/Gansu (SG), Qinling (QL) and Shennongjia (SNJ)) of Sichuan snub-nosed monkeys and (2) determine why some lineages have lower population numbers, a smaller geographical distribution, and are more threatened with extinction. Location China. Methods We used n-dimensional hypervolume modelling and genotype-environment association (GEA) models to compare the climatic niches of three snub-nosed monkey lineages, SDMs to reconstruct the historical, current and future distributions of each lineage and SMC++ to calculate their effective population sizes. Results We found evidence of: (1) climatic niche differentiation among the SG, QL and SNJ lineages of Sichuan snub-nosed monkeys; (2) geographical isolation combined with a decrease in population size during the LGM resulted in ecological specialization among these three lineages; and (3) a decline in climatic suitability and anthropogenically driven land conversion, combined with small population size and a narrow distributional range, indicates that the SNJ lineage is at a greater risk of extinction than the SG and QL lineages. Main conclusions We demonstrate that during the LGM a reduction in habitat suitability driven by climate change, in concert with decreasing population size, resulted in the geographical isolation of the three Sichuan snub-nosed monkey subpopulations, leading to lineage differences in ecological specialization. GEA models and hypervolume models demonstrated that the three lineages occupy different ecological niches. Based on lineage-level models, the SNJ and QL lineages should be the immediate focus of conservation efforts due to their small effective population size and expected future reductions in available suitable habitats. The modelling approach used here is robust and can be applied effectively to examine the biogeography, recent evolutionary history and effective population size of other endangered animal taxa.

AB  - Generalist predators play important roles in ecosystems by consuming various prey types. Despite this, predation studies often focus on a predator's most consumed prey, with limited attention given to predation on less common prey. In addition, despite increased temperature variability under climate change, it is unclear how predator foraging is affected by colder temperatures. Here, we examine the functional response of the generalist wolf spider Hogna baltimoriana on Hippodamia convergens ladybeetle larvae at an ambient and two colder temperatures. In agroecosystems, both wolf spiders and ladybeetles can act as biocontrol predators of pest species and may engage in intraguild predation, yet ladybeetles appear to be uncommon in wild wolf spiders' diets. We provide evidence of intraguild predation by H. baltimoriana on H. convergens across cold temperatures but find that the likelihood of this spider foraging on H. convergens larvae is reduced at lower temperatures and with a lower larva density. We further show that colder temperatures reduce space clearance rate, resulting in decreased foraging rates at low prey densities. Our results have important implications for biocontrol programs and our understanding of predator-prey interactions under climate change, and we highlight the need for functional responses to be evaluated on less commonly consumed prey.

AB  - Japan's Sika deer (Cervus nippon) population has steadily increased since the 1990s. Consequent overgrazing of forest floor vegetation has created denuded slopes and increased the fine-sediment input to nearby headstreams. Given the continuous structure of rivers, it is likely that upstream forest and headstream ecosystems ultimately impact the ecology of downstream ecosystems. To test this prediction, I investigated the taxonomic composition and habitat characteristics of stream macroinvertebrates before and after fine sedimentation infiltration. Fine sedimentation resulted in coverage of highly productive coarse substrates with fine sand and reduced the macroinvertebrate abundance and taxonomic diversity. These changes were influenced by habitat preference; taxa with coarse substrate preference decreased in abundance, while the abundance of taxa that prefer fine substrates increased. However, large armored caddisflies (Goera spp.) dominated after the fine sedimentation, despite their preference for coarse substrates. This rise likely results from the concurrent reduction in the number of the predatory cyprinid fish species, Tribolodon hakonensis, as large armored caddisflies have often been reported to be invulnerable to predation by fishes such as salmonids and sculpins. However, large cyprinids, which are abundant in Japanese rivers, can effectively forage "hard-armored" organisms using their well-developed pharyngeal teeth. Collectively the results provide insight regarding the catchment-scale impacts of deer-induced forest floor degradation and will help to inform conservation and management efforts.

AB  - Combining single-species ecological modeling with advanced machine learning to investigate the long-term population dynamics of the rheophilic fish spirlin offers a powerful approach to understanding environmental changes and climate shifts in aquatic ecosystems. A new ESHIPPOClim model was developed by integrating climate change assessment into the ESHIPPO model. The model identifies spirlin as a potential early indicator of environmental changes, highlighting the interactive effects of climate change and anthropogenic stressors on fish populations and freshwater ecosystems. The ESHIPPOClim model reveals that 28.57 % of the spirlin's data indicates high resilience and ecological responsiveness, with 34.92 % showing medium-high adaptability, suggesting its substantial ability to withstand environmental stressors. With 36.51 % of the data in medium level and no data in the low category, spirlin may serve as a sentinel species, providing early warnings of environmental stressors before they severely impact other species or ecosystems. The results of uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) and a decision tree show that pollution has the highest impact on the population dynamics of spirlin, followed by annual water temperature, overexploitation, and invasive species. Despite the obtained key drivers, higher abundance, dominance, and frequency values were detected in habitats with higher HIPPO stressors and climate change effects. Integrating state-of-the-art machine learning models has enhanced the predictive power of the ESHIPPOClim model, achieving approximately 90 % accuracy in identifying spirlin as an early indicator of climate change and anthropogenic stressors. The ESHIPPOClim model offers a holistic approach with broad practical applications using a simplified three-point scale, adaptable to various fish species, communities, and regions. The ecological modeling supported with advanced machine learning could serve as a foundation for rapid and cost-effective management of aquatic ecosystems, revealing the adaptability potential of fish species, which is crucial in rapidly changing environments.

AB  - Mangroves have been continuously affected due to human-induced and natural stresses. Therefore, reliable, accurate, and timely mangrove information is essential for conservation, protection, and sustainable management. Recent advances in remote sensing technology have provided an opportunity to observe and monitor mangroves spatially and temporally. Remote sensing technology could detect and acquire information like mangrove extent, cover change, species composition, canopy density, mangrove biomass, and carbon sequestration. In this study, European satellite Sentinel-2 data was used to map the defoliation of mangroves of Dharamtar creek, India, caused by the insect 'teak defoliator' (Hyblaea puera). Defoliation from the study area was recorded from August 2019 to October 2019. Mangrove plant Avicennia marina is the most dominant species distributed across the forest, and it was the only species observed to be infested. The total area of mangroves of Dharamtar creek was estimated to be 8175.5 ha. Out of the total mangrove area, high defoliated, moderately defoliated, low defoliated and very low defoliated and un-defoliated mangrove areas were estimated as 6.6%, 9.9%, 8.3%, 50.17% and 25.0%, respectively. The infestation was affected more than 6,000 hectares of mangroves. Unhealthy and stressed mangroves due to defoliation caused by the infestation of H. puera were detected using NDVI in the study area. The details regarding the moth, infestation of mangroves, its causes, impacts and other related information was discussed. We recommend further studies to investigate the causes of outbreaks, preference of this insect to this particular species of mangroves over other species and other implications of defoliation.

AB  - Recovering endangered species is a difficult and often controversial task that challenges status quo land uses. Southern Mountain caribou are a threatened ecotype of caribou that historically ranged in southwestern Canada and northwestern USA and epitomize the tension between resource extraction, biodiversity conservation, and Indigenous Peoples' treaty rights. Human-induced habitat alteration is considered the ultimate cause of caribou population declines, whereby an increased abundance of primary prey-such as moose and deer-elevates predator populations and creates unsustainable caribou mortality. Here we focus on the Klinse-Za and Quintette subpopulations, part of the endangered Central Group of Southern Mountain caribou in British Columbia. These subpopulations were trending toward immediate extirpation until a collaborative group initiated recovery by implementing two short-term recovery actions. We test the effectiveness of these recovery actions-maternity penning of adult females and their calves, and the reduction of a primary predator, wolves-in increasing vital rates and population growth. Klinse-Za received both recovery actions, whereas Quintette only received wolf reductions, providing an opportunity to test efficacy between recovery actions. Between 1995 and 2021, we followed 162 collared female caribou for 414 animal-years to estimate survival and used aerial counts to estimate population abundance and calf recruitment. We combined these data in an integrated population model to estimate female population growth, total population abundance, and recovery action effectiveness. Results suggest that the subpopulations were declining rapidly (lambda = 0.90-0.93) before interventions and would have been functionally extirpated (<10 animals) within 10-15 years. Wolf reduction increased population growth rates by similar to 0.12 for each subpopulation. Wolf reduction halted the decline of Quintette caribou and allowed them to increase (lambda = 1.05), but alone would have only stabilized the Klinse-Za (lambda = 1.02). However, maternity penning in the Klinse-Za increased population growth by a further similar to 0.06, which when combined with wolf reductions, allowed populations to grow (lambda = 1.08). Taken together, the recovery actions in these subpopulations increased adult female survival, calf recruitment, and overall population growth, more than doubling abundance. Our results suggest that maternity penning and wolf reductions can be effective at increasing caribou numbers in the short term, while long-term commitments to habitat protection and restoration are made.

AB  - Hubei Shishou Milu National Nature Reserve is an ideal place to restore the wild population of Pere David's deer (Elaphurus davidianus). Understanding foraging ecology and diet composition is essential for assessing population development or establishing long-term effective conservation measures for endangered species. However, little is known about the diet composition of Pere David's deer and its diet selection mechanism. In this study, we used stable isotope technology to investigate the diet composition of Pere David's deer according to various tissues (i.e., fur, muscle, liver, heart, and feces) and seasons, and evaluated the correlation between the nutrient composition of plants and diet composition. Bayesian isotope analysis showed that the autumn and winter diet estimated by fur and fecal samples indicated a diet dominated by C-3 grasses (42.7%-57.2%, mean), while the summer diet estimated by muscle and liver samples was dominated by C-3 forbs (30.9%-41.6%, mean). The Pearson correlation test indicated that the contribution of winter diet composition reflected by fur and fecal samples was associated with correlations with crude protein (r = .666, p < .01) and soluble sugars (r = .695, p < .01). The results indicated that crude protein and soluble sugars were important factors influencing the winter diet selection of Pere David's deer. In the context of the current reintroduction facing many challenges, such as habitat fragmentation, wetland degradation, and human disturbance, comprehensively evaluating the diet selection mechanism of Pere David's deer under different resource specificities and temporal changes should be considered in the future.

AB  - The composition and richness of herbivore and plant assemblages change along climatic gradients, but knowledge about associated shifts in specialization is scarce and lacks controlling for the abundance and phylogeny of interaction partners. Thus, we aimed to test whether the specialization of phytophagous insects in insect-plant interaction networks decreases toward cold habitats as predicted by the 'altitude niche-breadth hypothesis' to forecast possible consequences of interaction rewiring under climate change. We used a non-invasive, standardized metabarcoding approach to reconstruct dietary relationships of Orthoptera species as a major insect herbivore taxon along a broad temperature gradient (similar to 12 degrees C) in Southern Germany. Based on Orthoptera surveys, feeding observations, collection of fecal pellets from >3,000 individuals of 54 species, and parallel vegetation surveys on 41 grassland sites, we quantified plant resource availability and its use by herbivores. Herbivore assemblages were richer in species and individuals at sites with high summer temperatures, while plant richness peaked at intermediate temperatures. Corresponding interaction networks were most specialized in warm habitats. Considering phylogenetic relationships of plant resources, however, the specialization pattern was not linear but peaked at intermediate temperatures, mediated by herbivores feeding on a narrow range of phylogenetically related resources. Our study provides empirical evidence of resource specialization of insect herbivores along a climatic gradient, demonstrating that resource phylogeny, availability, and temperature interactively shape the specialization of herbivore assemblages. Instead of low specialization levels only in cold, harsh habitats, our results suggest increased generalist feeding due to intraspecific changes and compositional differences at both ends of the microclimatic gradient. We conclude that this nonlinear change of phylogeny-based resource specialization questions predictions derived from the 'altitude-niche breadth hypothesis' and highlights the currently limited understanding of how plant-herbivore interactions will change under future climatic conditions.

AB  - We conducted a field experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of neighboring vegetation to protect cherry-wood (Prunus avium) saplings against roe deer browsing and rubbing, and determine whether this protection varies according to the attractiveness of - and the physical barrier provided by - a variety of nurse shrubs. Our results show that nurse shrubs may delay roe deer browsing and rubbing on highly attractive cherry-wood saplings, even in a situation of high deer density. The most obstructing shrubs at roe deer knee to shoulder height (Populus x canescens and Cytisus scoparius) appeared to be efficient barriers, whereas the spiny shrub (Elaeagnus angustifolia) did not protect saplings more efficiently than thornless species. Yet, obstruction appeared to be less effective against browsing when the nurse species was itself browsed (Cornus sanguinea and Alnus cordata). Since roe deer may help to reduce plantation cleaning through the control of the shrub layer, especially brambles, we argue that natural methods of protection using surrounding vegetation should represent an economic and sustainable alternative to artificial protection of saplings.

AB  - 1. Food chain length provides key information on the flow of nutrients and energy in ecosystems. Variation in food chain length has primarily been explained by environmental drivers such as ecosystem size and productivity. Most insights are obtained from theory or aquatic systems, but the importance of these drivers remains largely untested in terrestrial systems.2. We exploited red wood ant nests markedly differing in size as natural experiments to quantify the drivers of trophic structure and food chain length of their symbiont arthropod communities. Using stable isotopes, we explored the variation in the trophic positions of four symbiont species with the trophic position of the top predator as a proxy for food chain length of the symbiont community.3. Nest size did not affect food chain length, nor trophic distance between the symbionts. Instead, food chain length and the trophic positions of the symbionts were strongly affected by the host's foraging decisions. When the host diet shifted from predominantly herbivorous to more predacious, the trophic position of the symbionts and food chain length strongly increased.4. We show for the first time that a food web can be structured by biotic interactions with an engineering species rather than by abiotic environmental variables.

AB  - Simple Summary Wild animals perceive nonlethal human activities as a potential threat, and they respond to human disturbances in a variety of ways: changes in group size and time-investment on vigilance are common behaviors. In China, nature reserves are generally divided into three functional zones: the core zone, the buffer zone, and the experimental zone, which represent low, medium, and high human disturbance levels, respectively. However, mining developments in the three zones pose threats to goitered gazelle living in the Kalamaili Nature Reserve, China. In this study, we found that human disturbances have larger effects on smaller-sized, single-sex groups rather than larger-sized, mixed-sex groups. Goitered gazelle spend more time being vigilant in the experimental zone than in the other two zones. In the experimental zone, a greater linear decrease with respect to group size was observed. Our results indicate that intensive human disturbances in the core and buffer zones brought goitered gazelle and humans closer together, which induced changes in vigilance and grouping patterns of this social species. Ultimately, this may have negative effects on the fitness and survival of the species. Nonlethal human disturbances have been confirmed to have a negative effect on wildlife in a variety of ways, including on behaviors. In many studies, the impact of human disturbances on gregarious species of wildlife is assessed through changes in their social organization and vigilance. In our study in the Kalamaili Nature Reserve, China, we wanted to estimate the impacts of differing levels of human disturbances on two different group types (mixed-sex and all-male) of goitered gazelle, Gazella subgutturosa, living in three functional zones (experimental, buffer, and core zones), which represent high, medium, and low human disturbance levels, respectively. In addition, we studied the time spent vigilant as a function of group size with different levels of human disturbances in the three zones. In general, mixed-sex gazelle groups were of similar sizes in the three different zones, while all-male groups slightly differed in their sizes between the experimental and buffer zones. This may indicate that human disturbances have varying effects on the different group types, with smaller-sized, single-sex groups being more significantly affected by human disturbances than larger-sized, mixed-sex groups. Goitered gazelle showed higher vigilance levels in the experimental zone than in the two other zones. A trend of decreasing vigilance varying linearly with group size was also found in the three zones, and the rate of decrease was higher in the experimental zone. Increased habitat fragmentation and human activities brought goitered gazelle and humans closer together in the core zone. Therefore, stopping mining activities and returning the reserve to a continuous habitat with fewer environmental disturbances is the best way to establish and protect a stable population of this endangered species of gazelle.

AB  - Simple Summary When weeds are left in mango farms, especially native wildflowers, there is a potential they may provide pollen and nectar to increase beneficial insect abundance and diversity. We examined how weed presence affects insects on mango trees as well as soil health. We found that weeds significantly increased pollinating and parasitoid (natural pest control agents) insect abundance and diversity. There was no difference in predatory insects between treatments, and slightly more herbivorous insects on weedy mango trees. Pollinators in mango flowers and spiders were also greater on weedy mango trees. Soil conditions were significantly improved in soil carbon and pH by the presence of weeds. These results show that a tolerable level of weed species may benefit insect, plant, and soil biodiversity in farms which oftentimes have very little life on them. This study examined if weeds could serve as insectary plants to increase beneficial insect abundance and diversity in mango cultivation in southern Florida. Additionally, we examined how weed presence affects mango tree soil health. We found that weeds significantly increased pollinating and parasitoid insect abundance and diversity. Eight insect orders and eighteen families were significantly more abundant on mango trees with weeds growing beneath them than those where weeds were removed. There was no difference in predatory insects between treatments, and slightly more herbivorous insects on weedy mango trees. Pollinating insects visiting mango flowers in the weed treatment were significantly greater, as well as spiders on weedy mango trees. However, there were more lacewings (Neuroptera) observed on the mango trees without weeds, and leaf chlorophyll in the old and new mango leaves was significantly greater, in the weed-free treatment. Soil conditions, however, significantly improved in soil carbon and a greater pH reduction in the presence of weeds, though weeds affected neither soil nitrogen, phosphorous, nor chlorophyll in productive green leaves. These results show that a tolerable level of selective weed species' presence may benefit insect, plant, and soil biodiversity in farms. This is important in increasing production, sustainability, and biodiversity in agriculture, which otherwise may be deficient in non-crop life.

AB  - To prioritise conservation actions and management strategies for threatened forest deer species at the Atlantic forest, we aimed to identify and describe the most suitable habitat areas for forest deer species and to indicate conservation measures for state agents and local communities. We adopt an approach based on ecological niche modelling, key variable thresholds and spatial analyses. In addition, we associated our approach with a human influence index, an invasive species dataset of occurrences, protected area cover and IUCN category. We indicate 2 % (484 km2) of the Atlantic forest cover as conservation priority areas (CPAs). Of these, 56.8 % are outside protected areas, 20.7 % are inside IUCN categories i, ii and iii protected areas, 19.9 % are inside IUCN categories iv, v, and vi protected areas, and 2.6 % are inside indigenous areas. Also, we indicate the most relevant protected areas for deer conservation in the Atlantic forest. The CPAs were classified into more human-influenced areas (MHIA) and less human-influenced areas (LHIA), and we identified 21 significant (greater than120 km2) continuous CPAs outside protected areas. We highlight actions in several perspectives of human influence, governance levels and law protection that would rationalise the use of funds and human resources.

AB  - Animal body size influences key ecological processes across biological hierarchies. For instance, densities (N) and community biomass (B) are allometric functions of body mass (M). Energetic equivalence predicts that density scales with body size as N proportional to M-0.75 and that biomass scales with body size as B proportional to M0.25. However, the way fish size-spectra are influenced by external processes, such as ecological subsidies (e.g. nutrients from upwelling zones) and fisheries management, is not well understood. We investigated the relationship of body size with density and biomass of reef fishes associated with subtidal kelp forests of Lessonia trabeculata that were influenced by the separate and interactive effects of management (Territorial Use Rights for Fisheries [TURF] or open access) and upwelling regimes (upwelling or non-upwelling zones). Fish densities and lengths were recorded using underwater visual censuses. Within each of 4 locations, paired TURF and open-access sites were surveyed. We surveyed 18 fish species, encompassing 1511 individuals ranging between 2 and 6639 g. We observed that fish size-spectra deviated from energetic equivalence, as N proportional to M-0.32 and B proportional to M2.2, indicating that the contribution of large-sized fishes to community density and biomass was greater than that predicted by energetic equivalence. Multi-model inference suggested that TURF and upwelling scenarios had weak effects on fish size-spectra. Results indicated that fish communities may have access to external food sources beyond local kelp forests. In addition, size-spectra may be a spatially persistent attribute of these fish communities.

AB  - Insects, as one of the most species-rich taxa with enormous taxonomic, behavioural and functional diversity, are in decline. Bees and wasps are especially crucial for ecosystems as pollinators or to control populations of other insects. To understand population drivers, comprehensive knowledge about top-down and bottom-up interactions, including all interaction partners, is needed.Nests of trap-nesting bees and wasps include multi-trophic interactions between bees, wasps, their food resources and natural enemies, simultaneously, however, up to today, all trophic interactions are not yet included in trap nest research because of challenges to identify the food used by nesting bees and wasps.Here, we reconstructed quantitative three- and four-trophic interaction networks of species in three apoid wasp families using DNA barcoding. The obtained tripartite and quadripartite networks encompassed natural enemy-wasp-spider and natural enemy-wasp-herbivore-plant interactions. Moreover, we identified so far undescribed Hymenoptera-prey interactions, including prey species known as agricultural and forest pests.More extensive research on bee and wasp multitrophic interaction networks will provide valuable insights to better understand responses to environmental and biodiversity change, to investigate ecological theory and to reveal so far unknown feeding links.

AB  - Several authors suggest that greater vegetation complexity provides more shelters, supporting higher parasitoid diversity. Additionally, it serves as visual cue in host searching. This study evaluates how visual stimuli and herbivore-induced vegetation changes affect parasitoid strategies and guilds in low deciduous forest [Yabucu], and Medium Semi-Evergreen forest [Noh-Bec]. We calculated the relative abundance of idiobiont and koinobiont life strategies for each vegetation type and constructed the range-abundance curves of these communities. Also, the relationship of guilds with the different types of damage from herbivory and leaf characteristics were described. The koinobiont:idiobiont (K:I) ratio was 6:1 (86.65% koinobionts and 13.35% idiobionts) in Yabuc & uacute; and 1:2 (32.78% koinobionts and 67.22% idiobionts) in Noh-Bec. Some guilds were associated with vegetation: a negative correlation between fluctuating asymmetry seedlings (FAS) and parasitoids attacking larvae into the fruiting bodies of fungi was founded; the FAS is an indirect indicator of herbivory, nonetheless, the parasitoids found do not target phytophagous hosts, which makes an inverse relationship plausible and could potentially reduce intra-guild competition. Hyperparasitoids were positively associated with holes in adult plants (HA); with an association with herbivore parasitoids, which could be contributing to the recorded evidence of holes.

AB  - The decline of most caribou (Rangifer tarandus) populations underlines the need to understand the determinants of key demographic parameters. In migratory caribou, we have limited information on rates and drivers of pre- weaning mortality. We fitted 60 pregnant females of the Riviere-aux-Feuilles caribou herd with GPS camera collars to track the survival of calves from birth to weaning in 2016-2018. Over the three years, calf survival rate before weaning, i.e. to 01-Sep, approximately three months of age, was 0.63 (CI 0.50-0.77). Summer mortality risk was mainly influenced by calf birth date, with calves born earlier in the calving season having a lower mortality risk than those born later. Mortality also increased when calves experienced low or high temperature during calving. This study provides the first estimates of pre-weaning survival of migratory caribou calves in this herd, illustrating the value of new technologies to collect data otherwise difficult to obtain in widely distributed migratory populations. This approach can easily be extended to other large herbivores and predators. Our study brings new insights on how climate change may affect summer juvenile survival given the increased temperatures and faster changes in plant phenology expected in the future.

AB  - Hunting pressure alters the spatial ecology of many ungulate species. During hunting periods, game species often select areas that have reduced hunter accessibility by increasing use of forest cover, remaining farther from roads, or moving to private land as a means of refuge. Our objectives were to determine if elk (Cervus canadensis) in central Utah, USA, shifted distribution towards areas of refuge (private land) in response to hunting and whether allocating hunting permits to refuge areas could reduce selection of refugia by elk. We captured 445 elk between January 2015 and March 2017 on the Wasatch Front in central Utah and fitted each individual with a global positioning system collar. We used logistic regression models and Bayesian change point analyses to determine differences in daily use of public land in response to the addition of private-land hunting. We detected shifts in elk distribution at the beginning of the archery hunting season and during the rifle season, suggesting elk selected for private land as refuge from hunters. At the conclusion of the hunting season, we detected a shift back to public land. The addition of private-land hunting increased use of public land by elk during the rifle season (from 29% in 2015 to 41% in 2016). Our results show that the distribution of elk across a matrix of public and private land can be influenced by manipulating hunting pressure. Hunter access, the ability of hunters to access target game species, can be a concern in areas with private-land refuges. This can be particularly problematic when management strategies rely on hunter harvest to maintain population objectives; however, this problem can be mitigated by the introduction of hunting on private lands, if landowners provide hunter access.

AB  - Context Population monitoring is an essential need for tracking biodiversity and judging efficacy of conservation management actions, both globally and in the Pacific. However, population monitoring efforts are often temporally inconsistent and limited to small scales. Motion-activated cameras ('camera traps') offer a way to cost-effectively monitor populations, but they also generate large amounts of data that are time intensive to process.Aims To develop an automated pipeline for processing videos of ungulates (Philippine deer, Rusa marianna; and pigs, Sus scrofa) on Andersen Air Force Base in Guam.Methods We processed camera videos with a machine learning model for object detection and classification. To estimate density using distance sampling methods, we used a separate machine learning model to estimate the distance of target animals from the camera. We compared density estimates generated using manual versus automated methods and assessed accuracy and processing time saved.Key results The object detection and classification model achieved an overall accuracy >80% and F1 score >= 0.9 and saved 36.9 h of processing time. The automated distance estimation was fairly accurate, with a 1.1 m (+/- 1.4 m) difference from manual distance estimates, and saved 16.8 h of processing time. Density estimates did not differ substantially between manual and automated distance estimation.Conclusions Machine learning models accurately processed camera videos, allowing efficient estimates of density from camera data.Implications Further adoption of motion-activated cameras coupled with automated processing could lead to continuous, large-scale monitoring of populations, helping to understand and address changes in biodiversity.

AB  - Whilst the re-introduction of fire can contribute to biodiversity conservation in Fennoscandian forests, the effects on reindeer herding remain uncertain. To assess the short- and long-term effects of prescribed burning on lichen supply in a productive forest landscape, we developed a model simulating lichen biomass available for reindeer grazing, covering 300 years and 1500 pine stands, under different soil preparation scenarios, including different prescribed burning regimes and mechanical scarification. Our simulations revealed that burning 25-50% of yearly clear-cuts has the potential to stop, or even reverse, reindeer lichen decline at landscape scale after 70 years, greatly surpassing the short-term losses caused by burning. No burning or burning 5% of yearly clear-cuts, as required by the FSC certification, compounded the negative effects of fire suppression and scarification on lichen. Compared to the scenario with no soil preparation, all our simulations resulted in a continuous decrease of lichen supply in Lichen-type stands, indicating that any form of disturbance in these habitats can strongly limit future gains.

AB  - Increasing human-wild boar conflicts in South Korea have led to a demand for effective management strategies. Absolute abundance, rather than relative indices, is needed for the long-term monitoring and population control of wild boars. Indirect methods for density estimation have become increasingly popular because they are cost-effective and do not have the risk of capture probability bias. We compared three indirect methods, including the non-invasive capture-recapture model (NICRM), random encounter model (REM), and fecal standing crop (FSC), in two different sites characterized by specific habitats (urban and agricultural environments). NICRM and REM reflected population fluctuation and hunting intensity assumptions at both sites; however, FSC did not reflect the latter. While using NICRM, efforts are needed for achieving a low genotyping error rate; this model would achieve more reliable results in low-density areas. REM with accurate parameter information (i.e., daily range, detection zone, and camera placement) could be the most effective density estimation method for long-term monitoring in South Korean environments. Conversely, FSC may not be recommended because of many factors, such as decomposition rate, rainfall, biased distribution of feces that might affect pellet groups. Additionally, the density estimates from this study can provide information for developing effective management strategies in South Korean environments.

AB  - Animal carcass decomposition is an often-overlooked component of nutrient cycles. The importance of carcass decomposition for increasing nutrient availability has been demonstrated in several ecosystems, but impacts in arid lands are poorly understood. In a protected high desert landscape in Argentina, puma predation of vicunas is a main driver of carcass distribution. Here, we sampled puma kill sites across three habitats (plains, canyons, and meadows) to evaluate the impacts of vicuna carcass and stomach decomposition on soil and plant nutrients up to 5 years after carcass deposition. Soil beneath both carcasses and stomachs had significantly higher soil nutrient content than adjacent reference sites in arid, nutrient-poor plains and canyons, but not in moist, nutrient-rich meadows. Stomachs had greater effects on soil nutrients than carcasses. However, we did not detect higher plant N concentrations at kill sites. The biogeochemical effects of puma kills persisted for several years and increased over time, indicating that kills do not create ephemeral nutrient pulses, but can have lasting effects on the distribution of soil nutrients. Comparison to broader spatial patterns of predation risk reveals that puma predation of vicunas is more likely in nutrient-rich sites, but carcasses have the greatest effects on soil nutrients in nutrient-poor environments, such that carcasses increase localized heterogeneity by generating nutrient hotspots in less productive environments. Predation and carcass decomposition may thus be important overlooked factors influencing ecosystem functioning in arid environments.

AB  - Mountainous regions are affected the most by climate change across the world. The livelihood of highlanders primarily depends on livestock farming and natural resources. In Bhutan, yak farming and sale of Cordyceps sinensis (caterpillar fungus)remain the main source of income for most highlanders. We conducted a study to understand the impact of climate change on the community livelihoods in Bhutan. A cross-sectional survey was conducted and interviewed 132 household heads, two focus group discussions of 20 respondents (10 in each group), and key informant interviews (n = 5) in two highland communities (i.e., Laya and Lunana) of Gasa district in northern Bhutan between August 2019 and February 2020. The study revealed that the caterpillar fungus (78.8%) is the major source of income for highland communities which overtook the yak farming practices since its legalization in 2004. More than 80% of households have abandoned yak farming due to its poor economic return because of the decreased utility of yak for meat purposes and other socio-cultural related practices. The majority of the respondents (91%) expressed concern that climate change is posing a threat to the growth and subsequent harvest of caterpillar fungus. The highland people reported emergence of insects/vectors in their community and mosquitoes were the most frequently reported (85%) insect. A small proportion of respondents (1.5%) were concerned about the grazing habitat of the yaks due to the change in the botanical composition of the rangeland. Given that there is a decrease in caterpillar fungus, which is the main source of income for highland communities, this study calls for a climate-resilient community-based economic opportunity for the sustainable livelihood of highland communities. Furthermore, we recommend a detailed study of the negative impacts due to climate change on freshwater resources, the distribution of vectors and vector-borne diseases, and rangeland ecology in the highland.

AB  - The marking behavior of male Siberian Roe deer in central Yakutia, Siberia is considered in the context of a biological signal field. The optical elements of the Roe deer signal field are trees and shrubs damaged by their horns. Seven species of tree and shrub plants used by Roe deer as marking objects have been found: pine, larch, fir, birch, willow, aspen, and alder. Among them, representatives of conifers predominate. The maximum thickness of a marking tree across the trunk circumference does not exceed 21 cm, the thickness of marking objects averaging 7.0 +/- 3.7 cm. The marking activity of the species rendered on wood and shrub vegetation is performed by demonstrating three types of damage: circular stripping across the trunk circumference; vertical stripping along the trunk, and twisting the trunk.

AB  - Mangrove forests play an important role in mitigating climate change but are threatened by aquaculture expansion. The inclusion of mangroves in climate change mitigation strategies requires measuring of carbon stocks and the emissions caused by land use change over time. This study provides a synthesis of carbon stocks in mangrove and shrimp ponds in the Gulf of Guayaquil. In this study area, we identified 134,064 ha of mangrove forest and 153,950 ha of shrimp farms. Two mangrove strata were identified according to their height and basal area: medium-statured mangrove (lower height and basal area) and tall mangrove (greater height and basal area). These strata showed statistical differences in aboveground carbon stocks. In both strata, the most abundant mangrove species was Rhizophora mangle. For both strata, trees had a maximum height (>30 m), and their density was greater than 827 ha(-1). Total ecosystem level carbon stocks (measured to 1 m soil depth) were 320.9 Mg C ha(-1) in medium-statured mangroves and 419.4 Mg C ha(-1) in tall mangroves. The differences are attributable to higher basal area, soil organic carbon concentrations and salinity, tidal range, origin of allochthonous material, and herbivory patterns. Mangrove soils represented >80% of the total ecosystem carbon. Ecosystem carbon stocks were lower (81.9 Mg C ha(-1)) in the shrimp farms, 50% less than in undisturbed mangroves. Our results highlight mangroves as tropical ecosystems with extremely high carbon storage; therefore, they play an important role in mitigating climate change. This research provides a better understanding of how carbon stocks in this gulf are found and can be used for design strategies to protect global natural carbon sinks.

AB  - Predation of livestock by wild carnivores is a source of human-wildlife conflict. Livestock Guarding Dogs (LGDs) are one of the most effective non-lethal methods used. LGDs could impact wildlife due to their possible top predator role; their effect on mesocarnivores has been studied mainly in terms of space use, however, temporal effects may also exist. Our study sought to determine the possible effects of LGD presence on the activity patterns of the native foxes Lycalopex griseus and L. culpaeus in southern Chile. Activity patterns were estimated from fox detections with camera traps set on ranches with and without LGDs in Isla Riesco, Magallanes region, Chile, between 2016 and 2018. We quantified the activity patterns of each fox species in presence/absence of LGDs, and under different conditions including breeding vs non-breeding season, moon phase and vegetation cover. Both species modified their daily activity pattern, avoiding times of day of high LGD activity; nevertheless, these modifications did not change the temporal interaction between the native foxes. Activity patterns of foxes without LGDs did not differ from those in natural areas. The effect of LGDs on fox activity patterns was stronger than other ecological variables (breeding season, moon phase or vegetation cover). Since LGDs change the activity patterns of foxes, they cannot be seen as a totally innocuous predation control tool; however, carnivores' temporal avoidance of areas with a fear-evoking agent like LGDs would result in fewer livestock-predators encounters, thus reducing sheep predation risk. LGDs appear to exert non-lethal effects upon carnivores that would contribute to reduced predation rates and may help decrease producers' economic losses, as well as the retaliatory hunting of wild carnivores. Thus, our results support that LGDs could be contributing to the co-existence with native predators in areas destined for livestock production.

AB  - Continuous nitrogen deposition threatens ecosystems by acidifying soils, causing a stoichiometric imbalance in the vegetation and ultimately, the disappearance of plant and animal species. There is a gap in knowledge of how decomposers such as oribatid mites cope with the effects of nitrogen deposition. Therefore, we conducted feeding experiments with the herbivorous mite Platynothrus peltifer (C.L. Koch, 1839) to assess its fitness as a measure of its reproductive response towards different nitrogen levels in its diet. Mites were collected from the field, starved, and allowed to lay eggs. We recorded the number of eggs during 60 days of experimental trial. The fecundity of mites varied with different elemental compositions, whereby phosphorus seemed to be a limiting factor. With ongoing nitrogen deposition in the future and concomitant phosphorus limitation, we expect a negative impact on the population dynamics of herbivorous decomposers such as Platynothrus peltifer.

AB  - Accurate abundance estimates are critical for informed management of wildlife populations. In New Mexico, USA, minimum counts from aerial surveys are the primary basis for management decisions regarding desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis mexicana); therefore, there is a need to assess methods that account for imperfect detection. Common survey methods for large mammals (i.e., sightability, double-observer, and double-observer sightability models) are known to result in biased estimates, but the presence of radio-collared individuals within a population allows for estimation of residual heterogeneity. Consequently, we explored the use of hybrid double-observer sightability approaches that account for residual heterogeneity when estimating abundance of desert bighorn sheep in the Fra Cristobal Mountains of New Mexico. We collected double-observer sightability data for 167 desert bighorn groups across 3 surveys between December 2016 and November 2017 and compared abundance estimates under 5 modeling methods: a standard sightability model (MS), a standard double-observer sightability model (MDS), a hybrid double-observer sightability model incorporating a recapture-type heterogeneity parameter (MR), a hybrid double-observer sightability model incorporating a mark-type heterogeneity parameter (MH), and a Lincoln-Petersen estimator. Across all model types, group behavior (moving vs. stationary) and group size influenced detection the most, followed by vegetation class, terrain type, and proportion of obscuring vegetation cover. Standard sightability models produced higher and less precise abundance estimates than all double-observer sightability models. Of the double-observer sightability models, MR was better supported and estimated greater abundance than MH and accounted for more bias than MDS. Both MR and MH yielded greater precision than MS. The MR models produced an average detection probability of p = 0.72 (SE = 0.02) and abundance estimates of N <^> $\hat{N}$ = 302 (95% CI = 262-385), N <^> $\hat{N}$ = 290 (95% CI = 261-340), and N <^> $\hat{N}$= 352 (95% CI = 264-548) for the December 2016, May 2017, and November 2017 surveys, respectively. Lincoln-Petersen estimates of abundance were greater than all double-observer sightability models and similarly precise, but their usefulness is reduced given the requirement to permanently maintain a subset of animals with radio-collars combined with the inability to incorporate information from factors influencing detection probability. Further, because residual heterogeneity models better estimate visibility bias, are flexible in their accommodation of radio-collar data, and can be adapted to unique survey occasions, they present a viable and robust option for estimating desert bighorn sheep abundance.

AB  - Although wolves are wide-ranging generalist carnivores throughout their life cycle, during the pup-rearing season wolf activity is focused on natal den sites where pup survival depends upon pack members provisioning food. Because prey availability is influenced by habitat quality within the home range, we investigated the relative importance of prey species for adults and pups and further examined the relationship between habitat characteristics, wolf diet, and litter size on Prince of Wales Island (POW) in Southeast Alaska. During 2012-2020, we detected 13 active den sites within the home ranges of nine wolf packs. We estimated minimum pup counts using motion-detecting cameras and individual genotypes from noninvasive samples (hair: n = 322; scat: n = 227) and quantified wolf diet composition using fecal DNA metabarcoding (n = 538). We assessed habitat composition, configuration, and connectivity within denning and annual home ranges estimated using wolf GPS-collar data. Contrary to expectations, wolves had a more constricted diet during denning season (April 15-July 31), and within this season pups had a narrower dietary niche (species richness [S] = 4) focused more on deer (relative frequency of occurrence [O/I] = 0.924) than adults (S = 15; deer O/I = 0.591). Litter size had a positive relationship with the relative frequency of deer in a wolf pack's diet. Wolf consumption of deer was positively associated with the proportion of young-growth forest (& LE;25 years old) within denning and annual home ranges. High levels of vegetation patch interspersion, and the density of closed logging roads were also important predictors, suggesting these habitat qualities were influential for increasing the availability of deer to wolves. Our results contrast with previous research indicating wolf pup diets included more alternate prey (i.e., beaver) than adults and emphasize the importance of deer to wolf viability on POW, especially during denning season.

AB  - Landscape distribution and grazing management of small ruminants are becoming more important issues as the sheep and goat industry continues to grow. The objective of this study was to evaluate spatial movement patterns of sheep and goats in Queensland, Australia using Global Positioning System (GPS) tracking to determine daily distance traveled, distance traveled from water, activity levels, and the influence of ambient temperature on these metrics. Optimized hotspot analysis was also performed to determine areas of increased small ruminant presence across the landscape. GPS positions were recorded at 10 -min intervals over the course of several months. Sheep and goats traveled an average distance from water of 0.6-1.1 km, with a maximum of 2.4 km. Daily distance traveled of sheep and goats averaged 6-9 km center dot d-1, with a maximum of 11 km center dot d-1. Average daily activity ranged between 42% and 47%. The overall trend of the datum showed that increased temperature led to decreased daily distance traveled, distance traveled from water, and activity of sheep and goats. The hotspot analyses showed a higher concentration of sheep and goats near water sources. Understanding small ruminant distribution in extensive rangeland pastures helps producers implement management regimes to improve efficacy and sustainability of land use and production.

AB  - Pyric herbivory (PH), the combination of prescribed burnings and targeted herbivory, is a promising tool for landscape restoration that emulates historical disturbance regimes. Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are crucial nutrients for plant growth and although several studies have analysed the single effects of fire or grazers in their availability, the combined effect of both disturbances in the soil nutrient budgets have been rarely considered. This research was planned to analyse the 2-year impact of PH restoration practices on the availability of N and P in two Ulex gallii-encroached grasslands in the Pyrenees. We monitored available forms of N and P for two years using periodic replacements of ion exchange resins to test the hypothesis that mid-term effect of targeted grazing was more relevant than short-term effect of burning. Additionally, we investigated the role of temperature and precipitation on nutrients accumulation and compared its significance to management factors. Burning transformed vegetation and litter into a spatially heterogeneous layer of ash and charred material, which resulted in a variable availability of N and P at the rhizosphere level. After two periods of PH, nutrient availability was higher in soils from grazed plots compared to ungrazed, and the impacts of early burns were scarcely discernible. Nitrate was found to be the most rainfall-dependent nutrient, and grazing also affected its spatial distribution. Our results suggest that the heterogeneous nutrient enrichment enhanced by PH is important for promoting the establishment of a diverse pool of plant species, including both N2-fixing and non-fixing species. In these rainy areas, the use of burnings alone, without grazing, may perpetuate the dynamics of N2-fixing shrub encroachment.

AB  - Dominant plant species are locally abundant and have large impacts on ecological communities via a variety of mechanisms. However, few studies have evaluated the influence of a dominant plant species both within and among trophic levels and on key ecosystem functions such as productivity. In this study, we evaluated the effect of the dominant plant species Solidago canadensis on plant and arthropod communities in an old-field ecosystem in southeastern Michigan. We found that S. canadensis negatively correlated with the richness and combined biomass of all other plant species in the community, likely by reducing light availability. In turn, less biomass of all other plant species led to lower arthropod abundance. Specifically, detritivore and predator arthropod abundance was lower with less biomass of all plant species excluding S. canadensis, but herbivore and omnivore abundance was unaffected. Our results highlight the significant role of dominant plants in determining plant diversity and ecosystem function, and further suggest that the effect of a dominant plant species on a community is observed at higher trophic levels.

AB  - A better understanding of the role of plant composition and N cycle on agroecosystems is necessary, as these will be affected by future developments in agriculture intensification. To explore the effect of plant diversity on yield and carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) balances in forage mixtures, identifying potential co-benefits between functions. We analyzed results from a field experiment where plants of three forage species (a grass, a legume, and a non-legume forb) were cultivated in monocultures and mixtures. Three years after sward establishment, dry matter yield, together with delta 15N, delta 13C, and C and N content in plant and soil material were measured. In addition, we analyzed a second scenario to investigate the effect of fertigation with pig slurry (delta 15N = +8.4 parts per thousand) on the C and N balances of forage species. Results support the hypothesis that C and N allocation is affected by plant diversity. Plant composition affected N source (% N derived from air, % N derived from soil, and % N transferred in mixtures). In addition, sown diversity increased yield and modulated C and N balances. The delta 15N of samples was affected by both plant composition and fertigation. These results are consistent with previous work showing strong plant composition effects on N-balances, and the potential role that legumes play in enhancing nitrogen sources (derived from the atmosphere) into forage mixture systems. This study contributes to the prediction of suitable sown plant community composition and N management for the optimum agriculture with increased productivity and at the same time reduced environmental impact.

AB  - Invasive alien species (IAS) are a major threat to global biodiversity. The total cost of biological invasions across all European Union member states has been estimated at 129.9 billion US dollars between 1960 and 2020. It is, therefore, crucial to implement effective measures for IAS management. In Europe, the overarching mechanism for this is established through the European Union (EU) Biodiversity Strategy 2030, which aims to halve the number of Red List species threatened by IAS by 2030, namely by stepping up the implementation of the EU IAS Regulation. To support the implementation of the strategy, we use the Species Threat Abatement and Restoration (STAR) methodology to identify and quantify opportunities to reduce species extinction risk in the EU by managing invasive alien species (IAS), focusing specifically on its threat abatement component (STAR-t). Using data from the European Red List on extinction risk, threats and distribution for terrestrial and freshwater species groups (both animals and plants) threatened by IAS, we identified key geographic areas and species for intervention. The countries and territories providing the largest opportunities to contribute towards reducing EU species extinction risk through managing IAS are the Canary Islands [Spain] (20.8% of total EU STAR-t attributed to IAS), Madeira [Portugal] (14.2%), mainland Spain (11.9%), Italy (9.3%), Azores [Portugal] (5.4%) and Greece (5.3%). For specific IAS, the greatest opportunities to reduce regional species extinction risk by mitigating threats from IAS come from managing feral goats (12.4%), mouflons (8.1%), rabbits (5.3%) and rats (4.6%). This work showcases the first application of STAR at a regional scale to measure opportunities for threat abatement caused by IAS and provides practical application in guiding the management actions with the highest conservation gains towards the EU Biodiversity Strategy 2030.

AB  - Extreme heat and chronic water scarcity present formidable challenges to large desert-dwelling mammals. In addition to camels, antelopes within the Hippotraginae and Alcelaphinae subfamilies also exhibit remarkable physiological and genetic specializations for desert survival. Among them, the critically endangered addax (Addax nasomaculatus) represents the most desert-adapted antelope species. However, the evolutionary and molecular mechanisms underlying desert adaptations remain largely unexplored. Herein, a high-quality genome assembly of the addax was generated to investigate the molecular evolution of desert adaptation in camels and desert antelopes. Comparative genomic analyses identified 136 genes harboring convergent amino acid substitutions implicated in crucial biological processes, including water reabsorption, fat metabolism, and stress response. Notably, a convergent R146S amino acid mutation in the prostaglandin EP2 receptor gene PTGER2 significantly reduced receptor activity, potentially facilitating large-mammal adaptation to arid environments. Lineage-specific innovations were also identified in desert antelopes, including previously uncharacterized conserved non-coding elements. Functional assays revealed that several of these elements exerted significant regulatory effects in vitro, suggesting potential roles in adaptive gene expression. Additionally, signals of introgression and variation in genetic load were observed, indicating their possible influence on desert adaptation. These findings provide insights into the sequential evolutionary processes that drive physiological resilience in arid environments and highlight the importance of convergent evolution in shaping adaptive traits in large terrestrial mammals.

AB  - Societal Impact StatementLong-term phenology data is crucial to elucidate the effects of climate change on plants, but such efforts are lacking in the tropics. Historical records at the Singapore Botanic Gardens and ongoing phenological monitoring have allowed us to study leafing behaviour and its association with changing rainfall patterns over nine decades in equatorial Singapore. We found that the leafing behaviour of trees in our tropical site changed between 1927 and 2022. This study was made possible by assiduous past and present record-keeping, and demonstrates the potential of botanical gardens as sentinels of environmental change, which is especially important in the tropics.Summary Understanding tropical phenology and the potential impacts of a changing climate requires long-term monitoring but such efforts are rare in the tropics. We took advantage of the availability of historical phenological and weather records at the Singapore Botanic Gardens and ongoing phenological monitoring to ask whether leafing behaviour has changed over an exceptionally long period of about nine decades, and whether these changes are associated with changing rainfall patterns in supposedly aseasonal Singapore. Records of leaf flush intervals from 1927 to 1939 in the Singapore Botanic Gardens were compared against leaf flush intervals calculated from present-day phenological monitoring conducted since 2016. Daily rainfall was modelled as a predictor of present-day leaf flushing events using moving-window analyses. Leaf flush intervals have shortened considerably for most of the species that were monitored in the two periods. Mean daily rainfall over a window of 1 to 4 months before was negatively associated with probability of leaf flushing for five species and positively associated with four out of a total of 23 species analysed. Long-term rainfall records from 1929 to 2022 show that February has become drier and May has become wetter since the 1960s. The results consistently support that more distinctive dry and wet periods today compared to nine decades ago have resulted in more frequent leaf flushing, which may have implications for plant-herbivore interactions, nutrient cycling and consequently plant health and ecosystem resilience. We also demonstrate the potential and importance of supporting long-term research in botanical gardens in the tropics.

AB  - Despite the popularity of translocation for conservation, many wildlife translocations fail. Research on translocation failure has most often focused on negative species interactions like competition or predation, but positive interactions such as facilitation may be just as important. Ecosystem engineers, including burrowing rodents, play a key role in maintaining high levels of biodiversity and could be used to improve translocation outcomes. However, ecosystem engineers might simultaneously facilitate and compete with translocated species. We used a natural experiment to assess translocation outcomes with a soft release for the threatened San Joaquin antelope squirrel (Ammospermophilus nelsoni) at a site with and without giant kangaroo rats (Dipodomys ingens)-an endangered species and ecosystem engineer. We further compared these outcomes to a control, non-translocated population of antelope squirrels. Survival was highest at the control site, lower at the site with giant kangaroo rats present, and lowest at the site with no giant kangaroo rats. In the year following translocation, we found evidence of reproduction at all three sites. After four years, the antelope squirrel population re-introduced to the kangaroo rat present site persisted, but the population at the kangaroo rat absent site appears to have failed. Home range sizes were much larger at the translocation sites compared to the control. Antelope squirrels dispersed farther from initial release at the site with giant kangaroo rats than the site without, but these results may have suffered from survivorship bias-that is, squirrels at the kangaroo rat absent site either stayed directly within the release footprint or dispersed so far that we could not find them. Our results suggest that the positive impacts of a burrowing ecosystem engineer outweigh the potential negative impacts from competition.

AB  - Since the beginning of the XIX century, Grotta Romanelli gained recognition in European stratigraphy as an important site for the Late Pleistocene, due to the attribution of its basal sediments to the Last Interglacial (MIS 5e). Its abundant archaeological and paleontological findings made the cave a key reference point for the study of human evolution and faunal dynamics in the larger Mediterranean area over approximately the last 130,000 years. After a century, a new chronostratigraphic reassessment of Grotta Romanelli revised the timeframe of its lower levels, predating them to the late Middle Pleistocene. In this study, we re-evaluate selected historical museum collections from the so-called "lower complex" of Grotta Romanelli and examine the new fossils excavated between 2015 and 2022. We identify three main mammal assemblages associated with three different interglacial periods spanning the last 350,000 years. Our findings offer new insights into terrestrial ecosystems in Mediterranean Europe from the late Middle Pleistocene to early Late Pleistocene. Additionally, they provide valuable information to the biochronological framework of the European large mammal faunas.

AB  - Remote-sensing technology facilitates longitudinal collection of body temperature during periods of hot or cold environmental stress without human interference, producing high-frequency measurements whilst reducing labour and stress to the animal. A pilot study was conducted to validate an improved, minimally invasive method for the continual measurement of vaginal temperature (VT) in female sheep. A silicon mould of a modified controlled internal drug release (CIDR) device (Zoetis Animal Health, Parsippany), was manufactured to securely house a temperature logger (Micro-T 16-bit; Star Oddi, Iceland) and allow direct contact at the collection site. These temperature-sensing CIDR devices were validated against manual rectal temperature (RT) measurements collected from 15 mature, non-pregnant, non-lactating Merino ewes. Rectal temperature was measured from each individual, six times per day in 2-h intervals for 14 consecutive days. The simultaneous measures of VT and RT did not differ significantly within each ewe (P > 0.05) and demonstrated a moderate linear relationship (R-2 = 0.62, P < 0.05). The mean (+/- SEM) difference between RT and VT was small (0.010 +/- 0.004 degrees C), with a 95% confidence interval of - 0.26 to 0.29 degrees C. Additionally, the coefficient of variation was lower on average for VT (0.49%) compared to RT (0.59%). Differences among paired readings were likely due to interval variation as well as penetration depth, air influx and faecal temperature when collecting RT. The initial silicone manufacturing costs were high (2200 AUD), with each unit costing 1.25 (AUD) thereafter; however, the temperature-sensing CIDR device was an effective and efficient research tool for the remote monitoring of body temperature. While further validation of these devices within extensive grazing environments is warranted, the collection and analysis of longitudinal physiological data from ewes has the potential to improve a variety of management aspects related to extensively grazed ewes maintained and joined in harsh conditions.

AB  - Background: Gut microbiota is pivotal in regulating hosts' biological processes and maintaining homeostasis, but knowledge about its role in wild herbivores in extreme environments remains limited.
   Methods: Gut bacteria and fungi were sequenced in ruminant (Chiru and Yak) and nonruminant (Kiang) herbivores on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and their community structure, co-occurrence networks, functions, and assembly mechanisms were investigated using multivariate ecological and statistical methods.
   Results: Kiang had lower gut microbial diversity than Chiru and Yak. Bacterial host-specific exclusivity was greater than that of fungi. In addition to the evidence of glycan biosynthesis and carbohydrate metabolism, Chiru had a high Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio and low animal pathogen abundance, suggesting better adaptation to the plateau's harsh environment. Additionally, members of gut microbiota tended to co-occur rather than co-exclude in all herbivores. Different network complexity and stability patterns were observed between bacterial and fungal communities. Furthermore, gut bacterial assembly was primarily controlled by stochastic dispersal limitation and drift, whereas fungal assembly was primarily controlled by deterministic homogeneous selection except in Chiru.
   Conclusions: On the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Chiru and Yak exhibit more diverse gut microbiota and more diverse metabolic functions than Kiang, and gut bacteria are more divergent than gut fungi in these herbivores.

AB  - Grasshoppers are important elements for supporting ecosystem services which make it important to understand their spatial distribution characteristics to reduce outbreaks, implement effective control while minimizing non-target impacts. The spatial software package Geographical Detector (GD) was used to rank the interaction and effects of 19 environmental factors on the distribution of grasshopper species were quantified in four types of steppes in Northwestern, China. Results showed that the distribution of the insect was mainly influenced by elevation (q = 0.44). Among the factor interactions, elevation & AND; average annual precipitation (q = 0.795) was the strongest, followed by elevation & AND; soil available nitrogen (q = 0.722). Temperate meadow steppe and temperate steppe were identified as the areas at greatest risk for grasshopper's occurrence. This research shows that the Geographical Detector could be provided a useful tool to identify the driving forces for grasshopper distribution. Our research also offers a new method to more broadly understand the interactions between different drivers to explain the distribution of other insects.

AB  - Predators may create healthier prey populations by selectively removing diseased individuals. Predators typically prefer some ages of prey over others, which may, or may not, align with those prey ages that are most likely to be diseased. The interaction of age-specific infection and predation has not been previously explored and likely has sizable effects on disease dynamics. We hypothesize that predator cleansing effects will be greater when the disease and predation occur in the same prey age groups. We examine the predator cleansing effect using a model where both vulnerability to predators and pathogen prevalence vary with age. We tailor this model to chronic wasting disease (CWD) in mule deer and elk populations in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, with empirical data from Yellowstone grey wolves and cougars. Model results suggest that under moderate, yet realistic, predation pressure from cougars and wolves independently, predators may decrease CWD outbreak size substantially and delay the accumulation of symptomatic deer and elk. The magnitude of this effect is driven by the ability of predators to selectively remove late-stage CWD infections that are likely the most responsible for transmission, but this may not be the age class they typically select. Thus, predators that select for infected young adults over uninfected juveniles have a stronger cleansing effect, and these effects are strengthened when transmission rates increase with increasing prey morbidity. There are also trade-offs from a management perspective-that is, increasing predator kill rates can result in opposing forces on prey abundance and CWD prevalence. Our modelling exploration shows that predators have the potential to reduce prevalence in prey populations when prey age and disease severity are considered, yet the strength of this effect is influenced by predators' selection for demography or body condition. Current CWD management focuses on increasing cervid hunting as the primary management tool, and our results suggest predators may also be a useful tool under certain conditions, but not necessarily without additional impacts on host abundance and demography. Protected areas with predator populations will play a large role in informing the debate over predator impacts on disease.

AB  - Understanding the drivers influencing ungulate population dynamics is crucial for developing conservation and management strategies to support wildlife health. Trace and macro elements are vital for ungulate growth, reproduction and survival. Thus, the trajectory of wildlife populations may be associated with element imbalances. Element concentrations can be measured in hair, an increasingly recognised bio-monitoring tool. However, a better understanding of the relevance for wild ungulate population dynamics is needed. This study aimed to assess if element profiles in hair reflected the population trajectory of a keystone Arctic ungulate, muskox Ovibos moschatus, and whether benchmarks could be defined for element concentrations to assess population status. We measured qiviut (hair) element concentrations of 11 muskox populations ranging across northern America, including Greenland, and evaluated the association between element concentrations and different population trajectories. Seven trace and macro elements differentiated increasing populations from declining and stable populations using linear discriminant analysis. In general, copper, selenium, iron, manganese and cobalt tended to be at higher concentrations in increasing populations, whereas zinc and calcium were generally at lower concentrations in these populations, though variations were observed among populations. Benchmarks were defined for copper, selenium and iron, indicating populations were more likely to decline below a threshold concentration of these elements ('limit') and increase above a threshold concentration ('target'). 'Limit' benchmarks were defined for zinc and calcium where populations were more likely to be increasing below this threshold value. Hair element profiles are a useful indicator of population trajectory in wild ungulate populations. Identified benchmarks can be used to assess population status, complementing ongoing but irregular and expensive monitoring efforts like population surveys, while trace element concentrations can provide insights into the mechanisms driving population change. Hair samples can easily be collected non-invasively or alongside other monitoring activities, enhancing proactive wildlife management and conservation.

AB  - Miombo woodlands are the most extensive dry forest type in southern Africa, covering ca. 1.9 million km(2) across seven countries. Fire is a key ecosystem process that has structured miombo for the last 200,000 years. However, how fires affect the ecosystem's functioning is not well understood. In this study, we used the individual-based forest model called FORMIND to analyze the carbon balance in the miombo woodlands of Niassa Special Reserve (NSR), northern Mozambique. The 42.000 km(2) NSR represents the most important conservation area in Mozambique (similar to 31% of the total conservation area in the country) and of miombo woodlands worldwide. Longterm inventory data from 2004 to 2019 for NSR were used to calibrate FORMIND. The primary ecosystem processes of this model are tree growth, mortality, regeneration, and competition. Fire is set as one of the main factors that affect these processes, after the woodland reaches an equilibrium at 200 years of age. We also calculated the Net Present Value (NPV) of carbon credits resulting from altering the fire regime (e.g., reducing or eliminating fires). The FORMIND model successfully reproduced important characteristics of the woodlands (aboveground biomass, stem size distribution and basal area). NPV estimates of above-ground woody biomass carbon stocks were highly dependent on the woodland age. The maximum NPV estimates were generated for a 30-year project starting with 200 year old woodlands (the current forest age) at 192-1339 USD based on a realistic range of carbon values (i.e., 3-20 USD MgCO(2)e(-1)). While fire plays an important role in miombo woodlands by reducing stock and changing species composition, its effects on the capacity of the woodland to mitigate the effects of climate change varies depending on the age of stands. Our results show that FORMIND model reliably reproduce the field inventory data, thus can be used to improve carbon accounting standards. We recommend the development of a fire management system to sustain the miombo woodlands of NSR for multiple reasons. NSR is a globally significant protected area, but perhaps more importantly it could become a regional example for how to improve miombo woodland management. Given that miombo woodlands provide a myriad of ecosystem services to rural Africans, investing in improving fire management could increase the benefits to local communities. Altering fire regimes could improve habitat quality and promote greater resilience to climate change while sequestering carbon. In addition, local employment opportunities in fire management could be created via carbon financing from a carbon project. However, much more outreach and education will be needed to local and national stakeholders for fire management to be perceived more positively and realize the potential to generate multiple benefits for nature and people.

AB  - The causes of megafauna extinction in the late Quaternary have long been a controversial subject, which may be related to the limitations of adequate information to evaluate global hypotheses related to climate change and the impacts of modern human dispersal. We propose a new global spatio-temporal approach using variations of Earth's orbital parameters and atmospheric CO2 levels as forcing factors for environmental and climate change with worldwide distribution. We analysed the overlap between 142 times-of-extinction of megafauna, and high obliquity (as a forcing factor for seasonality), low atmospheric CO2 levels (as a forcing factor for desertification), and the arrival of modern humans. We found that critical periods of seasonality and desertification intensified in the last 800 ka BP, and made the last 50 ka BP exceptionally severe in relation to the entire Quaternary. These critical periods significantly overlapped with 87% of extinctions in continental and connected islands, compared with 32.1% overlap of extinctions with the arrival of modern humans. In contrast the arrival of modern humans on isolated islands overlapped with 90.9% of the extinctions. The arrival of modern humans in continental regions had 81.3% of overlap with critical periods of climate change, suggesting that the synchrony observed between extinctions and the dispersal of modern humans in continental regions was driven by climate.

The predator-prey interaction clearly demon-strates how young individuals of hyper herbivores become vulnerable to African lions during long periods of extreme drought. And when the same age class is suppressed seasonally, year after year, populations can be drastically reduced by not incorporating reproductively active in-dividuals. So, for years I looked for data that represented the seasonality and drought conditions at the time the extinctions occurred. That's why I also thank Michael Palmer who, in a forum, proposed to help Ralph Ellis publish "the best explanation about what triggers glaciations"; with this study I learned a lot about the importance of orbital cycles I use in this study. I also thank my brother, Rafael Graipel, and several re-searchers with whom I had the opportunity to discuss the extinction of megafauna.

AB  - Premise: Plants produce an array of floral olfactory and visual cues to attract pollinators, including volatile organic compounds (VOC), which mediate plant-pollinator interactions and may be influenced by herbivory and neighboring plants. Consequently, these factors may affect plant fitness by disrupting pollination. However, most evidence comes from controlled experiments, limiting our understanding of how VOCs function in natural populations. This study investigated how herbivory and conspecific ramet density influence floral VOC profile, pollination, and seed production in a naturally occurring population of Solidago altissima. Methods: We recorded leaf herbivory and ramet density surrounding one focal ramet in 1-m(2) plots. We collected VOCs from the floral headspace and measured ovary fertilization as a proxy for pollination success and the number of seeds produced by the focal ramet. Results: Our findings revealed interactive effects between ramet density and herbivory on floral VOC emission, richness, and diversity. Specifically, at lower ramet densities, herbivory did not affect floral volatile emissions. However, in highly dense stands, herbivory suppressed floral volatile emissions. Despite these changes, floral volatiles did not affect pollination and the number of seeds in S. altissima. Conclusions: Our field-based findings underscore the importance of understanding the complex responses of floral VOCs to environmental stressors and their contributions to plant reproduction within natural communities. Our results suggest that while herbivory and ramet density influence floral scent, these changes do not affect reproduction in our study. Ultimately, generalist-pollinated plants like S. altissima might not rely heavily on chemical signaling during pollination.

AB  - The classical concepts of top-down and bottom-up cascading effects in ecosystems are challenged by the interactions between green and brown food webs. The green food web relies on photosynthesis and the brown food web relies on the mineralisation of dead organic matter. Mutualistic interactions between these two food webs are crucial for ecosystem functioning because a major fraction of organic carbon is produced by the green food web, while mineral nutrients are mainly recycled through the brown one. However, green and brown food webs can compete for mineral nutrients if decomposers are nutrient limited. Thus, bottom-up or top-down effects on one food web can have major cascading effects on the other one. In our freshwater mesocosm experiment, we tested cascading bottom-up effects targeting the green food web through sunlight filtering and the brown food web through organic carbon addition; cascading top-down effects mediated by fish presence. Our main finding is a positive effect of fish on phytoplankton density in mesocosms where daylight was reduced. Fish also had a positive effect on the brown food web with increased abundances of heterotrophic prokaryotes and microbial eukaryotes. However, they had no significant effect on zooplankton biomass. We did not observe any cascading effect of light treatment on the brown food web and of organic carbon treatment on the green food web. Our organic carbon treatment had nearly no effect on the brown food web. The most likely explanation for the observed fish x light interaction is a bottom-up effect mediated by nutrient cycling embodied by the increased sediment production and DOC accumulation in the presence of fish. The lack of effect of our organic carbon treatment may be due to the moderate quantity of added carbon and of the low bioavailability of some of the added molecules. Our experiment suggests that fish can strongly stimulate phytoplankton through bottom-up effects due to nutrient cycling, and not only through the classic trophic cascade due to the top-down control on large herbivorous zooplankton.

AB  - Fire and grazing are key drivers of plant community structure in the Great Plains ecoregion, with critical impacts on the quantity and quality of forage. While the impact of fire on forage quality is well understood in many ecosystems, few studies have examined this question in the northern mixed-grass prairie. We investigated the postburn nutrient content of forbs and graminoids over a 4-yr timeframe, asking 1) how forage quality changed over the 4 yr post fire and 2) whether the effect of fire on quality was impacted by the resumption of grazing. We used near-infrared spectroscopy and generalized partial least squares regression (plsRglm) methods to assess crude protein. We show that the use of generalized models provides improved estimates of percent nitrogen than the standard partial least squares approach. Both crude protein and fiber varied annually after the wildfires, with no effect of grazing on forage quality. In the first and second years, burned sites displayed higher protein than unburned locations. Fire did not affect crude protein between plant functional groups; however, forbs showed higher nutrient values than grasses throughout the 4 yr. Fire affected fiber content with grasses showing higher fiber than forbs. There was a positive relationship between neutral and acid detergent fiber and litter in burned sites. These results indicate no long-term effect of wildfire on protein content, which stabilizes in the third year post burn. The improvement of forb digestibility and retention of protein under dry conditions could modify the grazing capacity of the prairies at large scales. This may also change the foraging behavior of large ungulate grazers through mechanisms such as increasing patch reselection (i.e., intensified grazing cycles) and broadening feeding preferences to forbs when grasses are limited or have high fiber content.

AB  - Population fluctuations of lemmings in the High Arctic appear to be driven by predator-prey interactions. However, lemming grazing can sometimes have a strong impact on the vegetation during population peaks, suggesting a possible role of plant-herbivore interactions. We use a large-scale experiment where predators were excluded to investigate whether predator reduction could have cascading effects on the vegetation through an increase in lemming densities in the Canadian Arctic. Morphological traits and biomass of Salix arctica and the biomass of Poaceae and Juncaceae were sampled inside and outside lemming exclosures. We detected signs of lemming grazing on the number of buds and catkins of S. arctica at snowmelt, and stem length, stem growth, and number of leaves during the summer but the impact was relatively small. We did not detect an impact of grazing on plant biomass during the summer. We also found limited evidence that the impact of grazing was higher in the predator exclosure even though lemming density increased up to two-fold. Our results suggest that the short-term impact of lemmings on vascular plants is relatively small and that an experimental increase in lemming density did not have a cascading effect on the plants consumed by these herbivores in the Canadian Arctic.

AB  - Aerial surveys for large ungulates produce count data that often underrepresent the number of animals. Errors in count data can lead to erroneous estimates of abundance if they are not addressed. Our objective was to address imperfect detection probability by developing a framework that produces realistic and defensible estimates of bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) abundance. We applied our framework to a population of desert bighorn sheep (O. c. nelsoni) in the Great Basin, Nevada, USA. We captured and marked 24 desert bighorn sheep with global positioning system (GPS)-collars and then conducted helicopter surveys naive to the locations of collared animals. We developed a Bayesian integrated data model to leverage information from telemetry data, helicopter survey counts, and habitat characteristics to estimate abundance while accounting for availability and perception probability (i.e., detection given availability). Distance to ridgeline, terrain ruggedness, tree cover, and slope influenced perception probability of sheep given they were viewable from the helicopter. There was also annual variation in perception probability (2018: median = 0.64, credible interval [CrI] = 0.37-0.87; 2019: median = 0.81, CrI = 0.49-0.97). The abundance estimates from the integrated data model decreased from 2018 (594; 95% CrI = 537-656) to 2019 (487; 95% CrI = 436-551). In addition, accounting for availability and imperfect perception resulted in greater estimates of abundance compared to traditional directed search methods, which were 340 for 2018 and 320 for 2019. Our modeling framework can be used to generate more defensible population estimates of bighorn sheep and other large mammals that have been surveyed in a similar manner.

AB  - The Rancho La Brea locality is world famous for asphaltic deposits that trapped and preserved late Pleistocene megafauna over the last 50,000 years. This wealth of paleontological data allows for detailed investigation into paleoecological changes through the last glacial maximum into the Holocene. Here, we used dental mesowear analyses to infer dietary behavior in Bison antiquus, Equus occidentalis, and Camelops hesternus from five deposits ("pits") spanning the latest Pleistocene: pits 77, 91, 13, 3, and 61/67. Mesowear was compared among pits for each taxon and discriminant function and posterior probability analyses were conducted using a modern dataset to predict dietary categories at Rancho La Brea. Published mesowear scores from late Pleistocene Bison, Equus and Camelops from other localities were included in the discriminant function and posterior probability analyses to assess dietary variability among regions. Mesowear for each taxon did not differ among pits. Posterior probabilities and discriminant function analyses recovered E. occidentalis as a strict grazer with B. antiquus and C. hesternus recovered as mixed feeders. The stability of mesowear scores through the latest Pleistocene suggests average diets of these herbivores did not significantly change at Rancho La Brea. This is in contrast to documented changes in climate and flora proxies of southern California. However, it is unclear whether these proxies are representative of climate and floral changes at Rancho La Brea. Mesowear scores from late Pleistocene populations of Equus, Bison, and Camelops indicate little variability in diet in Equus, modest variability in Bison, and high variability in Camelops. These analyses suggest large ungulates may have been more opportunistic in their feeding strategies and highlights the need for using multiple proxies to clarify dietary behavior of herbivores

AB  - As a cause of ecosystem disturbances, phytophagous insects are known to directly influence the element and organic matter (OM) cycling in ecosystems by their defoliation and excretion activity. This study focuses on the interplay between short-term, insect herbivory, plant responses to feeding activity, rhizosphere processes, and belowground nutrient availability under nutrient-poor soil conditions. To test the effects of insect herbivory on OM and nutrient cycling in an N-limited pasture system, mesocosm laboratory experiments were conducted using Dactylis glomerata as common grass species and Chorthippus dorsatus, a widespread grasshopper species, to induce strong defoliating herbivory. (CO2)-C-13 pulse labeling was used together with labeled N-15 feces to trace the fate of C in soil respiration at the beginning of herbivory, and of C and N in above- and belowground plant biomass, grasshopper, feces, bulk soil, soil microbial biomass, throughfall solutions, and soil solutions. Within five days, herbivory caused a reduction in aboveground grass biomass by about 34%. A linear mixed-effects model revealed that herbivory significantly increased total dissolved C and N amounts in throughfall solutions by a factor of 4-10 (P < 0.05) compared with the control. In total, 27.6% of the initially applied feces N-15 were translocated from the aboveground to the belowground system. A significant enrichment of N-15 in roots led to the assumption that feces-derived N-15 was rapidly taken up to compensate for the frass-related foliar N losses in light of N shortage. Soil microorganisms incorporated newly available C-13; however, the total amount of soil microbial biomass remained unaffected, while the exploitative grass species rapidly sequestered resources to facilitate its regrowth after herbivory attack. Heavy herbivory by insects infesting D. glomerata-dominated, N-deficient grasslands remarkably impacted belowground nutrient cycling by an instant amplification of available nutrients, which led to an intensified nutrient competition between plants and soil microorganisms. Consequently, these competitive plant-soil microbe interactions accelerated N cycling and effectively retained herbivory-mediated C and N surplus release resulting in diminished N losses from the system. The study highlighted the overarching role of plant adaptations to in situ soil fertility in short-term ecosystem disturbances.

AB  - Arctic warming is causing widespread "greening" of tundra ecosystems. What this means for plant-herbivore relations, including the grazing pressure herbivores exert on increasingly productive tundra ecosystems, is poorly understood. Svalbard is one of the fastest warming places on Earth, with concomitant increases in both forage biomass and reindeer numbers. In 11 years between 1998 and 2023, we measured grass biomass and the proportion of shoots grazed in mesic grass-dominated tundra to evaluate whether increased forage biomass of grass absorbed the grazing pressure of more reindeer. Also, we used GPS data from adult female reindeer (2009-2023) to identify if grazing pressure was relieved by spillover into other habitats. During the study period, reindeer abundance, estimated by annual capture-mark-recapture, tripled, while grass biomass only doubled. Grazing pressure increased from 4% to 8%, which was lower than expected from the increased reindeer density. This discrepancy was not caused by spillover into other habitats, but rather by increased grazing in higher-biomass patches that have emerged with summer warming. Our findings support the notion that increased summer forage has contributed to Svalbard reindeer population growth, notably by making available higher biomass grass swards that allow for greater food off take.

AB  - The European bison is a species well known for its low genetic variability due to historical bottleneck incidents. Restoration of the European bison population in Lithuania began at the end of the 20th century, and the Lithuanian population was re-established with ten individuals from the Prioksko-Terrasny reserve in Russia and one free-roaming individual captured in Lithuania. This research focused on the genetic diversity and genetic structure of European bison in Lithuania based on microsatellite markers and mtDNA sequences. The results of the microsatellite analysis revealed that the Lithuanian population (n = 34) has a different genetic structure to individuals in Poland (n = 16), Germany (n = 10), and Sweden (n = 6). The analysis of the mtDNA sequences showed a low level of variation, with two haplotypes observed in the Lithuanian bison population. H1 was more frequent and was also found in Poland, Romania, and Russia. The results of this investigation show that individuals should be continuously genetically monitored, registering their migrations and relocations for the successful management of the species in Lithuania.

AB  - Megabentic non-crustacean invertebrates which play crucial important role in the ecosystem were spatiotemporally studied in an oligotrophic water mass of the eastern Mediterranean shelf-shelf break. The samples were collected with an Otter fishery trawl on three regions, each having five different seafloor depths. The samplings were repeated seasonally in four different months during year 2014-2015, being aimed to provide baseline ecological information on their bathymetric and seasonal distribution and biodiversity patterns. A total of 7 megabenthic non-crustacean phyla were found including 90 species composed mainly of 38 mollusks, 20 echinoderms, and 12 sponges. Three non-crustacean species recorded alien species for the Mediterranean Sea. Number of species for each phylum changed with the seafloor depth. Number of species increased overall from the shallow water to the intermediate water, and then decreased down to the shelf break. The westernmost Mediterranean Sea was incomparable so rich and high in the number of species, biomass and abundance as compared with the easternmost Mediterranean Sea. In general, abundance and biomass increased in summer and decreased in winter in the Mediterranean Sea, particularly at the shallower waters, continental shelf depending mainly on a series variety of organisms' behaviors and environmental conditions. The abundance of epifauna was differentiated by the status of the grounds: fishing and non-fishing grounds. Conomurex persicus changed remarkably the spatiotemporal trends in contrast to no regular seasonal pattern in the faunistic characters in very shallow waters after its introduction. The depth-related gradient was owing to a number of biogeochemical and physical factors interacted with sedimentary characters, light intensity, nutritional condition availability, and temperature. With an exception of few species, the characteristic species for spatio-temporal similarities, the species composition were rather different between the easternmost and westernmost Mediterranean Sea.

AB  - With the rapid socio-economic development, intensified land use and population growth have severely threatened global biodiversity, particularly on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, a global biodiversity hotspot where many endangered species face significant habitat loss and fragmentation. The alpine musk deer (Moschus chrysogaster), a species endemic to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and one of the most endangered species globally, requires critical habitat assessment and conservation efforts for regional and global biodiversity protection. This study integrated data from 274 alpine musk deer occurrence points, obtained through infrared camera monitoring, field surveys, and literature reviews, with environmental variables, employing the MaxEnt model to analyze the current spatial distribution of suitable habitats and priority conservation areas in Western China. We calculated conservation effectiveness and identified gaps within four western provinces using ArcGIS. Results indicated that altitude, annual mean temperature, and temperature annual range were the primary environmental factors influencing the distribution of suitable habitats, which were concentrated in areas with altitudes of 3,000-5,000 m, annual mean temperatures of 0-5 degrees C, and temperature annual ranges of 30-40 degrees C. The suitable habitats were mainly distributed in central and southern Gansu, northeastern and scattered southern regions of Qinghai, central and western Sichuan, and central and eastern Xizang, with Xizang having the largest area of highly suitable habitat, Qinghai having the largest area of moderately suitable habitat, and Sichuan having the highest proportion of highly suitable habitat, while overall, Qinghai had the highest proportion of priority conservation areas. The suitability of habitats within national nature reserves in Western China varied significantly, with Sichuan's reserves showing the highest efficiency in protecting highly suitable habitats, and all four provinces exhibited significant conservation gaps. The study recommends maintaining suitable habitats, optimizing nature reserve layouts, establishing conservation gaps, and restoring ecosystems to protect alpine musk deer habitats and promote biodiversity health.

AB  - The North American boreal forest is a massive ecosystem, and its keystone herbivore is the snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus). Hares are exposed to considerable environmental extremes in diet and weather, food availability, and predation risk. Gut microbiomes have been suggested to facilitate adaptive animal responses to environmental change, but severe environmental challenges to homeostasis can also disrupt host-microbiome relationships. To better understand gut microbiome contributions to animal acclimation, we studied the faecal bacterial microbiome of wild hares across two types of extreme environmental change that are integral to their natural history: (1) seasonal transitions between summer and winter, and (2) changes over the similar to 10 year 'boom-bust' population cycles that are characterised by shifting food resource availability and predation pressure. When compared to summer, hares in winter had lower bacterial richness and were depleted in 20 families (including Oxalobacteraceae and Christensenellaceae) but enriched for Ruminococcaceae (a family which contains plant fibre degrading bacteria) alongside nine other bacterial groups. Marked bacterial microbiome differences also occurred across phases of the population cycle. Bacterial microbiomes were lower in richness and compositionally distinct in the peak compared to the increase or decline phases of the population cycle. Direct measures of host physiology and diet quality (faecal fibre contents) most strongly supported food resource availability as a mechanism underlying phase-based differences in bacterial communities, but faecal fibre contents could not fully account for bacterial microbiome variation across phases.

AB  - Mouse deer are primitive, forest ungulates found in Asia and Africa. Both the lesser mouse deer (Tragulus javanicus) and the Philippine mouse deer (T. nigricans) are managed in European zoos, but inconsistent breeding success between institutions, high neonatal mortality and a general lack of research on their husbandry and behaviour were identified by the coordinators of the European Endangered Species Programme (EEP) and the European Studbook (ESB) for each species, respectively. This study is the first to provide a behavioural description for the Philippine mouse deer and to compile a detailed behavioural repertoire for both species. Our aim was to identify the effects of current husbandry and management practices on the reproduction, behaviour and welfare of zoo-housed mouse deer. Questionnaires on husbandry and management practices were sent to all institutions in the EEP and ESB for the lesser and Philippine mouse deer, respectively, and behavioural data were collected in 15 of these zoos. For the lesser mouse deer, results show a positive effect of vegetation cover on breeding success, foraging and moving behaviours. The provision of enrichment and presence of water ponds also positively affected these behaviours. The time that pairs spent in close proximity had a negative effect on breeding success, but animals in more vegetated enclosures spent less time in close proximity to each other. Results could be partially explained by the natural habitat of this usually solitary species being tropical forest, which provides local water sources and undergrowth for cover from predators. For the Philippine mouse deer there were differences in activity measures recorded between zoos, but the sample size was small with differences in training, enrichment and vegetation cover likely to have been important. In conclusion, since mouse deer inhabit overlapping male and female territories, the usual practice of housing breeding pairs together may be appropriate, but we suggest that they should be provided with opportunities to avoid each other in complex enclosures with ample vegetation cover to maximise their natural behavioural repertoire and breeding success.

AB  - Despite the risks associated, some species choose to shield behind a predator to decrease predation risk by another predator. In this study, we demonstrate how Baird's tapirs (Tapirus bairdii) use humans as a "shield" to reduce the risk of being preyed upon by jaguars (Panthera onca). We collected georeferenced photographic records of 23 tapirs (seven of them injured) sighted near human settlements (0 to 5 km) in the Calakmul region of Mexico from 2008 to 2019. Using multidimensional scale analysis, we determined which possible factors (tapir health status, injuries, distance to the settlement, as well as seasonality) are related to the decision of tapirs to approach human settlements. To support our claims of jaguars' attacks, we described the pattern of injuries believed to have been inflicted by jaguars on tapirs, and we analysed photographs and videos of species of the genus Panthera attacking larger prey than themselves to establish a pattern of injuries and compare it to the injuries observed on tapirs. Our study shows that tapir sightings near human settlements are related to health deterioration, injuries by jaguars and seasonality. The injuries found on tapirs are similar to those caused by other big cats on large prey, providing strong support for jaguar-inflicted wounds. Further studies should investigate whether the increasing human presence in different habitats in the Neotropical region could be influencing the behaviour and distribution of prey and predators.

AB  - The spotted hyena is positioned at the top of food chains and has the ability to influence the diversity of herbivores. Knowledge of this predator through research can assist in effective management decisions which will ensure ecosystem integrity. A study on population estimation and livestock loss by the spotted hyenas was conducted from January 2019 to December 2020 in the Damota community managed forests. Data was collected through distance sampling techniques, and the economic impacts of spotted hyena predation on livestock were quantified using a questionnaire survey with randomly selected households. Twenty-five transects were monitored over a period of two consecutive years. A mean of 113 +/- 0.51 individuals of spotted hyena was observed per 100 km(2). The density of spotted hyena was 1.34 +/- 0.42 and 0.69 +/- 0.12 individuals/km(2) and 0.55 +/- 0.97 and 0.75 +/- 0.14 individuals/km(2) in farm and forest during 2019 and 2020, respectively. The mean sex ratio of the adult male to adult female was 0.56:1.00 and 0.74:1.00 during the dry and wet seasons, respectively. Moreover, the mean sex ratio of adult to cub was 1:0.25 and 1:0.29 during the dry and wet seasons, respectively. Respondents indicated a total loss of 377 livestock due to the depredation of spotted hyenas over the past five years. The total estimated economic loss caused by depredation, theft, and diseases was US$ 47,885. On average, US$ 9577 per year (US$ 26 per day) has been lost over the past five years. The average annual depredation per household was 0.98 head of livestock worth US$ 95.6. Among depredated livestock, 64.8% of sheep were lost by spotted hyena, followed by donkey (16.4%). Therefore, livestock management practices, assessment of spotted hyena population, and economic loss are very important for carnivore conservation and scaling up human livelihood development.

AB  - 1. Landscape-scale factors known to influence in-field abundance of pest herbivores and their natural enemies, but little is known about effects that operate through the shorter-range influences exerted by habitats immediately adjacent to crop fields.2. This study first compared the abundance of brassica insect pests and their natural enemy arthropods in 24 spatially independent brassica vegetable fields across southern Australia. An "edge effect' index was used to compare the abundance of each taxon in the field center with abundance in areas of the crop adjacent to differing habitats. Then, three landscape properties: landscape composition, edge density, and connectivity of diverse crop and non-crop habitats were analyzed at five scales up to 5 km from these focal field centers to assess longer-range influences on arthropod abundances in field centers and on the edge effects.3. Edge effect of adjacent woody vegetation promoted ladybirds and reduced diamondback moth and whiteflies. Conversely, the presence of crops and pastures immediately adjacent to focal crop fields reduced whiteflies and aphids but with no effect on natural enemies.4. Effect of landscape composition and connectivity on arthropod abundance at field center found promotion of aphids (cabbage aphid and green peach aphid) by woodland in the landscape. 5. Effect of landscape properties on the edge effects of adjacent habitats was contrasting; strengthened (landscape composition and edge density on edge effect of crops, pasture and woody vegetation in reducing diamondback moth and whiteflies) as well as weakened (edge density and landscape connectivity on edge effect of crops, pasture and woody vegetation in reducing diamondback moth on diamondback moth, whiteflies and aphids, and promoting ladybirds).6. Synthesis and applications: Findings of this geographically extensive study help define the level of pest risk associated with sites as well as suggest potential interventions such as establishment or restorations of woody vegetation adjacent to crop fields that could reduce risk.

AB  - The germination index (GI) was widely applied to evaluate the phytotoxicity of compost. This study investigated the key phytotoxicity factors affecting seed germination in compost by using aqueous extracts in seed germination tests. The relationship between water-soluble substances in compost and seed germination, and their association with the microbial community were identified. In this study, sheep manure (SM) composted along or with three carbon additives (mushroom substrate, MS; cornstalks, CS; garden substrate, GS) for 49 days and, during this time, changes in multiple physical-chemical parameters, carbon and nitrogen matters, germination indexes (GI) and the compost microbiome were monitored. The results showed that all additives decreased water-soluble total nitrogen (TN), ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N) and low molecular weight organic acids, and significantly improved the seed germination indexes (seed germination rate, radical length and GI). The GI was correlated with water-soluble carbon degradation products (TOC, butyric acid, humic acid) and certain bacteria (Planifilum, Oceanobacillus, Ruminococcaceae_UCG_005 and Saccharomonospora). A structural equation model revealed that the main factors affecting seed germination were TOC (SM compost), acetic acid (SM+MS compost), humic acid (SM+CS compost), and pH (SM+GS compost). Low TOC and low molecular weight organic acids contents and higher humic acid content promoted GI. The research results could provide theoretical basis and measures for directional regulation of compost maturity.

AB  - Artificial light at night (ALAN) is a recognised disruptor of biological function and ecological communities. Despite increasing research effort, we know little regarding the effect of ALAN on woody plants, including trees, or its indirect effects on their colonising invertebrates. These effects have the potential to disrupt woodland food webs by decreasing the productivity of invertebrates and their secretions, including honeydew and lerps, with cascading effects on other fauna. Here, we cultivated juvenile river red gums (Eucalyptus camaldulensis) for 40 weeks under experimentally manipulated light (ALAN) or naturally dark (control) conditions. To assess direct impacts on tree growth, we took multiple measures of growth at four time periods, and also measured physiological function, biomass and investment in semi-mature trees. To assess experimentally the direct and indirect (tree-mediated) impacts of ALAN on invertebrates, from 19 weeks onwards, we matched and mismatched trees with their original ALAN environments. We colonised trees with a common herbivore of E. camaldulensis, the red gum lerp psyllid (Glycaspis nr. brimblecombei) and then measured the effects of current and historic tree lighting treatment on the psyllid life cycle. Our data revealed direct effects of ALAN on tree morphology: E. camaldulensis trees exposed to ALAN shifted biomass allocation away from roots and into leaves and increased specific leaf area. However, while the intensity of ALAN was sufficient to promote photosynthesis (net carbon gain) at night, this did not translate into variation in tree water status or photosystem adaptation to dim night-time light for ALAN-exposed trees. We found some evidence that ALAN had broad-scale community effects-psyllid nymphs colonising ALAN trees produced more lerps-but we found no other direct or indirect impacts of ALAN on the psyllid life cycle. Our results suggest that trees exposed to ALAN may share morphological responses with trees under dim daylight conditions. Further, ALAN may have significant 'bottom-up' effects on Eucalyptus woodland food webs through both trees and herbivores, which may impact higher trophic levels including woodland birds, mammals and invertebrates.

AB  - Global change is reshaping climatic conditions at a tempo that exceeds natural migration rates for most tree species. As climate change amplifies the disparity between species' adaptive capacity and local climates, tree populations risk becoming geographically stranded in increasingly unsuitable conditions. This mismatch may cause catastrophic losses of key forest ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration, habitat provisioning, and forest products. In response, forest managers and researchers are developing a suite of climate-adaptive strategies designed to sustain forest diversity and function. Among these, forest assisted migration (FAM) involves the movement of planting stock from source populations to locations either within or beyond their current ranges. The goal is to establish forests that can survive in today's climate and expected to thrive in future conditions, thereby sustaining ecosystem good and services. Because FAM is still in its infancy, implementation is limited by many uncertainties. Climatically derived seed sourcing is needed to ensure that planting stock possesses the ecophysiological amplitude to withstand both current and future climatic conditions at the destination site. Additionally, more knowledge about the impacts of local herbivores and intraspecific competition are needed because these drivers will co-regulate seedling success along with climate. Practically, these uncertainties must be addressed to instill in managers sufficient confidence that FAM investments will fulfill long-term management and societal goals relative to other silvicultural approaches. The Desired REgeneration through Assisted Migration (DREAM) framework is an international collaboration that uses basic and applied research to reduce these uncertainties and derive climate-informed planting approaches. DREAM is self-reinforcing in that each step in the process informs and strengthens subsequent phases. Namely, it sources seed in a climatically informed manner, experimentally tests this sourced stock to probe for physiological maladaptation under controlled settings, grows the stock in the field under a range of silvicultural scenarios, and finally forecasts long-term outcomes using models parameterized from the controlled- and fieldtests. In this paper, we describe the DREAM framework and illustrate aspects of its implementation drawing from two experimental sites: one in Que & PRIME;bec, Canada and one in Wisconsin, USA. Moreover, we place the DREAM study into the broader FAM context by briefly contrasting it with other operational examples throughout North America. Knowledge gained from this research-management collaboration will expand current reforestation paradigms to include future climate-adaptive ones that aim to use the right seed, planted in the right places, under the right conditions.

AB  - The native savanna ecosystem of the Orinoquia region is the habitat of 50% of the wild ungulate species reported for Colombia. Over the last 20 years, this high species diversity has been strongly threatened by the human transformation of the natural land cover causing connectivity loss of the habitats. The Orinoquia region lacks a biological connectivity analysis with a multi-species approach involving species groups that are representative of the savanna ecosystem such as the ungulates. Understanding the spatial distributions of suitable areas and the main habitats that act as primary habitats for ungulate species in these landscapes is fundamental for the design of conservation strategies. We use an occurrence dataset for lowland tapir (Tapirus terrestris), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), and white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari) in the development of species' potential distribution models, binarization process, and morphological spatial pattern analysis. This information was used for the modeling of dispersal corridors connecting the core habitats of the ungulate focal species using the randomized shortest path algorithm and quantifying the weighted global connectivity metrics. Our results suggest an integral corridor with potential least-cost dispersal routes between the native savanna landscape on the middle basins of the savanna rivers and the Meta River. These areas associated with the fluvial dendritic systems are connected, while the core habitats in the eastern part of the savanna landscape are disconnected. We discuss how the application of such knowledge on the spatial ecology of ungulate focal species might improve the management of the metapopulations in the Orinoquia region.

AB  - Increasing soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) storage can help mitigate climate change and sustain soil fertility. Changes in herbivore and anthropogenic nutrient enrichment intensities can lead to dramatic shifts in the plant and microbial communities, soil organic carbon (SOC) and nutrient dynamics. However, the legacy effects of grazing and N enrichment on the biogeochemical processes remain unclear. Here, we conducted a 6-year rotational grazing (Stocking rates: 0, 8 and 16 sheep ha-1) and 4-year N-addition (N addition levels: 0, 50, 100 and 200 kg N ha-1 yr-1) experiment to investigate how soil C, N and phosphorus (P) components respond to the legacy effects of grazing and N fertilization after a 3-year cessation of grazing and N addition treatments in an alpine meadow on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). We show that previous grazing significantly increased soil total nitrogen (STN), slightly increased SOC and decreased soil total phosphorus (STP); while previous N fertilization significantly decreased SOC, but it did not significantly alter STN and STP. Previous grazing at low stocking rates (<= 8 sheep ha-1) might amplify the negative legacy effects of N fertilization on SOC, while a higher stocking rate would weaken the negative impacts of previous N fertilization on SOC. The interactive and synergistic impacts of historical grazing and N fertilization induced a significantly negative effect on STP. Previous N fertilization decreased soil microbial carbon (MBC) and increased soil available N:P, resulting in the reduction of SOC. The increase in plant diversity caused by previous grazing increased SOC, which counteracted the negative effects of increasing bacterial diversity. Previous grazing-induced decreasing bacterial community heterogeneity may lead to increased STN. Although previous grazing-induced increases in soil moisture and soil nutrient availability may have positive effects on STP, previous grazing-induced negative effects on STP may exceed those positive effects. Therefore, the legacy effects of grazing could be beneficial for improving soil C and N, but may increase the risk of soil P loss in the short term, while residual exogenous N could pose a detrimental effect on C storage over time. Reintroducing grazing and/or P addition may be an appropriate choice to offset the adverse consequence of N deposition in the context of global change. Our findings suggest that the stocking rate at about 8 sheep ha-1 could be a suitable grassland management technique for soil fertility sequestration and mitigating the negative influences of residual exogenous N in the QTP.

AB  - Predicting the level of damage by deer browsing in young plantations is important for considering damage control measures. In this study, we examined a method for assessing the level of deer damage in young Sugi (Cryptomeria japonica) plantations with deer-proof fences by observing field signs of deer. First, a questionnaire survey was conducted to obtain information about the damage by deer browsing on planted trees and the extent of field signs, such as browsing marks and deer fecal pellets around the young plantations. The extent of field signs was recorded as qualitative data (i.e. "None", "A few", and "Many"). A multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) revealed a relationship between the extent of deer damage in young plantations and the presence of five field signs (browsing marks, bark stripping marks, fecal pellets, trails and tracks) around the young plantations. Based on coordinate values of each field sign obtained using the MCA, the extent of each field sign was scored, and the total value was calculated as the deer impact score (DISco). When the relationship between the DISco and the extent of deer damage to planted trees was subjected to a logistic regression analysis (LRA), the DISco was found to be a significant explanatory variable and the LRA was an effective model (AUC of 0.7809 and 0.7048, respectively) for predicting the probability of stand damage and High stand damage. Therefore, the DISco was shown to be an effective tool for assessing the damage risk of deer in young Sugi plantations with deer-proof fences.

AB  - 1. Charophytes are a key group of submerged macrophytes in temperate hardwater lakes, but have declined or been replaced by angiosperms as a result of eutrophication for more than 100 years. At present, this process is continuing in many European lakes despite an overall reduced nutrient loading. In eutrophic lakes, light attenuation by periphyton is a major factor responsible for declining angiosperm abundance. For charophyte declines, the impact of benthivorous and herbivorous fish has been discussed often, yet periphyton shading has been largely neglected.
   2. In our study, we investigated 11 temperate oligo-mesotrophic (total phosphorus [P] concentrations 9-22 mu g/L) hardwater lakes along a gradient of charophyte abundances. Charophyte abundance was mapped using underwater cameras or scuba diving, and coverage was estimated in five classes. Periphyton biomass, nutrient stoichiometry and invertebrate grazer abundance were measured twice on artificial substrates exposed inside and outside fish exclosures for 4 weeks in July and August. Fish biomass was sampled once using multi-mesh gill netting.
   3. We analysed the relationships between water chemistry (concentrations of nutrients and dissolved organic carbon), periphyton biomass and nutrient stoichiometry, periphytic invertebrate grazers and fish biomass to test (a) whether periphyton biomass was controlled bottom-up by nutrient availability or top-down by an omnivorous fish-invertebrate-grazer cascade and (b) whether charophyte abundance was affected by periphyton biomass, benthivorous and herbivorous fish.
   4. Multiple linear regressions revealed that charophyte abundance was significantly predicted by the biomasses of periphyton and benthivorous bream (Abramis brama L.), whereas herbivorous rudd (Scardinius erythrophthalmus L.) had no significant effect in the investigated lakes. Bream biomass and its proportion in the total fish biomass were linearly related to lake total P concentrations.
   5. Periphyton biomass in the tested lakes reached 0.1-21 g dry weight/m(2) and primarily was controlled bottom-up by P availability as indicated from stoichiometry and positive correlations with grazer abundance. Top-down control was found in only three lakes, which had significantly lower periphyton biomass inside fish exclosures as compared to controls.
   6. Our data imply that periphyton shading and negative fish impacts on charophytes increase with P loading. Low charophyte abundances at moderate P concentrations in the lake water indicate a high sensitivity of charophytes and/or unnoticed nutrient loading due to nutrient retention by charophyte stands. Management measures thus must focus on reducing nutrient loading and/or benthivorous fish biomass at early stages of impact to preserve charophyte stands in oligo-mesotrophic hardwater lakes.

AB  - Knowledge of the trophic web structure and control mechanisms in reservoirs of the semiarid tropical regions can enable a better understanding and proper management of these aquatic environments. This paper used an ecosystem approach to two Brazilian semiarid reservoirs and evaluated the interactions between cage fish farms and fishing activity. The trophic web models of the reservoirs were elaborated using Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) software. Over two years, the data were locally obtained, including information on fish farm, fishing activity, and functional groups (phytoplankton, aquatic macrophytes, benthic fauna, and fish). The modeling results indicated that most of the system energy is derived from the detritivory chain, which was more critical than the herbivory chain, with a Detritivory/Herbivory ratio of approximately 3.0 in both reservoirs. The key group of the ecosystem was the piscivorous fish, with Hoplias malabaricus and Cichla monoculus as the species with the greatest trophic impact, especially on fish at the intermediate trophic level. The benthic community and detritus had positive impacts on almost all other components of the trophic web. The reservoirs were considered immature, with low nutrient cycling and a high Total Primary Production/Total Respiration ratio. Systemic stability was deemed low for both reservoirs, which was indicated by the low overhead values. In both reservoirs, the presence of a well-developed detritus chain supports the trophic web and represents a source of stored energy in aquatic systems. The simulations demonstrated a positive relationship between fish farming and fishing activity, with all communities benefiting from the nutrient input from cage fish farms, with a biomass increase of aquatic or-ganisms, either by direct or indirect effects.

AB  - Marine Isotope Stage 3 (MIS 3, at 60-25 ka B.P.) was a short interstadial within the Last Glacial period. A generally warm and wet climatic condition during the MIS 3 period has been suggested by many previous studies. Quantitative climatic reconstruction and studies of seasonality, however, have been seldom attempted given the scarcity of useful proxy indicators. A full understanding the climatic characteristics during this period is hampered by their absence. This is especially the case in the East Asian monsoon region in North China, which is very sensitive to climatic change. To help fill this knowledge gap, we have determined the stable carbon (delta C-13) and oxygen isotope (delta O-13) compositions of tooth enamel from fossil mammals (Bubalus sp [buffalo] and Cervus elaphus [red deer], dated at similar to 33-31 ka B.P.) recovered from Longquan Cave in North China. We use these data to constrain ecology, local air temperature and precipitation amounts during the late MIS 3. The average delta C-13 (VPDB) of tooth enamel (-14.4 parts per thousand and -8.8 parts per thousand, respectively for buffalo and red deer) indicate that C3 plants comprised the main diet of animals living in this area. Pollen assemblages demonstrated that vegetation mainly consisted of grasses and herbs (similar to 64%) with trees only accounting for about 26%. These results indicate a landscape of open steppe with sparsely distributed trees. The reconstructed climate derived from tooth enamel delta O-13 was relatively colder and drier than present-day condition, with mean annual air temperature ranging from 4 to 13 degrees C and mean annual precipitation ranging from 360 to 670 mm. Moreover, the inferred summer and winter half-year temperatures were respectively 8-24 degrees C and -2 to 5 degrees C, which represents either similar or weaker seasonality than at the present time. The inferred cold and dry climate suggested by our study contrasts with the warm and wet conditions previously reconstructed using proxy indicators from bulk soil samples in North China. In comparison to the long-term, time-averaged climatic condition reflected by those soil proxies, the stable isotope compositions of fossil more likely recorded climatic conditions at annual or seasonal time-scale. The inferred annual cold/dry climate at Luanchuan Cave suggested by our data may indicate a short climatic cooling event from Greenland Interstadial (GIS) 5 to its following stadial. Mean annual temperature fluctuated by similar to 8 degrees C during this interstadial-stadial cycle. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Carrion is a dynamic and nutrient-rich resource that attracts numerous insect species that undergo succession due to the rapid change in the carrion resource. Despite this process being well-understood, few studies have examined resource change as a driver of carrion insect succession, and instead have focused on the effects of time per se, or on coarse, qualitative measures such as decay stage. Here we report on three field succession experiments using pig carcasses and human cadavers encompassing two winters and one summer. We quantified the effects of resource change (measured as total body score, TBS), carrion type, initial carrion mass, ambient temperature, and season on insect species richness and community composition. We found that all variables had an effect on different taxonomic or trophic components of the insect community composition, with the exception of initial carrion mass which had no effect. We found significant positive effects of TBS on beetle species richness and composition, while fly species richness was not significantly affected by TBS, but was by ambient temperature. TBS had a significant positive effect on all trophic groups, while ambient temperature also had a significant positive effect on the necrophages and predator/parasitoids. Our study indicates that resource change, as indicated by TBS, is an important driver of carrion insect species turnover and succession on carrion, and that TBS can provide information about insect ecological patterns on carrion that other temporal measures of change cannot.

AB  - Ponds and wetlands around the world face anthropogenic pressures that threaten key ecosystem processes such as nutrient and organic matter cycling. Wetlands in arid and semi-arid regions are particularly at risk from uncertainty of water availability and competing pressures for use. Such threats are most acute for non-perennial systems that rely on occasional surface water flows to maintain important ecological functions. This study investigates the decomposition of an endemic macrophyte Cycnogeton procerum (R.Br.) Buchenau as a key ecosystem process in a chain-of-ponds wetland system, located in the intermittently flowing Mulwaree River, New South Wales, Australia. The aims of this study were to identify spatial and temporal patterns and the relative importance of microbial activity in macrophyte decomposition to improve our understanding of ecological processes in these intermittent systems. Exponential decomposition rates (proportional mass loss (g)) were highest during spring and summer (0.07-0.10 kd(-1)) and slower during autumn and winter (0.03-0.04 kd(-1)), reflecting seasonal drivers. Decomposition was significantly different in 9 mm and 150 mu m mesh bags only during spring, suggesting decomposition was mostly performed by microbes, with invertebrate herbivores possibly only a factor during spring lotic conditions. Mesotrophic conditions, regulated by flow and internal macrophyte and algal dynamics appear to maintain a highly productive, macrophyte-dominated aquatic wetland system. Temperature was a major factor in decomposition rates and expected increases due to climate change will accentuate pressure on the resilience of the macrophyte community. Alterations caused by changing climate and anthropogenic land use place the ponds at high risk.

AB  - Mounting evidence suggests that reciprocal interactions between plants and the soil microbiota can be a primary force that generates key macroscopic patterns of plant communities (coexistence, dominance, and succession) in forest ecosystems. The aim of this article is to review empirical and theoretical perspectives of plant-soil feedback research in the context of forest community ecology. I first use a simple theoretical model to get insights into an array of the dynamics generated by plant-soil feedback: negative plant-soil feedback maintains plant species diversity and reduces plant growth, while positive plant-soil feedback drives plant growth of certain species and hence their dominance. I then describe how ecologists have unveiled the enormously complex plant-microbiota interaction (i.e., the soil conditioning experiment) and review the linkage of plant-soil feedback with three key plant community patterns: (i) dominance, (ii) spatial structure and (iii) succession. I highlight one belowground plant trait (mycorrhizal type) that can mediate these linkages: arbuscular mycorrhizal species tend to exhibit negative plant-soil feedback while ectomycorrhizal species tend to exhibit positive plant-soil feedback. Although mycorrhizal plant-soil feedback potentially explains the patterns of tree diversity from local to global scales, many questions remain. Future studies should expand plant-soil feedback theory to incorporate numerous other feedback mechanisms and test how mycorrhizal types mediate the net feedback effects that could propagate to shape large-scale forest structures and dynamics.

AB  - Perennial plants create productive and biodiverse hotspots, known as fertile islands, beneath their canopies. These hotspots largely determine the structure and functioning of drylands worldwide. Despite their ubiquity, the factors controlling fertile islands under conditions of contrasting grazing by livestock, the most prevalent land use in drylands, remain virtually unknown. Here we evaluated the relative importance of grazing pressure and herbivore type, climate and plant functional traits on 24 soil physical and chemical attributes that represent proxies of key ecosystem services related to decomposition, soil fertility, and soil and water conservation. To do this, we conducted a standardized global survey of 288 plots at 88 sites in 25 countries worldwide. We show that aridity and plant traits are the major factors associated with the magnitude of plant effects on fertile islands in grazed drylands worldwide. Grazing pressure had little influence on the capacity of plants to support fertile islands. Taller and wider shrubs and grasses supported stronger island effects. Stable and functional soils tended to be linked to species-rich sites with taller plants. Together, our findings dispel the notion that grazing pressure or herbivore type are linked to the formation or intensification of fertile islands in drylands. Rather, our study suggests that changes in aridity, and processes that alter island identity and therefore plant traits, will have marked effects on how perennial plants support and maintain the functioning of drylands in a more arid and grazed world.
   In global drylands, soils tend to be more fertile beneath tree, shrub and grass islands. Soil fertility was greater beneath taller and wider plants but was unaffected by either grazing pressure or the type of herbivore.

AB  - In the light of future ocean warming scenarios and habitat fragmentation, coastal fishes must adjust their physiological and behavioral traits to face the combined effect of global warming and ecological interactions. Seahorses (Hippocampus spp.) are charismatic fishes with peculiar life cycle traits, which make them vulnerable to several anthropic pressures and natural disturbances. In this study, we investigated the behavior of two sympatric seahorse species, the long-snouted Hippocampus guttulatus (Cuvier, 1829) and the short-snouted Hippocampus hippocampus (Linnaeus, 1758). Specifically, we carried out two manipulative experiments to assess (i) the effect of temperature and habitat availability on both H. hippocampus and H. guttulatus behavior and (ii) the effect of temperature and an increased density of H. guttulatus (by 3x) on the activity level of congeneric species H. hippocampus. Our results showed that +3 & DEG;C warming did not affect seahorse behavior in both experiments, suggesting greater behavioral tolerance to thermal variation. However, a significant reduction of the active behavior of H. hippocampus was observed when the artificial habitat was introduced in the tank, while H. guttulatus maintained its activity. Furthermore, a significant decrease of the H. hippocampus activity was observed with an increased relative dominance of H. guttulatus. Our results suggest that both increased density of H. guttulatus and habitat availability, but not ocean warming, will affect the behavior of H. hippocampus. Therefore, different interspecific behavioral strategies may occur, thus affecting the distribution of the two species among shallow habitats when they occur in sympatry.

AB  - Coral reef fishes are usually assumed to be most strongly associated with reef-building corals. However, sponges can be a significant structural component of coral reef ecosystems and their framework can enhance the local abundance and biodiversity of fish assemblages. Little is known regarding the range of fish species using complex sponges as either shelter or feeding substrata. Here we use a combination of stationary video cameras and focal animal sampling to document fish species positively associated with complex sponges in Kimbe Bay, Papua New Guinea. Stationary cameras identified 45 fish species using the sponges for either shelter, feeding substrata or as sites for ambush predation. A guild of 10 individual fish species from five families (Blenniidae, Chaetodontidae, Gobiidae, Labridae and Pomacentridae) were observed to quantify sponge and other habitat use and compared with habitat availability to determine the level of sponge selectivity. One species, Pleurosicya elongata (the Slender Spongegoby), lived in obligate association with Ianthella basta (Elephant Ear sponge), and there was a positive relationship between sponge size and number of resident fish, however this was not significant for all life stages. Five other fish species appeared to preferentially select sponges as habitat (Amblyglyphidodon aureus, Chaetodon kleinii, Coradion chrysozonus, Escenius prooculis and Pomacentrus nigromanus), while for others, sponge use appeared incidental. When selectivity indices were calculated for specific sponge species it was apparent that some fishes exhibited preferences for particular sponge species or growth forms. These results suggest more fish species may be reliant on sponges than is widely appreciated.

AB  - The Burmese python (Python bivittatus) is native to Southeast Asia and has an established invasive population throughout South Florida. As part of the effort to understand invasive python biology and potential impacts to the native ecosystem, we have been using radio-telemetry to investigate feeding rates of adult female pythons. The body size and gape of adult Burmese pythons enable them to consume large native prey items including, but not limited to, white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). As an ectothermic species, Burmese pythons' physiological processes, including digestion, are temperature dependent, which may limit their potential invasive range. The low temperature threshold for python digestion is thought to be 20 degrees C within a laboratory setting. Here, we detail an observation of a radio-telemetered female Burmese python that ingested an adult white-tailed deer, retained the deer within the digestive tract for 10 days, and then vomited the deer coinciding with a drop in air temperature as low as 9.4 degrees C. The python survived the vomiting and was alive at the time of publication. To our knowledge, this is the first observation of a free-ranging Burmese python vomiting a deer within the invasive range without direct disturbance from humans at the time of vomiting. This observation provides additional evidence regarding the limits of thermal tolerance, digestion, and feeding habits of invasive Burmese pythons.

AB  - Algal turfs trap and retain particulates, however, little is known about the relationship between particulate accumulation and taxonomic composition of algal turfs. We investigated how particulate mass related to algal turf structure (length and density) and community composition (taxonomic and functional) on two disparate reefs. Particulate mass was positively related to algal turf length. By contrast, the relationship between particulate mass and turf density was more complex and followed a negative parabolic shape; density increased with particulate mass before stabilising and then declining. Community analyses showed taxonomic, but not functional group compositions differed significantly between reefs and with increasing particulate mass. Our results suggest high loads of particulates accumulated in algal turfs are related to a longer, lower density turf structure, typified by filamentous forms such as Cladophora. Changes in algal turf structure and composition could have a variety of bottom-up influences on coral reef ecosystems.

AB  - Predators may alter niche overlap between prey species by eliciting divergent anti-predator behavior. Accordingly, we exploited heterogeneous gray wolf Canis lupus presence in Washington, USA, to contrast patterns of resource and dietary overlap between mule Odocoileus hemionus and white-tailed deer O. virginianus at sites with and without resident packs. Mule deer run (stot) in a way that is less effective as a means of fleeing from predators than the galloping gait of white-tailed deer. Consequently, mule deer manage risk from coursing predators like wolves by avoiding encounters, whereas white-tailed deer respond to such predators by exploiting areas where they are most likely to escape pursuit. Thus, under the 'refuge partitioning hypothesis' whereby predators reduce prey niche overlap by eliciting use of different refugia, we predicted wolf exposure to 1) decrease resource and dietary overlap between these ungulates, and 2) induce segregation consistent with each species using different parts of the landscape to reduce their wolf risk. At the home range scale, the ways in which resource overlap diminished in the wolf areas were consistent with the prey species reducing their respective risks, particularly with respect to slope, with mule deer separating from white-tailed deer by seeking steeper areas where wolf encounters are less likely. At the within-home range scale, the manner in which spatial overlap decreased in relation to forest cover was consistent with species-specific risk management, with mule deer avoiding wolf encounters by shifting toward this resource. Reduced resource overlap between the deer in areas occupied by wolves did not correspond with dietary divergence. Our findings suggest that wolf risk mediates spatial but not necessarily dietary overlap between sympatric ungulates, divergent anti-predator behavior is a non-consumptive pathway by which predators can reduce interspecific competition among prey, and use of disparate refugia by prey may not result in dietary divergence.

AB  - Urban trees provide numerous ecosystem services including the mitigation of urban heat. However, this cooling effect is often restricted due to poor tree growth and health caused by harsh growing conditions. The aim of this study is to analyse the influence of surface paving on the physiology, growth and cooling benefits of street trees of three common species with contrasting drought tolerance (Aesculus hippocastanum, Tilia x europaea and Quercus palustris) in Gothenburg, Sweden. Tree structural parameters, leaf water potentials, gas exchange, leaf area density and chlorophyll content were measured in three summertime periods in 2017 and 2018. Moreover, based on the measured data, the cooling effects of studied trees due to shading and transpiration were modelled. For all species, trees at highly paved sites were found to have significantly reduced growth, physiological performance and cooling effects compared to sites with a higher degree of permeable surfaces. This negative effect of surface paving was stronger than the effect of species, despite differences in drought tolerance and water use strategy between studied species. Based on the sensitivity of species to surface paving, we recommend Q. palustris and T. europaea for sites with good growing conditions due to their potential to maintain high water use and growth rates, and A. hippocastanum for highly paved sites where shading is not the primary ecosystem service sought. Our findings emphasise the importance of tree planting design in supporting urban tree growth and the continuous provision of ecosystem services, particularly in the context of the changing climate.

AB  - Terrestrial mammals are found nearly everywhere on Earth. Yet, most taxa are endemic to a single continent; geological, evolutionary, ecological, or physiological filters constrain geographic distributions. Here, we synthesize data on geography, taxonomy, lineage age, dispersal, body size, and diet for > 4000 terrestrial mammals prior to detectable human-mediated biodiversity losses and quantify factors correlated with the likelihood of dispersal between continents. We confirm the uniqueness of being on multiple continents: excluding humans and commensals, only 260 mammals are found on two continents, while six span three or more continents (the red deer, red fox, brown bear, least weasel, and common bent-wing bat), and just a single species - the lion - once had a geographic range that included four continents. Clearly the challenges of colonizing and persisting on multiple continents are severe. No single characteristic enables taxa to be on more than one continent. Rather, a suite of prerequisite conditions under some circumstances lead to distributions spanning multiple continents. The suite of factors facilitating the occupation of two continents, like being volant, are distinct from those that lead to the occupation of three or more, which are primarily faunivores. Other than humans and our commensals, very few species have become truly cosmopolitan over evolutionary time and geographic space.

AB  - BackgroundWith the widespread promotion of selective fishing which may target top predatory fishes, the abundance and species composition of top predators could change, which may further impact species at lower trophic levels through a chain of cascading trophic interactions. However, the top-down effects of changes in predator communities driven by selective fishing remain poorly investigated.MethodsFocusing on a seagrass ecosystem, we investigated how changes in two coexisting top predators (Lateolabrax japonicus and Acanthogobius ommaturus) under different selective fishing scenarios would affect species at lower trophic levels in a field manipulative experiment.ResultsWe found that the trophic niches of A. ommaturus and L. japonicus overlapped greatly, although not completely. If loss of L. japonicus led to increases in A. ommaturus, the abundances of herbivorous benthos Barleeia bureri increased likely owing to A. ommaturus's suppression of low-level predators, while epiphyte and seagrass biomass decreased significantly likely owing to A. ommaturus's disturbance of seagrasses and sediments. If both predators were depleted, the biomasses of herbivorous benthos Cyclina sinensis and B. bureri increased significantly likely owing to the absence of top predators' disturbance of sediments, while epiphyte and seagrass biomass did not change.ConclusionsOur study showed that loss of one top predator could lead to rapid changes in species at lower trophic levels in seagrass beds, depending on changes in, and the trophic or non-trophic effects (including biological disturbances) of, its competitors. Therefore, in fisheries resource management, the ecological impacts of selectively fishing a target predator must be managed considering changes in, and the trophic or non-trophic effects of, its competitors where present.

TI  - The effects of fire and stocking density on the unpalatable species Elytropappus rhinocerotis in Renosterveld vegetation in South Africa
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - Namaqualand Granite Renosterveld is a fire-prone shrubland in South Africa and is dominated by Elytropappus rhinocerotis, an indigenous unpalatable shrub with encroaching properties. Using vegetation surveys, the study aimed to understand the effects of fire and grazing on the cover, density and plant species associations with E. rhinocerotis. Plant cover was unaffected by fire and grazing. Fire widened the range of densities of E. rhinocerotis, but grazing alone had no impact and thus cannot significantly promote E. rhinocerotis dominance. Stand density did not influence the species composition, which indicates that E. rhinocerotis neither competitively exclude nor actively facilitate other species.

AB  - In forests affected by heavy fires and continuous grazing of exotic herbivorous mammal species, Nothofagus pumilio (lenga) cannot recover naturally. The main factors that hinder the natural recovery of these forests and the feasibility of native tree plantations are the exotic herbivorous pressure, like that produced by Lepus europaeus (European hare), and the environment degradation degree by anthropic disturbances. The objective of this study was to evaluate different plantation efforts to recover N. pumilio forests degraded by fires in Chilean Patagonia. The plantation actions also included wire fences for sapling protection in 100 ha, where 60 ha were established during autumn (May 2012), and 40 ha were established during spring (October 2012). In March 2013 we recorded the height annual growth (cm year(-1)), the section browsed at each sapling, the modification of plant form (number of new branches), and the vigor expression. We evaluated the data using one- and two-way ANOVAs, Cohen's d effect size, and chi-square analyses. We measured a total of 872 plants, where 42% presented damages caused by European hare browsing. These results indicated that the wire fences were not completely useful to stop the damage on saplings (Cohen's d effect size = < 0.2). We also found that autumn plantations were more susceptible to damage than those established during spring. European hares predominantly browsed on a particular sapling section: the apical buds. As a consequence, the browsed saplings had lower height growth than undamaged ones. These outputs highlight the need to explore and implement alternative actions for the rehabilitation of these degraded deciduous forests, to achieve the objectives of sustainable management or to recover the natural ecosystem functions.

AB  - 1.The replacement of native habitats by monocultures has led to the loss of insect biodiversity, including beetles.
   2.In an attempt to minimize this loss, Brazilian legislation requires farmers to conserve a proportion of farmland as a Legal Reserve.
   3.In this study, we investigated the decay of similarity in beetle communities of soybean monocultures compared to Legal Reserves.
   4.To do this, we studied 77 sample points distributed across the transition zone between the Amazon and Cerrado biomes, with a maximum distance of 625 km between the farthest points.
   5.Our results show that the transformation of forest areas into monocultures causes a drastic decrease in beta diversity for both herbivores and predators.
   6.This pattern is not observed in Legal Reserves, where the communities are, for the most part, different in a short geographic space.
   7.We noted an increase in beta diversity between sites at a shorter distance (200 km) compared with soybean monoculture areas (350 km).
   8.In these environments, many species are generalist pests that benefit from the simplified landscape.
   9.To verify the relationship between species dissimilarity and geographic distances, we used the Chord-Normalized Expected Species Shared dissimilarity index, replacing Bray-Curtis due to its robustness in dealing with small samples or subsampling.
   10.We reinforce the importance of Legal Reserves in conserving beetle biodiversity, emphasizing the need for preserved areas distributed throughout the landscape as they play a crucial role in maintaining beta diversity and preserving ecosystem services in anthropized landscapes.

AB  - Himalayan serow (Capricornis sumatraensis thar), a subspecies of the mainland serow is classified as vulnerable according to IUCN. Although the knowledge of their diet selection is essential for understanding this species' ecology and consequent conservation, little is known about the diet selection of Himalayan serow due to its elusive and secretive habits. We investigated the winter diet selection of Himalayan serow at food category level in the temperate forests of Bani Wildlife Sanctuary, the north-western Himalayas, during two winter seasons (November-February) of 2020 and 2021. A total of 1310 plant fragments belonging to six food categories were recorded by micro-histological analysis of faecal samples (n = 30). The majority of the diet comprised deciduous broad-leaved species (33.78%), followed by evergreen broad-leaved species (32.14.), graminoids (12.23%), evergreen conifers (6.05%), and forbs (2.97%). Diet selection value showed that Himalayan serow highly selected deciduous broad-leaved and evergreen broad-leaved species, whereas, graminoids were not preferred. Our findings unambiguously indicate that Himalayan serow is a browser during winter, selecting more digestible food plants within their habitats. Additionally, the availability of these preferred broad-leaved species may be important for the winter survival of Himalayan serow. We recommend that the winter habitat with a significant amount of forage must be well managed to supply the dietary requirements of serow.

AB  - Due to agriculture and logging, Costa Rica has lost many primary forests, making reforestation an important task. To judge the progress of reforestation, it is important to follow the reassembly of organismal communities within restored habitats. The COBIGA project near La Gamba, in the Golfo Dulce region of Costa Rica, aims at reforestation of lowland sites with native tree species. Ants, as ubiquitous and highly abundant terrestrial organisms, have a substantial influence on tropical ecosystems. The multiple roles include scavenging, predation, herbivory, and mutualistic interactions. We examined ant community responses to reveal the status of community regeneration and functional integrity. We compared the composition and diversity of the ant assemblages at three different age reforestation sites (2, 8, and 10 years old) with those at an old-growth forest as a reference site. By offering canned tuna fish at ground level along replicated transects, we observed 43 ant species representing six functional groups during the 2 months of sampling. Most of the observed ant species were omnivorous, but old-growth forests harbored a substantial number of other functional groups, such as generalized predators, arboreal predators, and arboreal omnivores. In contrast, the youngest reforestation site harbored a severely impoverished ant assemblage comprising mostly generalized polygynous and polydomous ant species from lower trophic levels. The within-site heterogeneity of the ant assemblages increased from the youngest to the oldest forest. In addition, our results show the importance of monitoring the progress of forest recovery to avoid the spread of invasive species into primary habitats.

AB  - Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii) is a highly invasive shrub that spreads rapidly, has many detrimental effects on native species and ecosystems, and is difficult to control. Clipping by itself is usually ineffective unless it is repeated over several years, so herbicides are commonly used, either alone or combined with clipping. Over the past decade, outbreaks of honeysuckle leaf blight have appeared. Previous work shows that long shoots are more susceptible to blight than reproductive short shoots. Clipping induces many long shoot resprouts that are expected to be infected by blight. In this study, I clipped honeysuckle shrubs in forest understory (forested) and open sites in northern and central Kentucky and followed their response through the growing season. Northern Kentucky sites were studied in 2022 and 2023; central Kentucky sites were studied in 2022 only. The total number of shoots, total shoot length, and number of leaves were higher at open sites and declined across the growing season. The fraction of blighted leaves reached maximum levels of 10-30%, higher than levels seen on shoots from intact shrubs. After 1 yr, 62% of all forested shrubs survived clipping, whereas 75% of all open shrubs survived. Survival rates for clipped forested stands were similar to those seen before blight outbreaks occurred, but they declined from the preblight 90% level seen in open stands, so leaf blight mortality effects appear to be largest in open stands. Although this study was not designed to quantify the effect of deer browsing on resprouting shrub mortality, browsing was extensive, with a maximum of 60-80% of all shoots browsed. The current effects of blight combined with a single clipping do not appear to be sufficient to manage honeysuckle; clipping repeated over several years and combined with blight needs to be investigated.

AB  - Unravelling the factors that influence plant -insect interactions remains a fundamental concern in terrestrial ecology. In the present study, we evaluated the impact of varying degrees of drying on cerrado areas adjacent to veredas on the species richness, abundance and composition of the insect herbivore fauna. Additionally, we examined differences in these impacts between various guilds (chewing and sucker insects) and developmental stages (adult and immature insects). The research has been performed in study areas located in three Protected Areas in Brazil. In total, we recorded 106 species of herbivorous insects across five orders (Coleoptera, Hemiptera, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, and Orthoptera). Hemiptera and Coleoptera stood out as the orders with the highest species diversity and individual numbers. Among the families, Cicadellidae and Curculionidae exhibited the highest richness in species and abundance of individuals. We found that richness of herbivorous insects was higher in wet zones (20.2 +/- 6.5) of the veredas compared to dry zones (12.3 +/- 7.5), as well as the abundance of herbivorous insects was higher in wet zones (49.4 +/- 25.5) than in the dry zones (15.8 +/- 7.9). Whithin insect guilds, the abundance of chewing insects was higher in wet zones (34.0 +/- 13.6) than in dry zones (16.3 +/- 14.8), but this difference was not observed for the diversity of sucking insects. Regarding developmental stage, immature insects exhibited higher species richness in wet zones (10.4 +/- 5.0) compared to dry zones (5.3 +/- 2.1), while adult insect diversity did not show differences between the studied zones. Furthermore, the species composition of herbivorous insects, various trophic guilds (chewers and suckers) and developmental stages (adults and immature insect) did not significantly differ among the zones studied within the veredas. According to our findings, herbivorous insects exhibit a preference for wet environments, which provide better conditions and higher -quality food resources for development and reproduction.

AB  - North Africa's megafauna has developed behavioural adaptations to reduce energetic and fitness costs under harsh arid land conditions. Animal behaviour and activity patterns are difficult to study in the wild, but remote camera traps provide a solution to collecting data without the presence of a researcher influencing outcomes. Here, we report results from a study comprising over 20,382 camera-trap days during a 34-month period in Dghoumes National Park, Tunisia. We aimed to evaluate temporal activity patterns and their overlap and explore opportunities for niche partitioning. Our focal species were the reintroduced scimitar-horned oryx, north-African ostrich, dorcas gazelles and extant regional top-order predators, African wolf and red fox. We found differences in activity patterns between seasons across the focal species, with the most noticeable change being an increase in dawn activity from 1% to 33% between winter and summer for the red fox. Consequently, higher summer temperatures limit opportunities for temporal niche partitioning and push focal species towards dawn-time activity peaks resulting in higher intra-guild overlap values at dawn. Arid antelopes have physiological adaptations that enable them to better exploit ecological resources in hotter time periods than the carnivores, and this reduces inter-guild overlap during summer days.

AB  - Riverine macrophytes are increasingly understood to influence both the physical and chemical dynamics of rivers by creating biogeochemical hotspots and stabilizing benthic sediments. They contribute carbon and nutrients to both aquatic and adjacent terrestrial ecosystems through senescence and herbivory. Here, we report the relationships between Justicia americana biomass, stem length, and stem density, and % carbon (%C), % nitrogen (%N), C:N, delta N-15, and delta C-13 relationships between tissues types (roots, stems, and leaves). Additionally, we report the effects of land use on the plant's tissue. We found that (1) J. americana stem density and dry biomass were positively correlated (P < 0.001); (2) delta C-13 and %N were significantly different in leaf and root tissue; (3) delta C-13 and delta N-15 were both positively correlated across tissue types; (4) Leaf C:N was less than <1/2> of root and stem tissue; (5) %C in leaf tissue was positively correlated (P < 0.05) with forest cover and negatively correlated with urbanization and watershed area; and (6) provide evidence that J. americana utilizes a C3 photosynthetic pathway. Overall, this study provides novel insight into the ecology of J. americana by elucidating the nutritional quality of different plant tissues and stoichiometric changes in the plant in response to land use.

AB  - The application of biocides may create unintended consequences on soil biota and ecosystem stability. The inputs of organic matter can increase biocides adsorption and reduction of non-target organisms influence. A field experiment was conducted to study the changes of soil abiotic and nematode communities resulting from biocides application in non-litter-added and litter-added soils in Illicium verum forest. Our results showed that litter addition could change the responses of soil nematodes to biocides. The influence of fungicide was evident mainly in litter-added plots in which it increased nematode abundance. Insecticide and its interaction with fungicide significantly decreased the diversity index and the abundance of omnivores-predators and herbivores in non-litter-added plots. While, insecticide had little effect on nematode diversity and abundance in litter-added plots. Litter addition may help to maintain the structure and stability of soil food web and result in bacteria dominant decomposition pathway. Our results suggest that litter addition may be a critical factor for maintaining soil ecosystem stability when biocides are applied in Illicium verum forest.

AB  - While ecosystems worldwide are confronted with myriad of biological invasions, our understanding of their consolidated impacts and control remains restricted to a few species only. Any such assessment and management based on single invasions can be biased, leading to unintentional spread of new invasive species and resulting in pessimism around invasive species management. Tropical countries like India, with limited resources for invasion management and a plethora of invasive species, are amongst the most vulnerable to impacts of multiple invasions.
   We investigated the impacts of single and co-occurring invasive plants (Lantana camara and Pogostemon benghalensis) on native plants, soil nutrients, and herbivory in Kanha Tiger Reserve - a seasonally dry tropical forest of Central India. We systematically sampled 120 plots of 10 m X 10 m area and recorded plant richness, abundance, regeneration, edaphic characteristics, and mammalian herbivory. Ordination and linear models were used to understand the effects of single and co-occurring invasions.
   Results indicate a compositional change in the native plant assemblage, reduced richness and abundance of native plants, increased potassium content in the soil, and increased herbivory on native plants. These effects were more pronounced with co-occurring invasive plants, and larger than other key ecological determinants, indicating towards a homogenised alternate state of an ecosystem.
   Synthesis. Additive impacts of multiple invasions were greater than their individual impacts on native vegetation structure, composition, soil nutrients, and herbivory. We infer potential negative feedback, where plant invasions force higher herbivory on already declining native plants thereby exhausting the sustenance of native plants. It can cause a future decline of herbivores, which are an important food resource for charismatic carnivores in these ecosystems. Mitigating the impacts of multiple invasions is thus urgently required.

AB  - Large herbivores can disperse seeds over long distances through endozoochory. The Korean water deer (Hydropotes inermis argyropus), an internationally vulnerable species but locally considered a vermin, is a potential endozoochorous seed dispersal vector. In this study, feeding experiments were conducted to test the efficiency of seed dispersal through gut ingestion by the Korean water deer, its temporal pattern and the effect of gut passage on seed recovery and germination rate. Eight plant species, including species that formerly germinated from its faeces, were used to feed three Korean water deer. Once the deer had consumed all the provided seeds, their faeces were collected after 24, 48, 72 and 96 h. The collected faeces were air-dried, and the number of seeds retrieved from the faeces was counted every 24 h (0-24, 24-48, 48-72 and 72-96 h). Among the eight plant species, six species were retrieved with intact seeds. Panicum bisulcatum had the highest recovery rate of 33.7%, followed by Amaranthus mangostanus (24.5%) and Chenopodium album (14.4%). Most of the seeds were recovered within the 24-48 h time interval. Germination tests were conducted on the ingested and uningested seeds for the four species which had a sufficient recovery rate. The effects of gut passage on seed germination differed according to plant species. The germination rate substantially decreased after gut passage. The results suggest that the Korean water deer can disperse seeds, potentially over long distances albeit at a high cost of low seed recovery and germination rate.

AB  - The Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau is a vast geographic area currently subject to climate warming. Improved knowledge of the CO2 respiration dynamics of the Plateau alpine meadows and of the impact of grazing on CO2 fluxes is highly desirable. Such information will assist land use planning. We measured soil and vegetation CO2 efflux of alpine meadows using a closed chamber technique over diurnal cycles in winter, spring and summer. The annual, combined soil and plant respiration on ungrazed plots was 28.0 t CO2 ha(-1) a(-1), of which 3.7 t ha(-1) a(-1)occurred in winter, when plant respiration was undetectable. This suggests winter respiration was driven mainly by microbial oxidation of soil organic matter. The winter respiration observed in this study was sufficient to offset the growing season CO2 sink reported for similar alpine meadows in other studies. Grazing increased herbage respiration in summer, presumably through stimulation of gross photosynthesis. From limited herbage production data, we estimate the sustainable yield of these meadows for grazing purposes to be about 500 kg herbage dry matter ha(-1) a(-1). Addition of photosynthesis data and understanding of factors affecting soil carbon sequestration to more precisely determine the CO2 balance of these grasslands is recommended.

AB  - Manure-inhabiting Mesostigmata mites are important biological control agents of pest flies. However, the biodiversity of this mite community is mainly known from Europe and America, and especially from cattle manure. This study examined the diversity and abundance of Mesostigmata mites associated with various types of manure in an (intensive) agricultural region of the Middle East, i.e., the city Ahvaz and its suburbs, in southwest Iran. Mite samples were extracted from manure of cattle, buffalo, sheep, horse, poultry and quail in 30 livestock and poultry farms. In total, 40 species belonging to 24 genera and 16 families were identified. The most diverse families were Laelapidae with eight species, Macrochelidae with seven and Parasitidae with six. Macrocheles muscaedomesticae and Uroobovella marginata were the most widespread species, recorded in 28 and 27 out of 30 collection sites, respectively. Two species, M. sumbaensis and U. marginata, were found in all studied manures. Simpson's diversity index recorded the highest diversity in buffalo and sheep manure. Real and theoretical species richness (rarefaction curves) were congruent in number of individuals. The presence of seven species of Macrochelidae in the manure confirms that these are important predators of the house fly for the region of Ahvaz and its suburbs. Members of the Parasitidae were highly prevalent, with one species known as a specialized predator of house fly eggs. This work aims to encourage further studies on the diversity of Mesostigmata in these agricultural settings, and further continue assessing the feasibility of these mites as effective biocontrol agents of filth flies in different types of manure and from different corners of the world.

AB  - 1. The abundance of insect galls may be influenced by the local host abundance as well as by the structure of the surrounding plant community, while insect galls may reduce host fitness. So far, few studies have been done in order to understand the relationship between galling insect abundance and the surrounding non-host plant community.
   2. In the present study, we explored the relationship between galling insect abundance and plant community structure and diversity. We tested the bottom-up forces of host and non-host plant density and non-host diversity on gall abundance. We also tested the top-down force of gall abundance on host fitness.
   3. We sampled all trees, measured their basal area, and estimated gall abundance in 25 plots (1 ha in total) located in a Brazilian savanna. In addition, we recorded the presence of flowers and fruits in all trees studied.
   4. We found a positive relationship between host basal area per plot and gall abundance and a negative relationship between non-host basal area and species diversity with gall abundance. We also observed a negative association between gall abundance and the probability of the host plant to have flowers or fruits.
   5. Our data provide evidence that plant communities in which one host species dominates can be more susceptible to herbivore pressures than communities with less host dominance and more non-host neighbours, and that the non-host species create disruptive cues limiting galling insect infestation.

AB  - Flowering time is an important phenological trait in plants and a critical determinant of the success of pollination and fruit or seed development, with immense significance for agriculture as it directly affects crop yield and overall food production. Shifts in the growth season, changes in the growth season duration and changes in the production rate are environmental processes (potentially linked to climate change) that can lead to changes in flowering time in the long-term due to selection. In contrast, biomass loss (due to, for example, herbivory or diseases) can have profound consequences for plant mass production and food security. We model the effects of these environmental processes on the flowering time evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) of annual plants and the potential consequences for reproductive output. Our model recapitulates previous theoretical results linked to climate change and light competition and makes novel predictions about the effects of biomass loss on the evolution of flowering time. Our analysis elucidates how both the magnitude and direction of the evolutionary response can depend on whether biomass loss occurs during the earlier vegetative phase or during the later reproductive phase and on whether or not plants are adapted to grow in dense, competitive environments. Specifically, light competition generates an asymetric effect of mass loss on flowering time even when loss is indiscriminate (equal rates), with vegetative mass loss having a stronger effect on flowering time (resulting in greater ESS change) and final reproductive output.
   Flowering time is an important phenological trait in plants. We explore the effects of growth season changes and biomass loss on the evolution of flowering time in annual plants and the potential consequences for biomass production.image

AB  - Understanding the impacts of environmental factors on spatial-temporal and large-scale rodent distribution is important for rodent damage prevention. Investigating rat hole density (RHD) is one of the most effective methods to obtain the intensity of rodent damage. However, most of the previous field surveys or UAV-based remote sensing methods can only evaluate small-scale RHD and its influencing factors. However, these studies did not consider large-scale temporal and spatial heterogeneity. Therefore, we collected small-scale and in situ measurement records of RHD on the northern slope of the Tien Shan Mountains in Xinjiang (NTXJ), China, from 1982 to 2015, and then used correlation analysis and Bayesian network (BN) to analyze the environmental impacts on large-scale RHD with satellite remote sensing data such as the GIMMS NDVI product. The results show that the built BN can better quantify causality in the environmental mechanism modeling of RHD. The NDVI and LAI data from satellite remote sensing are important to the spatial-temporal RHD distribution and the mapping in the future. In regions with an elevation higher than 600 m (UPR) and lower than 600 m (LWR) of NTXJ, there are significant differences in the driving mechanism patterns of RHD, which are dependent on the elevation variation. In LWR, vegetation conditions have a weaker impact on RHD than UPR. It is possibly due to the Artemisia eaten by the dominant species Lagurus luteus (LL) in UPR being more sensitive to precipitation and temperature if compared with the Haloxylon ammodendron eaten by the Rhombomys opimus (RO) in LWR. In LWR, grazing intensity is more strongly and positively correlated to RHD than UPR, possibly due to both winter grazing and RO dependency on vegetation distribution; moreover, in UPR, sheep do not feed Artemisia as the main food, and the total vegetation is sufficient for sheep and LL to coexist. Under the different conditions of water availability of LWR and UPR, grazing may affect the ratio of aboveground and underground biomass by photosynthate allocation, thereby affecting the distribution of RHD. In extremely dry years, the RHD of LWR and UPR may have an indirect interactive relation due to changes in grazing systems.

AB  - Recent excavations at Ranis (Germany) identified an early dispersal of Homo sapiens into the higher latitudes of Europe by 45,000 years ago. Here we integrate results from zooarchaeology, palaeoproteomics, sediment DNA and stable isotopes to characterize the ecology, subsistence and diet of these early H. sapiens. We assessed all bone remains (n = 1,754) from the 2016-2022 excavations through morphology (n = 1,218) or palaeoproteomics (zooarchaeology by mass spectrometry (n = 536) and species by proteome investigation (n = 212)). Dominant taxa include reindeer, cave bear, woolly rhinoceros and horse, indicating cold climatic conditions. Numerous carnivore modifications, alongside sparse cut-marked and burnt bones, illustrate a predominant use of the site by hibernating cave bears and denning hyaenas, coupled with a fluctuating human presence. Faunal diversity and high carnivore input were further supported by ancient mammalian DNA recovered from 26 sediment samples. Bulk collagen carbon and nitrogen stable isotope data from 52 animal and 10 human remains confirm a cold steppe/tundra setting and indicate a homogenous human diet based on large terrestrial mammals. This lower-density archaeological signature matches other Lincombian-Ranisian-Jerzmanowician sites and is best explained by expedient visits of short duration by small, mobile groups of pioneer H. sapiens.

AB  - New mammal species have always been a source of major zoological intrigue, and whilst discoveries of large mammals are becoming less frequent, species like the saola and dingiso continue to enter the zoological literature. Modern communities are often assumed to be complete and are used for constructing community-level models. One example is ecometric modelling. Here, we estimate the number of large herbivorous mammals not yet described based on description curves. We also investigate the effect of species description on the stability and accuracy of previously established relationships between traits and climate. The contemporary description record of large herbivorous mammals is incomplete, with at least 83 species undescribed. Primates, artiodactyls and marsupials are estimated to contain the greatest undescribed diversity, with particular gaps in the Neotropic, Afrotropic and Indomalayan realms. We find that beyond similar to 40% completeness, there is a limited impact on trait-environment relationships of increased species description, but that there is a high mismatch between true and predicted climatic values for published models. Consequently, mammalian species that have not yet been discovered are unlikely to have a large impact on the accuracy of trait-environment models, but we suggest possible alterations to previous approaches that might improve the accuracy of future models.

AB  - Grazing is the dominant land use across the world, and large mammalian herbivores exert strong influence over biogeochemical cycles. Grazing ecosystems feature C-rich soils, even though herbivores consume a major fraction of plant production to reduce detrital input to soil. Yet, counter-intuitively, moderate grazing can promote net soil-C storage in many ecosystems compared to grazer-exclusion. We address this enigmatic influence of grazers on soil-C and test their indirect effect on proximate drivers of decomposition: microbial extracellular enzyme activity. We used a replicated long-term grazer-exclusion experiment to measure responses in above- and belowground plant biomass, soil-C stock, microbial biomass, labile/recalcitrant C pools and three enzymes relevant to the C-cycle: peroxidase-which initiates decomposition of recalcitrant matter, alongside beta-glucosidase and cellobiohydrolase-which act further downstream on more labile fractions. Consistent with other ecosystems, upto 12 years of herbivore exclusion did not increase soil-C in the fenced plots despite higher plant biomass and higher potential detrital C-inputs. Grazer-exclusion did not alter microbial biomass; peroxidase increased threefold and beta-glucosidase was doubled; cellobiohydrolase was unaffected. Grazer-exclusion also led to twofold increase in recalcitrant-C and in microbial respiration, but it did not influence labile-C. Structural equation models supported the hypothesis that grazing favours soil-C via its indirect effect on peroxidase, but they did not support that the effects can run in the opposite direction where soil-C affects enzymes. Grazer-mediated shifts in how microbes deploy enzymes emerge as a plausible mechanism that affects soil-C. These linkages may be important to maintain soil-C sequestration in drylands which support large mammalian herbivores.

AB  - Most habitat suitability models and resource selection functions (RSFs) use indirect variables and habitat surrogates. However, it is known that in order to adequately reflect the habitat requirements of a species, it is necessary to use proximal resource variables. Direct predictors should be used to construct a real RSF that reflects the real influence of main resources on species habitat use. In this work, we model the spatial distribution of the main food resources of brown bear Ursus arctos L. within the natural and human-modified landscapes of the Central Forest State Nature Reserve (CFNR) for further RSF construction. Food-probability models were built for Apiaceae spp. (Angelica sylvestris L., Aegopodium podagraria L., Chaerophyllum aromaticum L.), Populus tremula L., Vaccinium myrtillus L., V. microcarpum (Turcz. ex Rupr.) Schmalh., V. oxycoccos L., Corylus avellana L., Sorbus aucuparia L., Malus domestica Borkh., anthills, xylobiont insects, social wasps and Alces alces L. using the MaxEnt algorithm. For model evaluation, we used spatial block cross-validation and held apart fully independent data. The true skill statistic (TSS) estimates ranged from 0.34 to 0.95. Distribution of Apiaceae forbs was associated with areas having rich phytomass and moist conditions on southeastern slopes. Populus tremula preferred areas with phytomass abundance on elevated sites. Vaccinium myrtillus was confined to wet boreal spruce forests. V. microcarpum and V. oxycoccos were associated with raised bogs in depressions of the terrain. Corylus avellana and Sorbus aucuparia preferred mixed forests on elevated sites. Distribution of Malus domestica was associated with meadows with dry soils in places of abandoned cultural landscapes. Anthills were common on the dry soils of meadows, and the periphery of forest areas with high illumination and low percent cover of tree canopy. Moose preferred riverine flood meadows rich in herbaceous vegetation and sparse mixed forests in spring and early summer. The territory of the human-modified CFNR buffer zone was shown to contain a higher variety of food resources than the strictly protected CFNR core area.

AB  - In 2015, the communities of reef-associated motile macrocrustaceans (decapods and stomatopods) were compared between two coral reefs with contrasting levels of degradation in Puerto Morelos (Mexican Caribbean), "Limones", less degraded, with a healthy live coral cover, and "Bonanza", more degraded, with less live coral and more macroalgae. Since then, several stressors have impacted Puerto Morelos. Massive influxes of floating Sargassum, which reached record levels in 2018, 2021, and 2022, have exacerbated the already high eutrophication of the reef lagoon. An outbreak and rapid propagation of the Stony Coral Tissue Loss Disease in 2018 changed the functionality of reefs. Three back-to-back hurricanes struck the coast close to Puerto Morelos in October 2020 and another one in August 2021. We repeated the study in 2022 to examine the potential changes in the habitat and communities of reef-associated crustaceans since 2015. Reef degradation did not increase significantly between 2015 and 2022, but crustacean species richness, diversity, evenness, and dominance, which differed between reefs in 2015, became similar between reefs in 2022, as did the crustacean community composition. The abundance of herbivore crabs increased in Limones, displacing the coral- and hydrocoral-mutualistic crabs and the abundance of detritivore hermit crabs increased in Bonanza. These results suggest a taxonomic homogenization between reefs, apparently related to subtle ecological changes not necessarily captured by standard metrics of reef condition.

AB  - The Sambar is one of the largest deer species distributed mainly in Asia, and it has been listed as a vulnerable species. Taxonomy based on morphological characterization has been the gold standard method used to identify the Sambar deer species. Yet, morphological identification is challenging and requires expertise. To conduct species identification and taxonomic decisions, we performed the molecular identification of R. unicolor found in Sri Lanka using DNA barcodes, COI, and Cyt b to compare the Sri Lankan R. unicolor with the Indian R. unicolor and other R. unicolor subspecies. We obtained mitochondrial DNA sequences from COI and Cyt b from blood samples collected from the wet zone in Sri Lanka. A phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the Bayesian analyses using MrBayes 3.2.7. Molecular dating was implemented in Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis Sampling Trees (BEAST v1.8.2) on the concatenated sequence using a log-normal relaxed clock and Yule species tree prior, with four categories. The results showed that the Sri Lankan R. unicolor is genetically different from the Indian R. unicolor and other R. unicolor subspecies. The divergence occurred approximately 1.1 MYA (million years ago) in the Pleistocene era. The results are essential for designing new conservation platforms for these Sambar deer species.

AB  - The Moose Horn Pass Caribou Fence site (KjRx-1) consists of three wooden fences located in a remote area of the Mackenzie Mountains in Canada's Northwest Territories. Situated in the traditional homeland of the Shuhtagot'ine (Mountain Dene), they were used to assist past hunters to harvest northern mountain caribou by channeling multiple animals toward kill zones. The main fence is nearly 800 m in length and terminates in a corral structure after descending from high ground into a valley. The two smaller fences are located north and south of the main fence, and they do not descend into the valley. Standard dendrochronological methods were employed to determine the ages of wood taken from the fence structures. Seventy-five living white spruce (Picea glauca) trees in the area were cored to determine the overall tree-ring growth patterns in the local environment. The chronology of living trees was supplemented by the inclusion of 29 standing-dead trees to establish a longer chronology of dated ring widths. Sixty-two of 89 cross-sections cut from the fence timbers were crossdated and added to the overall chronology, which created a well-replicated chronology of ring-widths from 972 to 2016 C.E. The terminal dates of material from the three fence systems suggest that the complex was built from trees that died over a wide temporal period, spanning the years 1314 to 1876 C.E, with clusters of dates between ca. 1420-1480 and 1580-1750 C.E. The millennial-long chronology developed in this study can now be used as a base to assist in dendroarchaeological dating of many more artifacts from the region.

AB  - Exotic plants are preferred in plantation forestry due to its fast growth rate and low maintenance. These plantations affect the natural vegetation and thus the fauna dependent on it. In our study, we assessed the impact of exotic plantations on savanna birds of Pune Metropolitan City (PMC). The original vegetation of the hilly region is a savanna type; through plantation forestry, exotic plants were planted in the savanna vegetation present over the hillocks in the PMC. We studied bird assemblages and vegetation in both savanna vegetation and exotic plantations. Bird sampling was done in late monsoon, winter and summer season. We found 41.67 +/- 10.49 (Mean +/- SD) bird species in savanna patches and 15.8 +/- 6.75 bird species in the exotic plantations. The vegetational study showed that exotic plantations have the lower richness and high dominance of woody plant species compared to savanna patches. We noted an increased percentage of omnivore birds, lower percentage of predator and herbivore birds in the exotic plantations as compared to savanna patches. Our results demonstrate that exotic plantations have changed native plant community structure which was present before plantation, and has become a poorer habitat for bird species. We recommend that exotic plants should not be preferred for plantation forestry. Currently, savannas are under threat of non-scientific plantation forestry, therefore awareness among citizens, policymakers, forest officials are necessary for its conservation.

AB  - Precise abundance estimates of large mammals are important for effective conservation, harvest, and conflict management. Determining abundance of wide-ranging, herding ungulate species has presented a unique challenge to wildlife managers because of factors such as dense forest, elusive behavior, and heterogeneity in density across the landscape. Roosevelt elk (Cervus canadensis roosevelti) populations in Northern California, USA, are no exception to these challenges, and as the elk population has grown, so has human-wildlife conflict, necessitating the need for efficient and repeatable methods to determine population abundance for management decisions. We explored non-invasive genetic sampling combined with spatial capture-recapture (SCR) as an alternative for monitoring populations that are difficult to observe directly. We combined an SCR model with a binomial point process and an unstructured single survey search method to estimate elk abundance in Northern California via Bayesian inference. We searched open grassy hillsides for female-calf groups and used a detection dog team to search forested areas to increase the number of detections of males and other solitary individuals. For the SCR analysis, we used sex and survey effort as detection covariates, and used a trap-level random effect to account for overdispersion in the count data from the herding behavior of elk. Our population estimate (N +/- SD) for the study area was 618 +/- 36.34 individuals (95% Bayesian credible interval = 551-693) with a mean density of 1.09 +/- 0.06 elk/km(2). Our work demonstrates a potential method to estimate population size of ungulates in an area that is not conducive to traditional monitoring methods.

AB  - Global climate change poses a severe threat to mountain biodiversity. Phenotypic plasticity and local adaptation are two common strategies for alpine plant to cope with such change. They may facilitate organismal adaptation to contrasting environments, depending on the influences of the environment or genotype or their interacted effects. In this study, we use an endemic alpine plant (Rorippa elata) in the Hengduan mountains (HDM) to unravel its phenotypic basis of adaptation strategy and evaluate the relative contributions of environment and genotype to its phenotype. We transplanted 37 genotypes of R. elata into two common gardens across low and high elevations (2800 vs. 3800 m) during 2021-2022. Nine fitness-related traits were measured, including flowering probability and glucosinolates (GS) content. We estimated the environmental or genotypic contributions to the phenotype and identified the main environmental components. Our results revealed that both environment and genotype-by-environment interactions contributed to the phenotypes of R. elata. Latitudinal heterogeneity was identified as a key factor that explained 24% of the total phenotypic variation. In particular, genotypes of the northern HDM showed significantly higher plasticity in flowering probability than those of the southern HDM. Furthermore, within the southern HDM, GS content indicated local adaptation to herbivory stresses for R. elata genotypes along elevations. In conclusion, our results suggest that R. elata may have adapted to the alpine environment through species-level plasticity or regional-level local adaptation. These processes were shaped by either complex topography or interactions between genotype and mountain environments. Our study provides empirical evidence on the adaptation of alpine plants.

AB  - Available studies on the vegetation development in Patagonia cluster along the forest-steppe ecotone, whilst little information is available from within the mountains. This study investigates shifts in the eastern boundary of rainforest taxa during the Late Glacial and Holocene periods. Continuous sections of highly organic sediments with several interbedded tephra layers were obtained at El Laguito del Morro Lake (41 degrees 32' 24.4" S, 71 degrees 47' 50.0" W), which were analyzed for pollen and macro charcoal. Additional macrofossil analysis was conducted to support the interpretations of pollen data and gain reliable ma-terial for radiocarbon dating. Fluctuations in regional precipitation were inferred from changes in the adjacent peatbog. The pollen record documents five distinct periods of forest diversity and structure. Late Glacial and early Holocene vegetation were characterized by a combination of Podocarpus and Cupres-saceae pollen which has no modern analogue. Taxa in question became rare, and or gradually dis-appeared around 10,300 cal yr BP when Nothofagus dombeyi type pollen increases but fluctuates. With the overall decline of charcoal concentrations around 7500 cal. BP Nothofagus dombeyi-type pollen stabilizes and dominates the diagram. After the rise in charcoal concentrations around 4000 cal yr BP also the overall vegetation composition changes around 3600 cal yr BP, with the rise of Cupressaceae pollen attributed to Austrocedrus chilensis marking the establishment of the modern vegetation structure. The last stronger change in vegetation composition is characterized by the expansion of the shrub Discaria sp. 770 cal yr BP. Charcoal and pollen data show a clear link between changes in fire regime and vegetation composition, however, changes in climate were most likely the main driver for both. During the Late Glacial period, a rainforest developed under cool temperatures and high moisture. Severity of fires decreased during a cold reversal period from ca. 12,800 to 11,300 cal yr BP. During Early Holocene, increased seasonality, volcanism-derived disturbances, and low-frequency surficial fires, enhanced Nothofagus dombeyi forest establishment. The expansion of the mixed Nothofagus dombeyi- Austrocedrus chilensis forest occurred under increased precipitation variability and the increase of low severity fires related to the establishment of El Ni ($$) over tilde no Southern Oscillation and the Southern Annular Mode during the Late Holocene. Scrub expansion occurred during historical times because of induced fires. (c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The ATP-binding cassette subfamily G member 2 (ABCG2) serves crucial roles in secreting riboflavin and biotin vitamins into the milk of cattle, mice, and humans, as well as in the transportation of xenotoxic and cytostatic drugs across the plasma membrane. However, the specific role of the ABCG2 gene in water buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis), especially its effect on milk fat synthesis in buffalo mammary epithelial cells (BuMECs), remains inadequately understood. In this study, the full-length CDS of the buffalo ABCG2 gene was isolated and identified from the mammary gland in buffaloes. A bioinformatics analysis showed a high degree of similarity in the transcriptional region, motifs, and conservative domains of the buffalo ABCG2 with those observed in other Bovidae species. The functional role of buffalo ABCG2 was associated with the transportation of solutes across lipid bilayers within cell membranes. Among the 11 buffalo tissues detected, the expression levels of ABCG2 were the highest in the liver and brain, followed by the mammary gland, adipose tissue, heart, and kidney. Notably, its expression in the mammary gland was significantly higher during peak lactation than during non-lactation. The ABCG2 gene was identified with five SNPs in river buffaloes, while it was monomorphic in swamp buffaloes. Functional experiments revealed that ABCG2 increased the triglyceride (TAG) content by affecting the expression of liposynthesis-related genes in BuMECs. The results of this study underscore the pivotal role of the ABCG2 gene in influencing the milk fat synthesis in BuMECs.

AB  - Northern Asia (here, the Russian Federation east of the Urals) played a key role in the spread of anatomically modern humans (AMH) across the Eurasian continent during the Upper Palaeolithic (UP). This time interval witnessed the climatically harshest and most variable part of the last glacial epoch when AMH spread to all continents, with the exception of ice-covered Antarctica, thus raising questions about how humans and environments interacted. Our review of available proxy records shows that the study region was largely dominated by productive steppe and tundra plant communities, which promoted a diverse small- to mega-scale fauna throughout the UP. While this rich fauna was an ideal food resource for AMH populations, its possible influence on the growth of woody plants through grazing is less well resolved. Another non-climatic factor that may have impacted on the spread of woody taxa are human activities (e.g. setting fires to facilitate hunting). Evidence that small populations of woody taxa were distributed in climatically favourable habitats comes from plant macroremains from sediment sequences and archaeological sites and from aDNA data. Contrary to the long-standing view of a generally colder-than-present last glacial climate, these proxy records reveal evidence that summers were warmer than today by several degrees Celsius, providing additional advantages for human activities. Another benefit for large herbivores, and thus human subsistence, were the generally low winter precipitation levels (similar to those of the modern steppe regions of Mongolia), which sustained year-round grazing grounds. These factors apparently outweighed the harsh colder-than-present winter conditions and promoted habitation of AMH in Northern Asia even during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) ca. 30-18 cal kyr BP. While our understanding of qualitative climate trends, mainly based on fossil pollen records, has substantially improved, quantification of climate parameters is still a challenging task. For the last glacial interval in Northern Asia, plant macroremains, chironomids, diatoms and ostracods may provide suitable alternative proxies.

AB  - In Central Africa's tropical forests, duikers (Cephalophus spp.) are essential seed dispersers and prey for apex predators and humans. However, little is known about their spatial ecology, with no studies available for medium-sized species south of the Congo River. Here, we study forest duiker spatial use in the buffer zone of Salonga National Park, Democratic Republic of the Congo. We assess capture success of (1) collective day capture with nets and (2) collective night capture with head-torches and use GPS/VHF collars to investigate species-specific home-range (a) size, (b) use and (c) overlap. Across 7 months, 47 capture attempts allowed collaring 13 Weyns's (C. weynsi), two bay (C. dorsalis), and one black-fronted (C. nigrifrons) duiker, with similar success between techniques. Weyns's duikers mean home range size was 29.38 ha, with stable core areas and dynamic boundaries. While one breeding pair showed 72.80% overlap and a mean interindividual distance of 288 m, overlap in non-breeding pairs ranged between 4.5% and 52.2%, with an average interindividual distance of 533 m. Our assessment of the spatial use of Weyns's duikers suggests that anthropogenic disturbances might affect spatial behaviour and reproductive success. Further research on the spatial ecology of forest ungulates is key to improving conservation strategies.

AB  - Hydropower has long been an effective form of renewable energy, but the development of the resource has negatively impacted fishes throughout the world. Formulating recovery plans to mitigate these effects requires a firm understanding of species-specific provenance, life history and life stage habitat requirements. However, the importance of this information is often only recognised after a substantial population decline, when obtaining it becomes demographically challenging. We provide a case study for this scenario and present a post hoc approach to gain insight into these critical data gaps for Burbot Lota lota in the upper Kootenai River in Montana and British Columbia. The population once supported a robust tribal and recreational harvest but declined following impoundment and these fisheries have remained closed or curtailed for nearly 20 years. The reasons for the decline are unknown and actions to assist recovery have been constrained by limited information regarding natal origin, life history and habitat use. We addressed this issue using strontium isotope ratios (Sr-87/Sr-86) in otoliths collected over four decades in Lake Koocanusa, the reservoir on the Kootenai River above Libby Dam. Due to the geologic heterogeneity of the basin and resulting variation in water Sr-87/Sr-86, the assignment probability for Burbot to their region of natal origin approached unity. Otolith Sr-87/Sr-86 also indicated the population was comprised of mainstem- and tributary-origin forms and their relative abundance changed over time. Mainstem Burbot was most abundant during the 1970s and 2000s, whereas tributary forms dominated between these periods. We suggest ecosystem changes following impoundment contributed to this shift in life history forms and the overall decline of the population. Our findings underscore the need for additional investigations of these impacts to guide restoration efforts.

AB  - The Northeast Pacific continental margin is characterized by strong seasonal upwelling, which drives high pri-mary productivity, and supports high diversity and biomass of benthic megafauna. The recent occurrence of a marine heat wave ("The Blob", sensu Kintisch, 2015) in 2013-2016 resulted in changes to phytoplankton community composition and loss of coastal kelp abundance and diversity, reducing gross primary productivity in the region. However, cumulative effects of marine heat waves and ongoing basin-scale deoxygenation in deep-sea ecosystems remain poorly understood. Here, we use a 7-year time series of physicochemical and video im-agery data from Ocean Networks Canada's NEPTUNE observatory to investigate temporal dynamics of the deep-sea pink urchin Strongylocentrotus fragilis in relation to multi-year environmental variability. Using generalized additive models, we show that local S. fragilis density at Barkley Upper Slope (420 m) fluctuated over time and was partially explained by changes in dissolved oxygen concentration and suspended particulate matter in the benthic boundary layer (ADCP backscatter), with high urchin density corresponding to high oxygen and low backscatter. Seafloor dissolved oxygen ranged from 0.80 to 1.89 mL/L and varied seasonally, exhibiting a clear negative correlation with sea surface primary productivity (MODIS satellite Chl-a data), corresponding with the onset of yearly upwelling conditions. However, during the anomalously warm years affected by 'The Blob', dampened upwelling maintained higher dissolved oxygen conditions near the seafloor. S. fragilis density declined during 'Blob' conditions, likely in response to reduced kelp and phytodetritus subsidies from coastal waters. We propose a foraging-respiration trade-off hypothesis, whereby S. fragilis forages in deeper water during weak upwelling and migrates to shallower habitats during low oxygen conditions. S. fragilis is an important bioturbator and detritivore; changes in the density and distribution of this species may directly affect sediment turnover rates and nutrient cycling on the continental margin, with consequences for surface and coastal productivity. https://github.com/rjcommand/.

AB  - Consistent intraspecific variation in behavior directly impacts reactions to environmental challenges, including life in human-altered landscapes. Yet, it is rarely considered in free-ranging species thriving in anthropogenic landscapes and causing human-wildlife conflict. Here, we examine the consistent inter-individual variability in wild boar movement traits and highlight its potential for ecology and practical management. We used satellite telemetry data from 95 GPS-tracked wild boars monitored in Czechia and computed weekly movement rate (activity), intensity of space use (exploration), and diurnality (boldness). Using a variance partitioning approach, we tested whether these traits were repeatable over time and therefore considered personality traits, and using Bayesian multivariate mixed-effect models, we examined the correlations among these traits to describe a behavioral syndrome while controlling for external and internal sources of variation. Wild boar showed significant consistent inter-individual variation in all three traits, with repeatability ranging from 0.16 to 0.35. We found significant correlations between traits, indicating the existence of a remarkable movement syndrome. Individuals staying within familiar areas were less nocturnal and moved slower, as opposed to individuals roaming more outside familiar areas, faster and with striking nocturnality. The movement syndrome and, most importantly, its variability, with individuals ranging in between extremes of activity and exploration, likely contributes to the success of this species and helps them thrive in human-dominated landscapes while maximizing resource acquisition. Integrating intraspecific behavioral variation into ecology and practical population management could improve models predicting wild boar movement and alleviate the biodiversity and economic loss caused by expanding wild boar populations.
   Wild boars' unique movement patterns, shaped by their personalities, might help them avoid humans and thrive in diverse environments. Recognizing these behavioral differences can aid in reducing human-willdlife conflicts and managing increasing wild boar populations effectively.

AB  - Understanding where animals graze and why they choose to graze there can be critical to rangeland and ecosystem management with misunderstandings of grazing distribution and behavior often being detrimental to management goals. Over time, grazing animals create grazing lawns that attract grazing animals due to ease of accessibility to more palatable regrowth. Similarly, fire can defoliate large areas of vegetation and promote new plant growth that is preferentially grazed by herbivores (i.e., pyric-herbivory in a patch-burn grazing framework). Grazer distribution in pyric-herbivory studies has been tracked through various metrics that produce valuable data. However, these data often lack precise information on what animals consume and do not account for differential plant production, limiting our ability to understand and apply pyric-herbivory to rangeland management through patch-burn grazing. Simultaneously monitoring plant biomass production and livestock grazing utilization would be the most comprehensive method to show site selection by grazing animals. To examine how previous grazing events influence grazing patterns, we collected data over 3 years on the utilization rate of patches by cattle in patch-burn grazing pastures and compared them to utilization rates in season-long grazed pastures. We found that regardless of management, grazing patterns were influenced by grazing in prior years. However, grazing in patch-burn pastures was more strongly influenced by fire than previous grazing events. Our results suggest that in the absence of additional disturbances, grazing patterns from previous years influence grazing patterns in the current year. However, disturbances that remove dead vegetation and promote regrowth, such as fire, override the influence of previous grazing patterns, modifying patch selection. Moving forward, these disturbances can be used to negate the effect of established grazing lawns and promote targeted grazing in areas with fresh regrowth, which benefits management goals.

AB  - Grassland shrub encroachment is known to change soil organic carbon (SOC) storage, but the effect of artificial thicketization on SOC in alpine grasslands of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the effects of two common shrubs, leguminous Caragana korshinskii and non-leguminous Hippophae rhamnoides, on SOC at a reforestation site on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. While C. korshinskii had no significant effect on SOC content, H. rhamnoides significantly increased SOC content. In both shrub communities, there was a significant positive correlation between SOC content and the coverage, plant aboveground biomass, dominant plant species biomass, total and available nitrogen, total phosphorus, and proportion of water-stable aggregate of greater than 250 mu m. Structural equation modeling showed that the common path by which the two shrub communities affected SOC was that the dominant species affected soil structure and the available nitrogen content by influencing community biomass, which had indirect effects on SOC. Additionally, C. korshinskii participated in the regulation of SOC. This result provides an important empirical reference and key insights into the carbon cycling mechanisms of reforested grasslands on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.

AB  - Conservation biological control of crop pests by natural enemies relies on management strategies to favour their trophic interactions. In agricultural landscapes, natural enemies acting across habitat boundaries may feed on non-pest prey, resulting in apparent competition between non-pest prey and pests. Such communities, including pests, non-pest prey, and natural enemies have been shown to be affected by landscape heterogeneity depending on the dispersal capacity of the interacting organisms. Nonetheless, a mechanistic understanding of how natural enemies' dispersal capacity interacts with landscape heterogeneity affecting conservation biological control is, however, lacking. Here, we contribute to such mechanistic understanding through modelling. We simulated the consequences of differences in landscape heterogeneity defined by the contrast of plant resource distribution in a semi-natural habitat compared to a crop and variation in natural enemy dispersal capacity on biological control of a pest. Our model showed that variation in plant resource distribution resulted in bottom-up effects that led to shifts in the dominant mechanism underlying biological control. At high landscape heterogeneity when resources differ strongly between crop and the semi-natural habitat, non-pest prey benefitted from the plant resources available, promoting apparent-competition-mediated biocontrol for high-dispersing natural enemies. At low landscape heterogeneity, pests benefitted mostly from plant resources available, promoting direct plant-pestenemy mediated biocontrol. Interestingly, intermediate levels of landscape heterogeneity resulted in the lowest levels of biocontrol. Our results highlight the importance of potential bottom-up effects that the matching between plant resources available in a habitat and the resource preference of herbivores can induce on conservation biological control.

AB  - The quality and completeness of the reference database have a direct impact on the accuracy of forage plant identification, thereby influencing the level of conservation and management of wildlife resources. In our research, target amplification was subjected to first-generation sequencing to assemble a local reference database using chloroplast trnL metabarcoding. We found that the primers c-h outperformed g-h as a universal DNA metabarcoding and 162 valid choloroplast trnL sequences were submitted (GenBank ID: PP081756- PP081917), which exhibited an obvious preference for A and T nucleotides (60.49%). The haplotype diversity (Hd), nucleotide diversity (Pi) and average number of nucleotide differences (K) of these trnL sequences were 0.978, 0.0484 and 4.743, respectively. To assess the availability of the local database in identifying the diet of South China sika deer ( Cervus nippon kopschi), high-throughput metabarcoding sequencing and BLAST analysis were performed. Ultimately, 25 forage plant species were identified, belonging to 19 families and 25 genera. Shrubs and herbaceous plants, such as Potentilla freyniana, Persicaria perfoliata, Rosa laevigata and Ardisia japonica etc, dominated the forage plants. This study established a local trnL reference database that holds immense value for the forage plant identification and nutritional evaluation for sika deer and other sympatric herbivores, as well as the conservation and management of biodiversity.

AB  - Most herbivores must balance demands to meet nutritional requirements, maintain stable thermoregulation and avoid predation. Species-specific predator and prey characteristics determine the ability of prey to avoid predation and the ability of predators to maximize hunting success. Using GPS collar data from African wild dogs, lions, impala, tsessebes, wildebeest and zebra in the Okavango Delta, Botswana, we studied proactive predation risk avoidance by herbivores. We considered predator activity level in relation to prey movement, predator and prey habitat selection, and preferential use of areas by prey. We compared herbivore behaviour to lion and wild dog activity patterns and determined the effect of seasonal resource availability and prey body mass on anti-predator behaviour. Herbivore movement patterns were more strongly correlated with lion than wild dog activity. Habitat selection by predators was not activity level dependent and, while prey and predators differed to some extent in their habitat selection, there were also overlaps, probably caused by predators seeking habitats with high prey abundance. Areas favoured by lions were used by herbivores more when lions were less active, whereas wild dog activity level was not correlated with prey use. Prey body mass was not a strong predictor of the strength of proactive predation avoidance behaviour. Herbivores showed stronger anti-predator behaviours during the rainy season when resources were abundant. Reducing movement when top predators are most active and avoiding areas with a high likelihood of predator use during the same periods appear to be common strategies to minimize predation risk. Such valuable insights into predator-prey dynamics are only possible when using similar data from multiple sympatric species of predator and prey, an approach that should become more prevalent given the ongoing integration of technological methods into ecological studies.
   In most ecosystems, prey must avoid capture by multiple species of predator. Prey minimizes movement and avoids high-use areas when top predators are most active. Considering multiple species of predator and prey is advantageous in ecology.image

AB  - The proximity to transportation hubs and the large movement of goods and people in cities make trees especially prone to invasive insect pests. Urban tree arrangements, in isolated tree sites or in forest patches, may alter their susceptibility to insect herbivory. Surprisingly little is known about how urban tree spatial arrangements influence pest abundance and top-down regulation by natural enemies. We sampled the abundance of an invasive pest of Eucalyptus, the psyllid Glycaspis brimblecombei, and of two of its natural enemies, the specialist exotic parasitoid Psyllaephagus bliteus and the generalist native predator Anthocoris nemoralis over two years. We measured insect abundances in isolated trees versus monospecific planted forest patches in 17 pairs of sites, each within a Portuguese city. The abundance of the exotic pest was three-fold higher in forest patches than in isolated trees. The parasitism rate was similar to 30 times higher in forest patches (11.5 %) than in isolated trees (0.4 %). The interdependence among insect species abundances also differed between spatial arrangements. In isolated trees, predator and parasitoid abundances depended markedly on prey abundance. In forest patches, we found a marked dependence of the predator on the composition of the surrounding landscape. Our study adds empirical data indicating that urban tree isolation matters for pest abundance and regulation by its enemies. In similar systems, avoiding dense monospecific patches of exotic trees and increasing the compositional heterogeneity of the landscape are promising paths to maintain the sustainability of urban trees and their environmental and societal benefits.

AB  - Fire regimes are expected to change with climate change, resulting in a crucial need to understand the specific ways in which variable fire regimes impact important contributors to ecosystem functioning, such as mound-building termites. Termite mounds and fire are both important agents of savanna ecosystem heterogeneity and functioning, but there is little understanding of how they interact across savanna types. We used very high-resolution LiDAR remote sensing to measure the size and distribution of termite mounds across approximately 1300 ha of experimental burn plots in four South African savanna landscapes representing a wide range of fire treatments differing in seasonality and frequency of burning. In nutrient-poor granitic savannas, fire had no impact on termite mound size, densities and spatial distributions. In nutrient-rich basaltic savannas with high mammalian herbivore abundance and intermediate rainfall, very frequent fires caused a decrease in termite mound size, whereas in arid nutrient-rich basaltic savannas, fires that occurred at intermediate frequencies and in transitional seasons (i.e. late dry season and late wet season) decreased the degree of spatial overdispersal exhibited by mounds. Overall, our results suggest that termite mounds are resistant to variation in fire seasonality and frequency, likely indicating that ecosystem services provided by mound-building termites will be unaffected by changing fire regimes. However, consideration of changes to termite mound size and distribution could be necessary for land managers in specific savanna types, such as nutrient-rich soils with high mammalian herbivore abundance.

AB  - Dry playa surfaces can be extremely vulnerable to disturbance which breaks their surface crusts resulting in increased aeolian sand and dust emissions. Trampling by livestock and motor vehicles is an important source of this disturbance. The Hamoun Lakes in the Sistan region of Iran are a major source area of dust storms which are causing damage to infrastructure and communities. This study performed portable wind tunnel tests of controlled surface disturbance by animals (cow, sheep) and motor vehicles (automobile, motorcycle) on a silty playa surface of Hamoun Saberi lake. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of different levels of trampling and disturbed surfaces by both vehicles and livestock on dust emission at wind speeds of 6 and 12 m s(-1). A significant increase of sediment emission was found with increased number of passes of vehicles and livestock and the degree of surface disturbance, more so at the high wind speed (12 m s(-1)). No significant differences were observed between a 10-20% disturbance level and an undisturbed surface, but statistically significant differences became apparent when disturbances reached 50-60% to 90-100% compared to undisturbed surfaces. Greater emission rates were reached by disturbances provided by automobile and cow compared to motorcycle and sheep, indicating greater trampling effects of automobile and cow likely related to greater weight and larger footprint. The automobile was the most surface-destructive of the four anthropogenic disturbances, providing emission in a lower number of passes compared to the motorcycle, cow and sheep. Better management of vehicle and livestock allocation on playas subject to disturbance, such as the Hamoun Lakes, will be a useful strategy to reduce disturbance and the frequency and intensity of dust storms.

AB  - Purpose Understanding parasite diversity in wild and captive animal populations is vital for their individual health and ecosystem dynamics. The helminth community in mountain gazelles (Gazella gazella Pallas, 1766), particularly in the isolated northernmost population in T & uuml;rkiye, remains poorly understood, posing challenges for conservation. This study aimed to identify and compare the diversity of helminths in captive and free-ranging mountain gazelles in Hatay, T & uuml;rkiye, while assessing potential zoonotic risks. Methods We collected a total of 188 fresh fecal samples from both captive and free-ranging populations. The samples were analyzed using DNA metabarcoding to assess helminth species and their species diversity across seasons. Results Our findings revealed eight helminth taxa in Gazella gazella, including six intestinal and two lung nematodes, with four of these species previously unreported in T & uuml;rkiye. We also found seasonal differences in helminth composition and abundance. Conclusions The identification of these helminth taxa highlights the value of advanced molecular techniques in uncovering parasite diversity in ungulates. Seasonal differences in helminth composition and abundance, and the biological characteristics of the detected helminth species align with the climatic parameters of the seasons in which they were identified.

AB  - During the last century shrub encroachment has occurred in many arid and semiarid areas of the world. Patagonia is a large xeric territory located in the southern tip of South America, which has been grazed by sheep for more than a century. In many areas overgrazing led to vegetation change (shrub encroachment), which in turn reduced sheep carrying capacity and caused ranch abandonment. However, these changes in physiognomy did not occur everywhere, and even some authors did not find evidence that shrub encroachment is currently occurring. Our objectives were to determine if encroachment really happened in NE Patagonia and, in the case of confirming shrub encroachment, to evaluate if the increase in shrub density was spatially homogeneous. We used object-based image analysis to evaluate shrub density and cover in aerial photographs taken in 1970 and 2018. In both dates, shrub density showed a clear contrast between two kinds of areas showing higher and lower density than was expected by chance. Shrub density and cover more than doubled between 1970 and 2018. This increase was concentrated in those areas with moderate or high densities of shrubs in 1970. Our results confirm the occurrence of shrub encroachment in NE Patagonia and demonstrate that it is currently concentrated near previously invaded areas. These findings have implications when defining protocols for monitoring shrub encroachment since monitors should focus on both areas that already have shrubs and areas that lack them.

AB  - Management of invasive alien species is a high priority for biodiversity conservation. Here, we studied the effects of glyphosate application, at 0.06 g/m(2) concentration, on physiologically integrated basal and apical ramets of the invasive clonal plant Carpobrotus edulis. Physiological integration allows the transport of resources and other substances between connected ramets in clonal plants. We found a significant reduction of growth and photochemical efficiency both in basal and apical ramets of C. edulis after glyphosate application. Interestingly, we also observed a significant growth reduction in untreated basal ramets when they remained connected to apical ramets treated with glyphosate. This result was interpreted as a cost for basal ramets due to supporting severely stressed apical ramets. Therefore, local application of glyphosate to apical ramets of C. edulis can negatively affect not only their own growth, but also the growth of their interconnected, untreated basal ramets. Our results suggest that glyphosate effectiveness can be maintained when applied only to one part of the clone so that the amount of herbicide used in eradication programs can be greatly reduced, which can minimize the negative impact of chemical herbicides on ecosystems.

AB  - ContextAs cities seek to provide more habitat for wildlife, there may be unintended consequences of increasing tick-borne disease hazards. In the United States, the Northeast is both highly urban and a hotspot for blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis) and tick-borne disease emergence. Though tick-borne disease was once considered a suburban and rural problem, tick-borne hazards in urban landscapes are increasing.ObjectivesWe hypothesized that multi-scale ecological processes hierarchically contribute to tick-borne hazards across an urbanization gradient. Urban greenspaces with higher functional connectivity to deer movement would have higher deer occupancy at the 'ecological neighborhood' scale, resulting in increased blacklegged tick populations and pathogen infection at the scale of within greenspaces.MethodsTo evaluate our hypothesis, we used circuit theory methods to model the impact of functional connectivity on deer occupancy, blacklegged tick abundance, and pathogen infected ticks across an urbanization gradient. We sampled nymphal ticks during their peak activity and deployed wildlife cameras to detect deer at 38 greenspaces across New York City and Long Island, NY from 2022 to 2023.ResultsWe found that functional connectivity significantly predicted deer occupancy with cascading effects on abundance of blacklegged nymphal ticks and Borrelia burgdorferi infection. We novelly identified a threshold of functional connectivity in urban areas necessary for deer occupancy, tick populations, and tick infection with B. burgdorferi, to emerge in urban environments.ConclusionsWe recommend targeted tick-borne hazard mitigation along this functional connectivity threshold as part of urban greenspace management plans. Additionally, we highlight the importance of examining multi-scale landscape drivers of host, tick, and pathogen interactions.

AB  - Large African mammal populations are traditionally estimated using the systematic reconnaissance flights (SRF) with rear-seat observers (RSOs). The oblique-camera-count (OCC) approach, utilizing digital cameras on aircraft sides, proved to provide more reliable population estimates but incurs high manual processing costs. Addressing the urgent need for efficiency, the research explores whether a semi-automated deep learning (SADL) model coupled with OCC improves wildlife population estimates compared to the SRF-RSO method. The study area was the Comoe<acute accent> National Park, in Ivory Coast, spanning 11,488 km2 of savannas and open forests. It was surveyed following both SRF-RSO standards and OCC method. Key species included the elephant, western hartebeest, roan antelope, buffalo, kob, waterbuck and warthog. The deep learning model HerdNet, priorly pre-trained on images from Uganda, was incorporated in the SADL pipeline to process the 190,686 images. It involved three human verification steps to ensure quality of detections and to avoid overestimating counts. The entire pipeline aims to balance efficiency and human effort in wildlife population estimation. RSO and SADL-OCC approaches were compared using the Jolly II analysis and a verification of 200 random RSO observations. Jolly II analysis revealed SADL-OCC estimates significantly higher for small-sized species (kob, warthog) and comparable for other key species. Counting differences were mainly attributed to vegetation obstruction, RSO observations not found in the images, and suspected RSO counting errors. Human effort in the SADL-OCC approach totaled 111 h, representing a significant time savings compared to a fully manual interpretation. Introducing the SADL approach for aerial surveys in Comoe<acute accent> National Park enabled us to address the OCC's time-intensive image interpretation. Achieving a significant reduction in human workload, our method provided population estimates comparable to or better than SRF-RSO counts. Vegetation obstruction was a key factor explaining differences, highlighting the OCC method's limitation in vegetated areas. Method comparisons emphasized SADL-OCC's advantages in spotting isolated, small and static animals, reducing count variance between sample units. Despite limitations, the SADL-OCC approach offers transformative potential, suggesting a shift towards DL-assisted aerial surveys for increased efficiency and affordability, especially using microlight aircraft and drones in future wildlife monitoring initiatives.

AB  - As a corridor for population movement out of Africa, the southern Levant is a natural laboratory for research exploring the dynamics of the Middle-to-Upper Paleolithic transition. Yet, the number of well-preserved sites dating to the initial millennia of the Early Upper Paleolithic (EUP; -45-30 ka) remains limited, restricting the resolution at which we can study the biocultural and techno-typological changes evidenced across the transition. With EUP deposits dating to 45-39 ka cal BP, Mughr el-Hamamah, Jordan, offers a key opportunity to expand our understanding of EUP lifeways in the southern Levant. Mughr el-Hamamah is particularly noteworthy for its large faunal assemblage, representing the first such assemblage from the Jordan Valley. In this paper, we present results from taxonomic and taphonomic analyses of the EUP fauna from Mughr el-Hamamah. Given broader debates about shifts in human subsistence across the Middle-to-Upper Paleolithic transition, we also assess evidence for subsistence intensification, focusing especially on the exploitation of gazelle and the use of small game. Taphonomic data suggest that the fauna was primarily accumulated by human activity. Ungulates dominate the assemblage; gazelle (Gazella sp.) is the most common taxa, followed by fallow deer (Dama mesopotamica) and goat (Capra sp.). Among the gazelle, juveniles account for roughly one-third of the sample. While the focus on gazelle and the frequency of juveniles are consistent with broader regional trends, evidence for the regular exploitation of marrow from gazelle phalanges suggests that the EUP occupants of Mughr el-Hamamah processed gazelle carcasses quite intensively. Yet, the overall degree of dietary intensification appears low-small game is rare and evidence for human capture of this game is more equivocal. As a whole, our results support a growing body of data showing gradual shifts in animal exploitation strategies across the Middle-toUpper Paleolithic transition in the southern Levant.

AB  - Food web structures (source and flow of energy in biological communities) are linked to ecological niche and species interactions, which are essential for assessing ecosystem stability and resilience. This study investigated the carbon fixation pathways of the source microbes and trophic relations of the benthic faunal community in the Onnuri Vent Field (OVF), Central Indian Ridge using sulfur (delta S-34), carbon (delta C-13), and nitrogen (delta N-15) stable isotopic compositions. OVF megafauna exhibited a common isotopic pattern in hydrothermal vents with increasing delta N-15 and delta C-13 values, but not with delta S-34 values. Chemosynthetic production was the predominant source of energy in the OVF, and we identified at least three potential pools of isotopically distinct chemosynthetic production pathways, namely, the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle, reverse tricarboxylic acid cycle, and methanotrophic production. Within phyla, the endosymbionts and episymbionts of host taxa had different bacterial groups or carbon fixation pathways, indicating that they utilize non-overlapping resources, mutually benefiting themselves from less competition. We identified seven trophic guilds and four trophic levels in the OVF: (i) basal species consisting of symbiont host and bacterivores, (ii) intermediate species consuming particulate organic matter and detritus in addition to bacteria, (iii) scavengers and carnivores that specialize in few diets, and (iv) top predators of crab Austinograea rodriguezensis and Munidopsis sp. that are omnivorous. However, there were some spatial variations in energy sources of megafauna within the OVF, suggesting that source availability affect their trophic relations. We also found similarities and differences in the energy source and feeding relationship of some OVF fauna from those in other Indian Ocean hydrothermal vents. Overall, we believe that the results of this study contribute to improving our understanding of the nature and variation of food web structure and feeding strategies used by vent fauna for survival in the Indian Ocean hydrothermal vents that are particularly less explored.

AB  - Landscape characteristics, seasonal changes in the environment, and daylight conditions influence space use and detection of prey and predators, resulting in spatiotemporal patterns of predation risk for the prey. When predators have different hunting modes, the combined effects of multiple predators are mediated by the physical landscape and can result in overlapping or contrasting patterns of predation risk. Humans have become super-predators in many anthropogenic landscapes by harvesting game species and competing with large carnivores for prey. Here, we used the locations of wolf (Canis lupus)-killed and hunter-killed moose (Alces alces) in south-central Scandinavia to investigate whether environmental and anthropogenic features influenced where wolves and hunters killed moose. We predicted that the combined effects of wolves and hunters would result in contrasting spatial risk patterns due to differences in hunting modes. We expected these contrasting spatial risk patterns also to differ temporally. During the hunting season, the probability of a wolf kill increased with distance to bogs, whereas it decreased with increasing building density and distance to clearcuts and young forests. After the hunting season, the probability of a wolf kill increased with increasing terrain ruggedness and decreased with increasing building density, distance to main roads, and distance to clearcuts and young forests. The probability of a hunter kill was highest closer to bogs, main and secondary roads, in less rugged terrain and in areas with lower building density. Hunters killed all moose during the day, whereas wolves killed most moose at night during and after the hunting season. Our findings suggest that environmental and anthropogenic features mediate hunting and wolf predation risk. Additionally, we found that hunter- and wolf-killed moose exhibited contrasting spatial associations to landscape features, most likely due to the different hunting modes displayed by hunters and wolves. However, wolf predation and hunting risks also contrasted over time since wolves killed mostly at night and hunters were restricted to hunting during daytime and during the hunting season. This temporal segregation in risk might therefore suggest that moose could minimize risk exposure by taking advantage of spatiotemporally vacant hunting domains.

AB  - The epidemiology behind multi-host/multi-parasite systems is particularly interesting to investigate for a better understanding of the complex dynamics naturally occurring in wildlife populations. We aimed to approach the naturally occurring polyparasitism of gastrointestinal nematodes in a sympatric wild ruminant scenario present in south-east Spain. To this end, the gastrointestinal tract of 252 wild ruminants of four different species (red deer, Cervus elaphus; mouflon, Ovis aries musimon; Iberian ibex, Capra pyrenaica and fallow deer, Dama dama) were studied in Cazorla, Segura y Las Villas Natural Park (Andalusia, Spain). Of the analysed animals, 81.52% were positive for parasite infection and a total of 29 nematode species were identified. Out of these, 25 species were detected in at least two host species and 11 parasitized all ruminant species surveyed. The multi-host interaction between these nematodes and the four host species is discussed under the perspective of host family-based differences.

AB  - Spring and summer rainfall patterns in Mongolian semi-arid grazing lands vary greatly from year to year, and are thought to affect the energy balance and nutritional conditions of sheep via plant community changes. To test this, climatic and vegetation data in Mongolian semiarid grasslands were obtained from spring to summer over 3 yr. For 2 yr, sheep energy intake and expenditure were calculated, and the energy balance and nutrition indicators were compared among years with different seasonal rainfall patterns. In 2019 and 2022, rainfall patterns were characterized by the presence and absence of early summer drought, respectively. Compared to 2019, plants were tall and abundant in 2022; thus, the mean bite size, energy intake, and body weight were higher. Estimated energy intake and expenditure were 4.56 and 2.10 Mcal in 2019, and 6.75 and 1.63 Mcal in 2022, respectively, indicating that rainfall timing and amount affected vegetation assemblage, plant height, herbage nutrition, grazing behavior, animal energy balance, and nutrition conditions. Insufficient rainfall before early summer in semiarid grazing lands resulted in low energy intake and balance, and delayed body weight gain could not be recovered. These results can inform the management of grazing lands to ensure optimal livestock conditions. (c) 2024 The Society for Range Management. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Bush encroachment is increasingly becoming a problem for biodiversity conservation in African savannas. While this invasion by woody vegetation may hamper avian scavengers such as vultures, which primarily search by sight, it may benefit mammalian scavengers that search by smell. This study aimed to examine the ability of nocturnal mammalian and diurnal avian scavengers to locate carcasses at increasing vegetation densities. We successively placed 27 impala (Aepyceros melampus) carcasses five days apart in a 2000 ha fenced game camp that offered an extensive range of woody plant densities. Scavenger arrivals and first feedings were recorded with camera traps. The avian scavengers, mainly white-backed Vultures (Gyps africanus), fed exclusively on carcasses during the day, and mammalian scavengers, predominantly brown hyenas (Parahyena brunnea), fed solely at night. The two guilds thus competed exploitatively without direct interaction between them. For vultures, the time taken to locate a carcass increased with woody plant density. The mean density of woody plants that avian scavengers located carcasses at was 2188 plants/ha, whereas mammalian scavengers located carcasses at appreciably higher densities of 5156 plants/ha. Resource managers need to understand the synergy between maintaining woody vegetation to benefit nocturnal mammalian scavengers and maintaining open savannas to benefit diurnal avian scavengers.

AB  - Effective conservation requires understanding species' abundance patterns and demographic rates across space and time. Ideally, such knowledge should be available for whole communities because variation in species' dynamics can elucidate factors leading to biodiversity losses. However, collecting data to simultaneously estimate abundance and demographic rates of communities of species is often prohibitively time intensive and expensive. We developed a multispecies dynamic N-occupancy model to estimate unbiased, community-wide relative abundance and demographic rates. In this model, detection-nondetection data (e.g., repeated presence-absence surveys) are used to estimate species- and community-level parameters and the effects of environmental factors. To validate our model, we conducted a simulation study to determine how and when such an approach can be valuable and found that our multispecies model outperformed comparable single-species models in estimating abundance and demographic rates in many cases. Using data from a network of camera traps across tropical equatorial Africa, we then used our model to evaluate the statuses and trends of a forest-dwelling antelope community. We estimated relative abundance, rates of recruitment (i.e., reproduction and immigration), and apparent survival probabilities for each species' local population. The antelope community was fairly stable (although 17% of populations [species-park combinations] declined over the study period). Variation in apparent survival was linked more closely to differences among national parks than to individual species' life histories. The multispecies dynamic N-occupancy model requires only detection-nondetection data to evaluate the population dynamics of multiple sympatric species and can thus be a valuable tool for examining the reasons behind recent biodiversity loss.

AB  - Conservation translocations are complex and challenging, but are frequently employed to tackle biodiversity decline. Large predator translocations can be particularly emotive and contentious, in part because they present actual or perceived risks to the safety and livelihoods of people. Understanding the social feasibility of conservation translocations is imperative, and provides opportunities to identify and address these risks. In Britain, the Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx is the most frequently raised prospect for large carnivore reintroduction. We used Q-Methodology to explore stakeholder perspectives on the prospect of lynx reintroduction to Scotland. We identified five perspectives: Lynx for Change was supportive of lynx reintroduction, feeling that lynx could facilitate ecosystem restoration. Lynx for Economy was also supportive, anticipating economic benefits to local communities. No to Lynx was strongly opposed, perceiving that humans were fulfilling the roles of absent large carnivores. Scotland is not Ready supported the conversation but perceived prohibitive socio-ecological barriers. We are not Convinced was not satisfied that an adequate case for biodiversity gain had been made, but was open to further exploration of the potential. There were important areas of divergence among the perspectives over the potential impacts on sheep farming and the degree to which environments should be managed by people or encouraged to self-regulate. There was a consensus on a lack of trust between stakeholder groups, which was primarily rooted in participants' experiences of previous wildlife reintroductions and the contemporary management of recovering predators. However, there was also consensus that, should lynx reintroduction continue to be explored, a participatory, cross-sectoral approach could address these trust issues, help manage existing and emergent conflicts, and build knowledge collaboratively. We provide a foundation for future dialogue between stakeholders over the prospective reintroduction of the lynx to Scotland and recommend a stakeholder-focused participatory process as the next step. Our findings have wider relevance for wildlife reintroductions, species recovery and conservation conflicts elsewhere. Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

AB  - Global warming is facilitating the range expansion of tropical herbivores, causing a tropicalization of temperate marine ecosystems, where tropical herbivores can suppress habitat-forming macrophytes, supporting the resilience of canopy-free ecosystem states. However, currently we lack a thorough understanding of the mechanisms that, on one hand, support the persistence of tropical herbivores and on the other support the recovery of temperate foundation species in tropicalized ecosystems, a required knowledge to predict potential regime shifts and reversals to the baseline state of the ecosystem.
   This study tested processes behind the persistence of the tropicalization of temperate reefs which experienced a complete loss of their kelp forests and an influx of tropical herbivores following a marine heatwave in 2011. For this, we assessed the feedback mechanisms that maintain turf-dominated states (recruitment of tropical herbivores, browsing and grazing rates and turf cover) and those that resist it (kelp recruitment, survival and reproductiveness).
   We found that the reefs remained tropicalized with high abundances of turf and tropical herbivores after 9 years from the regime shift. The rabbitfish Siganus fuscescens and the chub Kyphosus bigibbus were the most important herbivores whose persistence was supported by the adjacent reef lagoon, where seagrass meadows and the backreef habitats hosted juveniles of both species, particularly rabbitfish. Tropical herbivores exerted a strong top-down control on turf seaweed and kelp during herbivory assays, rapidly consuming kelp individuals in open areas. However, in topographical refuges in the reefs, herbivory was low and kelp individuals survived, with some having reproductive tissue.
   Synthesis. Our findings incorporate the importance of nursery grounds for tropical herbivores and herbivory refugia for kelp individuals into the tropicalization model, where the former increases the resilience of canopy-free states and the latter might facilitate recovering kelp populations. The restoration of abundant warm-resistant kelp populations in shelters could provide local sources of propagules to recolonize open spaces; however, our results suggest that the reduction of herbivory and the provision of turf-free substratum would be necessary to boost the recovery of kelp forests.

AB  - Background Determining the density of mammalian wildlife in an ecosystem is very important for the ecosystem conservation. The aim of this study is to reveal mammalian wildlife density and compare the effect human footprint index (HFI) on the Mediterranean ecosystems. The mammalian wildlife surveys were conducted between August 2013 and December 2013, using 21 camera traps with 2175 camera trap days in a Mediterranean forest ecosystem in & Idot;zmir, Turkiye. We used random encounter model (REM) method to estimate densities. Results The population density for 5 mammals were; for red fox 7.89 ind./km(2) (+/- 0.82 SE), wild boar 4.36 ind./km(2) (+/- 0.46 SE), European hare 15.33 ind./km(2 )(+/- 03.37 SE), beech marten 0.99 ind./km(2) (+/- 0.10 SE) and golden jackal 0.50 ind./km(2) (+/- 0.05 SE). These results were compared with mammal community which was previously studied in another Mediterranean ecosystem in Mugla, Turkiye, includes caracal and has a lower human footprint index. Conclusions According to results of this study human activity which can be revealed by Human footprint index (HFI) is one of the main parameter on Mediterranean ecosystem and it is effecting the density and occurence of species in mammal community. Both a higher human footprint index and the absence of caracal might cause higher density of red fox and European hare in & Idot;zmir, Turkiye. This study also suggests that caracal might be a serious suppressor on red fox which could be explained by competition. Caracal may also control the European hare in Mediterranean forest ecosystem of Anatolia. Thus, decreasing human footprint index and maintaining caracal suppressor effect are crucial for the conservation of the whole Mediterranean ecosystem.

AB  - Large transboundary protected areas such as the Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area (KAZA-TFCA), improve mammal conservation by addressing biodiversity threats on regional and international levels, but an adequate understanding of mammal space use and richness within protected areas is critical for effective management planning. This information has however been missing from the Angolan component of the KAZA-TFCA, such as areas of Luengue-Luiana National Park (LLNP), especially compared with neighbouring countries. We used camera trap data from 2021 to 2023 to investigate species richness of medium- and large-sized mammals in two hotspot areas of LLNP, as well as assess the space use patterns of 9 carnivore and 16 herbivore species. A total of 48 species were recorded over 10,781 camera trapping nights, with African elephant (Loxodonta africana) and small antelope (e.g. common duiker Sylvicapra grimmia and steenbok Raphicerus campestris) being the most common. Species composition differed significantly between sites, with 21 species more relatively abundant at Ndunjuru, including cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) and African wild dog (Lycaon pictus), and eight species more relatively abundant at Bico, including lion (Panthera leo) and hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius). The detection probability of 22 species were affected by one or more ecological (e.g. proximity to rivers) or anthropogenic (e.g. human settlement) covariate. These results are intended to act as a baseline to monitor conservation effort and aid habitat management in LLNP, as well as similar protected areas within the KAZA-TFCA and elsewhere.

AB  - Insect populations are declining due to a multitude of causes. One major cause is the loss of suitable habitat. Recently, green roofs have been investigated for their potential to mitigate this loss of habitat in urbanized environments. In Belgium, most installed green roofs are characterized by a thin layer of mineral substrate and a vegetational composition that is mainly dominated by species of Sedum, i.e. extensive Sedum-moss roofs or Sedum-moss-herbaceous planting. Lepidoptera, as well as many other insects, exert specific plant-herbivore interactions during at least one phase in their life cycle, but no attention has been paid to investigate the potential of Sedum to serve as host plants. Using a molecular approach, we identified caterpillar communities on both types of extensive green roofs and investigated their gut contents. Ten nocturnal moth species were identified: eight polyphagous macromoths and two monophagous micromoths. All species were found to feed on Sedum, a first record thereof for every species. Based on these findings we conclude that both types of green roofs provide larval habitat for at least some moth species. This can have broad implications considering the fact that moths play a crucial role in multiple trophic interactions. However, when the goal is to increase butterfly diversity in urban environments, other types of green roofs need to be reconsidered. While we did not observe larvae of diurnal butterfly species, there have been reports of imagines on wildflower green roofs or biodiverse (semi-)intensive green roofs.

AB  - Insect populations show strong temporal fluctuations in abundance. This renders classical monitoring studies extremely difficult to provide insights into specific management actions. For rare species of conservation concern, it is not an option to develop large scale experiments to assess and steer landscape-level actions such as grazing management. Bembix rostrata (Linnaeus, 1758) is a threatened digger wasp from coastal dunes and inland sandy regions occurring in a limited number of populations in NW Europe. Since coastal dunes are rapidly being encroached by bushes, grazing management (cattle, sheep, and horses) has been implemented to keep this biotope open. In order to provide insights for local evidence based conservation, a BACI (before/after and control/impact) experiment was set up to assess the impact of sheep grazing on B. rostrata. We quantified the number of nests during 3 years at two grazed sites and a control-site excluded from grazing. We additionally assessed grazing pressure. The BACI design allowed us to directly adjust the current grazing management. The implemented sheep grazing reduced densities of B. rostrata, but did not lead to its local extinction. We discuss these findings in relation to the biology of the species. Our efficient and effective experimental design allowed a fast assessment of the current grazing management and showed that spatially heterogeneous sheep grazing could be used as a management tool to ensure the conservation of the emblematic digger wasp B. rostrata.

AB  - Overabundant suburban deer (Odocoileus spp.) are a source of human-wildlife conflict in many communities throughout the United States. Deer-vehicle collisions, impacts to local vegetation, tick-borne pathogens, and other negative interactions are typical reasons cited for initiating deer management programs. Social attitudes, legal constraints, and perceived safety concerns lead many communities to examine nonlethal management options. Surgical sterilization is currently the only nonlethal method available to permanently sterilize females with a single treatment. However, there are limited data demonstrating methods and outcomes in management programs that sterilize a high percentage (>90%) of local populations of females, particularly regarding the impact of immigration on non-isolated populations. We present data from 6 surgical sterilization sites with geographically open populations in California, Maryland, Michigan, New York, Ohio, and Virginia, USA. From 2012 to 2020 we sterilized 493 deer, primarily via ovariectomy, and conducted annual or periodic population estimates using camera surveys, road-based distance sampling, and intensive field observations to assess population trends. Study sites ranged from 1.2 km(2) to 16.5 km(2) with similar to 47-169 individuals, resulting in approximate densities of 6-63 deer/km(2). For all sites we noted an average reduction of similar to 26% (17%-36%) from Year 1 to Year 2. Four years after initial treatment, we documented an average population reduction of similar to 45% (29%-56%). During the first year, the average cost per deer sterilized at locations where bait was used was US$1,185 ($927-$1,572). Surgical sterilization projects demonstrate that significant reductions in local deer densities using high-percentage, surgical sterilization programs can be achieved in non-insular locations, where baited deer are approachable by vehicle for darting. Sustained sterilization efforts may be necessary, as is the case with all deer management programs, in areas where immigration is possible, and all the animals are not sterilized.

AB  - This study investigates the influence of microenvironmental factors on carcass decomposition and insect colonization, emphasizing the detailed analysis of insect communities. The research involved placing two pig carcasses in contrasting environments: one in a sunlit open field and the other in a shaded forest area. Over 10 days, we observed variations in decomposition rates, with the carcass in the sunlit area decomposing faster than the one in the shade. This research applies Symbolic Aggregate approXimation to transform the daily measurements of carcass weight into symbolic sequences, enabling a comparison of temporal patterns in insect colonization and decomposition dynamics between the environments. Additionally, we utilized alpha and beta diversity assessments to explore the composition and behavior of the insect populations. Our findings revealed dynamic shifts in insect diversity in the sunlit area, marked by a rapid increase followed by a decline, contrasting with steadier, gradual changes in the shaded area. These shifts underscore the sensitivity of insect communities to subtle differences in sunlight and temperature exposure. Our study confirms the significant impact of these environmental factors on both decomposition rates and insect community dynamics, highlighting their potential to refine post-mortem interval estimations in forensic entomology. This enhances our understanding of how environmental conditions directly influence insect colonization, offering valuable insights for forensic applications.

AB  - Key message We test the potential benefits of planting 2-year vs. 1-year-old seedlings to restore Mediterranean oak-dominated systems. Planting 2-year-old Quercus suber L. seedlings is recommended for improved survival and resilience against wild boar (Sus scrofa L.) and drought in dry sandy soils. The removal of acorns in seedlings did not apparently influence leaf biochemical traits and could reduce wild boar damage, particularly in 1-year-old seedlings. Context In the face of anthropogenic global change, Mediterranean oak-dominated ecosystems confront increased biotic (ungulate herbivory) and abiotic (drought) stressors, compromising forest regeneration. Restoration measures are imperative to address this scenario. Aims This study assesses the impact of different mitigation measures on the survival and biochemical traits of two oak species. Methods We planted Quercus ilex L. and Q. suber L. seedlings in Caba & ntilde;eros and Do & ntilde;ana National Parks (Spain), subjecting them to three treatments: cotyledon/acorn removal, seedling age (1- vs. 2-year-old), and herbivore protection (fenced vs. non-fenced). Results Wild boar (Sus scrofa L.) damage peaked in winter and early spring, while drought prevailed from late spring to fall. In sandy soils, wild boar uprooted 1-year-old more often than 2-years-old seedlings (40% vs. 18%). One-year-old seedlings without acorns showed higher survival rates against wild boar only in sandy soils. The removal of acorns in seedlings did not influence plant biochemical traits. Conclusions Planting 2-year-old seedlings in sandy soils may mitigate wild boar damage and improve drought resilience. Seedling age seems more important than acorn removal against biotic and abiotic stressors although acorn removal could reduce wild boar damage in 1-year-old seedlings. Our results underscore the importance of considering multiple stressors in oak restoration strategies.

AB  - Pollen analysis of five teeth (two premolars, three molars) from a single maxilla of a giant deer (Megaloceros giganteus) found in Pleistocene deposits in The Netherlands reflects the diet and the landscape of the specimen that lived in eastern Doggerland. Apiaceae (among which Anthriscus sylvestris, Heracleum and Hydrocotyle), Asteraceae (among which Anthemis-type, Senecio-type and Cichorioideae), Filipendula, Poaceae and Symphytum were among the ingested plants. The landscape had dense, species-rich tall-herb vegetation and an open tree layer of Alnus and Betula, whereas thermophilous tree taxa were absent. Climate was probably cool-temperate, semi-dry, sub-continental. A radiocarbon date of the maxilla is beyond the 14C detection limit. We conclude that our giant deer most likely lived during the early Eemian or during an early Weichselian interstadial.

AB  - Changes in wild and domestic herbivore populations significantly impact extensive grazing systems, particularly in low productive environments, where increasing wild herbivore populations are perceived as a threat to farming. To assess the magnitude of these changes in Iceland, we compiled time series on herbivore populations from 1986 to 2020 and estimated changes in species densities, metabolic biomass, and consumption of plant biomass in improved lands and unimproved rangelands. We compared estimates of consumption rates to past and present net primary production. Overall, the herbivore community composition shifted from livestock to wildlife dominated. However, wild herbivores only contributed a small fraction (14%) of the total herbivore metabolic biomass and consumption (4-7%), and livestock dominated the overall herbivore biomass. These insights highlight the necessity of developing improved local integrated management for both wild and domestic herbivores where they coexist.

AB  - Translocation is a key conservation strategy, with breeding programs increasingly providing animals for release. Despite its growing use, translocation efforts frequently encounter limited success, particularly when captiveborn animals are involved. Ex-situ environments may lack cues needed to develop survival behaviors, such as predator avoidance, foraging, and social skills. Although practitioners typically address the lack of predator avoidance through training or predator removal, competitor naivety remains largely overlooked, despite its potential to hinder population establishment by compromising access to resources. We examined the impact of pre-release competitor experience on the Pacific pocket mouse (Perognathus longimembris pacificus), one of southern California's most critically endangered mammals. The Pacific pocket mouse is the smallest, and most behaviorally subordinate species in a community of native rodents that compete for resources. We conducted a controlled experiment to test if providing captive-born mice pre-release experience with kangaroo rats (Dipodomys simulans) would improve translocation outcomes. We compared fitness and body condition of pocket mice between the two treatments and examined if behavioral change was exhibited before release. Competitorexperienced females gained more weight and had higher survival and reproductive success than controls, with female survival surpassing that of males in both groups. These findings suggest that incorporating competitor experience into conservation breeding programs could improve translocation success. As competition is a common challenge in natural ecosystems, this behavioral intervention could be applicable for a wide range of species.

AB  - The Janzen-Connell hypothesis proposes that density and distance-dependent mortality generated by specialist natural enemies prevent competitive dominance. Much literature on Janzen-Connell mechanisms comes from the neotropics, and evidence of the role of distance and density-dependence is still relatively sparse. We tested the predictions of the Janzen-Connell hypothesis in a South-East Asian system dominated by mast fruiting species. We hypothesized that seedling survival would decrease with distance and density, seedling growth would increase, and herbivory would decrease, according to the predictions of the Janzen-Connell hypothesis. Experiments were conducted to determine the strength of the Janzen-Connell mechanism by manipulating the density and identity of tree species as a function of the distance from parent trees. Survival of conspecific seedlings was reduced near adult trees of one species, but not another. High densities of seedlings decreased the growth of conspecific seedlings of both species. In both species, herbivory rates decreased with distance in low-density areas. This study indicates that dipterocarp species experienced weak Janzen-Connell effects of distance and density dependence at the growth stage studied. Future studies in this system might focus on earlier life-history stages such as seeds and small seedlings, as well as studying mortality during mast-seeding events.

AB  - Background and aims Heathlands are a broad vegetation type characterized by the dominance of evergreen shrub species that thrive on nutrient-poor soils, thus sensitive to small changes in soil conditions. Here we aimed to identify soil gradients related to climate, management and main species in wet heathlands. Methods Soil nutrient levels, organic matter and acidity were studied at two soil depths on ninety plots from 18 sites in Erica mackayana wet heaths of NW Iberian Peninsula, in relation to presence and cover of structural plant species (shrubs and graminoids) at two scales: plot and site (landscape) scale. Results We identified one main soil gradient explained by soil organic matter (SOM), the effective cation exchange complex (eCEC), available phosphorus (P), and Aluminium-Calcium ratio (Al:Ca). Cattle density had a positive correlation with the main gradient in the surface layer, all other climate and management factors were unrelated to soil conditions. Molinia caerulea had a positive relation with SOM, eCEC, basic cations and low Al:Ca ratio. Erica cinerea showed the opposite reaction at both scales. Ulex gallii showed a negative correlation with C:N ratio at the plot scale and deeper layer. Conclusion SOM accumulation, low nutrient levels and Al toxicity explain the uniqueness of E. mackayana heathland vegetation and soils. Main indicator species react to soil conditions at plot and landscape scales. Cattle density correlated positively with soil nutrient levels, but density of wild ponies is unrelated to soil conditions. Large herbivores, especially ponies, are needed for conservation management of these heathlands.

AB  - Simple Summary The presence of Salmonella enterica in buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) farms is a cause for great concern, as it is responsible for serious economic losses and is a zoonotic agent capable of contaminating the mozzarella production chain. Salmonella induced disease mainly affects buffalo calves and is characterized by severe gastrointestinal lesions, profuse diarrhea, severe dehydration, septicemia and death; in adults it can also induce termination of pregnancy. The main source of infection in the herd is asymptomatic elderly animals that release high bacterial charges through the feces. Other sources of infection are contaminated fodder and water; the infection can also be transmitted by rodents, wild birds, insects and humans. There are several serotypes of Salmonella reported in the literature capable of infecting the buffalo. This work describes an important outbreak of Salmonellosis that occurred in young subjects of a buffalo farm located in the province of Salerno. It is supported by a new serotype of Salmonella so far never described and included in the Kauffmann-White classification. This case report describes for the first-time cases of severe gastroenteritis in water buffalo calves due to a new serovar of Salmonella enterica. The study was carried out on fecal matrix collected from live water buffalo calves that showed profuse diarrhea, severe dehydration and fever, exhibiting a systemic course. Culture and molecular investigations identified the pathogens isolated from intestinal contents as two Salmonella serovars, Salmonella enterica enterica O:35 and a new serovar of Salmonella enterica. The isolates showed multi-drug resistance. Timely diagnosis associated with a targeted antimicrobial treatment were found to be sufficient for the survival and recovery of the infected animals. Herd vaccines prepared from isolated pathogens were used to prevent further deaths of the calves.

AB  - Grazing can impart long-lasting changes in vegetated ecosystems. How ecosystems respond to herbivory depends on the ecological and evolutionary histories of their foundational species. The overall ecosystem functioning and associated biodiversity depend on these responses but there is still little understanding on how the intensity and duration of herbivory interact and impact vegetated ecosystems. We experimentally tested in the field the responses of three seagrass species with distinct life history traits to increasing intensities of herbivory over time. Specifically, we assessed structural responses (i.e., canopy height and shoot density) to reflect the ecosystem state. Additionally, we used mechanistic models to assess induced and constitutive responses in the different seagrass species. Results show that seagrasses coped with herbivory differentially in relation to their life history traits. Posidonia oceanica (persistent species) was resistant and only registered declines in canopy height, whereas both canopy heigh and shoot density rapidly decreased for Cymodocea nodosa (intermediate-colonizing species) and Zostera noltei (colonizing species). Seagrasses also differed in the type of structural response, with the colonizing species experiencing reductions in shoot density, and the persistent P. oceanica registering declines in canopy height. After months of exposure to cumulative herbivory, all three species showed signs of stability. Interestingly, none of the species disappeared completely even when exposed to extreme herbivory. Mechanistic models indicate that herbivory-induced responses are a potential explanation for these patterns. This study suggests that given the long evolutionary history of herbivory, some seagrasses may be remarkably well adapted to both intense and cumulative herbivory.

AB  - Hawaiian avifaunal communities have suffered irrevocable harm and significant threats remain for extant species. It is increasingly important to monitor and document bird density to improve our understanding of how remaining species respond to changing climate and emergent stressors. In this paper, we report annual densities (2003-2020) of two native and four non-native forest bird species in a region of Hawai ' i Island lacking previous estimates. We estimated long-term population trends and short-term trajectories within a Bayesian framework. Our findings support previous studies that demonstrated the negative impact of ungulate browsing on forest bird habitat. We also note a detection of the Japanese Bush Warbler ( Cettia diphone ), a recently documented nonnative species. The forest bird population trends presented here fill a regional gap and help extend the understanding of bird populations on Hawai ' i Island.

AB  - Reef building corals are important in subtropical marine ecoregions, shaping ecosystems and providing habitats for fish and benthic species. Algal communities contribute substantially to the benthic population structure across subtropical coral reefs, however increasing algal cover on subtropical reefs is also linked to degraded ecosystems as has been shown on tropical systems. As such, the dynamics of coral-algal interactions on subtropical reefs are also likely to be an indicator of ecosystem health on subtropical ecosystems. The subtropical lagoonal coral reef of Norfolk Island within the Norfolk Marine Park has been impacted by a regime of disturbance since 2020 including flooding, sedimentation, and heat stress events. Assessing the type and extent of algal interactions with the dominant coral Pocillopora damiconis within the reef sites of Emily Bay, Slaughter Bay, and Cemetery Bay has the potential to provide insight into drivers of ecosystem decline within the reef. Similarly, photochemical efficiency, as measured by yield (Fv/Fm) using pulse amplitude modulated fluorometry, can be used to provide a measure of the health of corals on reefs during degradation events. Here we assess the extent of coral-algal interactions and health of colonies of P. damicornis prior to the onset of summertime conditions (April 2023) and during summertime conditions (December 2023). Seasonal and within site dynamics of coral-algal interactions were evident by a significant bloom of red cyanobacteria (P < 0.0001, April 2023) and Lyngbya {P < 0.01 [Slaughter Bay West (SBW)], P < 0.01 [Slaughter Bay East (SBE)], December 2023}. Within reef, variability of coral-algal interactions was most evident for Lyngbya, and on the Norfolk reef, interactions of Lyngbya with P. damincornis were found to be significantly higher at slaughter bay west (SBW 30.2% of interactions) and east (SBE 24.6% of interactions) in December 2023 than at neighboring Emily (11.6% of interactions) and Cemetery Bay (0.6% of interactions). Pulse Amplitude Modulated (PAM) fluorometry also highlighted the potential for algal interactions to influence the photochemical efficiency of Pocillopora damicornis. Benthic structure, as measured by coral-algal interactions, and coral health within the Norfolk lagoonal, both highlight the potential for anthropogenic drivers of reef decline to influence the health of the ecosystem. Further investigation is therefore necessary to elucidate the specific causes and consequences of algae linked to poor water quality, such as red cyanobacteria and Lyngbya, interacting with corals.

AB  - Soil legacy influences plant interactions with antagonists and below-ground mutualists. Plant-antagonist interactions can jeopardize plant-pollinator interactions, while soil mutualists can enhance plant-pollinator interactions. This suggests that soil legacy, either directly or mediated through plant symbionts, affects pollinators. Despite the importance of pollinators to natural and managed ecosystems, information on how soil legacy affects plant-pollinator interactions is limited. We assessed effects of soil management legacy (organic versus conventional) on floral rewards and plant interactions with wild pollinators, herbivores, beneficial fungi and pathogens. We used an observational dataset and structural equation models to evaluate hypothesized relationships between soil and pollinators, then tested observed correlations in a manipulative experiment. Organic legacy increased mycorrhizal fungal colonization and improved resistance to powdery mildew, which promoted pollinator visitation. Further, soil legacy and powdery mildew independently and interactively impacted floral traits and floral reward nutrients, which are important to pollinators. Our results indicate that pollination could be an overlooked consequence of soil legacy and suggests opportunity to develop long-term soil management plans that benefit pollinators and pollination.

AB  - Metabolomics provides an unprecedented window into diverse plant secondary metabolites that represent a potentially critical niche dimension in tropical forests underlying species coexistence. Here, we used untargeted metabolomics to evaluate chemical composition of 358 tree species and its relationship with phylogeny and variation in light environment, soil nutrients, and insect herbivore leaf damage in a tropical rainforest plot. We report no phylogenetic signal in most compound classes, indicating rapid diversification in tree metabolomes. We found that locally co-occurring species were more chemically dissimilar than random and that local chemical dispersion and metabolite diversity were associated with lower herbivory, especially that of specialist insect herbivores. Our results highlight the role of secondary metabolites in mediating plant-herbivore interactions and their potential to facilitate niche differentiation in a manner that contributes to species coexistence. Furthermore, our findings suggest that specialist herbivore pressure is an important mechanism promoting phytochemical diversity in tropical forests.
   We leveraged these innovations in untargeted metabolomics to study the foliar metabolomes of 358 tree species to evaluate the interaction between the abiotic environment, metabolite diversity, and herbivore damage due to specialist and generalist insect herbivores. Our results suggest that plant neighbourhoods with diverse secondary metabolites reduce the rate of damage by herbivores, especially specialist herbivores with limited host ranges and the potential for density-dependent impacts on plants. The role of specialist herbivores in promoting local neighbourhoods of chemically dissimilar and diverse trees suggests that chemically mediated plant-herbivore interactions represent a key component of the niche with the potential to contribute to the maintenance of tree species diversity in tropical forests.image

AB  - Domestic livestock are widespread in seasonally dry forests, likely causing forest degradation and limiting tree seedling establishment. Shrubs can play an important role in facilitating tree regeneration, by protecting trees from livestock damage and ameliorating unfavorable abiotic conditions. We aimed at disentangling the relative contribution of grazing exclusion, long-term forest conservation, and the potential facilitation effect of shrubs on the performance of saplings of the native tree Kageneckia lanceolata. We planted 400 saplings in grazed and ungrazed areas situated both in a preserved and a degraded forest. In each situation, we established planting plots in three accompanying vegetation treatments: herbs, a nonleguminous spiny shrub and a leguminous spiny shrub. Survival of 3-year-old saplings was 10-fold higher in the preserved than in the degraded forest and 2-fold higher in the ungrazed than in the grazed site. Differences in survival among accompanying vegetation treatments were much smaller than between grazing treatments. Survival significantly increased with increasing protection by shrubs only in the degraded site. Sapling growth patterns were fairly similar to survival patterns, with no growth in the degraded forest, except for limited growth under both shrubs in the ungrazed site. We conclude that, in selecting plantation sites for the study species, forest condition and grazing exclusion should be prioritized over microsite selection based on neighboring vegetation.

AB  - It is commonly expected that exotic plants experience reduced herbivory, but experimental evidence for such enemy release is still controversial. One reason for conflicting results might be that community context has rarely been accounted for, although the surrounding plant diversity may moderate enemy release. Here, we tested the effects of focal tree origin and surrounding tree diversity on herbivore abundance and leaf damage in a cross-Atlantic tree-diversity experiment in Canada and Germany. We evaluated six European tree species paired with six North American congeners in both their native and exotic range, expecting lower herbivory for the exotic tree species in each pair at each site. Such reciprocal experiments have long been called for, but have not been realized thus far. In addition to a thorough evaluation of overall enemy release effects, we tested whether enemy release effects changed with the surrounding tree diversity. Herbivore abundance was indeed consistently lower on exotics across all six tree genera (12 comparisons). This effect of exotic status was independent of the continent, phylogenetic relatedness, and surrounding tree diversity. In contrast, leaf damage associated with generalist leaf chewers was consistently higher on North American tree species. Interestingly, several species of European weevils were the most abundant leaf chewers on both continents and the dominant herbivores at the Canadian site. Thus, most observed leaf damage is likely to reflect the effect of generalist herbivores that feed heavily on plant species with which they have not evolved. At the German site, sap suckers were the dominant herbivores and showed a pattern consistent with enemy release. Taken together, the consistently lower herbivory on exotics on both continents is not purely a pattern of enemy release in the strictest sense, but to some degree additionally reflects the susceptibility of native plants to invasive herbivores. In conclusion, our cross-Atlantic study is consistent with the idea that nonnative trees have generally reduced herbivory, regardless of tree community diversity and species identity, but for different reasons depending on the dominant herbivore guild.

AB  - Climate change may modify species distribution to higher latitudes, resulting in potential changes of parasite diversity and transmission dynamics in areas where animals might not be locally adapted to these new parasite species. In addition, climate change may increase the frequency and severity of infestations of parasites that are already present in a region, by promoting the development and survival of infectious stages. Over the last decades, the number of moose (Alces americanus) infested by winter ticks (Dermacentor albipictus) has increased in eastern Canada, possibly because milder climatic conditions are increasing winter tick survival. Our main objective was to determine which meteorological variables are more likely to influence winter tick load on moose. We compiled several weather variables that may limit winter tick survival and explored which weather variables, or their interactions, influenced the winter tick load of 4,100 hunted moose from 2013 to 2019 in Qu & eacute;bec, Canada along a latitudinal gradient. Winter tick load in fall decreased with the maximum number of consecutive days in spring with average daily temperatures below -15 degrees C and with the number of consecutive days in summer with a relative humidity <80% when snowmelt in spring was earlier. These results suggest that cold temperatures and prolonged periods of low humidity, amplified by early snowmelt, limit the survival of adult female ticks and eggs, thus limiting their subsequent load on moose during the following fall. With climate change, precipitation increases and warm temperatures occur earlier in spring and are more frequent in summer. Our results suggest that climate change may have a positive long-term influence on winter tick abundance in the environment and thereby increase winter tick load on moose, which could lead to a significant decrease in moose body condition and survival.

AB  - Tick-borne diseases are a significant health problem worldwide and have become even more pervasive in Europe due to the increasing abundance of tick species, especially the common tick (Ixodes ricinus L.). Moreover, in recent years, there have been changes in tick geographical distribution, the occurrence of new tick species, and an expansion in abundance driven by changes in forest management and climate change. Therefore, this paper's objective is to determine the effect of tree species composition and forest structure on the abundance of I. ricinus in various forest stands in Czechia. Altogether, we analyzed 4195 collected ticks on 56 monitored research plots, of which 4182 individuals were I. ricinus, 4 individuals were Dermacentor reticulatus Fabricius, and 7 individuals were Haemaphysalis concinna C. L. Koch. The average density reached 1.21 ticks per 10 m2. The highest I. ricinus abundance was observed in coniferous stands (especially in Scotch pine-Pinus sylvestris L.) and forest edges with a high incidence of wild ungulate habitat signs. Contrarily, the lowest tick numbers were in clear-cut biotopes and mixed stands. Increasing vertical structure had a significant (p < 0.05) negative effect on I. ricinus abun-dance, similar to tree species diversity (richness, evenness, heterogeneity) and complex stand diversity on nymph stage abundance. Close-to-nature silviculture of mixed forests, which are resistant to climate extremes, could reduce the tick abundance, as well as the presence of tick-borne diseases compared to standard coniferous monocultures, which are receding now due to climate change. Based on this knowledge, it should be possible to predict the I. ricinus abundance under changing environmental conditions in the Central European region.

AB  - Conservation of habitat fragments, including those embedded in an urban matrix which typically support fewer species than those in other landscape contexts, is important for combatting the global extinction crisis. Because urban avoiding species are often absent from habitat fragments within an urban matrix, studies of their distributions in these habitats are rare, and therefore the mechanisms by which species are excluded from habitat fragments within an urban matrix are poorly understood. We investigated the impacts of urbanization in the matrix (e.g., noise pollution, light pollution, invasive species) on the distribution of an urban avoiding species, the swamp rabbit (Sylvilagus aquaticus) in the largest urban forest fragment in the United States. We used the location of swamp rabbit latrines and presence-background species distribution modeling to reveal the impacts of urbanization in the matrix on swamp rabbit distribution while accounting for spatial heterogeneity in naturally occurring environmental variables. Swamp rabbits used mature forest, heterogeneously structured forest, and moderately inundated forest, and they avoided areas of high (Sus scrofa) hog activity at our study site. Our findings provide novel information to conservation practitioners and urban planners attempting to conserve high priority species in habitat fragments as urbanization continues to spread.

AB  - Identifying the evolutionary drivers of sexual signal complexity is a key challenge in the study of animal communication. Among mammals, male bovids and cervids often perform elaborate gestural displays during courtship, consisting of ritualized movements of various parts of the body but the causes underlying interspecific variation in complexity of such displays remain poorly understood. Here we apply the comparative method to investigate which factors may have either promoted or constrained gestural repertoire size. We found that sexual selection was a strong predictor of gestural display complexity in male bovids and cervids. Repertoire size was positively correlated with breeding group size, an indicator of the intensity of sexual selection in males. Moreover, repertoires were larger in species adopting nonterritorial and lek breeding mating systems than in species adopting resource-defence territoriality, a finding that can be explained by more emphasis on direct benefits than indirect benefits in resource-defence systems, where male mating success may also be less skewed due to difficulty in monopolizing mates. The results also indicate that gestural repertoire size was positively correlated with the number of closely related species occurring in sympatry. This is consistent with display complexity being selected to facilitate species recognition during courtship and thereby avoid interspecific hybridization. At the same time, repertoire size was negatively associated with male body mass, possibly due to the energetic and mechanical constraints imposed on movements in very large species. By contrast, we found no evidence that the habitat drives selection for complex gestural courtship displays.
   Courtship displays include some of the most bizarre examples of animal behavior, such as the spectacular "gestural" displays of male ungulates. This study finds that courtship display complexity is under sexual selection, but that courtship displays also seem more complex in ungulates co-existing with a large number of closely related species. We propose that courtship complexity has also evolved under selection pressures to avoid hybridization, as a mechanism to aid in species recognition.

AB  - Biofertilizers have been suggested as alternatives to synthetic fertilizers, which could reduce soil degradation brought on by excessive chemical fertilization and have an impact on the bacterial diversity and community in the soil. The diversity and community of soil bacteria in tea plantations treated with wheat straw compost have, however, received relatively little attention. In this research, a two-year field trial was run to examine the effects of applying wheat straw compost on the characteristics of the soil and the quality of the tea. We also used high-throughput sequencing to investigate the response of the soil bacterial community, and Spearman's rank correlation was used to estimate the relationship between the soil bacterial community, soil characteristics, and tea quality. It was noticed that applying chemical fertilizer along with compost increased the fertility of the soil and the quality of the tea. Based on a two-year thorough data analysis, the T4 treatment (compost fertilizers 15,000 kg ha(-1) + chemical fertilizers 1050 kg ha(-1), chemical fertilizer reduction 30%) was determined to be the best group. The diversity and community makeup of soil bacteria were impacted by fertilization management. After the initial compost replacement, soils with compost had a greater bacterial richness than soils with inorganic fertilizers. After the second compost substitution, PCoA analysis revealed that compost fertilizer could be easily differentiated from chemical fertilizer. In 2019, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Patescibacteria were the most prevalent bacterial phyla. In 2020, Firmicutes and Chloroflexi overtook Bacteroidetes and Patescibacteria as the two major bacterial phyla. In addition to increasing the diversity of soil bacteria and having an impact on the bacterial population, the application of wheat straw compost mixed with chemical fertilizers can also control the soil's characteristics and the quality of the tea produced in tea plantations. So, as a fertilization way with less environmental impact, wheat straw compost fertilization can be used in tea plantations.

AB  - Natural mineral licks are ecologically valuable resources to meet the physiological needs of herbivores, particularly in temperate forests. Importantly, licking sites can harbor high anthropogenic risk for conservation-dependent herbivores through higher chance of pathogen spillover from livestock and increased levels of poaching risks. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no information on the mineral lick use in temperate forests of west Asia and the Caucasus where a few threatened deer species exist. We monitored four naturally occurring mineral licks in Central Alborz Protected Area, northern Iran during May-July 2019 using camera traps and analyzed the mineral content of the licking sites. A total of 53 independent mineral lick visits were obtained from only three species of herbivores, i.e., Caspian red deer (Cervus elaphus maral; n = 21), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus; n = 26), and wild pig (Sus scrofa; n = 6). The sex ratio of visiting Caspian red deer was highly skewed toward females (3M:18F), whereas it was more balanced in visiting roe deer (11M:15F). The species-level distribution of visits corresponded to diurnal and cathemeral for Caspian red deer and for roe deer, respectively, without any evidence of different activity curves. There was a negative nonlinear relationship between the ambient temperature and the visitation rate. Our findings showed that mineral licks are important habitat features for these large herbivores and need to be included in spatial mapping and habitat protection measures.

AB  - Urbanization and climate change are two inevitable megatrends of this century. Knowledge about the growth responses of urban trees to climate is of utmost importance towards future management of green infrastructure with the aim of a sustainable provision of the environmental ecosystem services. Using tree-ring records, this study analyzed growth response to climate by stem diameter at breast height (DBH) of 1178 trees in seven large cities worldwide, including Aesculus hippocastanum L. in Munich; Platanus x hispanica Munchh. in Paris; Quercus nigra L. in Houston; Quercus robur L. in Cape Town; Robinia pseudoacacia L. in Santiago de Chile, Munich, and Wurzburg; and Tilia cordata Mill. in Berlin, Munich, and Wurzburg. Climate was characterized following the de Martonne aridity index (DMI). Overall, trees showed an 8.3% lower DBH under arid than humid climate at the age of 100. Drought-tolerant tree species were overall not affected by climate. However, R. pseudoacacia showed a lower diameter when growing in semi-dry than humid climate. In contrast, drought-sensitive tree species were negatively affected by arid climate. Moreover, the effect of drought years on annual diameter increment was assessed. P. x hispanica and R. pseudoacacia appeared as the most drought-resistant species. The highest sensitivity to drought was detected in T. cordata and Q. robur. A. hippocastanum and Q. nigra showed a lower diameter growth during drought events, followed by a fast recovery. This study's findings may contribute to a better understanding of urban tree growth reactions to climate, aiming for sustainable planning and management of urban trees.

AB  - This study investigates the effects of individuality and harem-holding status on the acoustic parameters of rutting calls (bugles) of 14 stags of Siberian wapiti Cervus canadensis sibiricus. The stags competed for mating with hinds in a large herd, free ranging inside a fenced area with complex landscape. We considered as harem-holders the stags, which kept a harem of 5 or more hinds for at least 2 days. Of the 15 days of observations enveloping the most active rutting period, during 3 days there was only one harem in the enclosure, during 9 days two harems, during 2 days three harems and during 1 day four harems. Stag bugles displayed both individual and status-related variation. Harem-holders compared with peripheral stags had shorter bugles with higher minimum fundamental frequency. After winning a harem and changing status from harem-candidate to harem-holder, stags shortened the duration of their bugles, lowered the beginning and maximum fundamental frequency and increased the minimum fundamental frequency. Significantly higher than the levels expected by chance, discriminant analysis classified 78.9% of bugles by the correct stag status and 53.2% of bugles by the correct individual callers. Different acoustic parameters encoded the status and individuality of the bugles. Status was encoded by the duration of the start and end parts and by the beginning and end fundamental frequencies. Individuality was encoded by the maximum fundamental frequency. We discuss that rutting calls of Siberian wapiti, although individualized, do not represent vocal signatures. However, these calls reliably mark stag harem-holding status.

AB  - Upper-elevation mesic Hawaiian forests have been transformed by cattle ranching and invasive ungulates within the past 200 years. Although the flora and fauna of the Hawaiian Islands have been radically altered by the introduction of invasive species, there is a movement of agriculturalists within the islands interested in reintroducing native species and reforestation in agricultural spaces. One of the keystone species in the Hawaiian Islands is the endemic tree species Acacia koa, known for its ecosystem services and cultural importance. This species is valuable for nitrogen fixation, aquifer recharge, habitat for biodiversity and usefulness in agroforestry systems. This investigation is focused on the relationship between the tree species A. koa and the forage grass species Pennisetum clandestinum (kikuyu) in a silvopastoral context, at an elevation of 5,200 feet above sea level (1585 masl) on the island of Maui. The site of investigation is called Pu'u Makua in Hawaiian and is situated on the southwestern flank of Haleakala (10,023 feet above sea level-3055 masl) and is part of Ulupalakua Ranch. A total of n = 28 forage samples of P. clandestinum were taken in dry season, 21 of which were taken from underneath the canopies of koa trees (which had been planted in densities of 3, 4, and 6 m apart). The other seven samples were taken in full sun (where no koa trees were growing). This same protocol (sampling n = 28) was repeated in the wet season. Forage samples were then sent to the Agricultural Diagnostics Laboratory at the University of Hawai`i at Manoa for forage analysis to compare attributes of kikuyu under different canopy densities of A. koa. To better understand the leaf area index (LAI) of the canopy of various densities of A. koa, hemispheric (180 degree) photos were taken and then input into Gap Light Analyzer Software for LAI. LAI data of A. koa as well as forage attributes of P. clandestinum were then input into the statistical software InfoStat to investigate relationships between canopy cover and forage quality at each specific location. It was found through Pearson correlation analysis that there are in fact significant relationships between koa and the quality of kikuyu. Measurements of koa trees were also taken to estimate biomass and the amount of carbon sequestered within each tree. These measurements were input into allometric equations specific to koa growing on the Island of Maui that were created by the United States Forest Service. Lastly, to better understand the knowledge of ranchers on Maui, we conducted surveys regarding various ranchers' perceptions of native and non-native trees and their usefulness for silvopastoral ranching systems. Ranchers also identified various tree species that were of use (or harmful) to their operations. Since A. koa was on this list of helpful trees and conferred various ecosystem services and agroecological benefits, the incorporation of koa into ranching systems on the island of Maui is recommended in zones appropriate for its growth.

AB  - Resilience of endangered rear edge populations of cold-adapted forests in the Mediterranean basin is increasingly altered by extreme heatwave and drought pressures. It remains unknown, however, whether microclimatic variation in these isolated forests could ultimately result in large intra-population variability in the demographic responses, allowing the coexistence of contrasting declining and resilient trends across small topographic gradients. Multiple key drivers promoting spatial variability in the resilience of rear edge forests remain largely unassessed, including amplified and buffered thermal exposure induced by heatwaves along topographic gradients, and increased herbivory pressure on tree saplings in defaunated areas lacking efficient apex predators. Here we analysed whether indicators of forest resilience to global warming are strongly modulated by local-scale topographic, microclimatic and biotic conditions. We studied a protected rear edge forest of sessile oak Quercus petraea, applying a suite of 20 indicators of resilience of tree secondary growth, including multidecadal and short-term indices. We also analysed sapling recruitment success, recruit/adult ratios and sapling thermal exposure across topographic gradients. We found large within population variation in secondary growth resilience, in recruitment success and in thermal exposure of tree saplings to heatwaves, and this variability was spatially structured along small-scale topographical gradients. Multidecadal resilience indices and curves provide useful descriptors of forest vulnerability to climate warming, complementing assessments based in the analysis of short-term resilience indicators. Species-specific associations of trees with microclimatic variability are reported. Biotic factors are key in determining long-term resilience in climatically stressed rear edge forests, with strong limitation of sapling recruitment by increased roe deer and wild boar herbivory. Our results also support non-stationary effects of climate determining forest growth responses and resilience, showing increased negative effects of warming and drought over the last decades in declining stands. Synthesis. Our findings do not support scenarios predicting spatially homogeneous distributional shifts and limited resilience in rear edge populations, and are more supportive of scenarios including spatially heterogeneous responses, characterised with contrasting intra-population trends of forest resilience. We conclude that forest resilience responses to climate warming are strongly modulated by local-scale microclimatic, topographic and biotic factors. Accurate predictions of forest responses to changes in climate would therefore largely benefit from the integration of local-scale abiotic and biotic factors.

AB  - Altered interactions between pathogens, their hosts and vectors have potential consequences for human disease risk. Notably, tick-borne pathogens, many of which are associated with growing deer abundance, show global increasing prevalence and pose increasing challenges for disease prevention. Human activities can largely affect the patterns of deer space-use and can therefore be potential management tools to alleviate human-wildlife conflicts. Here, we tested how deer space-use patterns are influenced by human recreational activities, and how this in turn affects the spatial distribution of the sheep tick (Ixodes ricinus), a relevant disease vector of zoonoses such as Lyme borrelioses. We compared deer dropping and questing tick density on transects near (20 m) and further away from(100 m) forest trails that were either frequently used (open for recreation) or infrequently used (closed for recreation, but used by park managers). In contrast to infrequently used trails, deer dropping density was 31% lower near (20 m) than further away from (100 m) frequently used trails. Similarly, ticks were 62% less abundant near (20 m) frequently used trails compared to further away from (100 m) these trails, while this decline in tick numbers was only 14% near infrequently used trails. The avoidance by deer of areas close to human-used trails was thus associated with a similar reduction in questing tick density near these trails. As tick abundance generally correlates to pathogen prevalence, the use of trails for recreation may reduce tick-borne disease risk for humans on and near these trails. Our study reveals an unexplored effect of human activities on ecosystems and how this knowledge could be potentially used to mitigate zoonotic disease risk.

AB  - Climate forecasts and disturbance mapping increasingly inform strategies for ecological restoration practices. Our study objectives were to understand how a postfire rehabilitation seed mix responds to fire, seeding timing, and changes in fall precipitation timing due to climate change. We planted seeds commonly used in the Great Basin Desert of North America on soil cores in a randomized block design. We imposed two experimental treatments, experimental fire (burned seedbeds or unburned seedbeds) and timing of seeding with simulated precipitation (early September vs. mid-October) in a two-way factorial design. We measured seedling emergence (1 month posttreatment), plant density, biomass, and seed production. Early seeding and precipitation reduced seedling emergence over 2-fold but increased total plant density (3-fold), biomass (13-fold), and seed production (140-fold) compared to delayed seeding and precipitation applications. Antelope bitterbrush was the only species with a negative response to early seeding and precipitation, with a decrease in both density and biomass (over 2-fold) by the end of the study. Burned seedbeds overall had little effect on measured outcomes for the total plant community. Burned seedbeds decreased forb seedling emergence 2-fold and alfalfa and Lewis blue flax density almost 3-fold but increased overall forb seed production 7-fold while other species and functional groups had minimal responses. Earlier seeding and precipitation interacted with the effects of burned seedbeds to increase biomass of Wyoming big sagebrush and western yarrow. The positive response of species to earlier fall seeding and precipitation underscores the importance of adapting our restoration practices for changing climate conditions.

AB  - Supporting the recovery of large carnivores is a popular yet challenging endeavour. Estuarine crocodiles in Australia are a large carnivore conservation success story, with the population having extensively recovered from past heavy exploitation. Here, we explored if dietary changes had accompanied this large population recovery by comparing the isotopes delta C-13 and delta N-15 in bones of crocodiles sampled 40 to 55 years ago (small population) with bones from contemporary individuals (large population). We found that delta C-13 and delta N-15 values were significantly lower in contemporary crocodiles than in the historical cohort, inferring a shift in prey preference away from marine and into terrestrial food webs. We propose that an increase in intraspecific competition within the recovering crocodile population, alongside an increased abundance of feral ungulates occupying the floodplains, may have resulted in the crocodile population shifting to feed predominantly upon terrestrial food sources. The number of feral pigs consumed to sustain and grow crocodile biomass may help suppress pig population growth and increase the flow of terrestrially derived nutrients into aquatic ecosystems. The study highlights the significance of prey availability in contributing to large carnivore population recovery.

AB  - Sea urchins are considered the most important grazers in Mediterranean shallow sublittoral rocky reef ecosystems, but fish can also have an important role in overgrazing and the reduction of habitat complexity. In this study, the trophic behavior of fish was recorded when provided access to experimental surfaces with increased macroalgal biomass and associated benthic fauna, created by herbivore exclusion cages. After a sufficient period for substantial algal growth, the cages were removed and the activity of fish on these surfaces was recorded for 3 h by an automated photographic camera system. Control surfaces with no restriction on grazers were defined on similar substrates for comparison. To quantify the effects of fish feeding activity on macroalgal coverage, photographic samples were taken immediately after the opening of the cages and after each 3 h recording. The response of fish when the cages were removed was immediate and intense. Feeding activity by 13 different fish species was recorded in total, of which the most frequent were the omnivores Diplodus vulgaris, Coris julis and Thalassoma pavo, and to a lesser extent the herbivore Sarpa salpa. The coverage of erect algae was substantially decreased on the experimental surfaces due to fish feeding activity. The algae were either directly consumed by the fish or cut off when the fish were feeding on macroinvertebrates. We conclude that in addition to grazing by herbivores, fish of higher trophic levels can also significantly affect macroalgal assemblages and restrict the recovery of erect algae in overgrazed reefs where prey is scarce.

AB  - Prince Mohammed bin Salman Royal Reserve (PMBSRR or the Reserve) is located in the northwest of Saudi Arabia and covers an area of 24,500 km2 of both marine and terrestrial ecosystems. Bat surveys have been undertaken between 2022 and 2024 across PMBSRR as part of the Reserve's groundbreaking conservation efforts and this is the first published checklist of the bat species present within the Reserve. Survey methods included bat capture, roost inspection, and acoustic recordings. Tissue and faecal samples were taken during the surveys and compared to a global database to confirm the species present. The survey results confirmed the presence of 18 species belonging to 14 genera of eight families. This research has greatly expanded our knowledge on the diversity of bats within the Kingdom, increasing the reported bat species in the Tabuk region by seven species, with the addition of Rhyneptesicus nasutus, Rhinolophus hipposideros, Nycteris thebaica, Tadarida aegyptiaca, Rhinopoma microphyllum, Taphozous nudiventris, and Taphozous perforatus and increasing the number of species within Saudi Arabia by one species, with the addition of Vansonia rueppellii.

AB  - Semipermeable membrane-covered composting is one of the most commonly used composting technologies in northeast China, but its humification process is not yet well understood. This study employed a semipermeable membrane-covered composting system to detect the organic matter humification and bacterial community evolution patterns over the course of agricultural waste composting. Variations in physicochemical properties, humus composition, and bacterial communities were studied. The results suggested that membrane covering improved humic acid (HA) content and degree of polymerization (DP) by 9.28% and 21.57%, respectively. Bacterial analysis indicated that membrane covering reduced bacterial richness and increased bacterial diversity. Membrane covering mainly affected the bacterial community structure during thermophilic period of composting. RDA analysis revealed that membrane covering may affect the bacterial community by altering the physicochemical properties such as moisture content. Correlation analysis showed that membrane covering activated the dominant genera Saccharomonospora and Planktosalinus to participate in the formation of HS and HA in composting, thus promoting HS formation and its structural complexity. Membrane covering significantly reduced microbial metabolism during the cooling phase of composting.

AB  - Herbivory of insular plant communities by introduced animals has been widely studied for decades. Though their diet mainly includes palatable and highly nutritive species, goats will also eat plants that are toxic to other animals. Thus, severe affection of toxic species may indicate high herbivore pressure or a low quality of vegetative food. To evaluate whether herbivory damage to low-palatability shrubs could give us information about feral goat pressure on vegetation, we assessed the predation impact of feral goats on the shrub Euphorbia dendroides (Euphorbiaceae) on Mallorca Island (Spain). We aimed to investigate whether goats consume juvenile E. dendroides and affect their population structure and determine if the plants increase the concentrations of toxic compounds as an adaptation to herbivory. Overall, two experimental plots and analysis of eleven natural populations indicated E. dendroides is affected by ungulates and that the population structure change with the presence of feral goats. Euphorbia dendroides could be used as an ecological indicator to determine the extent of ungulate damage to vegetation or indicate poor food availability, and thus inform the maintenance of optimal animal populations. Depending on the management objective for the territory, E. dendroides could be used as an ecological indicator to determine the extent of ungulate damage to vegetation or indicate poor food availability for animals, and thus inform the maintenance of optimal animal populations.

AB  - Successful conservation hinges on the reliable prediction and prioritisation of population core habitats and dispersal corridors. However, reliance on single-species connectivity has produced mixed results and, in most cases, failed to protect other species under the appealing but often unfulfilled guise of umbrella protection. The main objectives of this study were: (1) to identify core habitats and dispersal corridors for population connectivity of 15 terrestrial mammal species across Bhutan, (2) to identify indicator species of wildlife connectivity, (3) to prioritise core areas and dispersal corridors for the focal umbrella and indicator species, (4) to develop composite multispecies connectivity maps and evaluate the effectiveness of the existing protected area network. We used kernel density (KD) to identify core habitat areas and factorial least-cost path (LCP) to map dispersal corridors. We used correlation and cluster analyses to identify umbrella and indicator species, and quantitative ranking to prioritise core areas and corridors for these focal species. Finally, we produced maps of multispecies core areas and corridors, and identified gaps in the existing protected area network (PAN). We found that ungulates were generally more effective than carnivores in serving as umbrella species for core habitat protection, with Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) emerging as the most effective umbrella for core habitats and muntjac (Muntiacus muntjac) for dispersal corridors. We identified six focal connectivity indicator species in Bhutan: tiger (Panthera tigris), dhole (Cuon alpinus), clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa), Asiatic black bear (Ursus thibetanus), Asian elephant, and sambar deer (Rusa unicolor). Most indicator species' core areas and dispersal corridors outside the PAN were in southern Bhutan, indicating opportunities for increased multispecies connectivity through expanding protected area network in this region. A total of 40% of multispecies core areas and 24% of dispersal corridors were under PAN, with large parts of Bhutan offering suitable core areas and corridors for multispecies conservation. Core areas and corridors of the 15 considered species only partially overlapped, stressing the importance of multi-species consideration in designating wildlife corridors.

AB  - Expansion of urban areas, landscape transformation and increasing human outdoor activities strongly affect wildlife behaviour. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in particular led to drastic changes in human behaviour, exposing wildlife around the world to either reduced or increased human presence, potentially altering animal behaviour. Here, we investigate behavioural responses of wild boar (Sus scrofa) to changing numbers of human visitors to a suburban forest near Prague, Czech Republic, during the first 2.5 years of the COVID-19 epidemic (April 2019-November 2021). We used bio-logging and movement data of 63 GPS-collared wild boar and human visitation data based on an automatic counter installed in the field. We hypothesised that higher levels of human leisure activity will have a disturbing effect on wild boar behaviour manifested in increased movements and ranging, energy spent, and disrupted sleep patterns. Interestingly, whilst the number of people visiting the forest varied by two orders of magnitude (from 36 to 3431 people weekly), even high levels of human presence (>2000 visitors per week) did not affect weekly distance travelled, home range size, and maximum displacement of wild boar. Instead, individuals spent 41 % more energy at high levels of human presence (>2000 visitors per week), with more erratic sleep patterns, characterised by shorter and more frequent sleeping bouts. Our results highlight multifaceted effects of increased human activities ('anthropulses'), such as those related to COVID-19 countermeasures, on animal behaviour. High human pressure may not affect animal movements or habitat use, especially in highly adaptable species such as wild boar, but may dis-rupt animal activity rhythms, with potentially detrimental fitness consequences. Such subtle behavioural responses can be overlooked if using only standard tracking technology.

AB  - Understanding the responses of non-native plants to climate change while accounting for biotic interactions is key to predicting and mitigating future invasion risks. Non-native invasive plants may benefit from or decline in the face of climate change, relative to native competitors. Non-native plants might also suffer less than native plants from natural enemies such as herbivores, which could give non-natives a competitive advantage. However, we lack an understanding of how non-native plants will compete with native plants in a warming climate, while accounting for the effects of herbivore pressure. To test the potential interactions between warming, herbivore pressure and competition, we set up a common-garden experiment in Trondheim, Norway, using five non-native plants growing either alone or in competition with a native plant community. These plants were subjected to herbivore exclusion and artificial warming treatments, using open-top chambers. We found that under warming, three non-native species had greater biomass and all five species were taller than when grown without warming. Competition with native species reduced the biomass of three non-native species and herbivore exclusion resulted in taller plants for three non-native species. Native community biomass was not affected by either warming or herbivore exclusion. Furthermore, the native community was not affected by competition with any non-native plant except Centaurea montana, which resulted in lower native community biomass, suggesting that C. montana is likely to be the most detrimental of these non-native species to native communities. Competition with natives reduced the positive effects of warming on biomass for only one species, Alchemilla mollis. Our study strongly suggests that a warming climate may benefit invasive plants more than native plants, but for some species these effects will be mediated by biotic interactions in idiosyncratic ways, depending on the identity of both native and non-native species. This will present a challenge to predicting plant invasion success under climate change while accounting for biotic interactions.

AB  - Understanding the interactive effects of multiple environmental stressors on biological communities is crucial for effective environmental management and biodiversity conservation. Here, we present the results of an outdoor mesocosm experiment examining how an aquatic food web responds to the individual and combined effects of climate warming, heat waves, nutrient enrichment, and herbicide exposure. To assess ecosystem functioning, we examined energy flow, using stable isotope analysis integrated with the bioenergetics food web approach to quantify energy fluxes among trophic levels. Our results revealed that the combined effects of these stressors altered the pattern of energy fluxes within the food web. Under warming conditions, there was an increase in energy flux from producers and primary consumers to secondary consumers. However, we did not observe a significant increase in energy flux in primary consumers, potentially due to enhanced top-down control. Nutrient enrichment increased energy flux from producers to higher trophic levels while simultaneously decreasing detrital energy flux. Herbicide exposure did not significantly affect herbivory energy flux but did reduce detritivory energy flux, particularly from detritus to primary consumers. The interactive effects we observed were primarily antagonistic or additive, although we also detected reversed and synergistic effects. The responses to multiple stressors varied across different energy flow pathways, leading to an asymmetric response. Furthermore, our results also revealed significant differences in the effects of constant warming and heat waves, either alone or in combination with water pollution. The asymmetric response of energy flow pathways and the prevalence of antagonistic effects present significant challenges for ecosystem restoration. Together, our findings provide novel and clear evidence of the complex mechanisms by which the coexistence of stressors can differently affect the pathways of energy flux across trophic levels in aquatic ecosystems. Regulatory strategies for ecosystems should comprehensively consider responses at multi-trophic levels using a network perspective, especially in the face of combinations of global and local stressors.

AB  - The range of tularemia, a disease caused by the bacterium Francisella tularensis, may expand alongside climate change in the North. Transmission occurs via biting arthropods, contaminated water sources, infected animal tissues and fluids and even aerosolized bacteria. Little research has been published on F. tularensis in northern Canada. We investigated whether Rangifer (caribou and reindeer) in Canada and Alaska are exposed to F. tularensis, , as they provide significant cultural and subsistence value. From 2016 to 2020, 336 serum samples were collected from Rangifer across 17 herds, including captive reindeer in Alaska (n n = 30) and wild caribou across Canada (n n = 306) during collaring or harvesting efforts. Using a microagglutination test, we detected antibodies against F. tularensis in 7% of captive reindeer (CI95 2-21), 6% of migratory tundra caribou (CI95 4-11) and 10% of mountain woodland caribou (CI95 6-17), with the highest seroprevalence observed in animals from Nunavut (17%) and British Columbia, Canada (18%). Ten of the herds (n= 10/17; 59%) had at least one positive animal. Evidence of exposure to F. tularensis indicates that further studies are needed to characterize sources of transmission for Rangifer species and any potential health effects following infection.

AB  - The increased use of antler restrictions by state game agencies has led to a focus on antlers by the hunting public, particularly the potential for an association between genetics and antler characteristics. We analyzed microsatellite data from 1231 male white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) from three states (Oklahoma, Mississippi, and Texas) within USA to determine if genetic relatedness, internal relatedness (IR), homozygosity weighted by locus (HL), or correlations among uniting gametes (F-is) influenced total antler points, antler score, non-typical points or antler malformations. Within each location, deer in the lower and upper quartile intervals for number of antler points and score were unrelated (95% CI included 0 or was <0) and relatively heterozygous for four measures of inbreeding. Antler score and points were positively influenced by age but negatively influenced by IR and HL, except for antler score in Mississippi. Relatedness, HL, IR and F-is did not differ between groups of deer with and without antler malformations. Perceived differences in antler quality do not appear to be affected by heterozygosity or a result of close inbreeding because we found deer were unrelated and measures of inbreeding and genome-wide heterozygosity were not correlated with antler characteristics.

AB  - This study aimed at assessing haplotype diversity and population dynamics of three Congolese indigenous goat populations that included Kasai goat (KG), small goat (SG), and dwarf goat (DG) of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The 1169 bp d-loop region of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was sequenced for 339 Congolese indigenous goats. The total length of sequences was used to generate the haplotypes and evaluate their diversities, whereas the hypervariable region (HVI, 453 bp) was analyzed to define the maternal variation and the demographic dynamic. A total of 568 segregating sites that generated 192 haplotypes were observed from the entire d-loop region (1169 bp d-loop). Phylogenetic analyses using reference haplotypes from the six globally defined goat mtDNA haplogroups showed that all the three Congolese indigenous goat populations studied clustered into the dominant haplogroup A, as revealed by the neighbor-joining (NJ) tree and median-joining (MJ) network. Nine haplotypes were shared between the studied goats and goat populations from Pakistan (1 haplotype), Kenya, Ethiopia and Algeria (1 haplotype), Zimbabwe (1 haplotype), Cameroon (3 haplotypes), and Mozambique (3 haplotypes). The population pairwise analysis (F-ST) indicated a weak differentiation between the Congolese indigenous goat populations. Negative and significant (p-value <.05) values for Fu's Fs (-20.418) and Tajima's (-2.189) tests showed the expansion in the history of the three Congolese indigenous goat populations. These results suggest a weak differentiation and a single maternal origin for the studied goats. This information will contribute to the improvement of the management strategies and long-term conservation of indigenous goats in DRC.

AB  - Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a prion disease that infects cervid species by direct and environmental transmission and is invariably fatal. CWD spread can be promoted by the attraction of animals to "hotspots" such as hay bales and grain bags stored in fields and at farm sites. The density and location of hotspots may impact contact rates. We used an individual-based movement model of mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) to investigate the effects of density and configuration of hotspots (hereafter artificial attractants, AA) on contact rates at a constant density of 1 deer/km2 during winter. The model tracks when two deer from the same or different groups come into contact under 6 AA densities (0-1 AA/km2) and 6 AA configurations. We compared placing AA randomly versus clustered around farms, and removing them randomly versus biased by proximity to preferred habitat. Overall, the number of unique contacts per individual and the number of unique deer visiting an AA increased, and the number of AAs used by each deer decreased as AA density declined. Selectively removing field attractants near preferred habitat resulted in a larger increase in contacts per deer, with deer contacting more and different individuals, fewer deer using the remaining AA, and fewer visits per AA than random removal. There was a greater increase in contact rates when reducing AA density at farms by randomly removing all AA at a farm compared to randomly removing individual AA across farms. Deer responses to AA removal may not be as straightforward as originally believed. Deer contacts may increase, not decrease, with AA removal because deer are attracted to the remaining AA. Under moderate deer densities, AA removal may require a broad-scale, "all or nothing" approach to prevent deer from concentrating at remaining AA, but concomitantly lowering deer density needs further assessment.

AB  - Livestock farming is an activity closely linked to the environment, directly affecting its surrounding ecosystem while utilizing the natural resources it provides. Accordingly, it is essential to study these production systems in order to implement more sustainable models that allow for a balance between socioeconomic and environmental factors. The main objective of this study was to analyze the environmental impact of nine different dairy goat production systems located in northern Extremadura, Spain. The selected farms ranged from extensive and organic production models to more intensive ones. The methodology used was a life cycle assessment (LCA) to calculate the carbon footprint, following the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) guidelines. A comprehensive evaluation of emissions was conducted, considering the different global warming potentials (GWPs) established by the IPCC for the main gases associated with livestock farming. In addition, carbon sequestration (Cseq) was incorporated into the analysis to assess the contribution of goat farming to climate change mitigation based on its production management. CH4 emissions were the main source (44-67%) of GHGs, followed by CO2 from inputs (20-48%), and finally N2O (7-13%). A trend was observed linking increased CH4 emissions to more extensive and less productive livestock systems. However, the significant role of soil as a carbon sink was highlighted, as it greatly offsets the emissions produced, demonstrating its potential mitigation due to Cseq, particularly in more extensive models. The importance of this factor suggests that it should be taken into account in such studies to provide a realistic view of the final impact of each production system.

AB  - Vegetation restoration may increase the soil organic carbon stock (SOCS) but decrease the soil water storage (SWS) of terrestrial ecosystems in arid and semiarid regions. To guarantee the sustainability of restoration, it is critical to evaluate the coupling interaction of SOCS and SWS. Here, we examined the spatial distributions of SOCS and SWS across a 0-200 cm soil profile in a grassland, forestland and shrubland on the Loess Plateau and determined the driving factors that affected their variations. Our results showed that SOCS and SWS varied across the 0-200 cm soil profile and considerably accumulated in the deep soil layers (100-200 cm). In comparison to SOCS, SWS generally had higher relative benefits in most studied plant communities, which ensured sustainable restoration. In addition, land use played a less important role than local environmental conditions in determining the variations in SOCS and SWS. Specifically, the interaction between SOCS and SWS was mainly strong in the surface soil layers (0-20 cm). Topography was a predominant factor that affected SOCS and SWS in the deep soil layers (100-200 cm), while soil texture was a stable driving factor influencing their variations across the whole soil profile (0-200 cm). Given the low moisture consumption of grasslands and the lowest root mean square deviation (RMSD) of Hippophae rhamnoides, we proposed an advanced scenario for ecological restoration on the Loess Plateau: establishing reasonably large Hippophae rhamnoides patches with fewer edges in a contiguous grassland matrix. Furthermore, this scenario should be tailored to local environmental conditions, such as soil water, texture and topography, followed by natural vegetation succession.

AB  - Background and aims: Parque Interjurisdiccional Marino Costero Patagonia Austral is a protected area that is home to incredible biodiversity. Within the Park is Isla Valdes, an island whose vegetation is unknown and where European rabbits, an invasive herbivorous specie, have been introduced. The aims of this work are: a) to know the floristic richness of Isla Valdes; b) to evaluate the conservation status of its flora; c) to identify and characterize the different vegetation units; d) to analyze the differences and their possible causes between the vegetation units. M&M: the island was traveled around establishing the different vegetation units. Three transects were made in each one, using the Floristic -Holistic Method for arid, semiarid, and subhumid areas. With the data obtained, vegetation structure and ecological parameters were calculated, a list of the floristic composition was drawn up, each vegetation unit was described, and the current state of conservation of the vegetation was evaluated. Results: 74 species were identified, distributed in 31 botanical families. Five vegetation units with different floristic compositions and plant physiognomy were identified. 12 species are included in Argentina's preliminary red list of endemic plants, and two species have international conservation status (IUCN red list and CITES). Conclusions: The work constitutes the first floristic list of Isla Valdes, and provides important information for management decisions.

AB  - Increasing nitrogen deposition threatens many grassland species with local extinction. In addition to the direct effects of nitrogen deposition, nitrogen can indirectly affect plant populations via phenotypic shifts in plant traits that influence plant susceptibility to herbivory. Here, I test how herbivory varies across an experimental nitrogen gradient and whether differences in susceptibility to herbivory might explain patterns of local species loss. Specifically, I examine how increasing nitrogen availability in a restored prairie influences leaf traits and subsequent herbivory (by leaf-chewers like insects/small mammals versus deer) and the severity of herbivore damage on confamiliar pairs of extirpated versus extant species from Michigan prairies. Nitrogen increased herbivory by both leaf-chewers and deer as well as herbivore damage (proportion of leaves damaged). Leaf hairiness and specific leaf area affected patterns of herbivory following nitrogen addition, although patterns varied between extirpated vs. extant taxa and herbivory type. Nitrogen increased leaf hairiness. At high levels of nitrogen addition, hairy extant plants experienced less herbivory and damage than smooth-leaved plants. In contrast, hairy extirpated plants were more likely to experience leaf-chewer herbivory. Extirpated plants with thin leaves (high specific leaf area) were less likely to experience leaf-chewer herbivory; the opposite was true for extant species. Generally, extant species experienced more herbivory than locally extirpated species, particularly at high levels of nitrogen addition, suggesting that increasing herbivory under nutrient addition likely does not influence extirpation in this system. This study suggests that trait-mediated responses to nitrogen addition and herbivory differ between extant and extirpated species.

AB  - Hunting and trapping have been used to manage wild boar populations. Previous studies have reported the sex-age class characteristics of wild boars when hunted by gun, but the details of mortality rates by trapping are unclear. In this study, we aimed to evaluate wild boar death trends and mortality rates based on tag recovery data to assess the effectiveness of trapping for managing wild boar populations. In Japan, snare and box traps are frequently used for hunting and culling wild boar. A sex difference in trapping death trends was observed, showing that trapping pressure was higher in juvenile and yearling males and juvenile females. The annual mortality rate by trapping was the highest in juveniles (both males and females) at 0.73, and lowest in adult females at 0.54. Our findings suggest that trapping management may be less effective in reproductive females. Therefore, a strategic population management approach that combines trapping with other management measures is required to reduce wild boar populations effectively.

AB  - A comprehensive understanding of sociality in wildlife is vital to optimizing conservation and management efforts. However, sociality is complicated, especially for widely distributed species that exhibit substantive behavioral plasticity. Invasive wild pigs (Sus scrofa), often representing hybrids of European wild boar and domestic pigs, are among the most adaptable and widely distributed large mammals. The social structure of wild pigs is believed to be similar to European wild boar, consisting of matriarchal groups (sounders) and solitary males. However, wild pig social structure is understudied and largely limited to visual observations. Using a hierarchical approach, we incorporated genomic tools to describe wild pig social group composition in two disparate ecoregions within their invaded range in North America. The most common social unit was sounders, which are characterized as the association of two or more breeding-aged wild pigs with or without dependent offspring. In addition to sounders, pseudo-solitary females and male-dominated bachelor groups were observed at a greater frequency than previously reported. Though primarily composed of close female kin, some sounders included unrelated females. Bachelor groups were predominantly composed of young, dispersal-aged males and almost always included only close kin. Collectively, our study suggests social organization of wild pigs in their invaded range is similar to that observed among wild boar but is complex, dynamic, and likely variable across invaded habitats.

AB  - Large carnivores are making remarkable comebacks in Europe, but how this affects human-wildlife conflict remains unclear. Rebounding carnivore populations lead to increasing livestock depredation, which in turn leads to greater economic losses for farmers. However, returning carnivores could also influence the behavior of wild ungulates, which are themselves responsible for major crop damage and associated economic losses. Here, we exploit the natural experiment of a rebounding wolf population in the Italian Apennines to study how this affected both types of human-wildlife conflic. We used large datasets of wolf occurrences (n = 351), livestock depredation events (n = 165), and crop damage events by wild boar (n = 3442) to independently model the determinants of livestock depredation and crop damage distribution in relation to wolf habitat suitability over a ten-year period of increasing wolf numbers. These analyses yielded two major insights. First, livestock depredations were mainly related to insufficient prevention measures (e.g. lacking fencing) rather than landscape context, providing a clear pathway to conflict mitigation. Second, crop damage decreased in areas of higher wolf habitat suitability and became more likely in areas of lower wolf habitat suitability, closer to settlements. This suggests increasing predation pressure forces wild boars to avoid the most suitable wolf habitat, leading to a redistribution of crop damage in the landscape. More generally, our study highlights complex human-wildlife interactions as large carnivores recover in human-dominated landscapes, suggesting that multiple, cooccurring conflicts need to be assessed jointly and adaptively in order to foster coexistence between humans and wildlife.

AB  - The Buffalo National River (BNR), on karst terrain in Arkansas, is considered an extraordinary water resource. Water collected in Spring 2017 along BNR was metagenomically analyzed using 16S rDNA, and for 17 months (5/2017-11/2018), bacterial responses were measured in relation to nutrients sampled along a stretch of BNR near a concentrated animal feed operation (CAFO) on Big Creek. Because cell count and esterase activity can increase proportionally with organic enrichment, they were hypothesized to be elevated near the CAFO. Counts (colony forming units; CFUs) were different among sites for 73 % of the months; Big Creek generated highest CFUs 27 % of the time, with the closest downstream site at 13.3 %. Esterase activity was different among sites 94 % of the time, with Big Creek exhibiting lowest activity 71 % of the time. Over the months, activity was similar across sites at similar to 70 % active, except at Big Creek (56 %). The alpha-diversity of BNR microbial consortia near a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and the CAFO was related to distance from the WWTP and CAFO. The inverse relationship between high CFUs and low esterase activity at Big Creek (r = -0.71) actuated in vitro exposures of bacteria to organic wastewater contaminants (OWC) previously identified in the watershed. Exponential-phase Escherichia coli (stock strain), Streptococcus suis (avirulent, from swine), and S. dysgalactiae (virulent, from silver carp, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) were incubated with atrazine, pharmaceuticals (17 alpha-ethynylestradiol and trenbolone), and antimicrobials (tylosin and butylparaben). Bacteria were differentially responsive. Activity varied with exposure time and OWC type, but not concentration; atrazine decreased it most. Taken together - the metagenomic taxonomic similarities along BNR, slightly higher bacterial growth and lower bacterial esterase at the CAFO, and the lab exposures of bacterial strains showing that OWC altered metabolism - the results indicated that bioactive OWC entering the watershed can strongly influence microbial processes in the aquatic ecosystem.

AB  - Endozoochory in dry tropical forests is a phenomenon that ensures species perpetuation, due its positive effects on seed germination and plant establishment. However, the mechanisms behind this germinative success are poorly understood. This study aimed to analyze the ingestion of Libidibia ferrea and Senna spectabilis seeds by goats and sheep and the effect on dormancy and morphophysiological qualities. Four hundred seeds of each species were provided in the feed base of goats and sheep, followed by an evaluation of the recovery rate, germination (%), germination speed index, mean germination time, shoot and root length, and seedlings dry mass. The recovery of seeds from sheep occurred more rapidly (within 48 hours for both species) in the first hours after ingestion, while for goats, this process occurred slowly and over a more extended period, which may potentially favor the perpetuation of the species within the habitat. To elucidate the study, it was noted that vigor variables, dry mass, and germination speed index contribute most to the data explanation for L. ferrea seeds, whereas for S. spectabilis seeds, germination showed intermediate contribution, suggesting its relevant role in this species. Dormancy of L. ferrea and S. spectabilis seeds can be broken when ingested by goats and sheep, indicating that passage of the seeds through the digestive system enhances their physiological quality in comparison those that were not ingested by these animals.

AB  - Life history trade-offs are ubiquitous across species and place constraints on the timing of life history events, including the optimal age at first reproduction. However, studies on lifetime breeding success of male mammals are rare due to sex-biased dispersal and the requirement for genetic paternity inferences. We studied the correlates and apparent fitness consequences of early life reproduction among males in a free-living population of Soay sheep (Ovis aries) on St Kilda, Scotland. We investigated the factors associated with early breeding success and the apparent consequences of early success for survival and future reproduction. We used genetic paternity inferences, population data, and individual morphology measurements collected over 30 years. We found that individuals born in years with low-density population size had the highest early life breeding success and singletons were more likely to be successful than twins. Individuals that bred successfully at 7 months were more likely to survive their first winter. For individuals that survived their first winter, early breeding success was not associated with later breeding success. As individual heterogeneity affects breeding success, we believe that variation in individual quality masks the costs of early reproduction in this population. Our findings provide no evidence for selection for delayed age at reproduction in male Soay sheep.

AB  - The impacts of ungulate browsing on forested ecosystems largely stem from events happening at the plant scale, and plant-level responses to browsing vary according to factors including light environment and browsing intensity, frequency, and timing. Northern white-cedar (Thuja occidentalis), a slow-growing, shade tolerant, and highly browse-selected species, is experiencing regeneration problems in large part due to heavy browsing pressure by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). Although survival and recovery following browsing are essential for cedar recruitment, we know little about the reactions of individual cedar plants to browsing. Our objective was to evaluate the impact of browsing, as emulated by clipping, on cedar height, diameter, and branch growth. We applied combinations of shading (full sun or 50% sun) and clipping timing (early growth or dormancy), intensity (apex or 50% previous year's growth), and frequency (one or two years) to planted cedar seedlings. Partially shaded trees had systematically faster height, diameter and branch growth than trees in full sun. Clipping timing had no effect on height or branch growth but growing season clipping negatively affected diameter growth. Clipping frequency had no detectable effect on cedar growth. We observed aboveground growth compensation except under high clipping intensity. We confirm the expected browse tolerance of cedar and its high recovery potential following low to moderate browsing pressure. We underline that higher clipping intensities or longer-term browsing pressure than those we tested, which can be expected in areas with heavy, sustained browsing pressure, could negatively impact cedar's recovery potential.

AB  - Multi-colony studies of breeding seabirds may provide insights into the mechanistic links between large-scale climate variability and local changes in prey availability. In the North Pacific, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) is a dominant climate index characterized by contrasting patterns in sea surface temperature between the western and eastern North Pacific. To examine how inter-annual variability in the PDO affects rhinoceros auklets Cerorhinca monocerata across the North Pacific, we measured inter-annual changes in nutritional stress (as reflected in plasma levels of corticosterone) of adults breeding on 5 colonies (2 and 3 colonies from the western and eastern Pacific, respectively). We also examined concurrent changes in mass and energy content of food loads delivered to chicks. We found that higher summer PDO values were associated with increased corticosterone levels and lower mass and energy contents of the food loads in both the western and eastern North Pacific colonies. Results indicated that oceanographic conditions during higher PDO values induced local changes in forage fish communities, leading to reduced prey availability, which, in turn, increased the nutritional stress of breeding birds. We conclude that the higher summer PDO index in recent years was associated with food-poor conditions for breeding rhinoceros auklets across their reproductive range, and prolonged periods of high summer PDO may be detrimental to the populations of this seabird species. Our results highlight the complexity of the mechanisms of how large-scale climate variability affects seabirds with a large geographical distribution.

AB  - The Atlantic Forest of South America has undergone major changes due to urban and agriculture/pasture extension, resulting in a highly fragmented biome. Protected areas, created to ensure the biodiversity conservation of this biome, need to be connected for long-term landscape integrity. We aimed to quantify connectivity among protected areas in the south-east Atlantic Forest using two species with different environmental requirements: a threatened species with high requirements, the jaguar Panthera onca; and an exotic species with low requirements, the wild pig Sus scrofa. Our methods included expert opinion, and Circuitscape and least-cost-path analyses. We hypothesized that the patchy and altered landscape would not support the connectivity of jaguars but would allow wild pigs to transit. In fact, we found connectivity for both species, but there were more connectivity opportunities for wild pigs. The connection between Serra do Mar (and Serra do Mar state park) and Serra da Mantiqueira (Mantiqueira Mosaic) is narrow but possible to traverse through some protected areas of sustainable use and private reserves, highlighting the importance of these to structural landscape connectivity for the studied species in this region. The same connectivity that allows the transit of the native jaguar with high environmental requirements also allows the invasive wild pig to move through the landscape, which is worrisome.

AB  - Motion-sensitive cameras are popular as non-invasive monitoring tools, and several methods have been developed to estimate population densities from camera data. These methods frequently rely on auxiliary movement data including the distance traveled by an individual in a day and the proportion of the day that an animal spends moving when individual recognition is not possible. The estimation of these movement parameters is time-consuming, which could limit the applicability of cameras to estimate population density. To investigate the relevance of measuring movement parameters for the target population, we monitored 54 wildlife populations of red deer (Cervus elaphus), fallow deer (Dama dama), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), wild boar (Sus scrofa), and red fox (Vulpes vulpes) in different seasons through Europe with cameras. We estimated 91-day ranges and activity levels. We fitted mixed models for day range and activity level as response variables to assess if the inter-population variability in movement was explained by a set of a priori relevant geographical, environmental, biological, and management predictors. We then explored the bias in density estimates obtained in 25 independent populations when using predicted movement data. There was high intra-species variation in day range and activity level among species and populations. Only species explained a small proportion of this variability; other predictor variables did not. We observed bias in densities when predicting the day range and activity for independent populations. Considering the intra-species variability in movement parameters and the consequent unacceptable bias in density estimates, we recommend that monitoring and conservation programs estimate movement parameters for the target population and survey populations from camera data for more accurate density estimates. While this increases the handling time needed to estimate densities, it is worth the cost because of the reliability of camera-based methodologies to estimate needed movement parameters.

AB  - Marine predators are vital to the healthy functioning of coastal ecosystems, but to understand their roles, it is necessary to elucidate their movement ecology, particularly in relation to one another. A decade's worth of acoustic telemetry data (2011-2020) from Algoa Bay, South Africa, was investigated to determine how two mesopredatory species (teleosts: dusky kob Argyrosomus japonicus, n = 11, and leervis Lichia amia, n = 16) and two top predatory species (sharks: ragged-tooth sharks Carcharias taurus, n = 45, and white sharks Carcharodon carcharias, n = 31) used and shared this bay ecosystem. Multi-annual seasonal fidelity to the bay was exhibited by all species, but differences in residency were observed among species. Similarly, species used space in the bay differently-the teleosts moved less and had movements restricted to the central and western inshore regions of the bay. Conversely, the sharks roamed more, but detections were concentrated in the western part of the bay for C. taurus and in the eastern part of the bay for C. carcharias. Social network analysis showed that species segregated in space and time on a fine scale. However, there was some interaction observed between C. taurus, L. amia, and A. japonicus, but to varying degrees. This is likely because of strong habitat preferences exhibited by each species and predator-prey relationships between these predatory guilds. Results highlight that the sheltered marine Algoa Bay is a resource-rich environment, supporting multiple predators with different hunting strategies albeit similar prey preferences. Finally, these species are likely afforded some protection by the current Greater Addo Elephant National Park Marine Protected Area in the bay but are vulnerable to fishing pressure when they leave this ecosystem.

AB  - Anthropogenic landscape change can lead to novel interactions among species with consequences for predator-prey dynamics. Population responses of predators and prey vary according to species abundance, movement, and distribution. Although conservation often involves managing species abundance, culling predators to benefit vulnerable prey is socially, ethically, and ecologically tenuous. We conducted a before-after control-impact experiment to test how well mitigations designed to disrupt animal movement reduce encounters between endangered caribou (Rangifer tarandus) and their predators in a human-modified landscape. Using camera traps, we quantified coincident habitat use by predators and prey. By deploying obstacles to disrupt ease of movement on human developments, we reduced the ratio of wolf (Canis lupus)-caribou encounters by 85% and reduced the ratio of black bear (Ursus americanus)-caribou encounters by 60%, without removing predators. By managing animal movements that regulate predator-prey encounters, risk to endangered species can be reduced without the disruptive trophic effects caused by intensive carnivore removals.

AB  - Question: Legumes are a key component of rangelands because they play an important role in animal nutrition and the entrance of nitrogen (N) into ecosystems through symbiotic fixation. Legume abundance is commonly low in N-enriched environments because of competition with grasses and non-legume forbs. Both haying and livestock grazing remove plant biomass and reduce light limitation to plant growth, with the difference that livestock may selectively consume legumes. This study examines how legumes respond to grazing, haying and fertilization, and what mechanisms explain legume abundance in rangelands.Location: Flooding Pampa, Argentina.Methods: We performed two manipulation field experiments over 3 years. First, a factorial of rangeland management (intact, haying, or grazing) under two nutrient levels (ambient and increased N, phosphorus [P] and potassium [K]); and second, a factorial of rangeland management (intact or haying) and N x P addition. We evaluated legume, grass and non-legume forb abundance and ground-level light in three to five replicates of our experiments over 3 years.ResultsNPK fertilization increased legume abundance consistently under grazing, and temporarily under haying, but had no effect in the intact grassland. Also, P addition increased legume abundance only under haying when N was not added. Temporal changes in legume abundance were positively associated with changes in ground-level light, which increased with haying and grazing, but decreased with fertilization in the intact grassland, and negatively with grass abundance.Conclusions: The negative effects of nutrients on legume abundance were offset by the positive effects of livestock. The reduction in grass competition and increase in ground-level light due to grazing and haying explained the positive responses of legume abundance to nutrients in this temperate grassland. Our results highlight the importance of considering the interactive response of legume abundance to grazing and fertilization, which are becoming common practices in rangelands.

AB  - Species distribution models (SDMs) are widely used to project how species distributions may vary over time, particularly in response climate change. Although the fit of such models to current distributions is regularly enumerated, SDMs are rarely tested across longer time spans to gauge their actual performance under environmental change. Here, we utilise paleozoological presence/absence records to independently assess the predictive accuracy of SDMs through time. To illustrate the approach, we focused on modelling the Holocene distribution of the hartebeest, Alcelaphus buselaphus, a widespread savannah-adapted African antelope. We applied various modelling algorithms to three occurrence datasets, including a point dataset from online repositories and two range maps representing current and 'natural' (i.e. hypothetical assuming no human impact) distributions. We compared conventional model evaluation metrics which assess fit to current distributions (i.e. True Skill Statistic, TSSc, and Area Under the Curve, AUCc) to analogous 'paleometrics' for past distributions (i.e. TSSp, AUCp, and in addition Boycep, F2-scorep and Sorensenp). Our findings reveal only a weak correlation between the ranking of conventional metrics and paleometrics, suggesting that the models most effectively capturing present-day distributions may not be the most reliable to hindcast historical distributions, and that the choice of input data and modelling algorithm both significantly influences environmental suitability predictions and SDM performance. We thus advocate assessment of model performance using paleometrics, particularly those capturing the correct prediction of presences, such as F2-scorep or Sorensenp, due to the potential unreliability of absence data in paleozoological records. By integrating archaeological and paleontological records into the assessment of alternative models' ability to project shifts in species distributions over time, we are likely to enhance our understanding of environmental constraints on species distributions.
   Species distribution models (SDMs) are commonly used to project species distribution changes on the face of climate change, but their long-term performance is rarely tested. To address this, the authors employed paleozoological records to independently assess SDM accuracy. They focused on modelling the historical distribution of the hartebeest and compared the models' ability to predict past presences and absences in the archaeological record. The results demonstrated a lack of strong correlation between present-day and historical model performance, emphasising the influence of input data and modelling choices on SDM accuracy and highlighting the value of using paleontological and archaeological records for model assessment.image

AB  - Prey species adjust their behavior along human-use gradients by balancing risks from predators and humans. During hunting seasons, prey often exhibit strong antipredator responses to humans but may develop tolerance in suburban areas to exploit human-mediated resources. Additionally, areas with high human activity may offer reduced predation risk if apex predators avoid such locations. This study examined mule deer Odocoileus hemionus behavioral responses to risks from humans and their primary predators, cougars Puma concolor, contextualized by differences in risk levels between study sites, individual risk exposure, and human habituation. We framed our investigation using three non-mutually exclusive hypotheses: (H1) neutral impact, (H2) human shielding (human tolerance driven by cougar avoidance), and (H3) super-additive risk (human avoidance dominating behavior). We controlled for deer phenology and diel period, recognizing that deer behavior varies with these temporal dynamics. Spatiotemporal cougar encounter risk was quantified using GPS collar data, while spatiotemporal human encounter risk and use intensity were quantified using GPS smartphone data. Our results supported H2 and H3, emphasizing the significance of site- and individual-level variation in risk exposure and human use intensity. Deer managed cougar risk adaptively, but humans emerged as the dominant perceived risk, varying by study site. At the site with higher cougar density and lower human hunting pressure, deer exhibited antipredator responses to humans based on individual exposure to human activity, except during hunting season, when tolerance for cougars increased. Conversely, humans were the dominant risk at the site with lower cougar density and greater human hunting pressure. Deer behavior varied significantly across a gradient of human use, influenced by nuanced human presence and predation risks, which were discernible using human smartphone data.

AB  - The gut microbiome of Lepidopteran insects is highly dynamic, influenced by both host diet and phylogeny. While microbial communities are thought to facilitate host adaptation to diverse diets and environments, the existence of a core microbiome shared among closely related herbivores remains largely untested. In this study, we examined the microbial communities in the regurgitant of four Spodoptera species (S. exigua, S. frugiperda, S. latifascia, and S. littoralis) across different diets (artificial diet, cotton, maize, and squash). Using a high-throughput sequencing, we characterized bacterial and fungal community composition and diversity. Bacterial communities were shaped by both diet and host species, indicating species-specific bacterial selection. In contrast, fungal communities were exclusively structured by diet, with lower diversity and dominance of a few key taxa. Notably, no operational taxonomic units were consistently shared across all species or diets, challenging the concept of a conserved core microbiome in these generalist herbivores. Understanding how microbial communities shape generalist herbivores' ability to feed on diverse plants may offer potential strategies for microbiome-based pest management.

AB  - Fear of predation can affect important ecosystem processes by altering the prey traits expression that, in turn, regulates the quantity and quality of nutritional inputs to soil. Here, we aimed to assist in bridging a knowledge gap in this cascading chain of events by exploring how risk of spider predation may affect grasshopper prey performances, and the activity of various microbial extracellular enzymes in the soil. Using a mesocosms field-experiment, we found that grasshoppers threatened by spider predation ate less, grew slower, and had a higher body carbon to nitrogen ratio. Herbivory increased activity of all microbial extracellular enzymes examined, likely due to higher availability of root exudates. Predation risk had no effect on C-acquiring enzymes but decreased activity of P-acquiring enzymes. We found contrasting results regarding the effect of predation on the activity of N-acetyl-glucosaminidase and leucine arylamidase N-acquiring enzymes, suggesting that predation risk may alter the composition of N-inputs to soil. Our work highlighted the importance of soil microbial enzymatic activity as a way to predict how changes in the aboveground food-web dynamics may alter key ecosystem processes like nutritional-cycling.

AB  - Stingless bees (Apidae: Meliponini) are major pollinators in the tropics, supporting key ecosystem services. Yet, stingless bee impact on pollination depends on how many and which pollen types they use, and the relative importance of different factors affecting bee choice for pollen is uncertain. Further, empirical syntheses on bee-plant interactions have largely neglected the Amazon, where stingless bees are major pollinators. Here, we tested phenotypic, environmental, and anthropogenic effects on stingless bee pollen niche across the Brazilian Amazon. We assembled literature data on 242 pollen types collected by 36 species of stingless bees, which were sampled across 1450 km during 1975 to 2012. In this study, the pollen niche is defined by two dimensions: the number and set of pollen taxa collected by stingless bees, representing diversity and composition of the gathered pollen. We modeled the response of the pollen diversity and composition to (1) bee species body mass, (2) tree diversity, (3) tree composition, (4) rainfall, (5) urbanization, and (6) sampling year while accounting for the pollen sampling method, pollen taxonomic uncertainty, and bee phylogenetic relatedness. Pollen diversity decreased with body mass and over time but was higher in urban compared to wild colonies. Pollen composition changed with body mass, tree composition, and year. These relationships were independent of colony sampling method and bee phylogeny and were robust even under uncertainty in pollen taxonomic identification. We show that larger stingless bees are more selective foragers, but much of the variation in their pollen niche across the Brazilian Amazon reflects urbanization, plant resources, and geographical patterns in climate. The long-term change of stingless bee pollen niche can have serious consequences for pollination in the region.

AB  - The Persian Gulf, a shallow semi-enclosed sea bordered by eight nations, faces intensifying ecological degradation under the pressures of the Anthropocene. This review systematically examined pollution types, impacts, and conservation challenges in Persian Gulf from the Scopus database. A bibliometric analysis using VOSviewer identified six major thematic clusters, highlighting evolving research priorities. Chronic oil pollution from extraction, refining, and shipping activities remains a dominant threat, with cumulative impacts on microbial communities, benthic macrofauna, and coral reefs. Heavy metals, including mercury, cadmium, and lead, continue to bioaccumulate in sediments, marine biota, and food webs, posing serious risks to fisheries productivity, food security, and public health. Additionally, thermal pollution and hypersaline effluents from desalination plants are altering salinitytemperature regimes, exacerbating stress on coral reefs and seagrass beds. Rapid coastal development and land reclamation are driving habitat loss, especially for mangroves and mudflats, while microplastic debris is increasingly entangling marine megafauna and contaminating seafood species. The socio-ecological consequences include biodiversity decline, heightened public health threats from seafood contamination and airborne pollutants, economic vulnerabilities in fisheries and tourism sectors, and the cultural erosion of traditional livelihoods such as pearl diving and artisanal fishing. Despite the establishment of Marine Protected Areas and regional initiatives like the Kuwait Action Plan, conservation efforts remain fragmented due to weak governance, geopolitical tensions, and insufficient transboundary cooperation. Critical research gaps persist in cumulative impact assessments, socio-economic valuation, and the integration of climate change stressors into pollution risk models. Safeguarding the Persian Gulf's ecological integrity demands the urgent adoption of ecosystem-based management frameworks, legally binding regional agreements, strengthened science-policy integration, proactive public engagement, and a commitment to embedding planetary health principles into national and regional development strategies.

AB  - Woody plant encroachment (the replacement of grasses and forbs by woody shrubs and trees) is reshaping communities in both terrestrial and coastal environments, but little is known about its effects on basal consumers. We used interactions between fiddler crabs (Uca spp.) and the encroaching mangrove Avicennia germinans in Gulf of Mexico salt marshes to explore trophic interactions between basal consumers and encroaching shrubs. In a series of food preference trials, fiddler crabs consumed over five times more marsh (Spartina alterniflora) plant matter when given a choice between mangrove and marsh diets. In food quality trials, fiddler crabs stored 50% less energy, as measured by hepatopancreas lipid content, when restricted to a mangrove diet. These results demonstrate that mangrove encroachment may have negative consequences for salt marsh basal consumers, which may lead to deleterious population-level effects and altered ecosystem carbon flows. As fiddler crabs are generalist consumers and mangroves share many physical and chemical characteristics with other encroaching woody species, negative consequences for basal consumers may be widespread in other environments undergoing woody shrub encroachment.

AB  - Information on seabird diet is key to understanding their ecological role in the marine food web. The Mediterranean Sea is a biodiversity hotspot that is experiencing a series of growing threats, including overfishing and climate change. The Scopoli's (Calonectris diomedea) and Yelkouan shearwaters (Puffinus yelkouan), two marine predators in the region, are expected to have a piscivorous diet and exploit fishery discards, but their exact reliance on different resources is still unclear. We sampled four populations in the central Mediterranean Sea and used a combination of DNA metabarcoding and stable isotopes to compare their diets and assess trophic niches. We found prey items from 38 families belonging to 21 orders. Clupeiformes and Perciformes were the main prey groups identified in both shearwater species. In fact, diet composition largely overlapped and differed by only 3% variation in the diet consumed at order level and 16% at genus level, despite sampling different populations. The results suggest high overlap of dietary and isotopic niches, while Yelkouan shearwaters occupied a wider niche space overall. Certain taxa were potentially derived from discards but are also available naturally as juvenile fish or in foraging associations with marine megafauna such as predatory fish and turtles. These findings highlight the strong dietary overlap and ecological similarities between Scopoli's and Yelkouan shearwaters, emphasising the importance of understanding their foraging dynamics in the context of resource competition and the increasing pressures on Mediterranean marine ecosystems.

AB  - Research into biotic interactions has been a core theme of ecology for over a century. However, despite the obvious role that biota play in the global carbon cycle, the effects of biotic interactions on carbon pools and fluxes are poorly understood. Here we develop a conceptual framework that illustrates the importance of biotic interactions in regulating carbon cycling based on a literature review and a quantitative synthesis by means of meta-analysis. Our study focuses on blue carbon ecosystems-vegetated coastal ecosystems that function as the most effective long-term CO2 sinks of the biosphere. We demonstrate that a multitude of mutualistic, competitive and consumer-resource interactions between plants, animals and microbiota exert strong effects on carbon cycling across various spatial scales ranging from the rhizosphere to the landscape scale. Climate change-sensitive abiotic factors modulate the strength of biotic-interaction effects on carbon fluxes, suggesting that the importance of biota-mediated carbon cycling will change under future climatic conditions. Strong effects of biotic interactions on carbon cycling imply that biosphere-climate feedbacks may not be sufficiently represented in current Earth system models. Inclusion of new functional groups in these models, and new approaches to simplify species interactions, may thus improve the predictions of biotic effects on the global climate.

AB  - Oystershell scale (OSS; Lepidosaphes ulmi) is an emerging invasive insect that poses a serious threat to conservation of quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) in the southwestern US. Although OSS has been an urban pest in the US since the 1700s, it has recently spread into natural aspen stands in northern Arizona, where outbreaks are causing dieback and mortality. We quantified the ongoing outbreak of OSS at two scales: (1) local severity at two sites and (2) regional distribution across northern Arizona. Our regional survey indicated that OSS is widespread in lower elevation aspen stands and is particularly pervasive in ungulate exclosures. Advanced regeneration had the highest levels of infestation and mortality, which is concerning because this size class is an underrepresented component of aspen stands in northern Arizona. If OSS continues to spread and outbreaks result in dieback and mortality like we observed, then aspen in the southwestern US, and perhaps beyond, will be threatened. Three interacting factors contribute to OSS's potential as a high-impact invasive insect that could spread rapidly: (1) its hypothesized role as a sleeper species, (2) potential interactions between OSS and climate change, and (3) the species' polyphagous nature. Invasive pests like OSS pose an imminent threat to native tree species and, therefore, represent an immediate research and monitoring priority. We conclude with recommendations for future research and monitoring in order to understand OSS's biology in natural aspen stands, quantify impacts, limit future spread, and mitigate mortality and loss of aspen and other host species.

AB  - Coastal lagoons have long been perceived as simple, uniform and naturally stressed habitats, but recent research reveals that these ecosystems may be more complex, heterogeneous, and structured than anticipated, with an unexpected homeostatic and resilience capacity to respond to anthropogenic pressures. In addition, they are considered among the ecosystems with the highest biological productivity and among the most valuable in terms of socioeconomic importance. However, they face numerous challenges and an almost general lack of planning that hinders effective protection against anthropogenic pressures like agriculture, fishing, aquaculture, mining, tourism, coastal works, industrial pollution or eutrophication. This study represents a long-term analysis of changes in the composition and structure of the macrozoobenthic assemblages of the main habitats of the Mar Menor coastal lagoon, and their response to a severe eutrophic break episode, framed in the eutrophication process and human pressures that the lagoon has been suffering for the last 40 years. Four time periods have been studied, since the 1980s, established as a reference for the quality of lagoon benthic communities. 99 taxa (3 Phyla, 1 Class and 95 Families) have been identified. The main environmental characteristics and assemblage descriptors in the seven more representative hard and soft bottom habitats of the lagoon have served to discuss the process of change that they have been undergoing and their spatiotemporal variability. The dynamics of the communities is the result of multiple processes that interact with human impacts. The mechanisms that have permitted maintaining the ecosystem integrity for more than two decades of nutrient input are mainly based on the channelling of primary production towards benthic communities, and the export of excess production. During the periods of high and more or less abrupt increases in the input of nutrients, the ecosystem responds by increasing the populations of some species and trophic strategies in a sequence of filter-feeders, herbivorous and deposit feeders. All this in a complex scenario of spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the environmental conditions and biological assemblages, and species replacement in a framework of restricted connectivity and random colonization from the open sea.

AB  - Human-wildlife conflicts are an important factor for consideration in wildlife management at urban-wildland interfaces. Effective and adaptive management of human-wildlife conflicts is needed to promote tolerance and coexistence of humans and wildlife. Anecdotal reports suggest a recent spike in human-elk conflicts in California, yet there has not been a systematic analysis of human-elk conflicts in the state. To better understand human-elk conflicts in California, we conducted thematic analysis of human-elk conflicts reported in the California Department of Fish and Wildlife's Wildlife Incident Reporting (WIR) system. We also conducted a hotspot analysis using locations of human-elk conflicts reported in the WIR system and evaluated reports for principles of adaptive management. The WIR system contained n = 89 reports for elk and n = 78 of these described conflicts with elk. Overall, property damage (including crop damage) was the most common type of human-elk conflict reported, occurring in 69% of reports (n = 54/78), followed by non-competitive conflict with domestic animals (13%), competition with domestic livestock (12%), and habituation to humans (24%). We identified three hotspots of human-elk conflict in California in Del Norte, Kern, and San Luis Obispo counties. All incidents of human-elk conflict reported in the WIR system included at least one principle of adaptive management. We recommend modifications to the WIR system and interactions with property owners and stakeholders to enhance and facilitate adaptive management of human-elk conflicts in California.

AB  - Silicon (Si) has an important role in mitigating diverse biotic and abiotic stresses in plants, mainly via the silicification of plant tissues. Environmental changes such as atmospheric CO2 concentrations may affect grass Si concentrations which, in turn, can alter herbivore performance. We recently demonstrated that pre-industrial atmospheric CO2 increased Si accumulation in Brachypodium distachyon grass, yet the patterns of Si deposition in leaves and whether this affects insect herbivore performance remains unknown. Moreover, it is unclear whether CO2-driven changes in Si accumulation are linked to changes in gas exchange (e.g. transpiration rates). We therefore investigated how pre-industrial (reduced; rCO(2), 200 ppm), ambient (aCO(2), 410 ppm) and elevated (eCO(2), 640 ppm) CO2 concentrations, in combination with Si-treatment (Si+ or Si-), affected Si accumulation in B. distachyon and its subsequent effect on the performance of the global insect pest, Helicoverpa armigera. rCO(2) increased Si concentrations by 29% and 36% compared to aCO(2) and eCO(2) respectively. These changes were not related to observed changes in gas exchange under different CO2 regimes, however. The increased Si accumulation under rCO(2) decreased herbivore relative growth rate (RGR) by 120% relative to eCO(2,) whereas rCO(2) caused herbivore RGR to decrease by 26% compared to eCO(2). Si supplementation also increased the density of macrohairs, silica and prickle cells, which was associated with reduced herbivore performance. There was a negative correlation among macrohair density, silica cell density, prickle cell density and herbivore RGR under rCO(2) suggesting that these changes in leaf surface morphology were linked to reduced performance under this CO2 regime. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that increased Si accumulation under pre-industrial CO2 reduces insect herbivore performance. Contrastingly, we found reduced Si accumulation under higher CO2, which suggests that some grasses may become more susceptible to insect herbivores under projected climate change scenarios.

AB  - Basin sediments from Bjerkreim, SW Norway, have been analyzed regarding pollen, plant macrofossils, chironomids, palaeomagnetism, elements, volcanic ash, and loss-on-ignition. The chronology is based on the Vedde Ash and Saksunarvatn ash layers and radiocarbon dates of plant and insect macrofossils. The records spanning the period from local deglaciation around 16 ka BP to the early Holocene ca 10.2 ka BP, have given new detailed information of the late-glacial environments. In the cold pre-Bolling (prior to 14.6 ka BP), open pioneer vegetation on unstable mineral soils was dominant. After the Bolling warming, climate became moister and reached the late-glacial thermal maximum (July mean of 12-13 degrees C), and dominant dwarf shrubs and snow beds established. Shallow soils, strong winds, and drought may have restricted vegetation development. Despite colder summers (July mean of 9.5-11 degrees C) in Allerod 13.9-12.8 ka BP, fertile humus-soils developed, and shrub vegetation and open birch-forests established. Snow beds regained dominance in Younger Dryas (July mean of 6.5-9 degrees C). The early Holocene warming initiated rapid establishment of early Betula/Populus-forests and the later Corylus forests around 10.7 ka BP. Three cooling events in the Bolling-Allerod interstadial (Older Dryas/GI-1d, G1-1c2, GI-1b/Gerzensee) temporarily increased open-ground vegetation showing the ecotonal position of Bjerkreim with low resistance to these changes. The Empetrum expansion was delayed (from 14.5 to 13.7 ka BP) towards the east along the coast of Rogaland. This could point to a precipitation/outwash gradient decreasing towards the east and developing the acid soils necessary for Empetrum to expand. For the first time, macrofossils show the late-glacial presence of tree-birch in Norway. Tree-birch were sparse in Bolling and formed patches of open-forests in Allerod. Several pollen taxa previously thought to reflect long-distance dispersal, such as Populus, Hippohae center dot, Jasione, and Sanguisorba ssp., most probably were present in Rogaland during Late-glacial. Doggerland seem to have been important for the late-glacial northwards migration of plants into South Norway.

AB  - Introduction Climate change has led to rising atmospheric CO2 levels and temperatures, projected to double CO2 concentrations and increase temperatures by 2-5 degrees C by the end of the 21st century. These environmental changes influence plant primary and secondary metabolism, potentially altering plant-insect interactions. Herbivore performance depends on the nutritional quality of host plants, which may decline with elevated CO2 due to an increased carbon-to-nitrogen (C:N) ratio. To explore these effects, the performance of spongy moth larvae (Lymantria dispar) was assessed on oak (Quercus robur) and spruce (Picea abies) seedlings grown under varying climatic conditions. This approach compares a preferred host with a non-preferred one in the case of L. dispar, providing insight into how host plant selection may be influenced under future climate scenarios. In addition, the nun moth (Lymantria monacha), a conifer-feeding species, was also studied on the experimental spruce seedlings to facilitate a comparison with a specialist herbivore.Methods Three-year-old oak and spruce seedlings were reared for 1 year under four climate scenarios combining two CO2 levels (ambient: 410 ppm and elevated: 820 ppm) and two temperature regimes (20:15 degrees C and 25:20 degrees C). Seedlings were then processed into leaf powder diets for laboratory bioassays with larvae. Secondary metabolites in the seedlings were analyzed to assess climate-induced changes in tree composition and their effects on herbivores.Results Elevated CO2 increased the C:N ratio in both tree species, with spruce showing a higher ratio than oak. Higher temperatures led to increased nitrogen content, particularly in oak seedlings. L. dispar performed better on oak despite higher secondary metabolite concentrations, while L. monacha exhibited minimal variation in performance on spruce across climate treatments.Conclusion The combined effects of elevated CO2 levels and increased temperatures impacted plant quality; however, there were nearly no differences in the performance of Lymantria larvae. Despite the higher concentrations of secondary metabolites in the trees, the larvae were able to thrive effectively, demonstrating their resilience to environmental changes.

AB  - Climate change and heat stress pose significant challenges to livestock. Local breeds, particularly small ruminants, are gaining importance due to their adaptability to harsh climates. However, the extensive system they are commonly reared in leaves them exposed to the effects of climate change. This study aims to describe the distribution and climate-related challenges faced by registered Italian sheep and goat breeds over the past seven decades. Geolocalized data from all registered small ruminant farms were combined with climatic information retrieved from the "ERA-5-Land hourly data from 1950 to present" dataset. These data were used to calculate average daily temperature, temperature humidity index (THI), and total precipitation during summer. Additionally, THI-based heat waves (HWs) were examined, including the yearly number of HW days and mean THI during HW days. These data were analysed through linear regression models including region or breed, year, and their interaction as fixed factors. The climate data indicate a concerning trend of rising summer temperatures, THI, and HW frequency and intensity, particularly over the past three decades. Central-northern Italy, including the Po Valley and the Alpine Arch, is the most affected region, impacting breeds like Rosset and Brogne sheep, and Lariana and Frisa Valtellinese goats. This is of particular concern because these populations have not been selected for hot climates, and their already small population size exacerbates the problem. Conversely, southern Italy, characterized by hotter and drier temperatures, remained relatively stable. Breeds from this region, such as Girgentana and Nicastrese goats and Nera di Arbus sheep, might represent excellent case studies for climatic adaptation and potential resources for selection for resilience in the face of ongoing climate changes. The findings presented here are essential for the development of monitoring and intervention strategies for breeds facing future vulnerabilities, as well as for designing experiments to explore environmental adaptability in small ruminants.

AB  - Land-use change underpins the ongoing biodiversity crisis. Although such impacts are particularly acute across endemic-rich oceanic islands, little is known for afro-tropical islands. Here we assessed insectivorous bat responses to different land-use types of the island of Sao Tome<acute accent>, in Central West Africa. Since its human colonization in the mid-15th century, Sao Tome<acute accent> lost over 70 % of its native habitat, mostly to shaded and oil palm plantations, agriculture, and urban areas, while part of that was abandoned allowing secondary forests to re-grow. Using passive acoustic monitoring, we surveyed insectivorous bats in 115 sites across each land-use type over one month. We then examined bat species richness and activity, and species-specific activity. Based on 5520 h of recordings, we obtained 19,744 bat passes from five of the six taxa known to occur on the island, three of which are endemics. Both species richness and activity were highest in the four non-forest land-use types, with activity further decreasing with altitude. Species-specific responses corresponded to foraging guild: the forest foragers Hipposideros ruber and Macronycteris thomensis showed higher activity in forests and shaded plantations, the activity of the open-space foragers Chaerephon spp. peaked in urban areas, while that of the edge forager Miniopterus newtoni was highest in oil palm plantations. The island's insectivorous bats are persisting despite land-use change, including island endemics. Maintaining the mosaic of land-use types, including native forests, is likely to help sustain insectivorous bat diversity in this tropical island.

AB  - The loss of genetic diversity is a challenge many species are facing, with genomics being a potential tool to inform and prioritize decision-making. Most caribou (Rangifer tarandus) populations have experienced significant recent declines throughout Quebec, Canada, and are considered of concern, threatened or endangered. Here, we calculated the ancestral and contemporary patterns of genomic diversity of five representative caribou populations and applied a comparative population genomics framework to assess the interplay between demographic events and genomic diversity. We first calculated a caribou specific mutation rate, mu, by extracting orthologous genes from related ungulates and estimating the rate of synonymous mutations. Whole genome re-sequencing was then completed on 67 caribou: from these data we calculated nucleotide diversity, theta(pi) and estimated the coalescent or ancestral effective population size (N-e), which ranged from 12,030 to 15,513. When compared to the census size, N-C, the endangered Gaspesie Mountain caribou population had the highest ancestral N-e:N-C ratio which is consistent with recent work suggesting high ancestral N-e:N-C is of conservation concern. In contrast, values of contemporary N-e, estimated from linkage-disequilibrium, ranged from 11 to 162, with Gaspesie having among the highest contemporary N-e:N-C ratio. Importantly, classic conservation genetics theory would predict this population to be of less concern based on this ratio. Interestingly, F varied only slightly between populations, and despite evidence of bottlenecks across the province, runs of homozygosity were not abundant in the genome. Tajima's D estimates mirrored the demographic models and current conservation status. Our study highlights how genomic patterns are nuanced and potentially misleading if viewed only through a contemporary lens; we argue a holistic conservation genomics view should integrate ancestral N-e and Tajima's D into management decisions.

AB  - Cross-ecosystem nutrient transfer can enhance coral reef functioning in an otherwise oligotrophic environment. While the influence of seabird-derived nutrients on coral reef organisms is increasingly recognized, how they are integrated into reef food webs remains unclear. Cryptobenthic reef fishes are crucial for energy transfer on coral reefs, and their fast life histories imply that they respond strongly to seabird-derived nutrients. Here, we investigate how variation in nearshore seabird nutrient subsidies affects coral reef fish communities. By comparing fish communities across locations differing in seabird nutrient inputs and using stable isotope analysis, we explore nutrient integration across depth, their influence on cryptobenthic and associated larger reef fishes and investigated the relative reliance of cryptobenthic fishes on seabird-enriched benthic and non-enriched pelagic pathways. We find that, near seabird colonies, cryptobenthic fishes' diets can transition from pelagic to benthic dominance; cryptobenthic fish communities are larger; herbivores and all feeding groups comprising potential cryptobenthic fish predators have higher biomass. Collectively, our results stress the importance of seabirds in shaping energy pathways and suggest that, even in dynamic, ocean-swept reef systems, cryptobenthic fishes can mobilize seabird subsidies and potentially act as a nutritional bridge to higher trophic levels.

AB  - Many organisms actively manipulate the environment in ways that feed back on their own development, a process referred to as developmental niche construction. Yet, the role that constructed biotic and abiotic environments play in shaping phenotypic variation and its evolution is insufficiently understood. Here, we assess whether environmental modifications made by developing dung beetles impact the environment-sensitive expression of secondary sexual traits. Gazelle dung beetles both physically modify their ontogenetic environment and structure their biotic interactions through the vertical inheritance of microbial symbionts. By experimentally eliminating (i) physical environmental modifications and (ii) the vertical inheritance of microbes, we assess the degree to which (sym)biotic and physical environmental modifications shape the exaggeration of several traits varying in their degree and direction of sexual dimorphism. We expected the experimental reduction of a larva's ability to shape its environment to affect trait size and scaling, especially for traits that are sexually dimorphic and environmentally plastic. We find that compromised developmental niche construction indeed shapes sexual dimorphism in overall body size and the absolute sizes of male-limited exaggerated head horns, the strongly sexually dimorphic fore tibia length and width, as well as the weakly dimorphic elytron length and width. This suggests that environmental modifications affect sex-specific phenotypic variation in functional traits. However, most of these effects can be attributed to nutrition-dependent plasticity in size and non-isometric trait scaling rather than body-size-independent effects on the developmental regulation of trait size. Our findings suggest that the reciprocal relationship between developing organisms, their symbionts, and their environment can have considerable impacts on sexual dimorphism and functional morphology.

AB  - Arthropods respond to vegetation in multiple ways since plants provide habitat and food resources and indicate local abiotic conditions. However, the relative importance of these factors for arthropod assemblages is less well understood. We aimed to disentangle the effects of plant species composition and environmental drivers on arthropod taxonomic composition and to assess which aspects of vegetation contribute to the relationships between plant and arthropod assemblages. In a multi-scale field study in Southern Germany, we sampled vascular plants and terrestrial arthropods in typical habitats of temperate landscapes. We compared independent and shared effects of vegetation and abiotic predictors on arthropod composition distinguishing between four large orders (Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, Diptera), and five functional groups (herbivores, pollinators, predators, parasitoids, detritivores). Across all investigated groups, plant species composition explained the major fraction of variation in arthropod composition, while land-cover composition was another important predictor. Moreover, the local habitat conditions depicted by the indicator values of the plant communities were more important for arthropod composition than trophic relationships between certain plant and arthropod species. Among trophic groups, predators showed the strongest response to plant species composition, while responses of herbivores and pollinators were stronger than those of parasitoids and detritivores. Our results highlight the relevance of plant community composition for terrestrial arthropod assemblages across multiple taxa and trophic levels and emphasize the value of plants as a proxy for characterizing habitat conditions that are hardly accessible to direct environmental measurements.

AB  - Coral reefs are beginning to experience conditions unlike any in recent history. Understanding ecosystem function on future reefs will require reassessing ecological processes under novel environmental regimes. For many coastal reefs, severely degraded water quality will be a hallmark of these novel regimes. While herbivory has traditionally been considered essential for maintaining coral dominance, recent evidence from urban reefs suggests this pattern may be changing. Here, we reexamined the impacts of herbivores on a shallow, turbid reef exposed to extensive coastal development. We found that although herbivore biomass, size-structure, and grazing rates were significantly reduced relative to a nearby protected reef, coral cover on this shallow urban reef remained > 45%. In contrast, coral cover at the nearby protected site was roughly 50% lower. Differences in coral cover between the sites were due to greater cover of two groups of corals at the urban site: depth-generalist Orbicella spp., particularly O. faveolata, and Agaricia spp. with weedy life-history characteristics. Both groups are tolerant of low light but susceptible to coral bleaching. Our results suggest that diminished top-down pressure did not promote algal dominance. Instead, turbidity-induced reductions in available light drove community structure, leading to dominance of coral and algae species able to acclimate to low-light. Our study demonstrates how environmental context can alter the importance of critical processes on coral reefs and highlights the need to reexamine traditional paradigms in reef ecology to understand ecosystem function on future reefs.

AB  - As wild boar populations and their distribution ranges increase, human-wild boar conflicts have become increasingly prevalent in numerous regions across the globe. These conflicts have a profound impact on human livelihoods, resulting in significant economic losses. Understanding the habitat requirements and relative abundance of wild boars is crucial prior to implementing any conservation measures. However, studies on wild boar habitat and population in the central and eastern regions of the Tianshan Mountains in China are lacking. We assessed the activity patterns and relative abundance of wild boars in these areas and evaluated habitat suitability using a combination of camera trapping, line transects, species distribution modeling (maximum entropy model), and hierarchical abundance modeling (Bayesian N-mixture model). We used 311 infrared cameras and 280 field-based line transects to cover approximately 31,000 km(2) from September 2022 to May 2023 in the east-central Tianshan Mountains. We used 240 wild boar distribution locations and 13 environmental predictors in the development of species distribution models. We also used species counts and associated environmental predictors in the N-mixture model to estimate the relative abundance of wild boar. Wild boars were most active during crepuscular hours (1800), and relatively active in the diurnal period compared to the nocturnal period. The probability of wild boar occurrence increased with higher normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the minimum temperature of the coldest month, and annual temperatures below 39 degrees C. Boars were most likely to be found in closed deciduous-coniferous forests. The relative abundance of wild boars was positively affected by NDVI and negatively affected by the minimum temperature of the coldest month and temperature annual range. Based on our results, we suggest areas of management priority. In particular, extensive and intact habitat with substantial wild boar populations, such as the Banfanggou, the South Mountain of Urumqi, and the Hutubi, should be prioritized for long-term wild boar population monitoring and management so the adverse impacts of increasing wild boar populations in the study region can be minimized.

AB  - Land use changes are driving the fragmentation of natural habitats in Peninsular Malaysia, even within protected areas, which results in a loss of habitat connections. This process directly affects wildlife species, many of which are threatened with extinction, especially large mammals. To better conserve wildlife, these natural habitats must be linked both structurally and functionally. However, sparse data exists for this geographic region with regards to landscape connectivity and the connectivity importance of habitat patches, and this lack may hinder conservation efforts. To close this knowledge gap, we measured landscape connectivity and the connectivity importance of habitat patches in Selangor State of Peninsular Malaysia, and within its protected area system. We used two large mammals as focal species and graph-based connectivity indices (i.e., probability of connectivity) to map and develop a connectivity importance index (CII). Selangor has poor landscape connectivity for large mammals. CII showed only the two largest habitat patches in the study area have a high connectivity importance. All protected areas situated at hilly sites and those with less human interference yielded a high connectivity importance. However, large parts of habitat patches with a high connectivity importance are located outside the protected areas. These findings demonstrate the importance of considering connectivity indices for large mammals when planning protected area placement. Our study provides an approach to evaluate and plan for land conservation targeting wildlife, but also inform wise land use development.

AB  - Abyssal polymetallic nodule fields represent a unique deep-sea habitat. The hard substratum provided by nodules is thought to increase habitat complexity, promoting the occurrence of highly diverse abyssal assemblages. However, hard substratum in these habitats is also available as outcropping rock fragments, but their contri-bution to habitat heterogeneity has been largely overlooked. Here, we assessed if the type and size of hard substratum can modulate benthic biodiversity at local scales within the Clarion Clipperton Zone (N Pacific abyss). We compared megafauna (animals >10 mm) assemblages in nodule bearing habitats with those in areas containing rocks in addition to nodules. We found a lower faunal density but a clearly higher diversity and more heterogenous composition in the assemblages of rock bearing areas compared to those with only nodules. In addition, hard substratum patch size appeared to positively influence the size of some taxa, like bamboo corals. These results suggest that rocks, in addition to nodules, constitute keystone structures enhancing habitat het-erogeneity at local scales within nodule fields. Rock areas appear common in some abyssal plains and may make regionally-important contributions to abyssal biodiversity, suggesting that they may be relevant to include in conservation efforts.

AB  - Studies on the impacts of grazing on carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus stoichiometry and storage are crucial for better understanding the nutrient cycles of grasslands ecosystems. Using a controlled grazing experimental platform in a meadow steppe ecosystem, the effects of different stocking rates (0.00, 0.23, 0.34, 0.46, 0.69, and 0.92 AU ha(-1)) on the carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus contents of plant functional groups were explored. The major results were: (1) The carbon content of Gramineae Barnhart was significantly reduced by grazing intensity (p < 0.05), and the organic carbon content of Cyperaceae Rotundus was significantly higher than that of the other groups; the total nitrogen content of Cyperaceae and other groups and total phosphorus contents of Gramineae, Leguminosae Sp., Cyperaceae, and other groups all increased significantly with increasing grazing intensity (p < 0.05). (2) The carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus storage amounts of Gramineae, Leguminosae, and Ranunculaceae L. decreased significantly with increasing grazing intensity. Heavy grazing reduced the carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus storage amounts of Cyperaceae and other groups, while the carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus storage amounts of Compositae were the largest under moderate grazing. (3) The nitrogen content of each functional group was highly significantly negatively correlated with the C/N ratio, and the phosphorus content was highly significantly negatively correlated with the C/P ratio. Grazing and foraging affected the growth of the different functional groups, which in turn affected their carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus content, stoichiometry, and storage. Moderate grazing improved the nutrient utilization efficiency of grassland and is beneficial for promoting sustainable grassland development.

AB  - Understanding the relationship between humans and elephants is of particular interest for reducing conflict and encouraging coexistence. This paper reviews the ecological relationship between humans and Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) in the rainforests of the Malay Peninsula, examining the extent of differentiation of spatio-temporal and trophic niches. We highlight the strategies that people and elephants use to partition an overlapping fundamental niche. When elephants are present, forest-dwelling people often build above-the-ground shelters; and when people are present, elephants avoid open areas during the day. People are able to access several foods that are out of reach of elephants or inedible; for example, people use water to leach poisons from tubers of wild yams, use blowpipes to kill arboreal game, and climb trees to access honey. We discuss how the transition to agriculture affected the human-elephant relationship by increasing the potential for competition. We conclude that the traditional foraging cultures of the Malay Peninsula are compatible with wildlife conservation.

AB  - Fluctuations in the abundance of insect herbivores and the severity of damage they cause to their hosts are key factors affecting tree health and trophic interactions. Bell miner associated dieback (BMAD) is a trophic cascade involving eucalypt trees, psyllids and bell miners. Bell miners are a territorial species of bird that reduce insectivorous bird diversity, thereby increasing psyllid abundances. The role of psyllids in BMAD is debated, primarily because psyllid host specificity, genus, defoliation potential and/or lerp composition have been conflated or unexplored. This study documented psyllid communities and canopy structure of four eucalypt hosts (Eucalyptus bridgesiana, E. caliginosa, E. propinqua and E. siderophloia) in BMAD and non-BMAD-affected forests in northern New South Wales. Psyllid abundances were significantly higher in BMAD-affected forests. However, psyllid assemblages did not differ between forest types which contrasts with an influential hypothesis concerning bell miner farming of psyllids that produce sugary lerps (Glycaspis species). Importantly, psyllid communities differed among species of eucalypt host. Hosts supporting higher abundances of Cardiaspina tended to have a stronger negative relationship between canopy health and psyllid abundances than other host trees. Cardiaspina were also found on older leaves and associated with more leaf damage than other psyllids. Unlike most other psyllid genera, Cardiaspina initiate premature foliar senescence leading to defoliation which ultimately changes the age structure of leaves of the canopies of affected trees. Our study supports the functional linkage between psyllid assemblages, their relative abundances and defoliation potential to bottom-up mechanisms behind a bird-associated trophic cascade.

AB  - Coastal oak meadows are fragmented across an increasingly urbanized landscape in Greater Victoria with implications for common camas (qwl(sic)l/KLO,EL/Camassia quamash) fitness. Common camas, frequently present in coastal oak meadows, is an ecologically important cultural keystone species that forms the foundation of one of the most important Indigenous food systems in the region. Previous research has examined how the pressures associated with urbanization shape plant community composition and structure, but how these pressures influence individual plant fitness remains unclear. To improve our understanding, we assessed environmental conditions and common camas growth and reproductive traits across an urban-rural gradient in Greater Victoria. We found that urbanization on this landscape alters several key environmental variables (namely increased trampling and soil compaction, and decreased soil depth, canopy cover, and soil phosphorus) and that common camas appears to be responding to these altered conditions with a reduction in growth and reproductive trait values. By targeting the identified pressures, management can work towards supporting more successful urban camas populations into the future.

AB  - Inputs of persistent plastic items to marine environments continue to pose a serious and long-term threat to marine fauna and ecosystem health, justifying further interventions on local and global scales. While Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is frequently used for sustainability evaluations by industries and policymakers, plastic leakage to the environment and its subsequent impacts remains absent from the framework. Incorporating plastic pollution in the assessments requires development of both inventories and impact assessment methods. Here, we propose spatially explicit Characterization Factors (CF) for quantifying the impacts of plastic entanglement on marine megafauna (mammals, birds and reptiles) on a global scale. We utilize Lagrangian particle tracking and a Species Sensitivity Distribution (SSD) model along with species susceptibility records to estimate potential entanglement impacts stemming from lost plastic-based fishing gear. By simulating plastic losses from fishing hotspots within all Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) we provide country-specific impact estimates for use in LCA. The impacts were found to be similar across regions, although the median CF associated with Oceania was higher compared to Europe, Africa and Asia. Our findings underscore the presence of susceptible species across the world and the transboundary issue of plastic pollution. We discuss the application of the factors and identify areas of further refinement that can contribute towards a comprehensive assessment of macroplastic pollution in sustainability assessments. Degradation and beaching rates for different types of fishing gear remain a research gap, along with population-level effects on marine taxa beyond surface breathing megafauna. Increasing the coverage of impacts specific to the marine realm in LCA alongside other stressors can facilitate informed decision-making towards more sustainable marine resource management.

AB  - Three-dimensional (3D) habitat complexity is a primary driver of organism distribution and community structure across ecosystems. Identifying the specific metrics and spatial scales at which complexity is functionally important for communities is therefore a critical component in forecasting ecosystem function. Here we pair fish species traits with multiple metrics from habitat photogrammetry to evaluate the most important measures and scales of 3D complexity driving ecological functions within one of the most structurally diverse ecosystems on the planet: coral reefs. From May to July 2019, we collected high-resolution (1 cm) large- and small-scale intrahabitat (25 m(2)) structural complexity data across eight reefscapes (similar to 2500 m(2)) and conducted co-located fish functional group surveys in the Florida Keys, FL, USA. We used a hierarchical clustering analysis to group 80 observed fish species by four traits related to habitat use (social level, body size, crypsis, activity period) and feeding guild to generate mechanistic predictions about fish-habitat relationships. Evaluating relationships between the resulting trait-based functional groups (k = 9) and four metrics of intra-habitat complexity (large-scale vertical relief, and small-scale vector ruggedness [VRM], VRM deviation, and profile curvature) revealed that trait groups respond independently to the various measures and scales of reef complexity. While large-scale complexity (relief) is strongly related to the presence of solitary, cryptic, nocturnal carnivores, likely due to prey availability as well as day-time refuge opportunities, herbivore abundance is unaffected by increasing vertical relief, potentially due to predator avoidance. Instead, gregarious (i.e., schooling) herbivores increase with small-scale complexity measured by VRM and VRM deviation across reefscapes, while less gregarious herbivores only respond to small-scale complexity when these same measures occur in low-relief habitat, possibly due to a tradeoff between grazing resource availability and predator visibility. Our results reveal how unique elements of complexity provided by both biotic benthic communities as well as large-scale habitat features like vertical relief are differentially important to fish functional groups. The general relationships we identified using traits provide a framework for predicting fish community responses to changes in specific measures of structural complexity on coral reefs globally. Our work illustrates how preserving 3D habitat complexity by protecting or augmenting (e.g., via restoration) structure-forming organisms can support diverse organismal communities and overall ecosystem productivity.

AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi play a major role in maintaining ecosystem functions. AM fungi are found in most ecosystems including rangelands currently under increasing pressures from human activities. Southern Patagonia (Argentina) is a semiarid region influenced by extensive livestock production in rangelands. There is a lack of information about the environmental conditions and functionality of AM fungi in plant species of Patagonia ecosystems associated with livestock grazing. We assessed how soil properties, climatic conditions, and grazing intensities influence the response of AM fungi colonization. We studied most palatable and representative plant species (Poa dusenii, Rytidosperma virescens, Festuca gracillima, Nardophylum bryoides, Mulguraea tridens, and Carex argentina) growing in main ecological areas of Southern Patagonia. Most of the studied plant species (except C. argentina) presented AM symbiosis. AM colonization showed a negative relationship with soil organic carbon and nitrogen and a positive relationship with soil bulk density and pH. Results suggest that plants promoted a higher root AM colonization when soil nutrients and water availability (rainfall) are limiting. Sheep stocking rates had a differential impact depending on the ecological areas and plant life forms. High grazing decreased the AM colonization in the ecological areas with palatable plant dominance, suggesting that the impacts of grazing could lead to further negative effects on the ecosystem. Moderate grazing allows to maintain higher AM colonization, which would probably benefit the aboveground production of palatable plant and, consequently, to herbivores, particularly in degraded rangelands like Patagonian steppes. This study improves the knowledge of AM association in Patagonian semiarid rangelands by increasing our understanding of the impacts of grazing on belowground ecology. This information becomes relevant for grazing sustainable management, which may contribute to food security. (C) 2021 The Society for Range Management. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The history of Homo sapiens is studded with many events promoting relationships with wild animals changing their evolutionary path or impacting their adaptation. Artificial selection is recognized as the product of planned actions aimed to annex useful species into the anthropic niche. However, the effect of humans on animal evolutionary trajectories is diversified and cannot be assigned to a single driver. We characterized the genomes of feral pigs managed by different traditional husbandry practices to infer about the combining effect of artificial and natural selection. Whole genome characterization showed a clear distinctiveness of Sardinian wild boars (Sus scrofa) from free-range pig and domestic pig (Sus domesticus) populations, while Eurasian wild boars and hybrids are closely related, also in agreement with allelic frequency. In the Southern Italy system, we found 7 SNPs putatively under selection, associated with genomic regions including genes mainly involved in body weight control and feeding behavior, muscle growth and development, and adipocyte proliferation. Considering Sardinian wild boar and free-range pigs, over 3000 SNPs were found putatively under selection, and the genomic regions in which these SNPs fall include genes linked mainly to litter size and number of teats. The screening of genomic variability was useful to characterize feral pigs and wild boars from Southern Italy and Sardinia and the relationships between them, highlighting the effect of a peculiar artificial selection that modulates its weightiness due to the concomitant natural selection. In particular, the traditional Sardinian pig husbandry seems to act pushing down gene flow towards wild boar while favoring adaptations to life in the wild, creating a unique genetic pattern in free-range pigs, different both from the domestic and the wild genetic makeup. Our contribution opens up a discussion on the current European policy for the management of free-range pigs, the effective conservation actions for diversity in Suidae forms and their consequent impacts on biodiversity.

AB  - Feral goats, Capra hircus (Bovidae), currently occur across 28% of Australia, and are found in all states and territories as well as some offshore islands. Feral goats are harvested for live export or processed as game meat, with feral goats making up approximately 90% of goats sent to slaughter in Australia. Nymphs of the pentastomid parasite, Linguatula serrata, are common parasites of goats elsewhere in the world, where they cause Halzoun or Marrara disease in humans through the consumption of nymphs in raw or semi-cooked edible offal. Despite being commonly encountered in cattle at slaughter in Australia, L. serrata nymphs have never been reported from feral goats in Australia. Goats at slaughter, however, commonly show infections of lymph nodes, the majority of which are diagnosed as caseous lymphadenitis caused by bacteria, although a small number have no known aetiology. Examination of 33 feral goats from locations in New South Wales and South Australia found a Linguatula sp. nymph encased in the mesenteric lymph node of one goat from the Cooma region of New South Wales. The potential risk of transmission of Linguatula sp. to humans and other domestic animals is discussed. This study has highlighted the importance of continued surveys of feral animals for infection with parasites, especially as their distribution changes.

AB  - Intensive rotational grazing is a recently proposed rangeland management strategy that has been praised by the public and media but has not been fully proven or widely accepted by rangeland ecologists. In this study, a threeyear experiment was performed to evaluate the effects of intensive rotational grazing on the rangeland ecosystem in a typical steppe in Inner Mongolia, China. The experiment involved three treatments of rotational management with the same level of grazing intensity (1 sheep unit per ha in the first year and 1.3 sheep unit per ha for the next two years), including intensive rotational grazing (livestock rotated every 3-5 days), traditional rotational grazing (livestock rotated every 15 days), and continuous grazing (without livestock rotation). In addition, this experiment set up "no grazing treatment" as the reference and represents the widely used policy of "grazing forbidden". Compared with previous studies, this study first implemented rotational grazing at a low level of grazing intensity to obey the rangeland policy of Chinese governments, which aimed to balance the forage demand of livestock and the ecosystem conservation. The results revealed that the aboveground biomass and root biomass (0-10 cm deep) were significantly higher in the intensive rotational grazing treatment than in the other two grazing treatments. Moreover, the biomass of the dominant species (Leymus chinensis) and its proportion in the community were also higher in the intensive grazing treatment. Intensive rotational grazing could also promote the weight gain of grazing sheep. However, intensive rotational grazing did not improve the carbon sequestration of rangeland. These results indicated that intensive rotational grazing had considerable advantages in realizing the sustainable management of grazing grasslands when grazing intensity was at a relatively low level, which aims to balance plant growth and livestock production of grasslands. Furthermore, our results suggest that intensive rotational grazing is beneficial for promoting the progressive succession of degraded grasslands and providing economic revenue for local herders, thus worth studying in more regions and rangeland scenarios.

AB  - The genus Cistus plays a crucial role in the Mediterranean ecosystems. However, studies on microhistological characters of its leaves are scarce, resulting in a knowledge gap. We focused here on all Cistus species in the eastern Sierra Morena, southern Iberian Peninsula: C. albidus, C. crispus, C. ladanifer, C. laurifolius, C. monspeliensis, C. populifolius and C. salviifolius, because these species are present in the diet of ruminant herbivores such as deer. Our study involved analysing, characterizing, and comparing trichomes, stomata and epidermal cells, with a total of 17 variables analysed. The results confirm the distinction of Cistus species based on microhistological characteristics. Understanding these structures facilitates taxonomic classification and analysis of wild ungulate diet and habitat selection using light microscopy. We generate a helpful resource for future micro-histological analysis studies applied to wild ungulate diets determination, botany, conservation biology and resources management.

AB  - Information on prey selection and the diet of the leopard (Panthera pardus fusca) is essential for leopard conservation. We conducted an investigation into the prey species and the proportion of each species in the leopard's diet in a human-dominated mid-hill region of Nepal. The analysis of 96 leopard scats collected between August 2020 and March 2021 revealed that leopards consumed 15 prey species, including small- and medium-sized mammals and livestock. In addition to these prey species, we also found plastic materials, bird feathers, and some unidentified items in the leopard scats. Wild ungulates (such as barking deer, Muntiacus muntjak and wild boar, Sus scrofa) constituted only 10% of the biomass in the scats, while livestock contributed 27%, and other wild prey contributed 50%. Among all species, domestic goats had the highest relative biomass in the scats, followed by the jungle cat (Felis chaus), domestic dog (Canis familiaris), and large Indian civet (Viverra zibetha). Similarly, the Indian hare (Lepus nigricollis) had the highest proportion of relative individuals present in the scat samples, followed by the jungle cat and the large Indian civet. A lower proportion of biomass from wild ungulates in the leopard's diet and a higher dependency of the leopard on domestic prey and other wild prey indicate a shortage of medium-sized wild prey, such as barking deer and wild boar, in leopard habitats. Therefore, the conservation of wild prey species, especially medium-sized prey, is crucial for reducing the leopard's dependence on livestock and mitigating human-leopard conflicts in the future.

AB  - In savannas across the planet, encroaching woody plants are altering ecosystem functions and reshaping communities. Seed predation by rodents may serve to slow the encroachment of woody plants in grasslands and savannas. Our goals for this study were to determine if rodents in an African savanna selectively removed seeds of an encroaching plant and if foraging activity was influenced by the local vegetation structure or by the landscape context. From trials with two species of seeds (encroacher = Dichrostachys cinerea, non-encroaching overstory tree = Senegalia nigrescens) at 64 seed stations, we recorded 1,065 foraging events by seven species of granivorous rodents. We found a strong positive relationship between rodent activity and the number of seeds removed during trials. Foraging events were dominated by rodent seed predators, with <10.6% of events involving a rodent with the potential for secondary dispersal. Rodents selectively removed the seeds of the encroaching species, removing 32.6% more D. cinerea seeds compared to S. nigrescens. Additionally, rodent activity and the number of seeds removed increased at sites with more grass biomass. Our results suggest a potential mechanistic role for rodents in mitigating the spread of woody plants in grass dominated savannas.

AB  - We investigated factors influencing codistribution of cattle and exotic oryx on the Chihuahuan Desert Rangeland Research Center (CDRRC), south-central New Mexico. We established a camera-trapping grid on the CDRRC, 2019-2022, and modeled occupancy of cattle (Bos indicus) and oryx (Oryx gazella gazella) as a function of habitat attributes and presence of the other species. Species interaction factors were > 3.9 for oryx and cattle, and presence of either ungulate never negatively influenced occupancy of either except at water sites. Similarly, occupancy of the CDRRC landscape was positively correlated (>= 0.77) between oryx and cattle. Occupancy of oryx was weakly negatively influenced by total edge and terrain ruggedness. Cattle occupancy was weakly associated with areas away from roads, nearer water, and with greater number of habitat patches in the landscape (i.e., within a 1-km radius). Presence of oryx and cattle at water sites was negatively correlated (r = -0.20); patterns of use indicated that oryx avoided using water sites when cattle were present. Rather than segregation driven by interference competition or despotism, our results appeared to reflect common preferences and distribution of oryx and cattle for much of the CDRRC landscape. The exception to this was apparent subdominance of oryx to cattle at water sites.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of season, rangeland type, and herd size on the performance of goat browsing. A total of eighty communal household goat herds from Mbashe and Nkonkobe municipalities were monitored for twelve months. The effect of season, rangeland type and herd size on average daily gain (ADG), body condition score (BCS), body weight (BW), births, purchases, sales, deaths, goat production potential (GPP) and goat production efficiency (GPE) were evaluated. The Mbashe community was regarded to represent open grassland, while the Nkonkobe community represented the Vachellia karroo encroached rangeland. Approximately 1 560 goats of all classes were monitored. Results showed that more entries, births and sales, but fewer deaths, were recorded in V. karroo encroached rangeland than open grassland for larger herds (p < 0.05). The GPP and GPE were higher in V. karroo encroached rangeland than open grassland for larger than smaller herds (p < 0.05). Goat population dynamics, BW for castrates, sales and GPE were significantly higher among seasons (p < 0.05). It was concluded that larger herds of goats browsing V. karroo performed better in comparison to those that grazed open grasslands, which demonstrates that bush encroachment can benefit goat farming.

AB  - Herbivore foraging decisions are closely related to plant nutritional quality. For arboreal folivores with specialized diets, such as the vulnerable greater glider (Petauroides volans), the abundance of suitable forage trees can influence habitat suitability and species occurrence. The ability to model and map foliar nitrogen would therefore enhance our understanding of folivore habitat use at finer scales. We tested whether high-resolution multispectral imagery, collected by a lightweight and low-cost commercial unoccupied aerial vehicle (UAV), could be used to predict total and digestible foliar nitrogen (N and digN) at the tree canopy level and forest stand-scale from leaf-scale chemistry measurements across a gradient of mixed-species Eucalyptus forests in southeastern Australia. We surveyed temperate Eucalyptus forests across an elevational and topographic gradient from sea level to high elevation (50-1200 m a.s.l.) for forest structure, leaf chemistry, and greater glider occurrence. Using measures of multispectral leaf reflectance and spectral indices, we estimated N and digN and mapped N and favorable feeding habitat using machine learning algorithms. Our surveys covered 17 Eucalyptus species ranging in foliar N from 0.63% to 1.92% dry matter (DM) and digN from 0.45% to 1.73% DM. Both multispectral leaf reflectance and spectral indices were strong predictors for N and digN in model cross-validation. At the tree level, 79% of variability between observed and predicted measures of nitrogen was explained. A spatial supervised classification model correctly identified 80% of canopy pixels associated with high N concentrations (>= 1% DM). We developed a successful method for estimating foliar nitrogen of a range of temperate Eucalyptus species using UAV multispectral imagery at the tree canopy level and stand scale. The ability to spatially quantify feeding habitat using UAV imagery allows remote assessments of greater glider habitat at a scale relevant to support ground surveys, management, and conservation for the vulnerable greater glider across southeastern Australia.

AB  - A capacity for rapid adaptation should enhance the persistence of populations subject to temporal and spatial heterogeneity in natural selection, but examples from nature remain scarce. Plectritis congesta (Caprifoliaceae) is a winter annual that exhibits local adaptation to browsing by ungulates and hypothesized to show context-dependent trade-offs in traits affecting success in competition versus resistance or tolerance to browsing. We grew P. congesta from 44 insular populations historically exposed or naive to ungulates in common gardens to (1) quantify genetic, plastic and competitive effects on phenotype; (2) estimate a capacity for rapid adaptation (evolvability); and (3) test whether traits favoured by selection with ungulates present were selected against in their absence. Plants from browsed populations bolted and flowered later, had smaller inflorescences, were less fecund and half as tall as plants from naive populations on average, replicating patterns in nature. Estimated evolvabilities (3-36%) and narrow-sense heritabilities (h2; 0.13-0.32) imply that differences in trait values as large as reported here can arise in 2-18 generations in an average population. Phenotypic plasticity was substantial, varied by browsing history and fruit phenotype and increased with competition. Fecundity increased with plasticity in flowering height given competition (0.47 +/- 0.02 florets/cm, beta +/- se), but 23-77% faster in naive plants bearing winged fruits (0.53 +/- 0.04) than exposed-wingless plants (0.43 +/- 0.03) or exposed-winged and naive-wingless plants (0.30 +/- 0.03, each case). Our results support the hypothesis that context-dependent variation in natural selection in P. congesta populations has conferred a substantial capacity for adaptation in response to selection in traits affecting success in competition versus resistance or tolerance to browsing in the absence versus presence of ungulates, respectively. Theory suggests that conserving adaptive capacity in P. congesta will require land managers to maintain spatial heterogeneity in natural selection, prevent local extinctions and maintain gene flow.

AB  - The decline of semi-natural open ecosystems after land abandonment is a conservation issue in many industrialized countries. Large herbivores, such as horses (Equus ferus), are excellent candidates for rewilding activities, as they can contribute to reducing loss of open landscapes. However, their presence could affect the spatio-temporal distribution of sympatric species, especially if the reintroduction is unplanned and uncontrolled. La Calvana, central Italy, is a protected area with a mammalian community that has never been systematically monitored, and its grasslands, which are a high conservation priority, are disappearing. The area hosts a population of feral horses that originated about 40 years ago from a few released domestic individuals, and their unplanned presence could represent a unique rewilding opportunity for the restoration of the abandoned landscape. Yet nothing is known about their distribution or relationships with sympatric mammals. By deploying 40 camera traps in May-July 2022, we systematically monitored the area to investigate spatio-temporal patterns of feral horses and their relationships with environmental, biotic, and anthropogenic factors. We detected 12 wild mammal species and estimated that horses were present in 40% of the study area. None of the environmental variables tested affected the occupancy of horses, although modeling of site-use intensity revealed that this species used upper-ridge grasslands more frequently. This suggests the area is suitable to support the population and that their presence at higher elevations can be an asset to preserving grasslands by limiting forest and shrub encroachment. Horses occupancy was not related to the relative abundance of wild ungulates, suggesting minimal competition for resources at present. However, the lower temporal overlap at sites with greater vegetation cover during the hottest hours indicated dominance of horses. Feral horses seem unaffected by human proximity, although they are occasionally subject to poaching. Lastly, the 7-year-long population census revealed a 12% annual growth rate that may lead to exceeding the carrying capacity of the ecosystem in the future. We recommend continued monitoring of this population and implementation of conservation and management programs.

AB  - The increase of macroalgae at degraded reefs impedes several ecosystem services and calls for effective methods to facilitate a return to coral dominance. Removal of macroalgae (browsing) is typically realized by fish, but the role and identity of browsers at the heavily-fished East African coast is still largely unknown. This study investigated how browsing pressure at Kenyan reefs (-4.700, 39.396) related to fisheries management and herbivore community. From October 2018 to January 2019, consumption during 24-h buffet assays using the brown macroalgae Sargassum and Padina was determined and video recorded at six sites: two in fished zones, two in marine reserves (traditional fishing allowed) and two in no-take zones. Herbivorous fish composition, biomass and sea urchin density were also determined. Consumption of Sargassum and Padina was nearly three-fold lower in the fished zones (26% and 28% of macroalgal biomass consumed, respectively) compared to the no-take zones (62% and 82%), with intermediate consumption in the marine reserves (48% and 71%). Herbivore biomass was seven-fold higher in no-take zones and included substantially more browsers (mainly unicornfishes, Naso spp.) and scrapers (scarids), which were associated with the higher browsing pressure. Browsers and scrapers were predominantly responsible for the consumption of macroalgae as determined by video recordings, though key species differed across sites. In contrast, damselfish-dominated fished sites were associated with high sea urchin densities and low browsing pressure. These results indicate that fishing restrictions are likely to support reef resilience by increasing herbivorous fish biomass of key species and thereby promote macroalgae removal.

AB  - Invasive macrophytes are troublesome in a myriad of freshwater ecosystems worldwide. Before causing threats to recipient communities, invasive species face abiotic and biotic environmental factors during colonization and establishment that may hamper their success. We experimentally investigated the separate effects of one abiotic factor (sediment organic matter) and two biotic factors (competition and herbivory), along with their interactions, on the growth of the exotic species Hydrilla verticillata in its invasive range. We found that herbivory by the native mollusk Pomacea canaliculata, competition with the native macrophyte Egeria najas and high organic matter in sediment negatively impacted the performance of the exotic species in terms of plant height, biomass production and branching. However, the intensity of each limiting factor depends on the presence of a second factor, as indicated by significant interactions between sediment type x herbivory and competition x herbivory. Our most important finding was that these three factors act synergistically, with a disproportional significant negative impact on the exotic macrophyte. Because the native competitor and herbivore we used occur in lakes with high organic matter in the sediment, our findings help to explain why H. verticillata has still not colonized several aquatic habitats (i.e., floodplain lakes) in South America.

AB  - Global climatic changes have been observed for all natural biomes, with the greatest impact in the permafrost zone. The short series of direct observations of air temperature and precipitation from meteorological stations for this territory make it difficult to use them in studies of the impact of climate change on forest and forest-tundra ecosystems, but only longer series of gridded data expand the temporal-spatial resolution of this analysis. We compared local and gridded air temperature, precipitation and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) data, analyzed the trends of their changes over the last century for three sites in the permafrost zone (YAK and TAY in Russia, and CAN in Canada), and estimated the effect of their variability on oxygen isotopes in the tree-ring cellulose (delta O-18(cell)) of three different species (Larix cajanderi Mayr, Larix gmelinii Rupr. Rupr and Picea glauca (Moench) Voss). Climate trend analysis showed strong changes after the 1980s, and even more pronounced from 2000 to 2020. We revealed that delta O-18(cell)-YAK showed mixed signals of the July temperature (r = 0.49; p = 0.001), precipitation (r = -0.37; p = 0.02) and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) (r = 0.31; p = 0.02), while delta O-18(cell)-CAN captured longer March-May (r = 0.37, p = 0.001) and July (r = 0.32, p < 0.05) temperature signals as well as spring VPD (r = 0.54, p = 0.001). The delta O-18(cell)-TAY showed a significant correlation with air temperature in July (r = 0.23, p = 0.04) and VPD in March (r = -0.26, p = 0.03). The obtained eco-hydrological relationships indicate the importance of temperature and moisture to varying degrees, which can be explained by site- and species-specific differences.

AB  - Bycatch is one of the main causes of mortality among marine megafauna around the world. In the coastal waters of southern Brazil, bycatch in gillnet fisheries affects threatened species that use this region as a breeding and feeding area. The identification of hotspot areas of bycatch is necessary to design and prioritize efficient spatial-temporal closures that protect the largest possible number of threatened species of marine megafauna. In this context, the use of a multispecies approach is an important step towards planning effective fisheries management measures. This study has two main objectives: (1) to identify hotspot areas of bycatch in gillnet fisheries for the most threatened marine megafauna species on the continental shelf of Rio Grande do Sul (RS); (2) compare single species and multispecies mapping methods for the identification of these areas. To meet these objectives, data collected by onboard observers during fishing trips in the coastal commercial RS-based gillnet fleet between 2013 and 2015 and between 2018 and 2020 were analyzed. For the identification of the areas, hierarchical Bayesian spatio-temporal models were implemented, using monospecific and multispecific approaches and a weighting system for the conservation status of the species. Both approaches provide similar results, identifying three bycatch hotspots according to the time frame analysed. Based on our findings, we propose these areas as the top candidates for fishing exclusion zones, based on their biodiversity value. The suggested spatio-temporal closures would benefit several endangered species while also contributing to the recovery of fish populations.

AB  - Southern mountain caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) inhabit the interior mountain ranges of British Columbia, Canada. This population of woodland caribou is federally designated as threatened owing primarily to predation and habitat loss, but other compounding factors may impede their recovery. Of note are potential impacts from heli-skiing, a form of winter recreation that uses helicopters to transport skiers in wilderness areas. During late-winter, southern mountain caribou become range resident in high-elevation, old-growth forests and subalpine parklands. The deep snow characteristic of late-winter habitat offers reduced encounters with predators, and abundant arboreal lichens on which to feed; however, heli-skiing also occurs in these areas. Whether heli-skiing has any demographic impacts on caribou is unknown, but previous work has shown that heli-skiing can elicit short-term flight responses and longer-term reductions in space use and elevated stress levels. Furthermore, little is known about where skiing occurs or where helicopters transport skiers between lodges and ski areas, leaving regulating bodies with little information to guide management recommendations. We paired anonymized fitness tracker user data from the rasterized Strava global heatmap with 4 years of caribou global positioning system (GPS) location data to identify hotspots of potential interactions between heli-skiers and caribou. There were approximately 400 km2 where the potential for conflict appeared high out of 3,116 km2 suitable for heli-skiing. The majority of heli-ski operators have the capacity to reduce their interactions with caribou to almost zero through avoidance of key habitats and timing of use of that terrain. We recommend that heli-ski operators work with governmental managers towards the optimal use of tenures through rolling closures or the permanent diversion of ski runs away from high potential conflict areas.

AB  - Kelp aquaculture is an emerging industry outside of Asia. To be successful, this industry requires a reliable production of seedstock, the optimisation of which greatly benefits from a detailed physiological understanding of the microscopic life-cycle stages of the cultured species. This study investigated the impact of six zoospore densities (10-278 mm(-2)) on the subsequent development of Ecklonia radiata gametophytes and sporophytes. The results showed that germination rates and sex ratio were unaffected by initial zoospore density, but there were significant effects on gametophyte size and sporophyte production. After two weeks, female gametophytes were largest at an initial zoospore density of 40 mm(-2) while male gametophytes grew largest at densities below 40 mm(-2), but after four weeks gametophyte size showed a negative relationship with initial zoospore density. Significantly more sporophytes developed at initial zoospore densities below 40 individuals mm(-2) and no sporophytes were observed at the highest density (271 zoospores mm(-2)). These results clearly show the importance of initial zoospore density in optimising the nursery stage of kelp aquaculture.

AB  - Rare plant species often suffer less damage than common species because of positive density-dependent herbivory, and it has been suggested that this 'rare species advantage' fosters plant species coexistence. However, it is unknown whether rare species have an advantage when pollination interactions are also considered.
   We hypothesized that a 'positive density-dependent pollination success' across plant species would result in common plants experiencing higher seed set rates compared to rare species, and that positive density-dependent effects would negate or even override the positive density-dependent damage due to herbivory resulting in higher seed loss rates in common plant species.
   We tested this hypothesis by concurrently examining a plant-predispersal seed predator system and a plant-pollinator system for 24 Asteraceae species growing in an alpine meadow community (Sichuan Province, China). Having previously reported a positive density-dependent effect on seed loss rates due to seed predators, we here focus on the density-dependent effects on pollination success by investigating pollinator species richness, visitation frequencies and seed set rates for each plant species. We also estimated the seed output rate of each plant species as the product of seed set rate and the rate of surviving seeds (i.e. 1 - the seed loss rate).
   Consistent with our hypothesis, a positive density-dependent effect was observed for pollinator species richness, visitation frequencies and seed set rates across plant species. Moreover, the positive effect overrode the negative density-dependent effect of herbivores on seed production, such that common species tended to have a higher seed output rate than rare species (i.e. we observed a 'rare species disadvantage').
   These results indicate that the low seed output rate of rare species might result from a pollination limitation, and that both mutualistic and antagonistic interactions should be examined simultaneously to fully understand plant species coexistence in local communities.

AB  - To reduce the risk of zoonoses, it is necessary to understand the infection process, including the ecology of animals and vectors (i.e., the 'One Health' approach). In temperate climates, ticks are the major vectors of zoonoses, so factors determining their abundance, such as host mammal abundance and microhabitat conditions, should be clarified. Sika deer (Cervus nippon) are a major tick host and are rapidly expanding their distribution in Japan. We established 12 plots along a gradient of sika deer abundance in Tochigi Prefecture, Japan. We monitored the occurrence of mammal species with camera traps and sampled questing ticks on a monthly basis by flagging along three transects (center of a trail, forest edge, and forest interior) at each site from April to November 2018. The camera traps recorded 12 mammal species, predominantly sika deer. Five Haemaphysalis species and three Ixodes species were sampled. The numbers of ticks sampled were explained by the photographic frequency of sika deer, and partly by that of other mammal species, depending on tick species and their developmental stages. The numbers of sampled adult and nymphal ticks were the highest at the forest edge, where vegetation cover was greatest. Thus, vegetation management in tick habitats and the control of sika deer populations may reduce tick abundance.

AB  - Human wild-boar conflict is one of the prominent issues in Nepal, especially in areas adjacent to protected areas. Wild boars cause substantial damage to the agricultural crops and affect the lives of rural farmers through economic loss. However, the extent of this loss varies across protected areas. Thus, this study aims to compare the economic loss due to crop damage by wild boar between two protected areas with different management regimes; Shuklaphanta National Park (ShNP) and Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve (DHR). We used a questionnaire survey and descriptive statistics to characterize and compare the pattern of human wild boar conflicts between ShNP and DHR. Altogether, the two protected areas experienced a crop damage of 87,035.78 kg with an estimated economic loss of 26,389 USD within a year in our study. The most damaged crop in the ShNP was paddy whereas that in DHR was potato. We recorded a higher crop damage and economic loss in ShNP than in DHR. However, the severity of conflict is higher in DHR with around 8 % of the total production damaged by wild boar. Although the government declared wild boar an agricultural menace in 2023 and permitted killing on private lands, local communities should also apply other mitigation measures to prevent wild boars from entering crop fields. Additionally, the potential introduction of trophy hunting in ShNP (already permitted in DHR), following comprehensive studies, could help reduce economic losses associated with human-wild boar conflicts. Such combined efforts could create a more sustainable approach to managing wild boar populations while safeguarding local agriculture and livelihoods.

AB  - The intestinal microbiota plays an important role in the digestion and absorption of nutrients in animals. To address the challenge of conservation, many endangered wildlife are kept in captive or semi-captive conditions. Numerous studies have been conducted on the intestinal microbiota of captive animals, but little information is available on the intestinal microbiota of semi-captive animals, such as Przewalski's gazelle (Procapra przewalskii), which is an endangered ungulate species only distributed around Qinghai Lake in China. In this study, we used high-throughput sequencing methods to analyze the gut bacterial community of semi-captive Przewalski's gazelles during summer and winter. There were differences in the gut bacterial community composition between the 2 seasons, with higher bacterial diversity in winter. Deterministic processes dominated the bacterial community assembly in both seasons. There was a greater influence of heterogeneous selection in winter compared to summer, suggesting that there was more intestinal environmental filtering and selection on shaping the gut bacterial community during winter. There were more potential probiotic bacteria and fewer potential pathogens in winter compared to summer. Overall, stronger heterogeneous selection in winter might enhance gut selection for potential probiotic bacteria and filter out potential pathogens in Przewalski's gazelles, allowing them to adapt to the harsh living conditions in winter. Our study clarified that seasonal fluctuations trigger shifts in bacterial communities, which have potential benefits for Przewalski's gazelles. These results could provide valuable information for managing semi-captive populations and for future wild releases of Przewalski's gazelles.

AB  - Camera traps and acoustic recording devices are essential tools to quantify the distribution, abundance and behavior of mobile species. Varying detection probabilities among device locations must be accounted for when analyzing such data, which is generally done using occupancy models. We introduce a Bayesian time-dependent observation model for camera trap data (Tomcat), suited to estimate relative event densities in space and time. Tomcat allows to learn about the environmental requirements and daily activity patterns of species while accounting for imperfect detection. It further implements a sparse model that deals well will a large number of potentially highly correlated environmental variables. By integrating both spatial and temporal information, we extend the notation of overlap coefficient between species to time and space to study niche partitioning. We illustrate the power of Tomcat through an application to camera trap data of eight sympatrically occurring duiker Cephalophinae species in the savanna - rainforest ecotone in the Central African Republic and show that most species pairs show little overlap. Exceptions are those for which one species is very rare, likely as a result of direct competition.

AB  - Biodiversity provides essential ecosystem services to agriculture, including pest control and pollination, yet it is declining at an alarming rate, largely due to the agricultural sector. The introduction of genetically modified (GM) crops in the United States marked a major transformation of agricultural production, as over 90% of US corn, soybean and cotton areas are now planted with GM varieties. This shift in crop cultivation has substantially altered crop management practices, most notably the types and quantities of pesticides used. Despite the magnitude of these changes, the impact on biodiversity is still poorly understood. Here we estimate the causal impact of GM crops on bird diversity in the United States and compare bird communities through time in areas with different levels of exposure to GM crops. We find that insectivorous birds benefit from GM crop adoption and that this benefit is largest in cotton. In contrast, herbivorous birds weakly decrease with GM crop adoption. Thus, while GM crop adoption has a small positive effect on overall abundance of birds, the effect is heterogeneous across species groups, with potentially important consequences for bird community composition and associated ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes.
   The effects of genetically modified (GM) crops on biodiversity is not well understood, yet could have important implications due to the many ecosystem services provided by biodiversity to agricultural landscapes. This study evaluates the impact of GM crops on bird diversity in the United States.

AB  - Human-wildlife conflict poses significant ecological and socio-economic challenges, particularly in rural communities where agriculture and livestock rearing form the backbone of livelihoods. Despite the growing importance of this issue, District Lakki Marwat remains an unexplored area of northwest Pakistan. This study aims to fill this gap by systematically assessing the status, economic impacts, and community perceptions of five wildlife species: wild boar (Sus scrofa), grey wolf (Canis lupus), golden jackal (Canis aureus), striped hyena (Hyaena hyaena), and red fox (Vulpes vulpes). Using semi-structured surveys with 117 respondents, we analyzed species prevalence, perceived danger levels, crop damage patterns, and predation impacts on livestock and poultry. The findings revealed that wild boars were identified as the primary contributors to agricultural damage, with total annual crop losses surpassing the economic impacts attributed to the studied carnivores. On average, each surveyed household experienced an annual loss of PKR 4510.38. For the 39% of households reporting crop damage, the annual loss per reported household was PKR 11,727, which was higher than the average annual loss across all households, underscoring the severity of the impact on those specifically affected by the wild boar-related crop damage. Notably, community attitudes were most negative toward wild boars, a pattern driven by the economic burden of crop losses, challenging the conventional focus on carnivores as the primary conflict species. A Pearson's X2 test confirmed strong associations between species and perceived danger levels, while regression analysis demonstrated an association between crop damage and negative attitudes. Traditional deterrents like thorn fences were found ineffective against wild boars. More advanced methods, including game-proof fencing, trenches, bio-fencing, crop rotation, audio and visual deterrents, taste and order repellents, and watchtowers combined with group vigilance, are recommended to reduce crop damage. Integrating these approaches with community-based education, habitat management, and government-supported compensation schemes can mitigate wild boar impacts. This study contributes new insights into multi-species HWC dynamics, demonstrating that community perceptions are primarily shaped by the economic impact of a species, regardless of whether it is a carnivore or an omnivore. The attitudes of local communities are driven by the financial losses incurred, rather than the species' behavior or ecological role. This study underscores the need for collaborative efforts to reduce human-wildlife conflict, foster coexistence, and ensure ecological balance in vulnerable rural areas.

AB  - Context Wildlife avoid human disturbances, including roads and development. Avoidance and displacement of wildlife into less suitable habitat due to human development can affect their energy expenditures and fitness. The heart rate and oxygen uptake of large mammals varies with both natural aspects of their habitat (terrain, climate, predators, etc.) and anthropogenic influence (noise, light, fragmentation, etc.). Although incorporating physiological analyses of energetics can inform the impacts of both development and conservation, management decisions rarely incorporate individuals' energetic requirements when deciding on locations for potential development. Objectives We aimed to estimate the change in expected energy expenditure, numerically and spatially, for mule deer to traverse a landscape with varying levels of oil and gas development through time. Methods Using calculations of energy expenditure of mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) by weight, in relation to physical terrain components, plus avoidance factors for anthropogenic disturbance, we developed a spatiotemporal model of the minimum energy required for mule deer to traverse a landscape. We compared expected energy expenditure across 12 study sites with increasing levels of oil and gas development and over time in our study area, on the northern Colorado Plateau of Utah. Results We found that energy expenditure can be increased by development, regardless of terrain, through increased travel distance associated with avoidance behavior. Maximum median energy expenditure to traverse a 1400 ha sample area rose from 1135 to 1935 kilocalories, a 70% increase in energy required of a mule deer. There was a significant relationship between energy expenditure and the size of oil and gas development (p < 0.001), its compactness (p < 0.05), and its 'thinness' (p < 0.001), but not terrain ruggedness (p = 0.25). Conclusion As the energy costs of movement correlate across multiple species of large mammals, our analysis of the energetic cost, for mule deer, associated with development can serve as a quantitative representative of the impacts of oil and gas development for multiple mammals-including threatened or endangered species. Our bioenergetic cost-distance model provides a means of delineating impediments to efficient movement and can be used to quantify the expected energetic costs of proposed future developments. As wildlife are exposed to increasing anthropogenic stressors which reduce fitness, it is important to make strategic siting decisions to reduce energetic costs imposed by human activities.

AB  - The use of species detection rates gathered from motion-sensitive cameras as relative abundance indices (RAIs) could be a cost-effective tool to monitor wildlife populations; however, validations based on comparisons with reference methods are necessary. We considered 3 ungulates, wild boar (Sus scrofa), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), and fallow deer (Dama dama), and compared 2 different RAIs with independent indices of density obtained through feces counts across 3 summers (2019-2021) in a protected area of central Italy. We estimated the number of detections per day (RAI(events)), and the number of individuals per day (RAI(individuals)) from remote camera videos. Both indices were correlated with density estimates, yet only RAI(individuals) correctly ranked interspecific densities. Values of RAI(events) for the most abundant and gregarious ungulate (i.e., wild boar) were biased low and were lower than those of fallow deer. The uncertainty of RAIs was acceptable for the 2 most abundant study species (CVs <= 25%) but was greater for roe deer. At the intra-specific level, density estimates and RAIs showed comparable but slight inter-annual variation. Our results support the use of RAIs derived from motion-sensitive cameras as a promising and cost-effective tool to monitor ungulate populations, and researchers should incorporate group size into monitoring. We advocate the necessity of field tests based on comparison with locally reliable reference methods to validate the use of motion-sensitive cameras.

AB  - Invasive wild pig populations have undergone enormous increases in the United States and particularly across the southern U.S. in recent years. High fecundity rates and abilities to adapt quickly to varied habitats have enabled pig populations to become entrenched and difficult to eliminate. The pigs cause many negative impacts on ecosystems including degradation of water quality through infusion of fecal contamination and other non-point source pollutants. Our goal was to determine the effects of pig removal on water quality in streams that were known to be significantly polluted by pig activity Bolds (J Environ Qual 50: 441-453, 2021). We compared e. coli and fecal coliform concentrations and loads in streams between a pre-removal period with those that occurred during the removal activities. Results suggest that e. coli and fecal coliform concentrations were reduced by 75 and 50% respectively through pig removal efforts. Questions remain concerning the longevity of the reduction especially once pig removal activities decrease in intensity.

AB  - Simple Summary Small ruminants in northwestern Spain are frequently managed in mixed flocks. Sheep-goat joint management has not been considered a risk factor for parasite infection, so the main objective of this study was to establish if mixed management with goats supposes a risk factor for parasitic infections in ovine flocks. Goat contact was a risk factor for sheep to be infected by protostrongylids, Dictyocaulus filaria, gastrointestinal nematodes and Eimeria spp. In relation to host-specific parasites, goats cannot be considered as a source for sheep, but competition for food and spaces between both small ungulates can suppose a reduced grazing area to sheep, provoking high environmental contamination and stress that facilitate their infection. Small ruminants in northwestern Spain are frequently managed in mixed flocks. Sheep-goat joint management has not been considered a risk factor for parasite infection, so the main objective of this study was to establish if mixed management with goats supposes a risk factor for parasitic infections in ovine flocks. Two thousand and ninety-three sheep were sampled from 74 commercial meat ovine flocks for diagnostic of the main parasites. Goat contact was a risk factor for sheep to be infected by protostrongylids, Dictyocaulus filaria, gastrointestinal nematodes and Eimeria spp. In contrast, Moniezia, Fasciola hepatica, Dicrocoelium dendriticum and Paramphistomidae prevalences were not influenced. Sheep-goat mixed management can be considered as a risk factor, since goats would act as a source of pasture contamination for interspecific parasites (protostrongylids, Dictyocaulus filaria and gastrointestinal nematodes). In relation to host-specific parasites, such as Eimeria spp., goats cannot be considered as a source for sheep, but competition for food and spaces between both small ungulates can suppose a reduced grazing area to sheep, provoking high environmental contamination and stress that facilitate their infection. Future epidemiological studies for parasitic infections in small ruminants should consider sheep-goat mixed management as a possible risk factor to be included in multivariate analyses.

AB  - The influence of climate change on marine organism abundance has rarely been assessed (1) at the functional-group level; (2) simultaneously in major functional groups within the same ecosystem; (3) for >10 years; and (4) at metapopulation/community scales. A study simultaneously addressing these gaps would greatly enhance our understanding of the influence of climate change on marine ecosystems. Here, we analyzed 21 years of abundance data at the functional-group and species levels on a regional scale for four major functional groups (benthic algae, sessile animals, herbivorous benthos, and carnivorous benthos) in a rocky intertidal habitat along the northeastern Pacific coast of Japan. We aimed to examine the 21-year trends in regional abundance at both functional-group and species levels, plus their driving mechanisms and their dependence on species properties (thermal niche, calcification status, and vertical niche). Significant temporal trends in abundance were detected at functional-group levels for benthic algae (increasing) and herbivores and carnivores (both decreasing); they followed the temporal population trends of the dominant species. At species level, the metapopulation size of 12 of 31 species were increasing and 4 of those were decreasing, depending on the thermal niche and species calcification status. At both functional-group and species levels, temporal trends in abundance are caused by the direct or indirect influence of warming and ocean acidification. Comparing these results with community responses to marine heat waves in the same study area offered two implications: (1) long-term ecosystem changes associated with global warming will be unpredictable from the community response to marine heat waves, possibly owing to a lack of knowledge of the influence of calcifying status on species' responses to climate change; and (2) thermal niches contribute greatly to predictions of the influence of warming on population size, regardless of the time scale.

AB  - Exclusion of ground-nesting ants from tree canopies is an ant-management technique used in fruit crops. This strategy aims to disrupt the symbiotic relationship between ants and honeydew-producing herbivores, which are protected by ants, and enhance the biological control of these herbivores. Here, we evaluated this strategy to enhance the biological control of mealybugs in persimmon, but obtained an unexpected outcome. Using a randomized block design in a commercial persimmon orchard during two consecutive years, we demonstrated that physical barriers based on sticky bands excluded native ground-nesting ant species from persimmon trees and reduced the protection that these ants provided to mealybugs. The exclusion of native ground-nesting ants also increased the density and efficacy of the biological control agents of the mealybug. However, physical barriers favoured the establishment of the exotic canopy-nesting ant species Cardiocondyla obscurior. This ant species established its colonies under the sepals of persimmon fruit, and its abundance increased by more than 10 times in trees with physical barriers. Our results show that the exclusion of native ground-nesting from fruit trees can promote the control of invasive mealybugs, but may also facilitate the establishment and spread of exotic canopy-nesting ant species, hence increasing their invasive potential. Further research should evaluate alternative ant management strategies to enhance biological control of honeydew-producing herbivores without benefiting exotic canopy-nesting ant species.

AB  - In arid and semiarid environments, the sustainability of rehabilitation actions in degraded areas is a matter of concern. It has not been extensively researched. In a Spanish coal mining area, new soils to support vegetation were created (Technosols) using mine spoils and different organic wastes. Eight years after the establishment of rehabilitation measures, the quality of the works was assessed. Soil properties (organic matter, microbial biomass, structural stability and porosity) were evaluated as quality indicators. Thermogravimetric analysis differentiated between organic-C and other mineral-C sources. The degree of aggregation and the presence of interconnected pores and organic matter with different degrees of decomposition were identified by micromorphological techniques. Microbial biomass and water-stable aggregates satisfactorily traced the early pedogenesis of mine spoils, resulting in good indicators of the quality of new Technosols. Substrates prepared with sludges promoted soil development better than those created using pig slurries, primarily by favoring a higher porosity and organic matter content. Despite that, both treatments demonstrated, after 8 years, their ability to support the ecosystem services of biomass production, carbon sequestration, and organic matter recycling they were planned for, therefore ensuring their sustainability.

AB  - History has profoundly affected the composition, distribution, and abundances of species in contemporary ecosystems. A full understanding of how ecosystems work and change must therefore take history into account. We offer four well-studied examples illustrating how a knowledge of history has strengthened interpretations of modern systems: the development of molluscan antipredatory defenses in relation to shell-breaking predators; the North Pacific kelp ecosystem with sea otters, smaller predators, sea urchins, and large herbivores; estuarine ecosystems affected by the decline in oysters and other suspension feeders; and the legacy of extinct large herbivores and frugivores in tropical American forests. Many current ecological problems would greatly benefit from a historical perspective. We highlight four of these: soil depletion and tree stunting in forests related to the disappearance of large consumers; the spread of anoxic dead zones in the ocean, which we argue could be mitigated by restoring predator and suspension-feeding guilds; ocean acidification, which would be alleviated by more nutrient recycling by consumers in the aerobic ecosystem; and the relation between species diversity and keystone predators, a foundational concept that is complicated by simplified trophic relationships in modern ecosystems.

AB  - Context Habitat loss limits the dispersal of wide-ranging large mammals. It is pivotal to study the ecological and anthropogenic factors driving the habitat occupancy of large mammals for their long-term conservation and reduction of negative human-wildlife interactions.Objective To evaluate how the habitat occupancy pattern of the large mammals varies across a gradient of anthropogenic pressures.Methods We conducted ecological sign surveys across nine forest divisions including, Protected Areas (PAs) and outside PAs, along the Western and Eastern Ghats of Tamil Nadu, India. We used systematic grid-based Markovian occupancy model to study the effect of ecological and anthropogenic variables (prey abundance, habitat features, direct human disturbance and habitat fragmentation) on tiger (Panthera tigris), leopard (Panthera pardus), dhole (Cuon alpinus), elephant (Elephas maximus) and gaur (Bos gaurus) occupancy at 100 km(2) scale.Results Tiger and dhole occupancy was driven by the abundance of large and medium-sized prey. However, leopards also relied on the available small prey species and utilised fragmented forest patches. Large mammal occupancy increased in contiguous forests with water availability and decreased in landscapes with increased human disturbances and habitat fragmentation. Tiger occupancy was highly confined towards contiguous PA network while the rest of them had scattered but concentrated occupancy towards PAs.Conclusions The dependency of large mammals on contiguous forests suggests improving the quality and connectivity of forested habitats for their dispersal and reducing negative human-wildlife interactions. The low occupancy areas require urgent habitat management intervention to reduce grazing pressure and restore degraded habitats to sustain viable large mammal population at landscape-level.

AB  - Anthropogenic disturbance elicits adaptive responses in wildlife, generally aimed at riskavoidance, ultimately imposing constraints on their spatial and temporal niches. Previous studies have largely focused on long-term adaptive responses to stable human pressure, but rapid adjustments in wildlife's diel and habitat use patterns in response to fine-scale variations in human presence have so far been overlooked. In this study we estimate short-term spatio-temporal deviations in local habitat use and diel activity of medium and large mammal species in response to rapid variations in human disturbance. We employed a year-long camera-trapping within a small private reserve, and recorded spatio-temporal information on all sources of anthropogenic disturbance in the area. By controlling for the average habitat use and diel activity, we explored fine-scale spatiotemporal adjustments in seven mammal species. We found evidence of spatial and/or temporal avoidance across all species, except wild boar, with variations in magnitude and direction coherent with species traits and expected levels of human-tolerance. Most species exhibited temporal avoidance of human activities, with porcupine and roe deer eliciting particularly strong responses. Notably, foxes concurrently displayed temporal avoidance and spatial attraction, likely driven by the presence of anthropogenic trophic resources. Our study underscores the role of behavioral plasticity in enabling wildlife to adjust daily habitat use and activity patterns to varying levels of human pressure across space and time. Understanding these nuanced behavioral strategies can help to promote wildlife-human coexistence and mitigating the adverse impacts of human presence on wildlife fitness.

AB  - The relative roles of plants competing for resources versus top-down control of vegetation by herbivores, in turn impacted by predators, during early stages of tropical forest succession remain poorly understood. Here we examine the impact of insectivorous birds, bats, and ants exclusion on arthropods communities on replicated 5 x 5 m of pioneering early successional vegetation plots in lowland tropical forest gaps in Papua New Guinea. In plots from which focal taxa of predators were excluded we observed increased biomass of herbivorous and predatory arthropods, and increased density, and decreased diversity of herbivorous insects. However, changes in the biomass of plants, herbivores, and arthropod predators were positively correlated or uncorrelated between these three trophic levels and also between individual arthropod orders. Arthropod abundance and biomass correlated strongly with the plant biomass irrespective of the arthropods' trophic position, a signal of bottom-up control. Patterns in herbivore specialization confirm lack of a strong top-down control and were largely unaffected by the exclusion of insectivorous birds, bats, and ants. No changes of plant-herbivore interaction networks were detected except for decrease in modularity of the exclosure plots. Our results suggest weak top-down control of herbivores, limited compensation between arthropod and vertebrate predators, and limited intra-guild predation by birds, bats, and ants. Possible explanations are strong bottom-up control, a low activity of the higher order predators, especially birds, possibly also bats, in gaps, and continuous influx of herbivores from surrounding mature forest matrix.

AB  - Understanding the processing of limiting nutrients among organisms is an important goal of community ecology. Less known is how human disturbances may alter the stoichiometric patterns among organisms from different trophic levels within communities. Here, we investigated how livestock grazing affects the C:N:P ecological stoichiometry of soils, plants (Leymus chinensis), and grasshoppers (Euchorthippus spp.) in a semi-arid grassland in northeastern China. We found that grazing significantly enhanced soil available N and leaf N content of the dominant L. chinensis grass by 15% and 20%, respectively. Grazing also reduced (soluble) C:N of L. chinensis leaves by 22%. However, grazing did not affect total C, N, or P contents nor their ratios in Euchorthippus grasshoppers. Our results reveal that the effects of grazing disturbances on elemental composition attenuated from lower to higher trophic levels. These findings support the theory that organisms from higher trophic levels have relatively stronger stoichiometric homeostasis compared to those from lower trophic levels. Moreover, grasshopper abundance dropped by 66% in the grazed areas, and they reduced the feeding time on their host L. chinensis grass by 43%, presumably to limit the intake of excess nitrogen from host plants. The energetic costs associated with the maintenance of elemental homeostasis likely reduced grasshopper individual performance and population abundance in the grazed areas. A comprehensive investigation of stoichiometric properties of organisms across trophic levels may enable a better understanding of the nature of species interactions, and facilitate predictions of the consequences of future environmental changes for a community organization.

AB  - Even though there is extensive research on the rocky reefs in the Gulf of California, some areas still have scarce information, such as the Farall & oacute;n de San Ignacio, which is well known for its high biodiversity and its location in the biogeographic transition zone known as the "Sinaloa gap." Due to the limited information available for this site, the present study aimed to describe the composition and structure of asteroid and echinoid fish assemblages at the Farall & oacute;n de San Ignacio. For this purpose, visual surveys were conducted in November 2016 using belt transects of 25 m long by 4 m wide for fish and 25 m long by 2 m wide for invertebrates, to estimate species abundance, richness, diversity, and evenness indices, and to compare them with other rocky reefs located at the same latitude on the western coast of the Gulf of California that were visited the same year. A total of 34 species were recorded, including two asteroids and four echinoids. The most abundant species were the fish Azurina atrilobata, the starfish Phataria unifacialis, and the sea urchin Diadema mexicanum. Despite the Farall & oacute;n's isolation, the complexity of its community structure is similar to that of other islands in the Gulf of California, although there were differences in species composition due to the high abundance of herbivorous species at this site.

AB  - Aquatic macrophytes, especially Vallisneria nana, provide essential spawning habitat and food resources for the threatened Australian lungfish (Neoceratodus forsteri). The availability of V. nana for lungfish has been dramatically reduced in some areas due to flood disturbances and macrophyte recovery is inhibited by reduced hydrochory due to river fragmentation by dams. Active transplanting of macrophytes may be a feasible restoration strategy to increase abundance of macrophytes, however, in the presence of macro-herbivorous aquatic animals, replanted beds may not persist due to intensive grazing. In this study, we analyzed the effects of environmental conditions on growth and expansion of transplanted V. nana in six 60 m2 herbivore exclosures in the mid-Brisbane River in subtropical south-east Queensland. Following establishment, we also quantified the impact of aquatic herbivores on different patch sizes (15 m2 or 45 m2) of restored V. nana to test the hypothesis that larger patch sizes may confer greater resistance to grazing using a paired control/treatment design. After initial planting, V. nana grew and spread rapidly throughout the exclosure plots, with mean % cover increasing from 5% to 71% on average and mean leaf length increasing from 20 cm to 54 cm on average over 161 days. Transplanted V. nana cover was significantly positively associated with water depth and finer substrate sizes and leaf length was significantly positively associated with water depth and water velocity but was unrelated to substrate size. Exposure to grazing significantly reduced cover of V. nana, however there was no significant effects of macrophyte patch size, grazing intensity, or environmental factors on changes in V. nana cover. Complete removal of exclosure fencing resulted in near complete loss of macrophytes within 7-22 days at all plots, indicating the macrophyte beds (15 m2-60 m2) were of insufficient size to resist grazing pressure. Our findings suggest that transplanting is a viable restoration method with exclusion of grazing, which is critical for creating resistant beds to disturbances and driving future macrophyte recovery. Further research is required to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of alternative macrophyte restoration strategies in rivers to foster hydrochory and natural regeneration processes following flood disturbance.

AB  - The widespread and accelerated transformation experienced by our planet results in populations of endangered species having to survive in highly-altered environments and increasingly relying on resources provided by human subsidies. Presently, vultures rank among the most imperiled functional groups of large vertebrates globally, a situation that is largely attributed to the rapid intensification of agriculture and the subsequent transformation of farming practices and agro-grazing landscapes. Hence, documenting the long-term fluctuations in the vultures' dietary patterns in response to environmental changes, particularly in livestock management, is of utmost significance. Here, by means of bulk stable isotope analysis (delta C-13 and delta N-15), we examined long-term variations in diet composition and niche breadth in a population of the endangered Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus) in the north of the Iberian Peninsula. We specifically focused on the effect of European sanitary regulations enacted in 2014, which allow sheep farmers to abandon livestock remains for consumption by scavenging birds, except for pig carcasses. We found that the implementation of these new regulations did not cause a change in the diet of vultures. Changes were only detected in scrubland areas and were driven by an increase in the consumption of wild rabbit which, in turn, lead to expansion of the trophic niche. These results indicate that these endangered vultures are heavily dependent on food sources derived from intensive farming, mostly of pigs illegally disposed in the wild, and moreover, highlight the importance of carcasses of small vertebrates, often disregarded in conservation programs in favor of the contribution of livestock remains. Our research provides valuable insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics of trophic strategies among avian scavengers, specifically in the context of changes resulting from intensified human-pressures on agro-grazing Mediterranean landscapes.
