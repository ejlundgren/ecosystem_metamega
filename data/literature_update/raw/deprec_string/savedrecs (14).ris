AB  - Background Tea plant breeding or cultivation mainly involves propagation via cuttings, which not only ensures the inheritance of the excellent characteristics of the mother plant but also facilitates mechanized management. The formation of adventitious root (AR) determines the success of cutting-based propagation, and auxin is an essential factor involved in this process. To understand the molecular mechanism underlying AR formation in nodal tea cuttings, transcriptome and endogenous hormone analysis was performed on the stem bases of red (mature)- and green (immature)-stem cuttings of 'Echa 1 hao' tea plant as affected by a pulse treatment with naphthalene acetic acid (NAA). Results In this study, NAA significantly promoted AR formation in both red- and green-stem cuttings but slightly reduced callus formation. External application of NAA reduced the levels of endogenous indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and cytokinin (TZR, trans-zeatin riboside). The number of DEGs (NAA vs. CK) identified in the green-stem cuttings was significantly higher than that in the red-stem cuttings, which corresponded to a higher rooting rate of green-stem cuttings under the NAA treatment. A total of 82 common DEGs were identified as being hormone-related and involved in the auxin, cytokinin, abscisic acid, ethylene, salicylic acid, brassinosteroid, and jasmonic acid pathways. The negative regulation of NAA-induced IAA and GH3 genes may explain the decrease of endogenous IAA. NAA reduced endogenous cytokinin levels and further downregulated the expression of cytokinin signalling-related genes. By the use of weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), several hub genes, including three [cellulose synthase (CSLD2), SHAVEN3-like 1 (SVL1), SMALL AUXIN UP RNA (SAUR21)] that are highly related to root development in other crops, were identified that might play important roles in AR formation in tea cuttings. Conclusions NAA promotes the formation of AR of tea cuttings in coordination with endogenous hormones. The most important endogenous AR inductor, IAA, was reduced in response to NAA. DEGs potentially involved in NAA-mediated AR formation of tea plant stem cuttings were identified via comparative transcriptome analysis. Several hub genes, such as CSLD2, SVL1 and SAUR21, were identified that might play important roles in AR formation in tea cuttings.

AB  - Negative memories engage a brain and body-wide stress response in humans that can alter cognition and behavior. Prolonged stress responses induce maladaptive cellular, circuit, and systems-level changes that can lead to pathological brain states and corresponding disorders in which mood and memory are affected. However, it is unclear if repeated activation of cells processing negative memories induces similar phenotypes in mice. In this study, we used an activity-dependent tagging method to access neuronal ensembles and assess their molecular characteristics. Sequencing memory engrams in mice revealed that positive (male-to-female exposure) and negative (foot shock) cells upregulated genes linked to anti- and pro-inflammatory responses, respectively. To investigate the impact of persistent activation of negative engrams, we chemogenetically activated them in the ventral hippocampus over 3 months and conducted anxiety and memory-related tests. Negative engram activation increased anxiety behaviors in both 6- and 14-month-old mice, reduced spatial working memory in older mice, impaired fear extinction in younger mice, and heightened fear generalization in both age groups. Immunohistochemistry revealed changes in microglial and astrocytic structure and number in the hippocampus. In summary, repeated activation of negative memories induces lasting cellular and behavioral abnormalities in mice, offering insights into the negative effects of chronic negative thinking-like behaviors on human health.

AB  - Despite its central role in regulating energy intake and metabolism, ghrelin is little understood when it comes to its effects on hepatic lipid and glucose metabolism. Growing pigs were intravenously injected with ghrelin receptor antagonist [D-Lys3]-GHRP-6 (DLys; 6 mg/kg body weight) for seven days to determine whether ghrelin plays a role in glucose and lipid metabolism. DLys treatment significantly reduced body weight gain and adipose histopathology found that DLys treatment dramatically reduced adipocyte size. DLys treatment significantly increased serum NEFA and insulin levels, hepatic glucose level and HOMA-IR, and significantly decreased serum TBA level of growing pigs after fasting. Moreover, DLys treatment changed the dynamics of serum metabolic parameters, including glucose, NEFA, TBA, insulin, GH, leptin, and cortisol. Liver transcriptome showed that DLys treatment affected the metabolism-related pathways. Compared with the control group, adipose tissue lipolysis (the adipose triglyceride lipase level was significantly increased), hepatic gluconeogenesis (the G6PC protein level was significantly increased) and fatty acid oxidation (the CPT1A protein level was significantly increased) were promoted in the DLys group. DLys treatment expanded degrees of oxidative phosphorylation in the liver, coming about in a higher NAD+ /NADH proportion and enactment of the SIRT1 signaling pathway. Additionally, the liver protein levels of the DLys group were significantly higher than those of the control group for GHSR, PPAR alpha, and PGC-1. To summarize, inhibition of ghrelin activity can significantly affect metabolism and alter energy levels by enhancing fat mobilization, hepatic fatty acid oxidation and gluconeogenesis without affecting fatty acid uptake and synthesis in the liver.

AB  - The small intestine is the main site for digestion and absorption of nutrients, and the development of the small intestine can be affected by several factors, such as diet composition, age, and genotype. Thus, this study aimed to compare the small intestinal morphology and digestive function differences at different ages of three pig breeds. Thirty litters of newborn Taoyuan black (TB), Xiangcun black (XB), and Duroc (DR) piglets (ten litters per breed) were selected for this study. Ten piglets from each breed were selected and sampled at 1, 10, 21, and 24 days old. The results showed that the TB and XB piglets had lower growth but had higher lactase and maltase activities in the jejunum compared with the DR piglets, while most of the digestive enzyme activities in the ileum were higher in the DR piglets at different ages. The expression levels of nutrient transporters, mainly including amino acids, glucose, and fatty acids transporters, differed in the jejunum at different ages among three pig breeds and were higher in the DR piglets at 1 day old and XB piglets at 24 days old. Collectively, these findings suggest that the phenotypic differences in the growth, intestinal morphology, and digestive function among the three pig breeds mainly resulted from the differences in digestive enzymes and nutrient transporters in the intestine.

AB  - Bovicola ovis, commonly known as the sheep-biting louse, is an ectoparasite that adversely affects the sheep industry. Sheep louse infestation lowers the quality of products, including wool and leather, causing a loss of approximately AUD 123M per annum in Australia alone. The lack of a high-quality genome assembly for the sheep-biting louse, as well as any closely related livestock lice, has hindered the development of louse research and management control tools. In this study, we present the assembly of B. ovis with a genome size of similar to 123 Mbp based on a nanopore long-read sequencing library and Illumina RNA sequencing, complemented with a chromosome-level scaffolding using the Pore-C multiway chromatin contact dataset. Combining multiple alignment and gene prediction tools, a comprehensive annotation on the assembled B. ovis genome was conducted and recalled 11,810 genes as well as other genomic features including orf, ssr, rRNA and tRNA. A manual curation using alignment with the available closely related louse species, Pediculus humanus, increased the number of annotated genes to 16,024. Overall, this study reported critical genetic resources and biological insights for the advancement of sheep louse research and the development of sustainable control strategies in the sheep industry.

AB  - In this present study, we aimed to investigate the effects of adding tea polyphenols to feed on the immunity, antioxidant capacity, and gut microbiota of weaned goat kids. Thirty weaned kids (Leizhou goats, average initial weight of 9.32 +/- 1.72 kg, 2 months old) were randomly divided into five groups with six kids in each group, with half being male and half being female. The control (CON) group was fed the basal diet, and the four other groups were supplemented with 2, 4, or 6 g/kg tea polyphenols or 50 mg/kg chlortetracycline in the basal diet (denoted as the T1, T2, T3, and CTC groups, respectively). The results showed that compared to the CON and CTC groups, adding 4 or 6 g/kg tea polyphenols could increase the expression levels of serum antioxidant enzymes and intestinal antioxidant genes in the kids. It also increased the expression of Nrf2 and IL-10 in the intestine, while reducing the content and gene expression of cytokines (IL-1 beta, IL-6, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha). Dietary supplementation with 4 or 6 g/kg tea polyphenols reduced the expression levels of TLR4, MyD88, and NF kappa B in intestinal tissue, activated intestinal protective mechanisms, and enhanced the immune defense of the intestinal epithelium. Compared to the CTC group, feeding tea polyphenols significantly increased the Simpson indices. However, adding 4 g/kg tea polyphenols significantly increased the relative abundance of Verrucomicrobiota, Candidatus Soleaferrea, the Christensenellaceae R-7 group, and Prevotella, as well as the acetic acid content in the cecum of the kids (p < 0.05). Overall, the results indicate that dietary supplementation with 4 g/kg of tea polyphenols can effectively maintain the homeostasis of the gut microbiota and enhance the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant capabilities of weaned kids.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of yeast cell-wall polysaccharides (YCWPs) on lamb meat quality and the mechanisms underlying these effects. Twenty-four lambs were randomly assigned to four groups and were fed a basal diet supplemented with 0 (Control), 0.5 (YCWP 0.5), 1 (YCWP 1), and 2 (YCWP 2) g/day of YCWP, respectively, for 50 days. After a 12-h fast, the animals were slaughtered, and the rumen fluid, rumen digesta, and longissimus lumborum muscles were immediately collected. Fatty acid (FA) composition was analyzed using gas chromatography, and ruminal microbiota was characterized through microbial community sequencing. The results suggested that YCWP 2 supplementation enhanced meat color 45 min postmortem and improved muscle FA profile, as evidenced by the increased redness-greenness value and health-promoting FA levels, respectively. Moreover, microbial diversity analysis showed that YCWP altered rumen bacterial diversity to varying degrees at different doses. At the phylum level, YCWP 1 increased Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and Tenericutes abundance, whereas YCWP 2 increased Proteobacteria abundance but reduced that of Tenericutes. At the genus level, YCWP 1 increased unclassified Ruminococcaceae, Clostridium, Coprococcus, Succiniclasticum, and Anaerovibrio abundance, whereas YCWP 2 increased those of unclassified Bacteroidales, unclassified Veillonellaceae, and CF231. Furthermore, YCWP 2 modified rumen FA profile by enhancing unsaturated FA production by modulating ruminal biohydrogenation. Correlation analysis showed that changes in rumen bacterial composition correlated with rumen FA profiles, and these FA profiles in turn correlated with the FA composition of lamb meat. These findings provide novel insights into diet-induced regulation of FA composition in ruminant meat.

AB  - The emergence of new bacterial pathogens is a continuing challenge for agriculture and food safety. Salmonella Typhimurium is a major cause of foodborne illness worldwide, with pigs a major zoonotic reservoir. Two phylogenetically distinct variants, U288 and ST34, emerged in UK pigs around the same time but present different risk to food safety. Here we show using genomic epidemiology that ST34 accounts for over half of all S. Typhimurium infections in people while U288 less than 2%. That the U288 clade evolved in the recent past by acquiring AMR genes, indels in the virulence plasmid pU288-1, and accumulation of loss-of-function polymorphisms in coding sequences. U288 replicates more slowly and is more sensitive to desiccation than ST34 isolates and exhibited distinct pathogenicity in the murine model of colitis and in pigs. U288 infection was more disseminated in the lymph nodes while ST34 were recovered in greater numbers in the intestinal contents. These data are consistent with the evolution of S. Typhimurium U288 adaptation to pigs that may determine their reduced zoonotic potential.
   Mark Kirkwood et al. take an epidemiological, genomic, phylogenetic, and experimental approach to assess the evolutionary origins and virulence of the U288 and ST34 isolates of Salmonella enterica in affecting livestock and potentially humans. Their results indicate that the molecular evolution of these isolates is associated with altered pathogenicity in pigs and reduced zoonotic potential of U288.

AB  - Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are considered promising candidates for future grid energy storage, with hard carbons emerging as key commercial anode materials. This study presents a novel approach to synthesize N-doped hard carbons via co-hydrothermal treatment of vine shoots and pig manure and subsequent thermal annealing of the resulting hydrochar. This method enhances the development of micro- and ultra-microporosity in the synthesized hard carbons, with nitrogen, and to a lesser extent phosphorus and sulfur, introduced as doping elements. Furthermore, the incorporation of hydrochloric acid during the hydrothermal step promotes biomass hydrolysis, leading to increased mesoporosity and the formation of microsphere clusters. In the realm of electrochemical performance, an investigation into various ester- and ether-based electrolytes has revealed NaPF 6 in diglyme as the best formulation, thanks to its thinner and more stable solid electrolyte interface (SEI). Using this electrolyte, the best-performing electrode showed an initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) of 73 %, with reversible capacities of 239, 180, 86, and 57 mAh g-1 at 0.1, 1, 5, and 10 A g-1 , respectively. In addition, the electrode exhibited a remarkable capacity retention of 88 % after 250 cycles as well as a compatible behavior when paired with a NVPF-based cathode.

AB  - BackgroundTea-oil Camellia within the genus Camellia is renowned for its premium Camellia oil, often described as "Oriental olive oil". So far, only one partial mitochondrial genomes of Tea-oil Camellia have been published (no main Tea-oil Camellia cultivars), and comparative mitochondrial genomic studies of Camellia remain limited.ResultsIn this study, we first reconstructed the entire mitochondrial genome of C. drupifera to gain insights into its genetic structure and evolutionary history. Through our analysis, we observed a characteristic multi-branched configuration in the mitochondrial genomes of C. drupifera. A thorough examination of the protein-coding regions (PCGs) across Camellia species identified gene losses that occurred during their evolution. Notably, repeat sequences showed a weak correlation between the abundance of simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and genome size of Camellia. Additionally, despite of the considerable variations in the sizes of Camellia mitochondrial genomes, there was little diversity in GC content and gene composition. The phylogenetic tree derived from mitochondrial data was inconsistent with that generated from chloroplast data.ConclusionsIn conclusion, our study provides valuable insights into the molecular characteristics and evolutionary mechanisms of multi-branch mitochondrial structures in Camellia. The high-resolution mitogenome of C. drupifera enhances our understanding of multi-branch mitogenomes and lays a solid groundwork for future advancements in genomic improvement and germplasm innovation within Tea-oil Camellia.

AB  - Simple Summary: European pig meat production is highly dependent on imported soybean meal (SBM). The area of field beans produced in the EU has increased greatly in recent years. There is renewed interest in field beans as an energy and protein source. Extrusion of raw ingredients can increase their nutritional value. It was hypothesized that propionic acid-treated field beans can be used to replace SBM in finisher diets and that extrusion of field beans will improve their nutritional value. Three experiments were conducted to determine the effect of extrusion of field beans on energy and crude protein digestibility (in-vitro and in-vivo), growth and carcass quality of grow-finisher pigs. Field beans are a good energy and protein source and can be fed at up to 37% inclusion in pig diets. Extrusion of field beans increased the digestible energy (DE) value, decreased the digestible crude protein (dCP) value of field beans, and had no effect on pig growth.The in-vitro ileal digestibility of dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), and crude protein (CP) of field beans treated with propionic acid (trFB) and extruded trFB (exFB) was determined in experiment 1. The DE and dCP values of trFB and exFB were determined using the difference method in experiment 2. The effect of replacing SBM with trFB and exFB in grow-finisher diets on growth, carcass quality, apparent ileal digestibility (AiD), and total tract digestibility (ATTD) of DM, OM, gross energy (GE), and CP were investigated in experiment 3. In exp. 1, in-vitro digestibility of exFB compared to trFB was unchanged for DM (p = 0.12), increased for OM (p < 0.05), and increased for CP (p < 0.05). In exp. 2, the DE value of trFB and exFB was 14.38 and 15.75 MJ/kg respectively; and the dCP value was 21.35% and 21.42% respectively (on DM basis). In exp. 3, ADFI was higher for pigs fed trFB and exFB compared to the control diet (CON; p < 0.05), while ADG, FCR and carcass quality parameters of pigs did not differ among treatments (p > 0.05).

AB  - We assessed the effects of inhalation administration of lavender essential oil (LEO) either once (L1) or twice (L2) a day on animal welfare indicators, carcass and meat quality of Italian heavy pigs. Pigs (n = 108) were allotted to three experimental groups (control -C-, L1 and L2) and lavender was administered, via a vaporizer device, to the treated groups during the entire fattening-finishing period (79-160 kg BW). Tail lesion severity was reduced in L1 at the end of the trial compared to the other groups (p < 0.05). Body lesion counts, however, were higher in L2 than in C (p < 0.05), resulting in a more severe overall damage classification (p < 0.01). At slaughter, no differences were observed in carcass traits or blood stress indicators, only minor differences were observed in meat quality, and no LEO residual was found in fat or lean tissues, highlighting the preserved suitability of thighs for the dry curing process. While it was not possible to conclude on the ability to improve animal welfare of vaporized LEO in this production phase, the absence of adverse effects on meat quality and the discrepancies observed regarding the body lesions in L1 and L2 make further studies on behavioral aspects and the method of administration (route, frequency) of the product desirable.

AB  - Antibiotics are extensively used in livestock production to prevent and treat diseases, but their environmental impact through contamination of rivers and groundwater is a growing concern. The specific antibiotics involved, their sources, and their geographic distribution remain inadequately documented, hindering effective mitigation strategies for river and groundwater pollution control caused by livestock production. Here we develope the spatially explicit MARINA-Antibiotics (China-1.0) model to estimate the flows of 24 antibiotics from seven livestock species into rivers and leaching into groundwater across 395 sub-basins in China, and examine changes between 2010 and 2020. We find that 8364 tonnes and 3436 tonnes of antibiotics entered rivers and groundwater nationwide in 2010 and 2020, respectively. Approximately 50e90% of these amounts originated from about 40% of the basin areas. Antibiotic inputs to rivers decreased by 59% from 2010 to 2020, largely due to reduced manure point sources. Conversely, antibiotic leaching into groundwater increased by 15%, primarily because of enhanced manure recycling practices. Pollution varied by antibiotic groups and livestock species: fluoroquinolones contributed approximately 55% to river pollution, mainly from pig, cattle, and chicken manure; sulfonamides accounted for over 90% of antibiotics in groundwater, predominantly from pig and sheep manure. While our findings support existing policies promoting manure recycling to mitigate river pollution in China, they highlight the need for greater attention to groundwater pollution. This aspect is essential to consider in developing and designing future reduction strategies for antibiotic pollution from livestock production. (c) 2024 The Authors.

AB  - This study aimed to recover the phenols from olive oil mill wastewater, a major pollutant of the oil industry, by using spray-drying technology to produce a new feed with a nutraceutical value for animal feed supplementation and to evaluate its effect on the productivity and nutritional quality of ewe milk. Forty-five Sarda ewes in late lactation (150 +/- 2 d) and with homogeneous live weight (52 +/- 1.5 kg) were randomly allotted into three groups and fed with three dietary treatments containing increasing levels of polyphenols: 0% (C), 0.1% (T0.1), and 0.2% (T0.2) of dry matter. No effect of the dietary treatments was found on the milk yield and composition. Interestingly, milk urea content (p < 0.0001) and somatic cell counts (p < 0.001) decreased as the level of polyphenols inclusion in the diet increased. The inclusion of phenols (0.2% of dry matter) in the diet of sheep was effective in increasing the vaccenic (C18:1 trans-11) and rumenic acid (C18: cis-9 trans-11) levels, which are beneficial for human health. Finally, the recovery of polyphenols via spray-drying technology and their incorporation into a new fortified feed can be a valid strategy for naturally improving the nutritional value of milk while valorizing an oil industry byproduct, reducing environmental impact, and promoting waste reuse that is in line with circular economy principles.

AB  - The brown tree frog (Litoria ewingii) is a relatively widespread, commonly encountered pelodryadid frog from southeastern Australia, known for its characteristic whistling call. The distribution of Litoria ewingii spans over more than 350,000 km2, encompassing a range of moist temperate habitats, and is fragmented by well-known biogeographic barriers. A preliminary analysis of mitochondrial DNA sequences revealed evidence for deep phylogenetic structure between some of these fragmented populations. In this study, we sought to re-evaluate the systematics and taxonomy of Litoria ewingii sensu lato by analysing variation in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, adult morphology and male advertisement calls throughout the species' range. Our analyses reveal two additional, deeply divergent and allopatric lineages in South Australia. We herein re-describe Litoria ewingii from Tasmania, southern New South Wales, Victoria and south-eastern South Australia, resurrect the name Litoria calliscelis for a species occurring in the Mount Lofty Ranges and Fleurieu Peninsula in South Australia, and describe a new species, Litoria sibilus sp. nov., endemic to Kangaroo Island.

AB  - Simple Summary: Mastitis is a common and important clinical disease in ruminants, resulting in decreased milk production, infertility and delayed conception. If not treated promptly, mastitis may result in fibrotic mastitis. Although epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a typical characteristic of fibrotic diseases, the relationship between EMT and mastitis remains largely unknown. NF-kappa B and Snail are key regulators of the EMT. In the present study, we found that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced EMT in primary goat mammary epithelial cells (GMECs). Additionally, the expression of Snail was induced by LPS and was inhibited by the suppression of the TLR4/NF-kappa B signaling pathway. The knockdown of Snail alleviated LPS-induced EMT and altered the expression of inflammatory cytokines. Finally, we found that the expression of key molecules of the TLR4/NF-kappa B/Snail signaling pathway was increased in mastitic tissues. This study provides evidence that LPS induces EMT in GMECs through the TLR4/NF-kappa B/Snail signaling pathway and lays a theoretical foundation for further exploration of the pathological mechanism and treatment of mastitis. Mastitis is a common and important clinical disease in ruminants. This may be associated with inflammatory fibrosis if not treated promptly. Inflammation-derived fibrosis is usually accompanied by epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in epithelial cells. However, the precise molecular mechanism underlying mastitis-induced fibrosis remains unclear. Nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappa B) and Snail are key regulators of EMT. In this study, primary goat mammary epithelial cells (GMECs) were treated with 10 mu g/mL lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 14 d to mimic the in vivo mastitis environment. After LPS treatment, the GMECs underwent mesenchymal morphological transformation and expressed mesenchymal cell markers. Snail expression was induced by LPS and was inhibited by suppression of the TLR4/NF-kappa B signaling pathway. Snail knockdown alleviated LPS-induced EMT and altered the expression of inflammatory cytokines. Finally, we found that the expression of key molecules of the TLR4/NF-kappa B/Snail signaling pathway was increased in mastitis tissues. These results suggest that Snail plays a vital role in LPS-induced EMT in GMECs and that the mechanism is dependent on the activation of the TLR4/NF-kappa B signaling pathway.

AB  - Insects represent a promising alternative source to more expensive components of the feeding regimen of farm animals for meat production. With this aim in mind, we conducted this experiment to investigate the effects of dried larvae of darkling beetles (Zophobas morio L.) and larvae of wax moths (Galleria mellonella L.) on growth performance, nutrient digestibility and blood profiles in growing piglets. A total of 27 crossbred piglets ((LWxL)xD), 39 days of age and 14.39 +/- 0.19 kg of body weight) were randomly divided into three groups (n=9 per group) based on gender and body weight. We substituted part of a fishmeal and a grain with 2.5% of dried larvae of darkling beetles (Zophobas morio L.) or with 3.0% of dried larvae of wax moths (Galleria mellonella L.). The replacement of fishmeal with insect biomass in the feeding regimen of the pigs did not change growth rate among groups and did not altered the digestibility of dry matter, crude protein and crude fiber (p > 0.05). At the same time, the digestibility of the fat has increased in the experimental groups with dry larvae (p <= 0.05). Blood counts in all groups were within the physiological norm. As compared to control group, piglets of the experimental groups had an increase in bactericidal, lysozyme activity of the blood serum and phagocytic activity of neutrophils. Thus, supplementation of dry larvae of superworm or waxworm in the ration didn't affect negatively growth performance of experimental piglets while improving their parameters of non-specific immunity.

AB  - Non-contact body size measurement has become a hot research topic in intelligent livestock farming. In regard to body size measurement of large livestock, such as cattle, collecting a substantial number of point clouds is frequently involved. The direct calculation of all point clouds for body size measurement can be impacted as point clouds of different body parts may interfere with each other, which poses huge challenges for the positioning of key points and induces inaccurate positioning, resulting in measurement errors. The accuracy of body size measurement can be improved by segmenting point clouds of different body parts from each other, key measurement points can be precisely located, thus enhancing the accuracy of body size measurement. In this paper, we propose a network model initially trained for pig point cloud segmentation based on the Kernel Convolution integrated with Graph Attention Mechanism (KCGATNet for short), which, through transfer learning techniques, can also be used to achieve successful segmentation of various cattle point clouds using only 7 training samples. The model utilizes two core modules, Kernel Convolution (KC) and Point-based Graph Attention Mechanism (P-GAT), to extract local neighborhood features of point clouds. When using pig body point clouds as training data, it achieved precise segmentation of the head, ears, limbs, torso, and tail of pigs through a downsampling-upsampling architecture. On the test set of pig point clouds, Overall Accuracy (OA) reached 98.1% and mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) was up to 90.5%. Furthermore, when this model served as a pre-trained model and underwent transfer learning using 7 sets of annotated data of Simmental cattle, it achieved a mIoU of 90.1% on a test set of 93 Simmental cattle, 89.6% on a test set of 439 dairy buffalo, 90.2% on a test set of 103 Hereford cattle, and 90.0% on a test set of 119 Black Angus cattle. The experimental outcomes fully demonstrate the robustness of the proposed livestock point cloud segmentation model, KCGATNet. With transfer learning of a small sample size, it can reliably perform point cloud segmentation on a wide range of different breeds of quadrupedal livestock, saving a significant amount of time spent on manual annotation and improving the efficiency of livestock point cloud segmentation models.

AB  - During exploration, animals form an internal map of an environment by combining information about land-marks and the animal's movement, a process that depends on the hippocampus. The dentate gyrus (DG) is the first stage of the hippocampal circuit where self-motion ("where") and sensory cue information ("what") are integrated, but it remains unknown how DG neurons encode this information during cognitive map formation. Using two-photon calcium imaging in mice running on a treadmill along with online cue manipulation, we identify robust sensory cue responses in DG granule cells. Cue cell responses are stable, stimulus-specific, and accompanied by inhibition of nearby neurons. This demonstrates the existence of "cue cells" in addition to better characterized "place cells" in the DG. We hypothesize that the DG supports parallel channels of spatial and non-spatial information that contribute distinctly to downstream computations and affect roles of the DG in spatial navigation and episodic memory.

AB  - Simple Summary Food poisoning caused by potato glycoside alkaloids (SGA) remains a critical factor affecting potato production safety. The potato tuber moth is a notorious pest that damages all parts of potato tissues. In this study, the dominant SGA substances alpha-solanine and alpha-chaconine in different potato leaves were detected. The growth and development of PTM feeding on the leaves of different potato varieties and different SGAs containing an artificial diet were studied. To clarify the SGA concentration accumulation and excretion processes, the tissues of potato tuber moth larvae were dissected into several parts and studied using an UHPLC machine. The results showed that ecdysis and the excretion process may be effective approaches used by the potato tuber moth to equilibrate internal SGA accumulation. Food poisoning caused by potato glycoside alkaloids (SGA) remains a critical factor that affects potato production safety. The potato tuber moth (Phthorimaea operculella) is a notorious pest that displays good adaptability to SGA in potato tissues. Studies that explore the mechanisms underlying SGA homeostasis in potato tuber moth larvae are urgently needed. In this study, ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC)-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (MS/MS) was applied to detect the dominant SGA substances alpha-solanine and alpha-chaconine in potato leaves and PTM larval tissues. From the highest to lowest SGA concentrations, the potato cultivars studied were ranked as follows: DS47, LS6, DS23 and QS9. To exclude the influence of nutrients within different potato varieties, different SGA containing (0%, 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.3% and 0.4%) the artificial diet treatment groups were added. DS47 and 0.3% SGA-containing artificial diets presented the best conditions for PTM growth, development and reproduction compared to other potato cultivars and artificial diet controls. The potato tuber moth larva tissues were dissected and the SGA content within different tissues were detected using an UHPLC machine. The results showed that alpha-chaconine was dispersed in the feces, midgut, hindgut, head and cuticle, and alpha-solanine was distributed only in the feces and midgut. Antibiotic-treated insects exhibited higher concentrations of SGA than the normal microbiome group. Furthermore, the SGA concentrations of 100 newly-hatched PTM larvae and puparia were detected, with both of them found to contain small amounts of SGA. The results showed that ecdysis and the excretion process were effective approaches used by the potato tuber moth to equilibrate internal SGA accumulation. The microorganism-decreased SGA concentrations were excited in their gut. SGA may transfer from adults to the next generation, and SGAs in PTM are inheritable. In this study, we demonstrated that the potato tuber moth possessed an effective method to preliminarily decrease high SGA accumulation in potato.

AB  - Background Since the introduction of studies on maize silage digestibility at the end of the nineteenth century, protocols to estimate dry matter digestibility have not stopped evolving. Since the early 1980s, the protocol developed by Aufrere became a benchmark in many laboratories to estimate in vitro dry matter digestibility. In order to increase its throughput, to facilitate its execution and to decipher the impact of the different parameters of the protocol we decided to test the combination of 7 parameters in 21 different protocols. Results We thus tested the impact of (1) the presence or absence of pepsin in HCl solution, (2) the temperature of incubation during enzymatic hydrolysis, (3) the presence or absence of a gelatinization step, (4) washing/rinsing versus neutralization step, (5) the presence or absence of alpha-amyloglucosidase in enzymatic solution, (6) the duration of cellulase incubation, and (7) the concentration of the cellulase solution. The major result of our work highlighted that it was essential to carry out a gelatinization step to correctly estimate the in vitro dry matter digestibility of maize silage. Conclusions The proposed protocol in this paper is innovative, reliable, highthroughput and easy to implement in many laboratories to accurately quantity in vitro dry matter digestibility.

AB  - Pellets made from waste wool, typically sourced from sheep shearing residues generated by the textile or wool industry, have recently emerged as a promising alternative for plant nutrition. However, limited information is available on the impact of wool pellets (WP), applied at a dosage of 4 g per pot, on soil functioning, biological activity, plant physiology, and nutrient supply. A pot experiment was set up in a randomized block design with four replicates on sweet peppers (Capsicum annuum L.). The effect of WP on permanganate-oxidizable carbon, fluorescein diacetate, and beta-glucosidase enzyme activities were investigated in two soils differing in their soil organic matter (SOM) contents (low and high) and compared to the control and a reference N fertilizer solution. The nitrate and total nitrogen content of plants, the photosynthetic pigments, gas exchange intensity, shoot and root biomass, pepper fruit, and photosynthetic rate per total N-uptake were also examined. WP treatments (4 g per pot) increased soil biological activity in both soil types (with 0.58% and 1.84% soil organic matter, respectively) and significantly improved plant physiological parameters and N-use efficiency compared to the control and reference N fertilizer addition. Although the total N content in wool pellets was higher than in the mineral reference N-solution, this reference treatment served as a baseline dose allowing comparison with the N-supply intensity of the WP. WP significantly increased shoot biomass in both soil types, with a more pronounced effect in the low SOM soil due to faster mineralization and higher air capacity. In contrast, higher fruit was achieved in the high SOM soil. WP treatment increased N-uptake to 2.18 and 2.34 mg/week in low and high SOM, respectively. The research findings highlight wool pellets as a powerful alternative to inorganic fertilizers, offering a sustainable nutrient supply. Moreover, utilizing wool a by-product often considered waste as an organic fertilizer contributes to solving both economic and environmental challenges associated with wool disposal.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Invasive ants, such as Linepithema humile (the Argentine ant), pose a global threat, necessitating a better understanding of their behaviour in order to improve management strategies. Traditional eradication methods, including baiting, have had limited success, but the causes of control failure are not always clear. This study aims to investigate whether ants form associations between food odours and corpses, and subsequently avoid areas or food sources with food odours associated with corpses. We propose that ants may learn to avoid toxic baits in part because of their association with ant corpses, which could have implications for pest control strategies.RESULTS: Ants were tested on a Y-maze after exposure to scented corpses or dummies. 69% (n = 64) of ants avoided branches bearing the scent of scented corpses. Colonies neglected food with corpse-associated odours, with only 42% (n = 273) of foragers feeding from such sources. However, if corpses were produced by feeding ants scented toxicant, focal ants encountering these corpses did not avoid the corpse-associated scent on a Y-maze (53%, n = 65). In dual-feeder tests, ants did not avoid feeding at food sources scented with odours associated with conspecific corpses.CONCLUSION: Conspecific corpses act as a negative stimulus for ants in a foraging situation, potentially causing avoidance of toxic baits. This study suggests adding odours to baits and cycling them to disrupt the bait-corpse association may be helpful. Interestingly, although avoidance of baits was observed, feeding preferences were not significantly affected.(c) 2023 The Authors.

AB  - During the 2020-2021 trips, the bat fauna of Hon Tre Island, located in Nha Trang Bay in Khanh Hoa Province, Vietnam, was studied for the first time. Despite the small size of the island and the lack of fresh water sources on it, we revealed the presence of at least nine bat species from four families, which were captured and studied in the hand. The family Pteropodidae is represented by Cynopterus sphinx, an extremely ecologically flexible species, and also by Rousettus leschenaulti and Eonycteris spelaea; family Hipposideridae - by three species of Hipposideros: H. grandis, H. galeritus and H. gentilis; family Rhinolophidae - by Rhinolophus cf. pusillus and R. pearsonii; family Megadermatidae - by Megaderma spasma. Mitochondrial DNA sequences were obtained for six individuals of three species, which made it possible to confirm morphology-based identifications of the captured animals. In particular, this concerned R. pearsonii, whose specimens differed from those known from the mainland, primarily by their smaller size. The presence of a multi-species bat community on Hon Tre Island necessitates careful planning of tourism and infrastructure development, in order to minimize impact on the natural habitats of the island.

AB  - Collagen has become popular in dietary supplements, beverages and sports nutrition products. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the possibility of using various doses of collagen and collagen hydrolysate to produce probiotic sheep's milk fermented with Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lacticaseibacillus casei, Lacticaseibacillus paracasei and Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus. The effects of storage time, type and dose of collagen, and different probiotic bacteria on the physicochemical, organoleptic and microbiological properties of fermented sheep's milk at 1 and 21 days of refrigerated storage were investigated. The addition of collagen to sheep's milk increased the pH value after fermentation and reduced the lactic acid contents of fermented milk compared to control samples. After fermentation, the number of probiotic bacteria cells was higher than 8 log cfu g(-1). In sheep's milk fermented by L. acidophilus and L. casei, good survival of bacteria during storage was observed, and there was no effect of collagen dose on the growth and survival of both strains. The addition of collagen, both in the form of hydrolysate and bovine collagen, resulted in darkening of the color of the milk and increased the sweet taste intensity of the fermented sheep's milk. However, the addition of hydrolysate was effective in reducing syneresis in each milk sample compared to its control counterpart.

AB  - Herbivores face a broad range of defences when feeding on plants. By mixing diets, polyphagous herbivores are assumed to benefit during their development by gaining a better nutritional balance and reducing the intake of toxic compounds from individual plant species. Nevertheless, they also show strategies to metabolically cope with plant defences. In this study, we investigated the development of the polyphagous tansy leaf beetle, Galeruca tanaceti (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), on mono diets consisting of one plant species [cabbage (Brassica rapa), Brassicaceae; lettuce (Lactuca sativa), or tansy (Tanacetum vulgare), Asteraceae] vs. two mixed diets, both containing tansy. Leaves of the three species were analysed for contents of water, carbon and nitrogen, the specific leaf area (SLA) and trichome density. Furthermore, we studied the insect metabolism of two glucosinolates, characteristic defences of Brassicaceae. Individuals reared on cabbage mono diet developed fastest and showed the highest survival, while the development was slowest for individuals kept on tansy mono diet. Cabbage had the lowest water content, while tansy had the highest water content, C/N ratio and trichome density and the lowest SLA. Lettuce showed the lowest C/N ratio, highest SLA and no trichomes. Analysis of insect samples with UHPLC-DAD-QTOF-MS/MS revealed that benzyl glucosinolate was metabolised to N-benzoylglycine, N-benzoylalanine and N-benzoylserine. MALDI-Orbitrap-MS imaging revealed the localisation of these metabolites in the larval hindgut region. 4-Hydroxybenzyl glucosinolate was metabolised to N-(4-hydroxybenzoyl)glycine. Our results highlight that G. tanaceti deals with toxic hydrolysis products of glucosinolates by conjugation with different amino acids, which may enable this species to develop well on cabbage. The high trichome density and/or specific plant chemistry may lower the accessibility and/or digestibility of tansy leaves, leading to a poorer beetle development on pure tansy diet or diet mixes containing tansy. Thus, diet mixing is not necessarily beneficial, if one of the plant species is strongly defended.

AB  - Disease susceptibility and resistance are important factors for the conservation of endangered species, including elephants. We analyzed pathology data from 26 zoos and report that Asian elephants have increased neoplasia and malignancy prevalence compared with African bush elephants. This is consistent with observed higher susceptibility to tuberculosis and elephant endotheliotropic herpesvirus (EEHV) in Asian elephants. To investigate genetic mechanisms underlying disease resistance, including differential responses between species, among other elephant traits, we sequenced multiple elephant genomes. We report a draft assembly for an Asian elephant, and defined 862 and 1,017 conserved potential regulatory elements in Asian and African bush elephants, respectively. In the genomes of both elephant species, conserved elements were significantly enriched with genes differentially expressed between the species. In Asian elephants, these putative regulatory regions were involved in immunity pathways including tumor-necrosis factor, which plays an important role in EEHV response. Genomic sequences of African bush, forest, and Asian elephant genomes revealed extensive sequence conservation at TP53 retrogene loci across three species, which may be related to TP53 functionality in elephant cancer resistance. Positive selection scans revealed outlier genes related to additional elephant traits. Our study suggests that gene regulation plays an important role in the differential inflammatory response of Asian and African elephants, leading to increased infectious disease and cancer susceptibility in Asian elephants. These genomic discoveries can inform future functional and translational studies aimed at identifying effective treatment approaches for ill elephants, which may improve conservation.

AB  - Marked species composition changes are observed between shallow-water (0-200 m) temperate and tropical fauna, however, this transition is not well documented in deep-water fauna (> 200 m). Along the east coast of Australia there is an apparent biogeographic tropical to temperate transition between 30-40 degrees S for bathyal and abyssal fauna. This has been recorded for brittle stars (Echinodermata: Ophiuroidea) and certain benthic megafauna taxa combined but not tested for other taxa individually or tested with genetic data. During the 2017 RV Investigator expedition, a series of beam trawl and epibenthic sledge samples were taken from 13 sites along a south to north latitudinal transect along the east coast of Australia, from Freycinet Marine Park, 42 degrees S, to Coral Sea Marine Park, 24 degrees S, from 1,000 to 4,800 m depth. Three of the most abundant segmented worms (Annelida: Polychaeta) species, Melinnopsis gardelli, Melinnopsis chadwicki (Melinnidae) and Jugamphicteis galatheae (Ampharetidae) were morphologically identified, and the COI genetic marker was sequenced for 88 specimens. Melinnopsis gardelli was recorded across the biogeographical break from 42 degrees S to 24 degrees S. An AMOVA for the north and south populations revealed significant evidence of populations structuring of this species. The other two species, M. chadwicki and J. galatheae, were recovered from north and south respectively of the biogeographic break. One haplotype of M. gardelli was shared between two sampling locations south of the break, Jervis Marine Park and Freycinet Marine Park (distance 735 km), similarly, haplotypes were shared for M. chadwicki between locations 726 km apart and J. galatheae 950 km apart. We found genetic evidence of a break occurring at 28-35 degrees S dividingM. gardelli populations in the north and south, additionally our data appeared to show a third central population for M. gardelli. However, the break was not strongly defined as M. gardelli was found to bridge across the transition. Our results indicated deep-sea annelid populations are well connected along sections of the eastern Australian margin, suggesting the designated deep-water Marine Parks function as an important network for these organisms.

AB  - Early weaning stress (EWS) in piglets is associated with intestinal dysfunction. Here, utilizing a pig EWS model to mimic early-life stress (ELS) in humans, we investigated the mechanism of ELS-induced intestinal diseases through integrated multi-omics analyses of proteome, glycome, and microbiome. Our results demonstrated that EWS resulted in disrupted the ileal barrier integrity by reducing tight junction-related gene expression and interfering with cell-cell adhesion paralleled the increased proportion of pathogens such as Escherichia_Shigella and Helicobacter. Furthermore, Proteome data revealed that the accumulation of unfolded proteins and insufficient unfolded protein response (UPR) process caused by EWS led to ER stress. Data from proteome and glycome found that EWS induced aberrant mucin O-glycans, including truncated glycans, reduction in acidic glycans, and increased in fucosylated glycans. In addition, correlation test by taking fucose and inflammatory response into account suggested that enhancement of fucose expression might be a compensatory host response. Taken together, these results extend the comprehensive knowledge of the detrimental impacts and pathogenesis of EWS and help to provide intervention targets for ELS-induced intestinal diseases in the future.

AB  - Ammonia is one of the major environmental pollutants in the pig industry that seriously affects the airway health of pigs. In this study, we aimed to investigate the metabolic profiling changes of piglets' lung tissue after the exposure of 0 ppm (CG), 20 ppm (LG) and 50 ppm (HG) ammonia for 30 days. Compared with the control group, the obvious lung lesions were observed in HG, including interstitial thickening, inflammatory cell infiltration and focal hemorrhage. The significantly increased content of malondialdehyde in HG, combined with the significantly decreased mRNA expression of antioxidase and inflammatory-regulators in exposure groups, implied that ammonia exposure induced oxidative stress and diminished the anti-inflammatory response in lung tissues. Metabolomic analyses of lung tissues revealed 15 significantly altered metabolites among the three groups including multiple amino acids, carbohydrates and lipids. The accumulation of succinic acid, linoleic acid and phosphorylethanolamine and consumption of glucose, quinolinic acid and aspartic acid in ammonia exposure groups, indicated that energy supply from glucose aerobic oxidation was suppressed and the glycolysis and lipolysis were activated in lung tissues induced by chronic ammonia exposure.

AB  - In Arabidopsis, the outbreaks of reactive oxygen species (ROS) occur upon pathogen recognition by pattern- and effector-triggered immunity (PTI and ETI, respectively), which plays a significant role in disease resistance. Here, we found that Arabidopsis also experiences two outbreaks of ROS (oral secretion (OS)-induced ROS (ROSOS)) upon the perception of OS from cotton bollworm (Helicoverpa armigera) and other lepidopterans. Oral secretion-induced ROS burst requires the PTI machinery, including BRI1-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR KINASE1 (BAK1) and BOTRYTIS-INDUCED KINASE1 (BIK1). Oral secretion-induced ROS are primarily produced by respiratory burst oxidase homologue D (RBOHD) in the apoplast, and the double mutant, rbohdf, exhibits reduced resistance to lepidopterans. Insect biting rather than wounding induces the gene expressions of plant defense-associated respiratory burst and toxin catabolic processes, facilitating the breakdown of leaf glucosinolates into bioactive intermediates, like sulforaphane, thereby impeding insect herbivory. Our investigation demonstrates that Arabidopsis perceives insect OS in a BAK1-BIK1-dependent manner and employs RBOHD to produce ROS in the apoplast, thereby enhancing its insect resistance by accelerating glucosinolate hydrolysis.

AB  - Simple Summary African elephants commonly enter farmlands across their ranges and trample or consume crops, creating conflicts with farmers and challenges for conservation priorities. Farmers may retaliate and injure elephants, but the extent to which this occurs is relatively unknown. However, scars found on elephants may be evidence of past negative interactions. The objective of our study was to describe the presence of scars in an elephant population in the Greater Tsavo Ecosystem, a region of high human-elephant conflict in Kenya. We monitored and catalogued a population in the Kasigau Wildlife Corridor from 2017 to 2021, noting the number of scars and their placement on individuals. Presumably, evidence of conflict between elephants is more likely to be found on the head or rump areas of elephants, whereas humans are most likely to injure the body of elephants. We found that adult males were much more likely to have scars than adult females, older males were more likely to have scars than younger males, and more scars were located on the body as opposed to the rump and head. Understanding how many elephants in a population have scars and the location of scars can describe the potential level of human-elephant conflict in a population. This valuable information can be used to better understand the level of conflict in a community and aid in management recommendations. Human-elephant conflict (HEC) compromises crop security and threatens elephant conservation. Most commonly, HEC manifests as crop-foraging as elephants modify natural foraging strategies to incorporate crops. Farmers may retaliate by frightening or harming elephants, leaving scars from inflicted wounds. We assessed the prevalence and distribution of scars on the bodies of African savanna elephants (Loxodonta africana) observed in the Kasigau Wildlife Corridor (KWC), part of the Greater Tsavo Ecosystem of Kenya, where conflict is prevalent. We surmised that scars on the body are largely a result of HEC as opposed to scars on the rump or head, which we attributed primarily to elephant-elephant conflict. We hypothesized that: (1) male elephants would have more scars than females; (2) older males would be more likely to have scars than younger males; and (3) most scars would be located on the bodies of elephants. We assessed scars from a photographic catalogue of elephants from the KWC. In line with our hypotheses, male elephants were more likely to have scars than females (32% of males compared to 6% of females); older males had significantly more scars than younger males (61% compared to 24%); and the majority of scars (89%) were located on the body. Scar presence may be useful as an animal-centered indicator to estimate the prevalence and demographic patterns of HEC.

AB  - Previously, expression of the Arabidopsis thaliana GLABRA3 (GL3) induced trichome formation in Brassica napus. GL3 orthologues were examined from glabrous (B. oleracea), semi-glabrous (B. napus), moderately hirsute (B. rapa), and very hirsute (B. villosa) Brassica species. Ectopic expression of BnGL3, BrGL3 alleles, or BvGL3 induced trichome formation in glabrous B. napus with the effect on trichome number commensurate with density in the original accessions. Chimeric GL3 proteins in which the B. napus amino terminal region, which interacts with MYB proteins, or the middle region, which interacts with the WD40 protein TTG1, was exchanged with corresponding regions from A. thaliana were as stimulatory to trichome production as AtGL3. Exchange of the carboxy-terminal region containing a bHLH domain and an ACT domain did not alter the trichome stimulatory activity, although modeling of the ACT domain identified differences that could affect GL3 dimerization. B. napus A- and C-genomes orthologues differed in their abilities to form homo- and heterodimers. Modeling of the amino-terminal region revealed a conserved domain that may represent the MYB factor binding pocket. This region interacted with the MYB factors GL1, CPC, and TRY, as well as with JAZ8, which is involved in jasmonic acid-mediated regulation of MYC-like transcription factors. Protein interaction studies indicated that GL1 interaction with GL3 from B. napus and A. thaliana may underlie the difference in their respective abilities to induce trichome formation.

AB  - Video exposure is known to affect brain function, yet its impact on neurodevelopmental processes remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate whether exposure to a video depicting social behavior induces behavioral and neurological changes in socially isolated mice. On Postnatal Day (PND) 21, male mice were separated from their dams and randomly assigned to three groups: socially grouped mice; socially isolated mice (ISO), where mice were housed without any social stimulation; and social video-exposed mice (SVE), where mice were exposed to a social video played on a tablet from PND21 to PND56 under socially isolated conditions. On PND56, all animals underwent behavioral tests. Compared to the socially grouped mice and ISO group, the SVE group showed an attenuated response to amphetamine treatment. In the social cognition test, the ISO group exhibited decreased affiliative behavior and increased offensive and defensive behavior. However, the SVE group showed a partial improvement in social cognition, including increased affiliative behaviors and decreased defensive behaviors, although no changes in offensive behaviors were observed. Furthermore, the SVE group exhibited elevated levels of tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine transporter in key social cognition regions-namely the prefrontal cortex, retrosplenial cortex, and hippocampus. This neurochemical shift implies that socially isolated mice can acquire social behaviors through exposure to video-based social interactions. These effects may be related to the compensatory response of the dopamine system, which is implicated in various psychiatric disorders.

AB  - Trachymela sloanei (Blackburn, 1897) is a non-indigenous beetle of the Iberian Peninsula herbivorous of several species of Eucalyptus trees. Since its first detection in Europe in 2014, little information is available about the populations of this beetle in this distribution range. Therefore, a complete chorological update of the Australian tortoise beetle in the Iberian Peninsula is carried out. The ecology, phenology and potential distribution are discussed. Certain features of its morphology are fully illustrated to increase knowledge of this species. Finally, other remarks of interest that could be useful for the future management perspectives of this plague of Eucalyptus in the European continent are commented on briefly.

AB  - The object of research was to estimate the main economic indicators related to production efficiency - revenues, costs, profit and profitability of Ile de France sheep farms in three different regions of Northern Bulgaria for a 3-year period (20182020). Production system was semi-intensive, stable-pasture, with feeding in winter and grazing in summer. Profit was calculated as a difference between total revenues and total costs, and profitability rate as a ratio between profit and total costs. Data were processed using a mathematical-statistical model and Excel computer program. Profit and profitability were calculated negative on Farm 2 - BGN -51.62 and -8.97%, respectively, and positive on Farm 1 (BGN 250.27 and 57.28%) and Farm 3 (BGN 59.83 and 23.98%). Based on the obtained results, it can be summarized that the farm size does not determine the amount of revenues, but rather animal productivity, applied technologies and management strategy. The availability of pastures and feed self-production also contribute to higher economic results on farms. In order to achieve economically efficient production, it is necessary to find the optimal ratio between the costs of purchasing and raising highly productive animals and the revenues from sales, taking into account the risk of investment as well.

AB  - Floral bracts (bracteoles, cataphylls) are leaf-like organs that subtend flowers or inflorescences but are of non-floral origin; they occur in a wide diversity of species, representing multiple independent origins, and exhibit great variation in form and function. Although much attention has been paid to bracts over the past 150 years, our understanding of their adaptive significance remains remarkably incomplete. This is because most studies of bract function and evolution focus on only one or a few selective factors. It is widely recognised that bracts experience selection mediated by pollinators, particularly for enhancing pollinator attraction through strong visual, olfactory, or echo-acoustic contrast with the background and through signalling the presence of pollinator rewards, either honestly (providing rewards for pollinators), or deceptively (attraction without reward or even trapping pollinators). However, studies in recent decades have demonstrated that bract evolution is also affected by agents other than pollinators. Bracts can protect flowers, fruits, or seeds from herbivores by displaying warning signals, camouflaging conspicuous reproductive organs, or by providing physical barriers or toxic chemicals. Reviews of published studies show that bracts can also promote seed dispersal and ameliorate the effects of abiotic stressors, such as low temperature, strong ultraviolet radiation, heavy rain, drought, and/or mechanical abrasion, on reproductive organs or for the plants' pollinators. In addition, green bracts and greening of colourful bracts after pollination promote photosynthetic activity, providing substantial carbon (photosynthates) for fruit or seed development, especially late in a plant's life cycle or season, when leaves have started to senesce. A further layer of complexity derives from the fact that the agents of selection driving the evolution of bracts vary between species and even between different developmental stages within a species, and selection by one agent can be reinforced or opposed by other agents. In summary, our survey of the literature reveals that bracts are multifunctional and subject to multiple agents of selection. To understand fully the functional and evolutionary significance of bracts, it is necessary to consider multiple selection agents throughout the life of the plant, using integrative approaches to data collection and analysis.

AB  - Airflow in naturally ventilated barns usually presents high variability with time and it is rather difficult to estimate because of the presence and interaction of the animals. On the other hand, appropriate ventilation is an essential requirement to ensure animal welfare and efficient and sustainable production. In this regard, the computational fluid dynamic simulations represent a powerful and useful tool and, in this paper, CFD simulations are used to investigate and assess the geometrical and seasonal effects on the natural ventilation of an existing pig barn sited in the northern Italy and composed of six wings converging on a central body. First, the effects of the complex barn geometry on the ventilation parameters have been investigated by outdoor simulations with eight wind scenarios on a closed envelope building model. From these analyses, both the interaction among the different wings and the influence of the surrounding buildings, have been carefully evaluated and a dimensionless parameter, called ventilation rate ratio, has been proposed and applied to the case study barn to assess the effects of the building geometry on the ventilation efficiency. Then, starting from the statistical analysis of the free-field ventilation at the site, seven additional wind scenarios have been analysed on a different model of the barn, to evaluate the efficiency of indoor natural ventilation during summer and winter seasons, when the most extreme conditions for animal welfare take place. The ventilation resulted very different during the years from season to season, but also presented valuable differences in the same season, from wing to wing. The outcomes of the paper provide useful indications on the present conditions of the structure and they could be used as decision-making information for the management of the livestock building to identify the most favourable pens for the different finishing pig groups at different fattening stages but also for the planning of the most suitable ventilation retrofitting interventions.

AB  - In this paper, reverse engineering technique was employed to extract the ridges of the hoof ball contour, and hoof ball tissue structure was analyzed based on the bionic prototype of goat hooves. The quantified geometric features were used to design the bionic track shoe pattern, which can enhance its adhesive performance and solve the problem that agricultural tracked vehicles in hilly and mountainous areas are prone to slip due to poor adhesive performance. The monolithic structure of the biomimetic goat hoof track shoe pattern and the ordinary one-line track pattern were arranged and combined; they included six kinds of track shoe models and the adhesive performance was compared. A discrete element system was established based on soil parameter determination to compare the maximum adhesion of different track shoe models. The bionic track shoe samples were prepared for soil bin tests to verify the reliability of the discrete element analysis results. Compared with the ordinary track shoe, the adhesion of the optimal bionic track shoe was improved by 9.1%.

AB  - The consumption of Caesalpinia coriaria dry ground fruit (Ccgf) and a Duddingtonia flagrans chlamydospore suspension (DfchS) either individually or in combination for the control of gastrointestinal nematodes (GIN) was assessed in sheep. Forty-five lambs infected with GIN were distributed into five groups (n = 9): Group 1: DfChS at 5 x 10(5) chlamydospores /kg BW; Group 2: Ccgf at 10% of the total diet; Group 3: Combination of both treatments; Group 4: Levamisole at 6 mg/kg BW; and Group 5: Control. The DfChS was orally administered every third day for 15 days; while the Ccgf, was daily offered during the same period. Faecal egg counts and coprocultures were established. Mean faecal egg accounts (EPG) and infective larvae from coprocultures were recorded. The highest EPG reductions were obtained on the 17th day with the treated group (72.1%); followed by Ccgf group (69.1%) at day 13 and DfchS group (62.6%) also on the 17th day; though, no significant differences were found among treatments. The highest larval reductions were observed with the combined treatment 97.7% (day 17); followed by DfchS group: 96.2% (day 11) and Ccgf group: 70% (day 11). The EPG and larvae reductions achieved with DfchS and Ccgf could be associated to the anthelmintic compounds present in both fungi and plants. The combined use of DfchS and Ccgf against GIN in sheep under grazing conditions seems to be a promising alternative for GIN control in sheep.

AB  - The archaeological landscape of the Tadrart Acacus massif (SW Libya, central Sahara) is made of sites testimony of complex systems of cultural-specific settlement and economic strategies stretching over millennia of occupation. Here, caves and rock shelters represent the main physiographic features exploited by prehistoric herders. Climate fluctuations, settlement patterns and economic strategies regulate the depositional and post-depositional processes documented in the excavated sites. In this regard, the site of Takarkori, thanks to its well-preserved archaeological record, which was extensively excavated, represents a highly valuable archive of past societal activities. We show how a multifaceted analysis of deposits and sediments of anthropogenic and biogenic origin, like dung and coprolites accumulations, may broaden the reconstruction of the cultural dynamics and variability of the Saharan Late Pastoral Neolithic (5700-4650 cal BP). Analysis of spatial distribution coupled with micromorphological investigation increased the reconstruction of the shelter's organisation and use, including its deposit' formation processes. Pollen analysis highlighted aspects of seasonality among Late Pastoral herders attending the site, also contributing to deepen our knowledge on palaeoenvironment of Middle Holocene Sahara.

AB  - Bisphenol A (BPA) is a widely used plasticizer known to cause various disorders. Despite a global reduction in the use of BPA-containing products, prenatal exposure to low-dose BPA, even those below established safety limits, has been linked to neurological and behavioral deficits in childhood. The precise mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear. In the present study, we observed a significant increase in the number of cortical neurons in offspring born to dams exposed to low-dose BPA during pregnancy. We also found that this prenatal exposure to low-dose BPA led to increased proliferation but reduced migration of cortical neurons. Transcriptomic analysis via RNA sequencing revealed an aberrant activation of the cAMP-PKA-CREB pathway in offspring exposed to BPA. The use of H89, a selective PKA inhibitor, effectively rescued the deficits in both proliferation and migration of cortical neurons. Furthermore, offspring from dams exposed to low-dose BPA exhibited manic-like behaviors, including hyperactivity, anti-depressant-like responses, and reduced anxiety. While H89 normalized hyperactivity, it didn't affect the other behavioral changes. These results suggest that the overactivation of PKA plays a causative role in BPA-induced changes in neuronal development. Our data also indicate that manic-like behaviors induced by prenatal low-dose BPA exposure may be influenced by both altered neuronal development and abnormal PKA signaling in adulthood.

AB  - Blister blight infection with Exobasidium vexans is one of the most destructive foliar diseases that seriously affect the quality and yield of tea. This research investigated the metabolite changes of healthy and infected leaves on tea cultivar 'Fuding Dabaicha' and further explored the potential antimicrobial substances against E. vexans infection. In total, 1,166 compounds were identified during the entire course of an infection, among which 73 different common compounds were significantly accumulated involved in the important antimicrobial substances of flavonoids and phenolic acids, including kaempferol (3,5,7,4 ' -tetrahydroxyflavone), kaempferol-3-O-sophoroside-7-O-glucoside, phloretin, 2,4,6-trihydroxybenzoic acid, galloylprocyanidin B4, and procyanidin C1 3 ' -O-gallate, which indicated that these metabolites might positively dominate resistance to E. vexans. Furthermore, relevant biological pathways, such as the flavone and flavonol biosynthesis, flavonoid biosynthesis, and phenylpropane pathways, were more closely related to resistance to E. vexans. Additionally, total flavonoids, phenolics, alkaloids, and terpenoids contributing to antimicrobial and antioxidant capacity were significantly altered during four different infection periods, especially the Leaf_S2 stage (the second stage of infection), in which the most concentration accumulated. The leaves affected by E. vexans infection at the second stage had the relatively highest antioxidant activity. Accordingly, this study provides a theoretical support for and comprehensive insights into the effects on the metabolite changes, tea quality components, and antioxidant activity of blister blight caused by E. vexans.

AB  - Canola (Brassica napus) is a significant oilseed crop in the world, including in Pakistan. Increases in global temperatures will likely affect future plant species distribution, and could influence the survivability of individual species because of the relationship between temperature, germination and dormancy. The objective of this study was to improve heat tolerance in canola with the foliar application of sulfur. Therefore, a pot study was performed in a growth room at the Institute of Horticultural Sciences, University of Agriculture Faisalabad in 2017-2018 under controlled conditions. Two varieties of canola, i.e., Hyola-401 and 45S42, two levels of foliar sulfur (S-0= 0 ppm and S-1 500 ppm) treatments, and two temperature levels (T-1=18 degrees C and T-2=28 degrees C) were studied. Heat stress was imposed at the time of anthesis (55-60 days after emergence). Collected data indicated that morphological characters such as root shoot length and their fresh and dry weight showed better performance where foliar sulfur was applied either in heat stress as well as in control conditions where no heat stress was imposed. The photosynthetic rate (6.21 mu mole CO2 m(-2)/sec), stomatal conductance (0.12 mu mole CO2 m(-2)/sec) and intercellular CO2 concentration (346.13 mu mole CO2 m(-2)/sec) were improved in sulfur treatments under heat stress conditions while transpiration rate (0.51 mol H2O m(-2) s(-1)) was decreased with foliar application of sulfur. Similarly, yield and yield components (No. of siliques per plant (23), No. of seeds per siliqua (20), 1000 seed weight (3.53 g) and overall yield (2.11 t/ha) increased where foliar sulfur was applied @ 500 ppm. Overall results concluded that the foliar application of sulfur may be helpful for plant tolerance against heat stress by improving the physiological attributes and yield characters in canola. Moreover, among the genotype of Brassica napus L, Hyola 401 performed better in comparison with genotype 45S42 where foliar applied sulfur under heat stress conditions.

AB  - Previous studies have screened key candidate genes for litter size in sheep, including fibrillin-1 (FBN1), family with sequence similarity 184 member B (FAM184B) and zinc finger and AT-hook domain containing (ZFAT). Therefore, it is necessary to verify these genes in the Xinggao mutton sheep population and determine the associated loci for litter size. In this study, three loci (FBN1 g.160338382 T > C, FAM184B g.398531673 C > T and ZFAT g.20150315 C > T) were firstly screened based on the population differentiation coefficient between the polytocous and monotocous sheep groups. Then, population genetic analysis and association analysis were performed on these loci. The results revealed that the g.160338382 T > C in FBN1 was significantly associated with the litter size of sheep. Moreover, there was no significant interaction effect between the g.160338382 T > C locus and FecB on litter size. Notably, g.160338382 T > C is adjacent to the anterior border of exon 58 and belongs to a splice polypyrimidine tract variant, which may lead to alternative splicing and ultimately cause changes in the structure and function of the protein. In summary, our results provided a potentially effective genetic marker for improving the litter size of sheep.

AB  - Simple Summary Chromium is a heavy metal often utilized in industrial applications in its hexavalent form, which is particularly toxic. It also serves as a trace mineral to organisms in its trivalent form. In humans, accidental or intentional ingestion of high amounts of hexavalent chromium leads to corrosive lesions in the gastrointestinal tract, potentially resulting in death due to extensive areas of necrosis and hemorrhage in the stomach and intestines. In a swine farm, pigs housed in bedding of pine wood shavings containing chromium died secondarily to ulcerative gastritis with subsequent perforation of the glandular stomach. This study marks the first description of natural acute oral chromium poisoning in animals.Abstract Heavy metal poisoning poses a challenge in diagnostic practices and environmental safety. This study describes the epidemiological, clinical, and pathological aspects of a chromium (Cr) poisoning outbreak in growing/finishing pigs housed in pens with bedding of pine wood shavings containing Cr. A visit to the affected farm was conducted. Epidemiological data were collected, and necropsy and histopathological examinations and heavy metal quantifications were performed. Up to 30% of the animals from the affected pens displayed clinical signs 48 h after housing, characterized by apathy, rigid gait, distended abdomen, pain to abdominal palpation, fever, vomiting, and skin cyanosis. The lethality rate reached 76.6%. Main postmortem findings consisted of ulcerative gastritis with perforation of the glandular stomach in all necropsied swine. Heavy metal analysis revealed a higher concentration of Cr in the bedding of the affected pens, along with elevated levels of Cr in the livers of the affected swine. Given that Cr is a known cause of poisoning in humans (with acute oral exposure resulting in corrosive lesions in the gastrointestinal tract), this study marks the first diagnosis of acute oral natural Cr poisoning in animals. This diagnosis was established through the association of epidemiological, pathological, and heavy metal quantification data.

AB  - Simple Summary Drought is considered a critical threat to crop growth and sustainable agriculture worldwide, and it also greatly impacts insect development and population growth. Brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens (Stal), is the predominant rice crop pest in China, and the damaging effects of BPH are enhanced by its strong migratory and reproductive capacities. Our results provide useful information about the effect of drought stress on the poor population growth and negative physiological changes in BPH. Negative changes to water balance and osmotic pressure can cause a decline in the quality of BPH; the GST content of BPH feeding on drought-stressed rice was significantly higher than BPH feeding on non-stressed control plants, and the length of flight muscle sarcomeres and mitochondrial content were decreased in BPH feeding on drought-stressed rice. These findings suggest that water management greatly impacts the physiology and population growth of BPH, and provide a basis for understanding physiological and population-wide responses in BPH during drought stress, which may be helpful in understanding the relationship between drought stress and BPH infestation. Drought stress greatly impacts insect development and population growth. Some studies have demonstrated increased reproductive capacity in drought-stressed insects; however, physiological changes in the brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens (Stal), during periods of drought are unclear. In this study, BPH fed on drought- stressed rice had lower population numbers than BPH feeding on non-stressed rice. Water content, osmotic pressure of hemolymph and total amino acid content of BPH were significantly lower when BPH fed on drought-stressed rice compared to the non-stressed control; however, glucose content and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity were significantly higher in BPH fed on drought-stressed rice. The expression of Vitellogenin and Exuperantia in BPH fed on drought-stressed rice was higher than that in BPH feeding on non-stressed control plants. The size of myofibrils and the abundance of mitochondria in BPH flight muscles were significantly lower in BPH fed on drought-stressed rice compared to non-stressed plants. These results indicate that water management impacts the physiology of BPH, which may be useful in understanding the relationship between drought stress and this damaging herbivore.

AB  - Phosphor-in-glass (PiG) as a reliable color converter has drawn considerable attention in solid-state laser lighting. Here, a series of green-emitting Y3Al3.5Ga1.5O12:Ce (YAGG:Ce) PiG samples are fabricated via a solid-state reaction method. The microstructure, photoluminescence and thermal performance of the YAGG:Ce PiG samples are systematically investigated. Impressively, the optimized sample not only exhibits a superior internal quantum efficiency of 94% but also has a remarkable thermal conductivity of 2.5 W m(-1) K-1. Moreover, it achieves excellent thermal stability (maintaining 81.2% of the room-temperature intensity at 473 K). Notably, the maximum luminous efficacy of the as-synthesized sample is 236.8 lm W-1 under a blue laser power density of 2.77 W mm(-2). Furthermore, a prototype laser diode packaged with the high efficiency and robust YAGG:Ce PiG produces bright green light, indicating its enormous potential as a green color converter for application in laser-driven lighting.

AB  - Human mediated intra-continental exchange of genetic material among domesticated organisms has never been restricted to a single direction. The introduction of pig breeds between China and Europe aims to enhance economically important traits in local populations. However, the reciprocal introgression pattern, specifically the role of introgressed genes and structural variations (SVs), remains underexplored. A global collection of whole-genome resequencing data is utilized from 418 pigs to generate comprehensive dataset, including single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as well as SVs. The analysis reveals incomplete linkage disequilibrium between SVs and adjacent SNPs, highlighting the limitations of conventional SNP-based analyses in capturing the genetic effects of SVs. By examining both population-level SNPs and SVs, bidirectional introgression between Chinese and European pig populations is characterized. It is identified 3558 bidirectional introgressed genomic segments and 30 SVs, with haplotypes at BMP2, which are associated with improved body size. The origin and allele frequency trajectory of the BMP2 segment are further validated using ancient genomes, suggesting that the body size-enhancing haplotype likely originated from ancient European populations and has since maintained a relatively high allele frequency. Overall, the results highlight the significant role of bidirectional introgression in shaping the genetic composition and phenotypic traits in modern pig breeds.

AB  - Microbial source tracking (MST) using host-specific Bacteroidales and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) markers is an efficient tool to identify the sources of fecal contamination in environmental water. This study evaluated and updated the previously reported performances of seven host-specific Bacteroidales markers (three human-, two cattle-, and two pig-specific). Additionally, the performance of a cattle-specific Bovine mtDNA and a pig-specific Swine mtDNA marker were evaluated and then applied to MST of river water samples collected in Yamanashi Prefecture, Japan. We collected 48 fecal-source samples, including raw sewage, secondary-treated sewage, an effluent of a domestic wastewater treatment tank, pig feces, pig wastewater, and cattle feces, which were quantitatively analyzed using host-specific Bacteroidales and mtDNA markers. BacHum and gyrB markers (human-specific), BacR and Bovine mtDNA markers (cattle-specific), and Pig2Bac and Swine mtDNA markers (pig-specific) were judged the best-performing markers. Then, these selected markers were applied to MST to identify the sources of fecal contamination in 59 river water samples collected at 21 sites. Of them, 20 (95%), 21 (100%), and 16 (76%) sites were positive for at least one human, cattle, and pig marker, respectively, indicating the need for immediate action and monitoring to control fecal pollution.

AB  - The tongue, as a muscular hydrostat, performs several dynamic behaviors and functions, including feeding, vocalizing, and respiration. As such, this hydrostat must be capable of performing complex movements, which are powered via a set of muscles typically defined as "extrinsic" (originating outside of the tongue) and "intrinsic" (contained wholly in the tongue). These muscles are typically classified based on their gross anatomical positions and also are often ascribed functions based on these positions, with the extrinsic muscles being assigned the role of positioning the tongue, and the intrinsic muscles thought to function to shape it. For example, genioglossus is typically described as a tongue protruder, whereas hyoglossus is often described as a tongue retractor. However, the neural control of these muscles involves relatively small motor units, and defining the function of tongue muscles based on anatomy, when they occupy overlapping space and exhibit refined control may oversimplify their function. Yet, distinguishing between gross anatomical structures and refined neural control can be challenging due to the complexity of functions the tongue performs. Here, we used an infant animal model (pigs) to evaluate how the neural control of the tongue is modulated in anatomical space given a relatively simplified behavior (suckling). We tested for variation in control along the anteroposterior and dorsoventral axis of the tongue using high speed videofluoroscopy coupled with electromyography (EMG). We found variation in EMG firing timing along both axes, which correspond to differences in behaviors. Furthermore, this variation in activity is likely reflected by regional variation in function within a muscle. These data suggest that defining muscles by their anatomical structure over-simplifies their functional roles and that studies investigating the three-dimensional structure and function of the tongue should evaluate it based on regional variation in control, in the context of the behavior of interest.

AB  - Simple Summary Unsatisfactory, erroneous, inadequate, or inapplicable laws can lead to negative effects on human and animal health. Such can be the case with the uncontrolled and legally unregulated spread of chronic wasting disease (CWD) with possible zoonotic potential. This disease is spreading in cervids across Europe and other continents. In the context of historical experience with prion diseases, and taking into consideration the "one health" approach, CWD poses a serious challenge. The CWD problem should be properly managed in the European Union before the scale of the disease increases to resemble the situation in North America. The legal comparative analysis conducted in this study indicates that the experience gained by countries that have been struggling with the disease for years should be taken into account when drawing up community legislation.Abstract Prions cause infectious and fatal neurodegenerative diseases in mammals. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) affects wild and farmed cervids. The increasing number of cases in Europe, the resistance of prions to external conditions, and the persistence period threaten not only wild cervid populations but also the economy. The possible zoonotic potential of CWD is of growing concern. CWD is a relevant issue as far as the idea of "one health" is concerned, which is a fundamental principle of European veterinary law. Methods of legal text analysis and interpretation are used for this comparative legal study. Research reveals that countries struggling to tackle CWD employ different normative approaches to the problem and use different control and eradication schemes. The results of this study indicate that it is reasonable to issue uniform regulations in the European Union at the common, rather than national, level. The European legislation should creatively draw on the experience of North American countries that have been struggling with the discussed disease for a long time.

AB  - ObjectiveThe data provided herein represent the whole-genome sequencing data associated with three sheep breeds of Iranian native breeds. Sheep are the first domesticated animals that, during the long path of the evolution process, have created gene variants with desirable phenotypic effects, so they can be suitable models for biomedical research. In addition, sheep have a vital role in providing protein to a notable part of the human population around the world.Data descriptionTen blood samples were taken from three Iranian native sheep breeds, the Zel, Karakul, and Kermani kinds. Blood samples genomes were extracted using the salting-out technique. The Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform was used to carry out sequencing of the whole genome in a laboratory in China. All sequence information is available through the NCBI database in the sequence read archive (SRA) format under the accession number PRJNA904537. The dataset presented here can provide a useful resource for genome analysis of livestock breeds adapted to hot and dry regions.

AB  - Because global climate change results in increasingly extreme temperatures and more frequent droughts, behavioral thermoregulation is one avenue by which species may adjust. Changes in activity patterns in response to temperature have been observed in a number of mammal species, but rarely have been investigated in humid tropical habitats. Here we examine the relationship between activity patterns and microclimate temperatures for white-lipped peccaries (Tayassu pecari, Tayassuidae, Cetartiodactyla) in four distinct biomes-the Cerrado, the Pantanal, the Atlantic Forest, and the Amazon. From 2013 to 2017, we monitored 30 white-lipped peccaries fitted with GPS collars that included accelerometers and temperature sensors. White-lipped peccaries were primarily diurnal, with peaks of activity in the morning and late afternoon, except in the Amazon where activity was high throughout the day. Total time active did not vary seasonally. White-lipped peccaries were significantly less likely to be active as temperatures increased, with the probability of being active decreasing by >49% in all biomes between 30 and 40 degrees C. Our findings indicate that white-lipped peccaries are likely to be adversely impacted by rising temperatures, through being forced to reduce foraging time during their prime active periods.

AB  - Sheep wool is a fiber composite material derived from natural renewable sources. Natural fibers are becoming more popular in various applications, including the building industry. The reason for such popularity is because of the emergence of environmental, ecological, and economic concerns. Another reason is due to the favorable characteristics of natural fiber such as biodegradability, nontoxicity, combustibility, ease of availability, non abrasiveness, light weight, low cost, and high corrosion resistance. Despite these benefits, natural fibers have certain disadvantages, such as high water sensitivity, low melting temperature, and poor adherence to other materials. In this regard, the surface modification of natural fibers has attracted the attention of researchers to overcome these limitations. The impact resistance and strength properties of conventional (WF) and modified (MWF) waste sheep wool fibers in the manufacturing of concrete composites were examined in this study. WF fibers were used in five concrete mixtures, ranging from 0.5 to 2.5%. Pre-treatment was applied to the sheep wool fibers in five concrete mixtures with the same fiber content, and the results were results were examined with reference to a controlled plain concrete mixture. The addition of WF and MWF to concrete mixtures marginally reduced the compressive strength. However, the positive interaction between wool fibers and the cement matrix increased the tensile strength and impact resistance, resulting in increased concrete ductility and energy absorption capacity. The results show that pretreatment of sheep wool fibers significantly improves the performance of wool-fiber-reinforced concrete under impact loads. Consequently, one of the most promising building materials for environmentally friendly construction is wool-reinforced cement-based composite.

AB  - Pigs have emerged as valuable large-animal models for cardiac xenotransplantation; however, the temporal dynamics of myocardial development in this species remains insufficiently defined. This study analyzed gene expression patterns across four key developmental stages (neonatal, juvenile, sexual maturity, and adulthood) to delineate the molecular mechanisms driving porcine myocardial development. Increases in heart weight were accompanied by proportional expansion of myocardial fiber area and chamber size, reflecting coordinated structural development. Transcriptomic profiling of myocardial tissue by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) identified 2 189 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) across stage comparisons. Short time-series expression miner (STEM) analysis classified these DEGs into four major expression clusters enriched in pathways associated with myocardial development, immune responses, cell proliferation, and metabolic processes. Among 359 DEGs conserved across all developmental stages, six candidate genes were strongly associated with myocardial development. Reverse transcription-quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) confirmed a significant correlation between the expression of these candidate genes and myocardial development in porcine tissue. These findings establish a transcriptomic framework for porcine myocardial maturation and provide a molecular basis for advancing cardiac xenotransplantation.

AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of maternal dietary selenium yeast (SY) supplementation during pregnancy on the hair follicle development of kids. Sixty pregnant Hanshan white cashmere goats were randomly divided into the con group (fed with a basal diet) and the SY group (fed with a basal diet with 0.4 mg/kg SY). SY was supplemented during the pregnancy until the birth of the kids. The growth performance, cashmere performance, hair follicle characteristics, and serum antioxidant capacity of the kids were periodically determined. The results showed that the birth weight of the kids in the SY group was significantly higher than that in the con group (p < 0.05), and the average weight at 15 days, 1 month, 3 months, and 5 months of age increased by 13.60%, 8.77%, 8.86%, and 3.90%, respectively (p > 0.05). The cashmere fineness at early birth was dramatically reduced with SY supplementation (p < 0.001), whereas cashmere length and production were significantly increased at 5 months of age (p < 0.05). Histology assays indicated that the primary hair follicles were fully developed at birth, and there was no significant difference in the number of primary hair follicles between the two groups (p > 0.05). The number of secondary hair follicles and the number and density of active secondary hair follicles in the SY group at 15 days were significantly higher than those in the con group (p < 0.05) and were increased by 11.18%, 6.18%, and 22.55% at 5 months of age, respectively (p > 0.05). The serum antioxidant capacity analysis revealed that the SY group had higher levels of T-AOC, SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px activities and lower levels of MDA (p > 0.05). These results reveal that the maternal dietary supplementation of SY in gestation can promote the morphogenesis and maturation of secondary hair follicles and increase the number and density of secondary hair follicles by enhancing the body's antioxidant capacity, contributing to the improvement of cashmere quality and yield.

AB  - Introduction: Traditional knowledge about medicinal plants is part of the health system of indigenous communities. The use of multiple combined species is frequent in the Argentine Northwest, but studies focused on the subject are scarce. This study describes and contextualizes the uses of these preparations. M&M: We applied participant observation techniques in the indigenous community of Ocumazo, Humahuaca, Jujuy, Argentina, with its prior informed consent. Open interviews were undertaken with key collaborators and other adults, through sampling by networks and by opportunity. We investigated the elaboration of recipes and how people used them. Further, we analyzed the administration and the context of application. The data were analyzed with qualitative techniques. Results: 12 combinations of 26 plant species were surveyed (69% native, 23% cultivated, 9% adventitious), including animal products. In daily life, medicinal preparations are used for respiratory, gastrointestinal, bone, and musculoskeletal diseases, among others. In the context of ritual celebration, the beverages take on symbolic significance. Conclusions: The inhabitants of Ocumazo articulate precise knowledge about the ways to combine the species and to administrate the formulas. In a ritual context, the selection of species and the elaboration of recipes differ from daily use. The community has its own knowledge about the distribution of species according to warm or cold qualities prevailing notions of Hippocratic humoral medicine.

AB  - The lady beetles Tenuisvalvae notata and Cryptolaemus montrouzieri are important predators of mealybugs (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae). Like the prey, these lady beetles produce wax filaments that cover their body during the larval stage. It has been hypothesized that lady beetle body wax chemical profiles are like their prey as i) a mechanism of camouflage, and ii) conveying protection to the lady beetle larvae against aphid-tending predatory ants. Here, we tested this hypothesis for the predators T. notata and C. montrouzieri and two mealybug prey species, Ferissia dasyrilii, and Planococcus citri. We assessed how prey species influence the predator's cuticular chemistry throughout its development and evaluated the metabolic costs of wax production in both larvae and adults. Cuticular wax samples were analyzed using GC-MS and GC-FID, and metabolic costs were specifically evaluated in 4th instar larvae of both predator species. The larvae were subjected to body wax removal from 0 to 4 times. Results showed that predator body wax profiles are not like the chemical profile of prey body wax. There was a metabolic cost associated with wax removal; predators (male and female) showed a significant reduction in adult body weight when wax was removed. This suggests reallocation of energy to wax replacement instead of growth. In addition, we detected effects of wax removal on fecundity and egg viability. Our results do not support the hypothesis that predators mimic the cuticular wax composition of prey as a means of camouflage.

AB  - Corn earworm, Helicoverpa zea Boddie (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), is a common herbivore that causes economic damage to agronomic and specialty crops across North America. The interannual abundance of H. zea is closely linked to climactic variables that influence overwintering survival, as well as within-season host plant availability that drives generational population increases. Although the abiotic and biotic drivers of H. zea populations have been well documented, prior temporal H. zea modeling studies have largely focused on mechanistic/simulation approaches, long term distribution characterization, or degree day-based phenology within the growing season. While these modeling approaches provide insight into H. zea population ecology, growers remain interested in approaches that forecast the interannual magnitude of moth flights which is a key knowledge gap limiting early warning before crops are planted. Our study used trap data from 48 site-by-year combinations distributed across North Carolina between 2008 and 2021 to forecast H. zea abundance in advance of the growing season. To do this, meteorological data from weather stations were combined with crop and soil data to create predictor variables for a random forest H. zea forecasting model. Overall model performance was strong (R2 = 0.92, RMSE = 350) and demonstrates a first step toward development of contemporary model-based forecasting tools that enable proactive approaches in support of integrated pest management plans. Similar methods could be applied at a larger spatial extent by leveraging national gridded climate and crop data paired with trap counts to expand forecasting models throughout the H. zea overwintering range.

AB  - The recovery of wolves (Canis lupus) across Europe is a notable conservation success in a region with extensive human alteration of landscapes and high human population densities. We provide a comprehensive update on wolf populations in Europe, estimated at over 21,500 individuals by 2022, representing a 58% increase over the past decade. Despite the challenges of high human densities and significant land use for agriculture, industry, and urbanization, wolves have demonstrated remarkable adaptability and increasing population trends in most European countries. Improved monitoring techniques, although varying in quality and scope, have played a crucial role in tracking this recovery. Annually, wolves kill approximately 56,000 domestic animals in the EU, a risk unevenly distributed and differently handled across regions. Damage compensation costs 17 million EUR every year to European countries. Positive economic impacts from wolf presence, such as those related to reducing traffic accidents with wild ungulates or supporting wildlife tourism, remain under studied. Wolf recovery in Europe is supported by diverse policy and legal instruments such as LIFE programs, stakeholder platforms, as well as the EU Habitats Directive and the Bern Convention. Coexisting with newly established wolf populations in Europe entails managing impacts on human activities, including livestock depredation, competition for game, and fear of attacks on humans, amidst varying social and political views on wolf recovery. Sustainable coexistence continues to operate in evolving and complex social, economic, and political landscapes, often characterized by intense debates regarding wolf policies.

AB  - Objective: We describe the composition and variation of women's resource strategies in an arid-living Southern African agro-pastoralist society to gain insights into adaptation to climate-change-induced increased aridity.
   Methods: Using cross-sectional data from 210 women collected in 2009 across 28 agro-pastoralist villages in Kaokoveld Namibia, we conducted principal-component (PC) analysis of resource variables and constructed profiles of resource strategies from the major PCs. Next, we explored associations between key resource strategies and demographic measures and fitness proxies.
   Results: The first two PCs accounted for 43% of women's overall resource variation. PC1 reflects women's ability to access market resources via livestock trading, while PC2 captured women's direct food access. We found that market strategies were more common among married women and less common among women who have experienced child mortality. Women with higher subsistence security were more likely to be from the OvaHimba tribe and had a higher risk of gonorrhea exposure. We also qualitatively explored drought-induced pressure on women's livestock. Finally, we show that sexual networks were attenuated during drought, indicating strain on social support.
   Conclusions: Our results highlight how agro-pastoralist women manage critical resources in unpredictable environments, and how resource strategies distribute among the women in our study. Goats as a commodity to obtain critical resources suggests that some women have flexibility during drought when gardens fail and cattle die. However, increased aridity and drought may eventually overwhelm husbandry practices in this region.

AB  - We aimed to investigate the impact of heat stress (HS) on the expression of tight junction (TJ) proteins and the interaction between genes affecting intestinal barrier function using transcriptomics in the porcine jejunum. Twenty-four barrows (crossbred Yorkshire x Landrace x Duroc; average initial body weight, 56.71 +/- 1.74 kg) were placed in different temperatures (normal temperature [NT]; HS) and reared for 56 days. At the end of the experiment, jejunal samples were collected from three pigs per treatment for transcriptome and reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analyses. We identified 43 differentially expressed genes, involving five Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways, eight molecular functions, seven cellular components (CCs), and nine biological processes, using gene ontology enrichment analysis. Genes associated with the actin cytoskeleton, filament-binding pathways, and TJ proteins were selected and analyzed by RT-qPCR. Significant differences in relative mRNA expression showed that downregulated genes in the HS group included ZO1, CLDN1, OCLN, PCK1, and PCK2, whereas ACTG2, DES, MYL9, MYLK, TPM1, TPM2, CNN1, PDLIM3, and PCP4 were upregulated by HS (p < 0.05). These findings indicate that HS in growing-finishing pigs induces depression in gut integrity, which may be related to genes involved in the actin cytoskeleton and filaments of CC.

AB  - Simple Summary With the increasing consumption of pork, pig manure has become an important pollution problem in the pig livestock industry. It is worth noting that the amount of manure from fattening pigs far exceeds that from breeding herds. During the fattening period, the manure's composition may vary depending on the stage of the pig's growth, from nursery to finishing, and on the variety of feed. The treatment of manure by black soldier fly larvae (BSFL), Hermetia illucens (L.), (Diptera: Stratiomydiae) is an emerging waste management technology. Although studies have shown that BSFL could be used in swine manure treatment, there is little literature discussing the nutrient discrepancies of swine manure types and their influences on BSFL growth. Thus, this study analyzed the nutrient composition of different fattening pig manure types. Furthermore, the factors that influence larval growth were identified. This could be used in further waste treatment and formulation diets for BSFL. Livestock manure is an important component of agricultural organic waste, and in recent years, with the development of research on the bioconversion of manure, BSFs have been proven to be useful in the treatment of a variety of livestock wastes. In-depth research on the composition of manure and its effect on the development of BSFL is, however, very scarce. The purpose of this study was to identify the parameters that influenced the growth of BSFL that was fed fattening pig manure. The pH, moisture, and nutrients of the fattening manures (namely, nursery, growing, and finishing pig manures) were measured. To examine the influence of manure types on larval growth, 100 larvae were inoculated in 100 g of each type of manure in triplicate. According to the findings, larvae fed finishing pig manure had the lowest dry weight (30.2 +/- 6.1 mg) compared to those fed growing (58.2 +/- 7.3 mg) or nursery (65.5 +/- 6.2 mg) pig manure. The correlation coefficients (r) between the nutrients in the manure and the weight of the larvae were calculated. Hemicellulose had the greatest |r| value (0.9569). Further research revealed that larvae raised on hemicellulase-pretreated finishing pig manure frequently weighed 21-30% (days 2-8) more than larvae raised on control manure. In conclusion, hemicellulose was a significant component that might hinder larval growth. The results of this study could be used to improve the system before it is put into use.

AB  - Exposure to environmental toxicants have serious implications for the general health and well-being of children, particularly during pivotal neurodevelopmental stages. The Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Superfund program has identified several areas (Superfund sites) across the United States with high levels of environmental toxicants, which affect the health of many residents in nearby communities. Exposure to these environmental toxicants has been linked to changes in the structure and function of the brain. However, limited research has investigated the relationship between the proximity of childhood homes to a Superfund site and the development of subcortical structures like the hippocampus and amygdala. The present study investigated the hippocampal and amygdala volumes of young adults in relation to the proximity of their childhood homes to Birmingham, Alabama's 35th Avenue Superfund site. Forty participants who either lived within or adjacent to the Superfund site (Proximal group; n = 20) or who lived elsewhere in the greater Birmingham metropolitan area (Distal group; n = 20) were included in this study. Both groups were matched on age, sex, race, and years of education. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to compare the gray matter volume of the hippocampus and amygdala between groups. Differences in bilateral hippocampal and left amygdala volumes were observed. Specifically, hippocampal and amygdala volumes were greater in the Proximal than Distal group. These findings suggest that the proximity of children's homes to environmental toxicants may impact the development of the hippocampus and amygdala.

AB  - Two subspecies of white-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus are recognized in the northwestern United States: O. v. leucurus (Douglas, 1829), and O. v. ochrourus Bailey, 1932. Historically, O. v. leucurus was common along the Lower Columbia River and the name was applied to all populations in western Oregon as far south as Grants Pass. Today, O. v. leucurus is limited to populations along the Lower Columbia River with another in Douglas County, Oregon. Examination of 35 electrophoretic loci in 1988 did not support current subspecific taxonomy of O. virginianus in Oregon. Analysis of 18 cranial dimensions among three disjunct populations of O. virginianus in 2003 revealed variation that sorted into three corresponding distinct morphological groups in Oregon. Analyses of mtDNA and microsatellites at 15 autosomal loci from three subspecies of O. virginianus and 2 subspecies of O. hemionus (Rafinesque, 1817) revealed that each O. v. leucurus population possessed unique haplotypes, whereas O. v. ochrourus shared haplotypes with populations to the east. The most genetically differentiated whitetails were the 2 populations of O. v. leucurus (FST = 0.31), which were similarly differentiated from O. v. ochrourus (FST = 0.17-0.19); FST between O. h. hemionus and O. h. columbianus (Richarson, 1829) was 0.10. Thus, O. v. leucurus populations appear morphologically and genetically more different from each other than either is from O. v. ochrourus. Moreover, genetic differentiation among the three O. virginianus populations exceeds differentiation for existing subspecies of O. hemionus. We conclude the evidence warrants describing a new subspecies of O. virginianus in southwestern Oregon.

AB  - This study employs a microaerobic pretreatment that includes different microbial reagents combined with oxygen to enhance the energy conversion potential of rice straw (RS) via anaerobic digestion (AD) in a more cost-effective and time-efficient manner. Five broad varieties of microbial reagents including liquid consortium (LC), cow manure (CM), sheep dung (SD), biogas slurry (BS), and straw-decomposing consortia (SC), have been used as sources of useful microbes at varying oxygen concentrations of 0, 6,12 and 24 mLO2/gVS to explore the effect of microaerobic pretreatment on RS degradation. The results showed that RS pretreated with SC had the highest cumulative methane yield (CMY) of 311.7 mL/gVS at 12 mLO2/gVS, followed by BS, CM, LC, and SD, with the CMYs of 270.5, 263.2, 257.1, and 256.7 mL/gVS at 6 mLO2/gVS, respectively. The RS pretreated with SC, BS, CM, LC, and SD led to improvements in the methane yield by 88.7%, 63.7%, 59.3%, 55.6%, and 55.4%, respectively, compared to the untreated RS. The microbial community analysis revealed that the relative abundance (RA) of Firmicutes , which are known to play a key role in accelerating the rate of hydrolysis, increased after microbial pretreatment combined with oxygen supply. The RA of Clostridium III , which facilitates cell wall degradation via hydrolytic pathways along with other sugar-fermenting bacteria, such as Saccharofermentans , Lutaonella , and Sed-imentibacter, increased after AD in the digestate of pretreated RS compared to that in untreated RS. Moreover, a shift in acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic archaea, including Methanothrix and Meth-anospirillum, was also observed, indicating precursor changes resulted by pretreatments and varied microbial metabolism, which might have enhanced the methane production process of RS. The energy potential analysis revealed that microbial pretreatment was a suitable technique for stimulating the energy conversion efficiency of RS. This study can be used as a reference for future utilization of a diverse range of lignocellulosic materials for clean energy production. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Infertility, abortion, and stillbirth caused by endometritis are the main factors affecting fertility in ru-minants. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated inflammation is the main cause of endometritis. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) pathway and pyroptosis play an important role in the inflammation, but the under-lying mechanism is still unclear. Previous studies have reported that UFMylation, a ubiquitin-like post -translational modifier, plays an important regulatory role in inflammation via the TLR4 pathway; how-ever, its relationship with pyroptosis is still unclear. Our result showed that LPS induced inflammation by activating the TLR4 pathway and pyroptosis in goat endometrial epithelial cells (gEECs). We also found that TAK-242,a specific inhibitor of the TLR4 pathway, inhibited the pyroptosis pathway. In addition, with an increased LPS treatment time, ubiquitin-folding modifier factor 1 (UFM1) conjugated proteins were highly expressed in gEECs. Moreover, overexpression of UFM1 inhibited LPS-induced activation of the TLR4 pathway and pyroptosis, whereas si-UFM1 produced contrasting results. After inhibiting the TLR4 pathway, si-UFM1 could not upregulate the expression of nod-like receptor family protein 3 (NLRP3), cleavage caspase-1, or cleavage gasdermin D (GSDMD). In conclusion, these results suggest that UFM1 inhibits pyroptosis activation in LPS-induced gEECs through the TLR4 pathway. (c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Synthetic elicitors of the salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) plant defense pathways can be used to increase crop protection against herbivores and pathogens. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that elicitors of plant defenses interact with pathogen infection to influence crop resistance against vector and nonvector herbivores. To do so, we employed a trophic system comprising of cranberries (Vaccinium macrocarpon), the phytoplasma that causes false blossom disease, and two herbivores-the blunt-nosed leafhopper (Limotettix vaccinii), the vector of false blossom disease, and the nonvector gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar). We tested four commercial elicitors, including three that activate mainly SA-related plant defenses (Actigard, LifeGard, and Regalia) and one activator of JA-related defenses (Blush). A greenhouse experiment in which phytoplasma-infected and uninfected plants received repeated exposure to elicitors revealed that both phytoplasma infection and elicitor treatment individually improved L. vaccinii and L. dispar mass compared to uninfected, untreated controls; however, SA-based elicitor treatments reduced L. vaccinii mass on infected plants. Regalia also improved L. vaccinii survival. Phytoplasma infection reduced plant size and mass, increased levels of nitrogen (N) and SA, and lowered carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratios compared to uninfected plants, irrespective of elicitor treatment. Although none of our elicitor treatments influenced transcript levels of a phytoplasma-specific marker gene, all of them increased N and reduced C/N levels; the three SA activators also reduced JA levels. Taken together, our findings reveal positive effects of both phytoplasma infection and elicitor treatment on the performance of L. vaccinii and L. dispar in cranberries, likely via enhancement of plant nutrition and changes in phytohormone profiles, specifically increases in SA levels and corresponding decreases in levels of JA. Thus, we found no evidence that the tested elicitors of plant defenses increase resistance to insect herbivores or reduce disease incidence in cranberries.

AB  - The outbreak of African swine fever (ASF) in China has significantly reduced the country's pig production capability, whilst also having far-reaching impacts on livestock products supply in the wider food system. Previous studies have quantified the potential long-terms impacts on food prices, however, little information is available regarding the direct short-term impacts on food system changes (livestock products supply and consumption patterns) and water quality protection associated with the outbreak. Here, we used multiple sources of data in relation to consumption patterns and water quality to fill this knowledge gap. Our results indicate that the ASF outbreak has changed the short-term livestock products consumption pattern in China, with increasing reliance on importation of livestock products. A rapid change in pork self-sufficiency rate has also driven a rapid increase in the consumer price index of many cities. Banned swill feeding and reversed environmental regulations in the watercourse intense regions has unintended consequences, especially on water quality. Swill, which is no longer fed, was dumped into water waste streams and lowered the sewage treatment efficiency. The re-establishment of pig production back into watercourse intense regions has led to exceedance of local manure nutrient loading capacity of agricultural land. We suggest (a) a short-term intermediate policy to prohibit discharge of swill to sewage systems, to return their previous efficiency, (b) the development of new technologies for the safe recycling of swills, and (c) the design of a long-term intelligent spatial planning of pig production, slaughter and transportation within China to ensure continued protection of water quality vulnerable zones.

AB  - Active surveillance was conducted by collecting questing ticks from vegetation through a 2-yr survey in Pike County, Pennsylvania. Over a thousand blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis Say) and American dog ticks (Dermacentor variabilis Say) were collected. A single specimen of the following species was collected: lone star tick (Amblyomma americanum L.), rabbit tick (Haemaphysalis leporispalustris Packard), and an Asian longhorned tick (Haemaphysalis longicornis Neumann). This study represents the largest county-wide study in Pennsylvania, surveying 988 questing I. scapularis adult and nymphs. Molecular detection of five distinct tick-borne pathogens was screened through real-time PCR at a single tick resolution. Respectively, the overall 2-yr adult and nymph prevalence were highest with Borrelia burgdorferi (Spirochaetales: Spirochaetacceae) (45.99%, 18.94%), Anaplasma phagocytophilum (Rickettsiales: Anaplasmataceae) (12.29%, 7.95%) where the variant-ha (8.29%, 3.03%) was overall more prevalent than the variant-v1 (2.49%, 4.17%), Babesia microti (Piroplasmida: Babesiidae) (4.97%, 5.30%), Borrelia miyamotoi (Spirochaetales: Spirochaetaceae) (1.38%, 1.89%), and Powassan virus lineage II [POWV]/deer tick virus (DTV) (2.07%, 0.76%). Adult and nymph coinfection prevalence of B. burgdorferi and B. microti (3.03%, 4.97%) and adult coinfection of B. burgdorferi and A. phagocytophilum or A. phagocytophilum and B. microti were significantly higher than the independent infection rate expected naturally. This study highlights the urgency to conduct diverse surveillance studies with large sample sizes to better understand the human risk for tick-borne diseases within small geographical areas.

AB  - Environmental enrichment implemented in early life is able to induce long-term changes in gene expression, synaptic function and behavioural responses. In this study, we evaluated the adult behavioural effects of perinatal environment enrichment in male and female mice (PEE), as well as the males and females of PEE male offspring (OPEE). For this purpose, animals were submitted to the following battery of behavioural analyses: elevated plus maze, open field test, light-dark box and novelty suppression feeding test. The frontal cortex and ventral hippocampus of PEE mice were collected for the evaluation of the expression of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-related genes. The PEE animals showed an increase in exploratory activity, associated with a reduction in anxiety-like behaviours on the elevated plus maze; this effect was mainly observed in males. Additionally, the male OPEE showed a reduction in anxiety-like behaviours on the elevated plus maze, mainly observed in a reduction of risk assessment-related behaviours. The PEE male mice also showed reduced expression of Gabra3 in the ventral hippocampus when compared to the control group. These results demonstrate that perinatal environmental enrichment promotes a reduction in anxiety-like behaviour that can be transferred intergenerationally.

AB  - Virtual fencing technology uses on-animal devices to communicate boundaries via a warning audio tone and electrical pulse signals. There are limited virtual fencing studies on sheep. This study used modified cattle eShepherd((R)) virtual fencing neckbands to enable automated trials with small sheep groups. The first 5-day trial with six Dorper crossbred sheep was conducted in an experimental paddock setting, with a second 5-day trial conducted with 10 Ultra White sheep on a commercial farm. The animals across both trials were contained in the inclusion zone for 99.8% and 92.2% of the trial period, and most of the cues they received were audio tones, indicating they were learning the warning audio tone meant to stop or turn around. In the second trial, sheep crossed over into the exclusion zone on the third night and remained there until they were walked out for their daily yard check in the morning. These preliminary trial results indicate automated technology can work on sheep, but devices need to be designed specifically for sheep, including algorithms adapted to better herd a group of sheep back out of an exclusion zone. A collar device may only be applicable to some sheep breeds with reduced wool.
   Virtual fencing technology uses on-animal devices to communicate boundaries via a warning audio tone and electrical pulse signals. There is currently limited validation work on sheep. This study used modified cattle eShepherd((R)) virtual fencing neckbands on reduced-wool sheep with clipped necks to enable automated trials with small groups across both day and night. The first 5-day trial with six Dorper crossbred sheep was conducted in an experimental paddock setting, with a second 5-day trial conducted with 10 Ultra White sheep on a commercial farm. The animals across both trials were contained in the inclusion zone for 99.8% and 92.2% of the trial period, with a mean percentage (+/- SD) of total audio cues as audio only (i.e., not followed by an electrical pulse) being 74.9% +/- 4.6 in the first trial, and 83.3% +/- 20.6 for the second trial. In the second trial, sheep crossed over into the exclusion zone on the third night and remained there until they were walked out for their daily yard check in the morning. These preliminary trial results are promising for the use of automated technology on sheep, but suitable devices and algorithms still need to be designed specifically for sheep in the long term.

AB  - Tick-borne diseases are a growing public health problem in the United States, and the US northeast has reported consistently high case rates for decades. Monmouth County, New Jersey, was one of the earliest jurisdictions to report Lyme disease cases in 1979 and reports several hundred cases per year nearly 40 yr later. In the time since, however, tick-borne health risks have expanded far beyond Lyme disease to include a variety of other bacterial pathogens and viruses, and additional vectors, necessitating a continually evolving approach to tick surveillance. In 2017, Monmouth County initiated an active surveillance program targeting sites across three ecological regions for collection of Ixodes scapularis Say (Acari: Ixodidae) and Amblyomma americanum L. (Acari: Ixodidae) as well as testing via qPCR for associated bacterial pathogens. During the first five years of this program (2017-2021), we report high levels of spatiotemporal variability in nymphal density and infection prevalence in both species, limiting the granularity with which human risk can be predicted from acarological data. Nonetheless, broader patterns emerged, including an ongoing trend of A. americanum dominance, risks posed by Borrelia miyamotoi, and the frequency of coinfected ticks. We present some of the first county-level, systematic surveillance of nymphal A. americanum density and infection prevalence in the northeastern US. We also documented a temporary decline in Borrelia burgdorferi that could relate to unmeasured trends in reservoir host populations. We discuss the implications of our findings for tick-borne disease ecology, public health communication, and tick surveillance strategies in endemic areas.

AB  - Phoresy, the use of another organism for dispersal, is one of the most intriguing commensalistic interactions. The selection of a correct host is fundamental for phoretic organisms to ensure arrival to suitable habitats and to encounter potential mates. This study focuses on a group of phoretic mites in the genus Lasioseius (Acari: Blattisociidae). In La Selva Biological Station, a tropical wet forest in Costa Rica, Lasioseius mites feed on nematodes inside the scrolls formed by the young leaves of their hosts, plants in the order Zingiberales. When leaves expand and unfurl, mites disperse to another rolled leaf by clinging onto 'rolled-leaf beetles', a group of insect herbivores specialized on Zingiberales (genera Cephaloleia and Chelobasis; Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae). In this study, we determined whether Lasioseius mites associated with Cephaloleia belti Baly are specialized on this beetle species as a phoretic host. Mites may also be attracted to Chelobasis perplexa Baly, sharing the same host plant. Another possibility is that Lasioseius mites are opportunistic generalists and attach to rolled-leaf beetle species (e.g., Cephaloleia dorsalis Baly) that never share host plants with either C. belti or Ch. perplexa. In a laboratory setting, we tested whether mites preferred scents from and/or attached to particular beetle species. Scent attraction experiments showed that Lasioseius mites collected from C. belti were attracted to scents from C. belti and Ch. perplexa, but were not attracted to scents from C. dorsalis. Mites collected from C. belti attached to both C. belti and Ch. perplexa, but never to C. dorsalis. In conclusion, Lasioseius mites are not strict specialists, but are able to detect and attach to beetle species that inhabit their host plant.

AB  - The comparison of chloroplast genome (cpDNA) sequences among different plant species is an important source of plant molecular phylogenetic data. In this paper, the cpDNA sequences of 13 different oil-tea camellia samples were compared to identify an undetermined oil-tea camellia species from Hainan Province. The cpDNA of the samples was sequenced and resequenced, and divergence hotspots and simple sequence repeat (SSR) variations were analyzed. Bayesian inference (BI) and maximum-likelihood (ML) phylogenetic trees were constructed based on the full cpDNA sequences. The cpDNA sequences were 156512 similar to 157089 bp in length and had the circular tetrad structure typical of angiosperms. The inverted repeats (IRs) of different species included varying contractions and expansions. The cpDNA sequences of the samples of the undetermined species of oil-tea camellia from Hainan Province and Camellia gauchowensis from Xuwen County were identical. In total, 136 genes were annotated, including 91 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 37 tRNA genes and 8 rRNA genes. The GC content of the cpDNA was 37.3%. The small single-copy (SSC)/IR boundary was rich in variation. Divergence hotspots were mainly located in the intergenic space (IGS) and coding sequences (CDSs), and there were obvious differences in divergence hotspots among species. The same divergence hotspots were found in Camellia vietnamensis, Camellia gauchowensis and the undetermined species of oil-tea camellia from Hainan Province. A total of 191 similar to 198 SSR loci were detected. Most of the SSRs included A or T, and the distribution of SSRs in the cpDNA was uneven. Different species shared common SSRs and exhibited unique SSRs. Based on the full cpDNA sequences, the evolutionary relationships of different species of Camellia were well identified. The thirteen samples were classified into 2 clades and 6 subclades, and the different sections of Camellia clustered on the same branch in 2 clades and 2 subclades. Camellia vietnamensis was more closely related to the undetermined species of oil-tea camellia from Hainan Province and the sample of Camellia gauchowensis from Xuwen County than to the sample of Camellia gauchowensis from Luchuan County. Camellia osmantha was closely related to Camellia gauchowensis and Camellia vietnamensis. In conclusion, the cpDNA of different oil-tea camellia species has a conserved tetrad structure with certain length polymorphisms. SSRs are expected to be developed as "barcodes" or "identity cards" for species identification. SSR variations and other factors result in abundant divergence hotspots in the CDSs and IGS (one non-CDS region), indicating that full cpDNA sequences can be used for the species identification and phylogenetic analysis of Camellia. Accordingly, the undetermined species of oil-tea camellia from Hainan Province is likely Camellia vietnamensis, Camellia vietnamensis and Camellia gauchowensis may be the same species, and additional genetic evidence is needed to determine whether Camellia osmantha is a new independent species. The previous division of related sections of Camellia may need readjustment based on full cpDNA sequences.

AB  - Although 5-methylcytosine (m(5)C) has been identified as a novel and abundant mRNA modification and associated with energy metabolism, its regulation function in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle is still limited. This study aimed at investigating the effect of mRNA m(5)C on adipogenesis and myogenesis using Jinhua pigs (J), Yorkshire pigs (Y) and their hybrids Yorkshire-Jinhua pigs (YJ). We found that Y grow faster than J and YJ, while fatness-related characteristics observed in Y were lower than those of J and YJ. Besides, total mRNA m(5)C levels and expression rates of NSUN2 were higher both in backfat layer (BL) and longissimus dorsi muscle (LDM) of Y compared to J and YJ, suggesting that higher mRNA m(5)C levels positively correlate with lower fat and higher muscle mass. RNA bisulfite sequencing profiling of m(5)C revealed tissue-specific and dynamic features in pigs. Functionally, hyper-methylated m(5)C-containing genes were enriched in pathways linked to impaired adipogenesis and enhanced myogenesis. In in vitro, m(5)C inhibited lipid accumulation and promoted myogenic differentiation. Furthermore, YBX2 and SMO were identified as m(5)C targets. Mechanistically, YBX2 and SMO mRNAs with m(5)C modification were recognized and exported into the cytoplasm from the nucleus by ALYREF, thus leading to increased YBX2 and SMO protein expression and thereby inhibiting adipogenesis and promoting myogenesis, respectively. Our work uncovered the critical role of mRNA m(5)C in regulating adipogenesis and myogenesis via ALYREF-m(5)C-YBX2 and ALYREF-m(5)C-SMO manners, providing a potential therapeutic target in the prevention and treatment of obesity, skeletal muscle dysfunction and metabolic disorder diseases.

AB  - Introduction: Plants employ the Calvin-Benson cycle (CBC) to fix atmospheric CO2 for the production of biomass. The flux of carbon through the CBC is limited by the activity and selectivity of Ribulose-1,5-Bisphosphate Carboxylase/Oxygenase (RuBisCO). Alternative CO2 fixation pathways that do not use RuBisCO to fix CO2 have evolved in some anaerobic, autotrophic microorganisms. Methods: Rather than modifying existing routes of carbon metabolism in plants, we have developed a synthetic carbon fixation cycle that does not exist in nature but is inspired by metabolisms of bacterial autotrophs. In this work, we build and characterize a condensed, reverse tricarboxylic acid (crTCA) cycle in vitro and in planta. Results: We demonstrate that a simple, synthetic cycle can be used to fix carbon in vitro under aerobic and mesophilic conditions and that these enzymes retain activity whenexpressed transiently in planta. We then evaluate stable transgenic lines of Camelina sativa that have both phenotypic and physiologic changes. Transgenic C. sativa are shorter than controls with increased rates of photosynthetic CO2 assimilation and changes in photorespiratory metabolism. Discussion: This first iteration of a build-test-learn phase of the crTCA cycle provides promising evidence that this pathway can be used to increase photosynthetic capacity in plants.

AB  - Simple Summary This study aimed to investigate the impact of Spirulina platensis (SP) supplementation on the reproductive characteristics of Sahrawi and Jabbali bucks. It involved a comparative analysis of semen quality and the levels of the blood hormones luteinizing hormone (LH) and testosterone (Tes) between animals in both the Control group and the supplementary feeding groups. The outcomes demonstrated that the addition of SP had a notable positive effect on reproductive parameters, likely attributable to enhancements in several seminal traits for Sahrawi and Jabbali goats. These findings hold significant promise for enhancing the reproductive efficiency of Omani goats and offer valuable insights for livestock management practices.
   Abstract Spirulina platensis (SP) is a protein-rich dietary supplement that improves animal reproductive traits. This study investigated the effect of SP supplementation on puberty onset, semen characteristics, scrotal circumference (SC), libido, and hormone concentrations in Sahrawi and Jabbali bucks. The study was conducted in 36 bucks, divided into three groups (n = 6/group), for 70 days. The rations included the following: (1) Control feed (Con) with 14% crude protein and 11.97% MJ/kg DM energy; (2) Con with 2 g SP/head/day SP treatment (T1) and (3) Con with 4 g SP/head/day treatment (T2). The mean (+/- SEM) SC of both SP groups in the Sahrawi breed was significantly higher (p <= 0.05) compared to the Con. The mean of the semen volume significantly increased (p <= 0.05) in the SP group than in the Con group in both breeds. SP groups vs. Con groups had increased sperm concentration in Sahrawi bucks than Jabbali bucks. Mean serum luteinizing hormone (LH) and testosterone (Tes) concentrations in Jabbali bucks were significantly higher (p <= 0.05) in the SP groups compared to Sahrawi bucks. SP improved the SC, semen quality, libido, sperm concentration, and LH and Tes concentrations in both breeds. The results of the current study suggest that adding SP to the diet may have the ability to improve the semen quality of the local Omani bucks.

AB  - Bromine released from the decomposition of short-lived brominated source gases contributes as a sink of ozone in the lower stratosphere. The two major contributors are CH2Br2 and CHBr3. In this study, we investigate the global seasonal distribution of these two substances, based on four High Altitude and Long Range Research Aircraft (HALO) missions, the HIAPER Pole-to-Pole Observations (HIPPO) mission, and the Atmospheric Tomography (ATom) mission. Observations of CH2Br2 in the free and upper troposphere indicate a pronounced seasonality in both hemispheres, with slightly larger mixing ratios in the Northern Hemisphere (NH). Compared to CH2Br2, CHBr3 in these regions shows larger variability and less clear seasonality, presenting larger mixing ratios in winter and autumn in NH midlatitudes to high latitudes. The lowermost stratosphere of SH and NH shows a very similar distribution of CH2Br2 in hemispheric spring with differences well below 0.1 ppt, while the differences in hemispheric autumn are much larger with substantially smaller values in the SH than in the NH. This suggests that transport processes may be different in both hemispheric autumn seasons, which implies that the influx of tropospheric air ( "flushing ") into the NH lowermost stratosphere is more efficient than in the SH. The observations of CHBr3 support the suggestion, with a steeper vertical gradient in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere in SH autumn than in NH autumn. However, the SH database is insufficient to quantify this difference. We further compare the observations to model estimates of TOMCAT (Toulouse Off-line Model of Chemistry And Transport) and CAM-Chem (Community Atmosphere Model with Chemistry, version 4), both using the same emission inventory of . The pronounced tropospheric seasonality of CH2Br2 in the SH is not reproduced by the models, presumably due to erroneous seasonal emissions or atmospheric photochemical decomposition efficiencies. In contrast, model simulations of CHBr3 show a pronounced seasonality in both hemispheres, which is not confirmed by observations. The distributions of both species in the lowermost stratosphere of the Northern and Southern hemispheres are overall well captured by the models with the exception of southern hemispheric autumn, where both models present a bias that maximizes in the lowest 40 K above the tropopause, with considerably lower mixing ratios in the observations. Thus, both models reproduce equivalent flushing in both hemispheres, which is not confirmed by the limited available observations. Our study emphasizes the need for more extensive observations in the SH to fully understand the impact of CH2Br2 and CHBr3 on lowermost-stratospheric ozone loss and to help constrain emissions.

AB  - Periosteum is essential for bone regeneration and damage repair in mammals. Most species of deer family (Cervidae) develop two kinds of special periosteum, antler periosteum and pedicle periosteum, both supporting the complete regeneration of antler. Antler is the bone organ with the fastest growth rate in mammals. Along with the fast growth of antler, its external tissues such as blood vessels, nerves and the covering skin also grow rapidly. Currently, it is still unclear whether antler periosteum contributes to the fast growth of antler and how. It is also unclear why the regenerative capacity of antler periosteum is weaker than that of pedicle periosteum. In this study, the in vitro culture system for antler periosteal cells (AnPC) was constructed for the first time using the mid-beam antler periostea during antler fast-growth period. According to our results, the cultured AnPC expressed classical MSC markers, consistent with the pedicle periosteal stem cells (PPSC). However, the fluorescence intensities of the MSC markers on AnPC were significantly weaker than those on PPSC. In addition, AnPC showed much lower proliferation rates than PPSC. The proliferation rates of the AnPC also gradually decreased after successive passages, while the proliferation rates of the pedicle periosteal stem cells remained unchanged. These findings may partially explain the weaker regenerative capacity of antler periosteum. Further comparative global gene analysis revealed clearly the different gene expressed patterns between AnPC and PPSC. AnPC may mainly function on promoting angiogenesis, nerve growth and intramembrane bone formation during antler regeneration, whereas PPSC may primarily be involved in androgen signaling receptor pathway and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and function on maintaining stem cell renewal.

AB  - The stigmas of saffron (Crocus sativus L.) are known as "red gold" for being the most expensive spice of the world. This medicinal crop grows well in the regions with cold winter Mediterranean climate. However, salinity can be one of the limiting factors for its cultivation in these regions. Composted manures and their co-compost with wood-derived biochar as fertilizers in saline soil can reduce the salinity stress on saffron. In this study, the composted manures from dairy farms (FYM), sheep and goats (SG) and poultry (PM) and their co-compost with wood-derived biochar (FYM-B, SG-B and PM-B) were amended in non-saline (EC1:2 0.25 dS m(-1), SOM; 9.9 g kg(-1)) and soil with natural slight salinity (EC1:2; 1.95 dS m(-1), SOM; 30.9 g kg(-1)) soil for two consecutive years with the total amendment rate of 65 t ha(-1) for each fertilizer. The saline soil was transported from an agricultural farm (30 km away from research field); whereas, the non-saline soil was not transported and was not cultivated before. The amendment of fertilizers and sowing of corms were conducted at the same time in the mid of August. The stigma yield in saline control soil was significantly lower than non-saline control in both cropping years. In non-saline soil, all fertilizers reduced stigma yield of first-year crop by 14-60 % (P < 0.05). No differences between treatments for the stigma yield of second year crop in non-saline and of first year crop in saline soil were observed. In saline soil, FYM and PM fertilizers increased stigma yield of second year crop by 44 % and 41 %, respectively (P < 0.05). The two-year cumulative agronomic efficiencies for nitrogen and phosphorus and the nitrogen use efficiency for leaf biomass were lower under fertilizer treatments than control in non-saline and saline soil. In non-saline soil the PM-B; whereas, in saline soil all fertilizers (except SG) increased the phosphorus use efficiency of leaves (P < 0.05). The two-year amendment of composted manures and FYM-B in non-saline soil resulted in high uptake of sodium in leaves (P < 0.05); whereas, such effect was not observed for saline soil. Almost all fertilizers increased similar to 2-5 fold the concentration of bioavailable phosphorus and similar to 2-3 fold the concentration of potassium in non-saline and saline soil (P < 0.05). The positive influence of fertilizers on stigma yield and PUE of leaves of second year crop was observed only for saline soil. Furthermore, contrary to the results for non-saline soil, these fertilizers did not cause an increased uptake of Na in leaves in saline soil. We attribute this effect to the high concentration of SOM and gradual decline in EC (0.94-1.71 dS m(-1)) over time in saline soil. The gradual improvement in yield (from negative to neutral in non-saline and from neutral to positive in saline soil) was observed over time. Amendment of fertilizers and sowing of corms at same time may be the reason for their negative influence on stigma yield in low SOM-containing non-saline soil.

AB  - Light is one of the most important environmental factors that stimulates plant metabolism. Zhong Ming 6 (ZM6) is a green tea (Camellia sinensis) cultivar that highly accumulates TGGP (1,2,6-tri-O-galloyl-beta-D-glucopyranose). Here, three kinds of supplemental light wavelengths, including blue light (BL, 200 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)), red light (RL, 200 mu mol m(-2) S-1), and white light (WL/CK, 200 mu mol m(-2) S-1), were applied to explore their effects on the transcriptomes and metabolomes of young shoots (one bud and two leaves) in tea plants. Interestingly, artificial BL and RL significantly affected the secondary metabolites and transcriptome factors of tea plants. Here, BL had strong effects on multiple physiological actions related to secondary metabolism. In addition, RL could induce plant growth, development, and photosynthesis. Eight structural genes and 34 transcription factors (TFs) that were significantly correlated with total catechin (TC) and anthocyanin contents were identified. Due to the upregulation of the CsGSTF12 gene in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway, anthocyanin production under BL was much higher than those under RL and WL. However, CsMYB75, Cs3GGT, bHLH-MYC, and other R2R3-MYBs were also highly upregulated under BL, which increased the accumulation of TC and anthocyanins in tea plants. The CsMYB4 gene was highly significant and positively correlated with TC and anthocyanin accumulation under RL. We showed that BL is less conducive to plant growth due to the number of functional metabolites (gallic acid, caffeine, TC, TGGP, and anthocyanin) that were increased. RL can also be used to increase the chlorophyll content and tea yield, as well as for improving taste, quality, and metabolic mechanisms of the tea plant.

AB  - Extensive literature has reported a link between stress and tumor progression, and between both of these factors and mental health. Despite the higher incidence of affective disorders in females and the neurochemical dif-ferences according to sex, female populations have been understudied. The aim of this study was therefore to analyze the effect of stress on tumor development in female OF1 mice. For this purpose, subjects were inoculated with B16F10 melanoma cells and exposed to the Chronic Social Instability Stress (CSIS) model. Behavioral, neurochemical and neuroendocrine parameters were analyzed. Female mice exposed to CSIS exhibited reduced body weight and increased arousal, but there was no evidence of depressive behavior or anxiety. Exposure to CSIS did not affect either corticosterone levels or tumor development, although it did provoke an imbalance in cerebral inflammatory cytokines, decreasing IL-10 expression (IL-6/IL-10 and TNF-alpha/IL-10); chemokines, increasing CX3CR1 expression (CX3CL1/CX3CR1); and glucocorticoid receptors, decreasing GR expression (MR/ GR). In contrast, tumor development did not alter body weight and, although it did alter behavior, it did so to a much lesser extent. Tumor inoculation did not affect corticosterone levels, but increased the MR/GR ratio in the hippocampus and provoked an imbalance in cerebral inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, although differently from stress. These results underscore the need for experimental approaches that allow us to take sex differences into account when exploring this issue, since these results appear to indicate that the female response to stress is mediated by mechanisms different from those often proposed in relation to male mice.

   Quantifying mineral block supplement intake by individual beef cattle is a challenging task but may enable improved efficiency of supplement use particularly in a grazed system. Estimating time spent licking when cattle access the mineral block supplement can be useful for predicting intake on an individual basis. The advancement of sensor technology has facilitated collection of individual data associated with ingestive behaviours such as feeding and licking duration. This experiment was intended to investigate the effectiveness of wearable tri-axial accelerometers fitted on both neck-collar and ear-tag to identify the licking behaviour of beef cattle by distinguishing it from eating, standing and lying behaviours. The capability of tri-axial accelerometers to classify licking behaviour in beef cattle revealed in this study would offer the possibility of measuring time spent licking and further developing a practical method of estimating mineral block supplement intake by individual grazing cattle.
   Identifying the licking behaviour in beef cattle may provide a means to measure time spent licking for estimating individual block supplement intake. This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of tri-axial accelerometers deployed in a neck-collar and an ear-tag, to characterise the licking behaviour of beef cattle in individual pens. Four, 2-year-old Angus steers weighing 368 +/- 9.3 kg (mean +/- SD) were used in a 14-day study. Four machine learning (ML) algorithms (decision trees [DT], random forest [RF], support vector machine [SVM] and k-nearest neighbour [kNN]) were employed to develop behaviour classification models using three different ethograms: (1) licking vs. eating vs. standing vs. lying; (2) licking vs. eating vs. inactive; and (3) licking vs. non-licking. Activities were video-recorded from 1000 to 1600 h daily when access to supplement was provided. The RF algorithm exhibited a superior performance in all ethograms across the two deployment modes with an overall accuracy ranging from 88% to 98%. The neck-collar accelerometers had a better performance than the ear-tag accelerometers across all ethograms with sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) ranging from 95% to 99% and 91% to 96%, respectively. Overall, the tri-axial accelerometer was capable of identifying licking behaviour of beef cattle in a controlled environment. Further research is required to test the model under actual grazing conditions.

AB  - This paper presents the scientific problem of the biological corrosion of Portland cements and its effects on the phase composition of cement pastes after the corrosion process in the environment of reactive media from the agricultural industry. Seven Portland cements produced from different cement plants exposed to pig slurry and water as a reference medium for a period of six weeks were tested. After the exposure process in both of the above-mentioned reaction environments, the hydrating cement pastes were characterized in terms of their phase composition using the XRD method and were also subjected to morphological observations and a chemical composition analysis with the application of SEM and EDS methods. The results of these studies indicate the presence of a biological corrosion product in the form of taumasite [C3S center dot CO2 center dot SO3 center dot 15H(2)O], which is a phase formed as a result of the reaction of dead matter (cement paste) with living matter, caused by the presence of bacteria in pig slurry. In addition to taumasite, the tested samples also showed the presence of the hydration product of Portland cements named portlandite (Ca(OH)(2)). Moreover, unreacted phases of cement clinker, i.e., dicalcium silicate (C2S) and tricalcium aluminate (C(3)A), were detected. Based on microscopic observations and analyses of the chemical composition of selected areas of the samples, the presence of the taumasite phase and compact areas of pseudo-crystalline C-S-H phases with different morphological structures, derived from the hydration products of cements doped with ions originating from the corrosive environment, were confirmed.

AB  - Storage mites are serious pests of stored animal feeds and animals that consume mite-infested feed could reduce feed intake and eventually cause weight loss. To understand the mite species and infestation rates of them in animal feeds, we conducted a survey of mite infestations in samples of animal feeds from animal feed shops, feed mills, or chicken farms in eight provinces in northern Thailand. High mite infestation rates were observed in chicken feed (42.9%), followed by pig feed (26.7%). No mites were observed in fish and frog feeds. Mites were common in pelleted feeds (n = 96) or raw materials (n = 3), but was never observed in extruded feeds (n = 33). The mite species identified include three storage mites: Suidasia pontifica, Dermatophagoides farinae, and Aleuroglyphus chinensis, as well as the predatory mites Cheyletus malaccensis, Blattisocius keegani, and B. everti. Among them, A. chinensis and B. everti, are newly recorded in Thailand. Suidasia pontifica was dominant in chicken and pig feeds, and could be the major storage mite pest in northern Thailand. Figures and identification keys are provided.

AB  - In long-term spaceflight, astronauts will face unique cognitive loads and social challenges which will be complicated by communication delays with Earth. It is important to understand the central nervous system (CNS) effects of deep spaceflight and the associated unavoidable exposure to galactic cosmic radiation (GCR). Rodent studies show single- or simple-particle combination exposure alters CNS endpoints, including hippocampaldependent behavior. An even better Earth-based simulation of GCR is now available, consisting of a 33-beam (33-GCR) exposure. However, the effect of whole-body 33-GCR exposure on rodent behavior is unknown, and no 33-GCR CNS countermeasures have been tested. Here astronaut-age-equivalent (6mo-old) C57BL/6J male mice were exposed to 33-GCR (75cGy, a Mars mission dose). Pre-/during/post-Sham or 33-GCR exposure, mice received a diet containing a 'vehicle' formulation alone or with the antioxidant/anti-inflammatory compound CDDO-EA as a potential countermeasure. Behavioral testing beginning 4mo post-irradiation suggested radiation and diet did not affect measures of exploration/anxiety-like behaviors (open field, elevated plus maze) or recognition of a novel object. However, in 3-Chamber Social Interaction (3-CSI), CDDO-EA/33-GCR mice failed to spend more time exploring a holder containing a novel mouse vs. a novel object (empty holder), suggesting sociability deficits. Also, Vehicle/33-GCR and CDDO-EA/Sham mice failed to discriminate between a novel stranger vs. familiarized stranger mouse, suggesting blunted preference for social novelty. CDDO-EA given pre-/ during/post-irradiation did not attenuate the 33-GCR-induced blunting of preference for social novelty. Future elucidation of the mechanisms underlying 33-GCR-induced blunting of preference for social novelty will improve risk analysis for astronauts which may in-turn improve countermeasures.

AB  - Camellia oleifera is an important economic plant widely grown in South China. The oil extracted from C. oleifera seeds is edible containing high-quality unsaturated fatty acids. Calonectria species are well-known fungal plant pathogens. In this study, 30 soil samples were collected from five C. oleifera plantations in Dajian Mountain, Zhejiang Province, China, and a total of 21 isolates of Calonectria species were obtained. Based on the morphological characterizations and phylogenetic analysis using combined sequence data of four genes including cmdA, his3, tef1 and tub2, these Calonectria species were identified as Calonectria pacifica and Ca. kyotensis. Pathogenicity tests using inoculation of wounded leaves proved that the two obtained Calonectria species were pathogenic to C. oleifera. To our knowledge, this represents the first report of Calonectria species from the soils in C. oleifera plantations and their potential threat as pathogens of the plant should be monitored.

AB  - Mongolian sheep are a breed of sheep in China known for their excellent cold and drought resistance. Sperm from Mongolian sheep are often cryopreserved to improve breeding outcomes. However, cryopreservation of sperm often results in issues such as reduced vitality and altered morphology. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the impact of the cryoprotectant resveratrol on frozen sperm from Mongolian sheep, specifically examining its effects on key proteins during cryopreservation. In this study, sperm samples were obtained from three adult Mongolian rams and processed through semen centrifugation. The sperm motility parameters of Fresh Sperm Group (FR), Resveratrol added before freezing group (FF-Res), Resveratrol-free frozen sperm group (FT), and Resveratrol added after freeze-thawing group (FA-Res) were determined. The tandem mass tags (TMT) peptide labeling combined with LC-MS/MS was used for proteomic analysis of the total proteins in FR and FT groups. A total of 2651 proteins were identified, among which 41 proteins were upregulated and 48 proteins were downregulated after freezing. In-depth bioinformatics analysis of differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) revealed their close association with the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) and oxidative phosphorylation pathway. The energy-related protein dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLD) and the reactive oxygen species (ROS)related protein NADH dehydrogenase 1 beta subcomplex subunit 9 (NDUFB9) exhibited significant decreases, indicating their potential role as key proteins contributing to reduced sperm vitality. The study demonstrated that the addition of resveratrol (RES) to semen could elevate the expression levels of DLD and NDUFB9 proteins. This study represents the pioneering proteomic analysis of Mongolian ram sperm before and after cryopreservation, establishing the significance of DLD and NDUFB9 as key proteins influencing the decline in vitality following cryopreservation of Mongolian ram sperm. These findings clarify that resveratrol can enhance the levels of DLD and NDUFB9 proteins in cryopreserved Mongolian ram sperm, consequently enhancing their vitality.

AB  - Phosphor-in-glass film (PiG-film) displays great potential for high performance laser-driven white lighting, benefiting from its facile fabrication and high efficiency. However, the low thermal conductivity of the glass matrix may lead to thermal quenching of phosphors and limit the maximum luminous flux of the light source. Here, boron nitride (BN) with high thermal conductivity and low absorption coefficient was embedded into Y3Al5O12:Ce PiG-film to facilitate the heat-transfer process, and to regulate the propagation of both laser and fluorescence. The influences of BN particle size and doping concentration on surface morphology (pore formation), luminescence saturation threshold (LST), luminous flux, and the spatial distribution of correlated color temperature (CCT) were investigated and correlated. Moreover, the luminescence spot confinement was analyzed and luminous exitance was obtained. Benefiting from the formation of effective BN heat-transfer network, the luminous efficacy of both YAG-45-2 % and YAG-45-1 % films surpass the non-doped one as laser power density >19.00 W/mm2. A LST higher than 27.04 W/mm2 was observed in YAG-45-2 % film, more than 42 % higher than the non-doped one. Though the extra reflection of blue laser by BN particles downgrades the CCT spatial distribution uniformity, the particles strongly scatter the fluorescence and restrict the fluorescence-emitting spot (diameter) expansion from 307 to 174 mu m, and a high luminous exitance of 1614 lm/mm(2) was achieved in YAG-45-2 % film. These results firmly demonstrate that incorporation of particles with high thermal conductivity and low absorption coefficient in PiG-film is a feasible strategy for achieving high-brightness laser lighting.

AB  - In this study, based on the assessment of soil heavy metals (HMs) pollution using relevant indices, a compre-hensive approach combined network environ analysis (NEA), human health risk assessment (HHRA) method and positive definite matrix factor (PMF) model to quantify the risks among ecological communities in a special environment around mining area in northwest Yunnan, calculated the risk to human health caused by HMs in soil, and analyzed the pollution sources of HMs. The integrated risks for soil microorganisms, vegetations, herbivores, and carnivores were 2.336, 0.876, 0.114, and 0.082, respectively, indicating that soil microorgan-isms were the largest risk receptors. The total hazard indexes (HIT) for males, females, and children were 0.542, 0.591, and 1.970, respectively, revealing a relatively high and non-negligible non-carcinogenic risks (NCR) for children. The total cancer risks (TCR) for both females and children exceeded 1.00E-04, indicating that soil HMs posed carcinogenic risks (CR) to them. Comparatively, Pb was the high-risk metal, accounting for 53.76%, 57.90%, and 68.09% of HIT in males, females, and children, respectively. PMF analysis yielded five sources of pollution, F1 (industry), F2 (agriculture), F3 (domesticity), F4 (nature), and F5 (traffic).

AB  - Populations of Eruca sativa (Brassicaceae) derived from arid and Mediterranean habitats exhibit ecotypic differentiation. Here, pooled DNA sequencing was used to assess adaptive genome differentiation in the two ecotypes. Differentiated SNP loci were scanned with the empirical F-ST outlier method and by correlating allele frequencies with environmental parameters. Genetic diversity values were relatively higher in the pooled arid genome, whereas the pooled Mediterranean genome exhibited stronger directional selection, indicating the impact of climatic conditions on genetic diversity. GO enrichment analysis categorized the annotated differentiated loci according to biological processes, revealing a large set of candidate genes related to abiotic and biotic stress responses. Allelic variation was detected in regulatory elements and coding regions (synonymous and non-synonymous mutations) of genes belonging to different transcription factors and phytohormone signaling, suggesting adaptation to both abiotic and biotic conditions. Furthermore, SNP mutations were also found in genic regions belonging to the synthesis of secondary metabolites, including aliphatic glucosinolates and their hydrolyzed bioactive compounds, among others. The results of this eco-genomic study demonstrate the role of divergent abiotic and biotic selection factors in evolutionary processes leading to adaptive ecotypic differentiation.

AB  - Faecal samples are an important source of genetic information for studies of wild animals. The quality and quantity of faecal DNA can, however, be affected by different factors. Our goal was to compare different dung sample storage and DNA extraction methods to optimise the quality and quantity of DNA extracted from forest elephant dung samples. Dung samples (n = 132) of forest elephants were collected in a forest area in Cote d'Ivoire. Each faecal sample was preserved in 50 mL cryotubes using five different methods: Ethanol 70%, formalin 10%, Sodium acetate, acetic acid, and formalin (SAF), dimethyl sulfoxide, and Sodium chloride (20% DMSO), and silica gel. We used the Cetyl Trimethyl Ammonium Bromide (CTAB) cationic detergent and the phenol chloroform DNA extraction procedures for comparison. DNA was successfully obtained from all 132 faecal samples using both DNA extraction methods. Regarding the total DNA extracted independently from the storage buffers, the phenol chloroform method yields a mean DNA concentration (2163.93 +/- 918.62 ng/mu L) sevenfold higher than that obtained with the optimised CTAB method (338.15 +/- 528.54 ng/mu L). Our study indicates optimised faecal sample storage and DNA extraction procedures that can help implement conservation strategies for forest elephants.

AB  - Livestock farms in China are equipped with supporting land, which is a key factor in promoting the optimal combination of crop and livestock systems to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from agricultural production. However, there is still a research gap on the process of carbon flow at the farm scale in China and the mechanisms by which supporting land affects GHG emissions. In this study, we used an agri-environmental impact assessment framework created through an extensive farm survey based on a localized database. GHG emissions from livestock production were accounted for on a farm-by-farm basis. The impact pathways of GHGs were also analyzed using structural equation modeling. The results showed that the completed coupling farms (consuming agricultural waste and supplying fodder) were 2840 kg CO(2)e/$1000 USD, which was approximately 13.1% lower than those from incomplete coupling farms (consuming agricultural waste or supplying fodder) and 20.2% lower than those from non-coupling farms. GHG emissions are positively correlated with the pig-land ratio (R-2 = 0.62, p < 0.001). Assuming that China's farms could be fully integrated by 2030, it could reduce GHG emissions by 12-22% of current levels, or about 45.5-84.5 million tons CO(2)e. Our findings provide new insights about expanding land to improve manure and feed management, which can help stakeholders develop strategies to reduce GHG emissions from livestock production, contributing to the achievement of sustainable agricultural development across China and globally.

AB  - Simple Summary African swine fever is an acute pig disease caused by a highly contagious virus, and so far no cure has been found. Killing live pigs in affected areas is still the most effective way to prevent the spread of the disease. However, this approach can have a devastating impact on a country's pig industry. Thus, it is necessary to implement strict biosafety prevention and control before the disease begins to spread. In order to further understand the transmission characteristics of the disease and develop effective prevention and control measures, a fractional-order African Swine Fever model with saturation incidence is constructed in this paper. This model, as an effective method to describe the laws of the objective world, is suitable for analyzing the problem of the continued spread or regression of diseases in areas where there are African Swine Fever outbreaks in the real world. Both theoretical analysis and numerical simulations show that timely and effective disinfection measures on pig farms are important to prevent the spread of the disease.Abstract This article proposes and analyzes a fractional-order African Swine Fever model with saturation incidence. Firstly, the existence and uniqueness of a positive solution is proven. Secondly, the basic reproduction number and the sufficient conditions for the existence of two equilibriums are obtained. Thirdly, the local and global stability of disease-free equilibrium is studied using the LaSalle invariance principle. Next, some numerical simulations are conducted based on the Adams-type predictor-corrector method to verify the theoretical results, and sensitivity analysis is performed on some parameters. Finally, discussions and conclusions are presented. The theoretical results show that the value of the fractional derivative alpha will affect both the coordinates of the equilibriums and the speed at which the equilibriums move towards stabilization. When the value of alpha becomes larger or smaller, the stability of the equilibriums will be changed, which shows the difference between the fractional-order systems and the classical integer-order system.

AB  - During operation in a nuclear reactor, Zr-based nuclear fuel cladding is subject to waterside corrosion which can lead to hydrogen ingress. The hydrogen that enters the material will migrate to colder spots and precipitate as zirconium hydrides if the hydrogen content exceeds the hydrogen terminal solid solu-bility in the material. Since a temperature gradient is established in the radial direction of the cladding during operation, the hydrides can preferentially precipitate at the colder outer surface of the cladding. Other gradients can also occur in the longitudinal and azimuthal directions of the cladding tube. As a consequence, hydrogen redistributes itself in response to the concentration and temperature gradients present in the sample. The response of the hydrogen in solid solution to temperature gradients is governed by the heat of transport Q * as a function of temperature, so it can be used in the BISON code. A set of experiments was set up to determine the heat of transport ( Q *), in which a uniformly hydrided Zircaloy-4 sample is annealed under a fixed temperature gradient at a range of temperatures, and the resulting hydrogen distribution is analyzed to determine Q *. The results are discussed in terms of existing literature. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Deoxynivalenol (DON), one of the most common mycotoxins, is frequently found in foods. This study investigated the effects of orally administered DON on the blood biochemical parameters, growth performance, histology, microbial composition, and metabolism of rats. After a 1-week adaptation period, 4-week-old rats were administered 0.9% saline (control), 1 mg/L DON (T1), 10 mg/L DON (T2), or 50 mg/L DON (T3) by gavage for 49 days. The DON-treated groups had significantly lower body weights than the control group (p < 0.05). Blood alkaline phosphatase, phosphate, cholesterol, amylase, and creatinine levels differed significantly between the DON-treated and control groups (p < 0.05). With increasing DON doses, fibrosis and apoptosis were observed in several tissues. In terms of metabolites, the bile acid biosynthesis pathway emerged as a potential biomarker, while the tryptophan metabolism pathway was found to be the most affected. The fecal microbiota showed significant differences in both alpha and beta diversity between the DON-treated and control groups (p < 0.05). In the cecal and fecal microbiota, the relative abundance of Firmicutes increased in the control and T1 groups, whereas Bacteroidota and Campylobacterota were more abundant in the T2 and T3 groups. In conclusion, our results showed that high DON exposure induces several dose-dependent adverse effects on rats.

AB  - Simple Summary: Fermented feed as an alternative to antibiotics in livestock is gaining interest. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the effects of the addition of three fermented feeds to the basal diet of Bamei piglets from the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. The results suggest that fermented feed has the function of improving the growth condition, immunity and intestinal flora structure of Bamei piglets. This study provides a new approach for using fermented feed as an in-feed antibiotic substitute in the raising of Bamei piglets in high-altitude environments. Purebred Bamei piglets present problems, including slow growth, respiratory disease, and post-weaning stress. This study investigated the effects of Lactobacillus plantarum QP28-1- and Bacillus subtilis QB8-fermented feed supplementation on the growth performance, immunity, and intestinal microflora of Bamei piglets from Qinghai, China. A total of 48 purebred Bamei piglets (25 days; 6.8 +/- 0.97 kg) were divided into the following four groups for a 28-day diet experiment: basal feed (CK); diet containing 10% Lactobacillus plantarum-fermented feed (L); diet containing 10% Bacillus subtilis-fermented feed (B); and diet containing a mixture of 5% Lactobacillus plantarum + 5% Bacillus subtilis-fermented feed (H). The daily weight gain and daily food intake of group H increased (p < 0.05), and the feed/weight gain ratios of the groups fed with fermented feed decreased more than that of the CK group. The levels of three immune factors, namely immunoglobulin (Ig)M, IgG, and interferon-gamma, were higher (p < 0.05), whereas those of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1 beta, and IL-6 were lower (p < 0.05) in the fermented feed groups than in the CK group. Total protein was higher (p < 0.05), while urea nitrogen, total cholesterol and triglycerides were lower (p < 0.05) in the mixed-fermented feed group than in the CK group. Analysis of the gut microbiota showed that the addition of fermented feed increased the alpha-diversity of the gut microbiota, increasing the abundances of probiotics including Lactobacillus, Muribaculaceae, Ruminococcaceae, Prevotellaceae, and Rikenellaceae. Additionally, correlation analysis demonstrated that several of these probiotic bacteria were closely related to serum immunity. In conclusion, fermented feed supplementation rebuilt the intestinal microbiota of Bamei piglets, thereby reducing the feed/weight ratio, improving feed intake, and enhancing immunity.

AB  - Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a lethal X-linked recessive disorder caused by mutations in the DMD gene and the subsequent lack of dystrophin protein. Recently, phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PMO)-antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) targeting exon 51 or 53 to reestablish the DMD reading frame have received regulatory approval as commercially available drugs. However, their applicability and efficacy remain limited to particular patients. Large animal models and exon skipping evaluation are essential to facilitate ASO development together with a deeper understanding of dystrophinopathies. Using recombinant adeno-associated virus-mediated gene targeting and somatic cell nuclear transfer, we generated a Yucatan miniature pig model of DMD with an exon 52 deletion mutation equivalent to one of the most common mutations seen in patients. Exon 52-deleted mRNA expression and dystrophin deficiency were confirmed in the skeletal and cardiac muscles of DMD pigs. Accordingly, dystrophin-associated proteins failed to be recruited to the sarcolemma. The DMD pigs manifested early disease onset with severe bodywide skeletal muscle degeneration and with poor growth accompanied by a physical abnormality, but with no obvious cardiac phenotype. We also demonstrated that in primary DMD pig skeletal muscle cells, the genetically engineered exon-52 deleted pig DMD gene enables the evaluation of exon 51 or 53 skipping with PMO and its advanced technology, peptide-conjugated PMO. The results show that the DMD pigs developed here can be an appropriate large animal model for evaluating in vivo exon skipping efficacy.

AB  - The most daunting issue of global climate change is the deleterious impact of extreme temperatures on tea productivity and quality, which has resulted in a quest among researchers and growers. The current study aims to unravel molecular programming underpinning thermotolerance by characterizing heat tolerance and sensitivity response in 20 tea cultivars. The significantly higher negative influence of heat stress was recorded in a sensitive cultivar with reduced water retention (47%), chlorophyll content (33.79%), oxidation potential (32.48%), and increase in membrane damage (76.4%). Transcriptional profiling of most tolerant and sensitive cultivars identified 78 differentially expressed unigenes with chaperon domains, including low and high molecular weight heat shock protein (HSP) and heat shock transcription factors (HSFs) involved in heat shock response (HSR). Further, predicted transcriptional interactome network revealed their key role in thermotolerance via well-co-ordinated transcriptional regulation of aquaporins, starch metabolism, chlorophyll biosynthesis, calcium, and ethylene mediated plant signaling system. The study identified the key role of HSPs (CsHSP90) in regulating HSR in tea, wherein, structure-based molecular docking revealed the inhibitory role of geldanamycin (GDA) on CsHSP90 by blocking ATP binding site at N-terminal domain of predicted structure. Subsequently, GDA mediated leaf disc inhibitor assay further affirmed enhanced HSR with higher expression of CsHSP17.6, CsHSP70, HSP101, and CsHSFA2 genes in tea. Through the current study, efforts were made to extrapolate a deeper understanding of chaperons mediated regulation of HSR attributing thermotolerance in tea.

AB  - Simple Summary Intestinal health directly influences the profitability of animal production, and so growth-promoting antibiotics have been used in the feed or drinking water to reduce the impact of enteric diseases and improve production parameters. However, these have generated long-term bacterial resistance. In the search for natural alternatives to antibiotics, various probiotic strains have been developed to improve intestinal health and biological indicators in farm animals, which is important to provide the consumer with safe food. This review describes the main probiotic bacteria and yeasts, their in vitro properties and their impact on the antioxidant capacity and intestinal environment of animals. Furthermore, this review outlines the role of probiotics in apparently healthy ruminants, pigs and poultry, including animals with digestive diseases.
   Antibiotic growth-promoters in animal feeding are known to generate bacterial resistance on commercial farms and have proven deleterious effects on human health. This review addresses the effects of probiotics and their symbiotic relationship with the animal host as a viable alternative for producing healthy meat, eggs, and milk at present and in the future. Probiotics can tolerate the conditions of the gastrointestinal tract, such as the gastric acid, pH and bile salts, to exert beneficial effects on the host. They (probiotics) may also have a beneficial effect on productivity, health and wellbeing in different parameters of animal performance. Probiotics stimulate the native microbiota (microbes that are present in their place of origin) and production of short-chain fatty acids, with proven effects such as antimicrobial, hypocholesterolemic and immunomodulatory effects, resulting in better intestinal health, nutrient absorption capacity and productive responses in ruminant and non-ruminant animals. These beneficial effects of probiotics are specific to each microbial strain; therefore, the isolation and identification of beneficial microorganisms, as well as in vitro and in vivo testing in different categories of farm animals, will guarantee their efficacy, replicability and sustainability in the current production systems.

AB  - In the present study, a Novel Object test (NOT), designed for turkeys in small groups, was implemented on commercial farms (groups of ~ 5000 animals). The aim of the study was to investigate the reaction of turkeys to novelty in an on-farm setting, which is an approach to assess anxiety-like behaviour and hence might be an appropriate welfare indicator in farm animals. In a pilot study, repeatability of the test design was tested by presenting four different objects simultaneously at different age levels in poultry production. The main study tested the NOT repeatedly on one farm, fattening both female and male birds, with the aim to evaluate sex and age effects in commercial conditions. Data was recorded on three farms, keeping conventionally fattening turkeys (male and female birds), including two fattening periods for pilot studies and four fattening periods for the main study. Novel Object tests were conducted on flock level, using four different novel objects (a bucket, a ball string, a plastic rod and a beach ball). Data were collected by direct observation. The latency up to the first approach, latency up to the first peck, pecking frequency, and the number of animals approaching the object were recorded. Generalised linear mixed models were calculated. Results of the main study found a tendency for the object type to affect the latency to approach the object (F3201 = 2.5; p = 0.06), for all other parameters a significant effect was detected (all F 0.05). Also, sex effects were found to be significant for all parameters measured (all F 107.2; all p < 0.001), with females showing shorter latency times until the first peck and the first approach, a higher pecking frequency, and more animals approaching the object. The interaction between age and sex was found to be significant for the latency to approach (F6213 = 2.3; p < 0.05). Males showed longer latencies to approach the object in week 5 as compared to all other time points. No differences between time points were found in females. In summary, the results highlight important issues in turkeys' reaction to novelty, which might be of interest in animal husbandry. Furthermore, results indicate, that further studies are required to validate this behavioural test regarding the interpretation of underlying motivations.

AB  - Due to climatic changes and global warming, heat stress has become a worldwide problem, especially in tropical and subtropical countries. Therefore, research studies that aim to alleviate heat stress conditions in males are valuable due to the high sensitivity of the testis to increased temperature. This study investigated whether an exogenous intravenous injection of melatonin could influence the testicular artery blood flow (TBF) and peripheral reproductive hormones and metabolomes in heat-stressed goats or not. Melatonin administration enhanced TBF, as measured by color Doppler ultrasonography, and induced significant changes in most studied hormones. Such data are valuable in the field of improving animal productivity under heat-stress environments because there were close correlations between TBF and potential animal fertility. In addition, peripheral metabolomic analysis was characterized and differentiated among the studied groups denoting several significant up and down metabolites that could be used in further research to investigate the underlying mechanisms.
   The beneficial effects of melatonin were investigated to mitigate various detrimental effects and toxicity on reproductive performance. The present study aimed, for the first time, to explore the effect of intravenous melatonin injection on testicular artery hemodynamics (TH) and metabolomic changes, reproductive hormones in heat-stressed bucks. Ten bucks were randomly split into two groups (five each): (1) the melatonin group, treated with a single intravenous dose of melatonin solution containing 10 mg melatonin each, and (2) the control group, which was treated with 10 mL of the vehicle without melatonin. Changes in the TH at the level of the supra testicular artery (STA) were assessed by triplex ultrasonography just before (0 h) and at 0.5, 2, 7, 24, and 168 h after melatonin or vehicle administration. Doppler velocity parameters of peak systolic velocity (PSV; cm/s), end-diastolic velocity (EDV; cm/s), and time average maximum velocity (TAMAX; cm/s) were measured. Doppler indices (resistive index; RI and pulsatility index; PI), systole/diastole (S/D) ratio and total arterial blood flow volume (TABFV; ml/minute) were measured. Peripheral concentrations of FSH, LH, inhibin, melatonin, testosterone (T), estradiol (E2), and cortisol were measured just before injection (0 h) and at 0.5, 2, 7, and 24 h and daily up to day 7 post administration in both groups. Results revealed reductions in the RI values and increases in the TABFV in the melatonin group compared to the control one, especially 2 h after administration. Significant increases in concentrations of FSH, T, E2, and melatonin and decreases in cortisol and inhibin in the melatonin group compared to the control one. Plasma metabolomic analysis at 2 h indicated the up-regulation of L-glutamine, L-arginine, sorbitol, D-glucose, ascorbic acid, and ornithine and the down-regulation of D-xylose, D-arabitol, ribitol, and oleic acid in the melatonin versus the control group. In conclusion, acute administration of melatonin (10 mg IV) enhanced testicular artery blood flow and plasma reproductive hormones in the Shiba goat under heat-stress circumstances.

AB  - The aim of this study was to compare the sensitization of alpha(S1)-CN in cow and goat's milk in a mouse model. Fifty mice were divided into control group, adjuvant control group, cow's milk alpha(S1)-CN sensitized group, goat's milk alpha(S1)-CN sensitized group and cross sensitized group. Cow's and goat's milk alpha(S1)-CN were used to establish a mouse sensitization model. The results showed that cow's milk alpha(S1)-CN had higher allergenicity than goat's milk alpha(S1)-CN, as can be seen in significantly increased s-IgE and Th2 cell-related inflammatory factors, the proportion of Th2, and the expression of Th2 cell-related transcription factors. Furthermore, the sensitization of cow's milk alpha(S1)-CN damaged the intestinal barrier of mice, caused the leakage of LPS, activated the TLR4-NF kappa B pathway, and thus resulted in the increase of IFN-gamma. In addition, mice allergic to cow's milk alpha(S1)-CN were less sensitized to goat's milk alpha(S1)-CN.

AB  - Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) causes the most clinically severe neuroinvasive arboviral disease in the United States. The virus is endemic in eastern and Gulf Coast states and the Great Lakes region, causing cases annually. To detect EEEV circulation in its enzootic cycle before the virus infects humans and other mammals, mosquito control agencies in New Jersey have conducted mosquito surveillance using a series of permanent wooden resting box sites since 1975. We conducted 2 field studies, 1 evaluating resting traps and 1 evaluating efficacy of CO 2 lures, to optimize collection of Culiseta melanura , the primary enzootic vector of EEEV. Resulting mosquito samples were subjected to molecular analysis to determine EEEV infection rates. Corrugated plastic boxes trapped more bloodfed Cs. melanura than other resting trap types (resting boxes, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] resting traps, or fiber pots) and were similar to resting boxes in total number of female Cs. melanura caught. Further, non -baited CDC light traps were more successful in trapping host -seeking Cs. melanura than those baited with dry ice, a CO 2 lure. The EEEV RNA was identified in Cs. melanura , Aedes vexans , Anopheles quadrimaculatus , and Uranotaenia sapphirina .

AB  - Cognitive function is crucial for astronauts to successfully complete space missions. Therefore, investigating the mechanisms by which one of the primary stressors in the space environment-microgravity-affects cognitive function is of great significance. Although synaptic plasticity is recognized as being highly associated with cognitive function, the mechanisms underlying its changes under microgravity remain unclear. Here, using a hindlimb unloading (HU) model in mice, we investigated the effects of short-term (7 days) and long-term (28 days) HU on cognitive function. We found that long-term HU significantly affected cognitive performance, as evidenced by impaired spatial learning and memory, reduced long-term potentiation (LTP), and decreased dendritic spine density in the 28-day HU group, while no such changes were observed in the 7-day HU group. Proteomic analysis focusing on synaptic subregions revealed that metabolic and oxidative phosphorylation signal pathways were significantly upregulated, whereas signal pathways related to synaptic organization and cation transport were markedly downregulated. Notably, we identified increased phosphorylation of the calcium-regulating protein RyR2 (ryanodine receptor 2) as a key alteration. Furthermore, continuous treatment with the RyR2 stabilizer S107 from days 7 to 28 during HU effectively prevented HU-induced cognitive decline in mice. In summary, our study provides the first evidence that microgravity-induced cognitive impairment is mediated by excessive phosphorylation of RyR2.

AB  - Patterns of trait expression within some plant species have recently been shown to align with the leaf economics spectrum paradigm. Resistance to herbivores is also expected to covary with leaf economics traits. We selected 36 mature Populus tremuloides genotypes in a common garden to assess whether aspen leaf economics patterns follow those observed among species globally. We also evaluated leaf economics strategies in the context of insect resistance by conducting bioassays to determine the effects of plant traits on preference and performance of Lymantria dispar. We found that: (1) intraspecific trait patterns of P. tremuloides parallel those exhibited by the interspecific leaf economics spectrum, (2) herbivores preferred leaves from genotypes with resource-acquisitive strategies, and (3) herbivores also performed best on genotypes with resource-acquisitive strategies. We conclude that a leaf economics spectrum that incorporates defense traits is a useful tool for explaining intraspecific patterns of variation in plant strategies, including resistance to herbivores.

AB  - It is well known that plant elicitors can induce plant defense against pests. The herbivore-induced plant volatile (HIPV) methyl salicylate (MeSA), as a signaling hormone involved in plant pathogen defense, is used to recruit natural enemies to protect wheat and other crops. However, the defense mechanism remains largely unknown. Here, the headspace volatiles of wheat plants were collected and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), gas chromatography with electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD) and principal component analysis (PCA). The results showed that exogenous application of MeSA induced qualitative and quantitative changes in the volatiles emitted from wheat plants, and these changes were mainly related to Carveol, Linalool, m-Diethyl-benzene, p-Cymene, Nonanal, D-limonene and 6-methyl-5-Hepten-2-one. Then, the electroantennogram (EAG) and Y-tube bioassay were performed to test the physiological and behavioral responses of Aphidius gifuensis Ashmesd to the active volatile compounds (p-Cymene, m-Diethyl-benzene, Carveol) that identified by using GC-EAD. The female A. gifuensis showed strong physiological responses to 1 mu g/mu L p-Cymene and 1 mu g/mu L m-Diethyl-benzene. Moreover, a mixture blend was more attractive to female A. gifuensis than a single compound. These findings suggested that MeSA could induce wheat plant indirect defense against wheat aphids through attracting parasitoid in the wheat agro-ecosystem.

AB  - Plants have several means of coping with biotic stress, which involves physiological, cellular and molecular mechanisms. The interplay of two principal phytohormonal pathways, Jasmonic acid (JA) and Salicylic acid (SA) play a crucial role in transmitting stress-induced signals throughout the plant. However, the interplay of these hormonal pathways is not clear when plants encounter biotic agents that trigger antagonistic hormonal signals. To address this, we conducted biochemical and gene expression studies on tomato, Solanum lycopersicum plants, exposed to insect alone (IA), fungus alone (FA), or sequential dual stress with fungi followed by insect (FI) and insect followed by fungi (IF), with untreated control. We also assessed the performance of late-arriving conspecific herbivore on these plant sets. The total phenol, and non-tannin phenols content in IF and FI plants showed similar increase or decrease as FA and IA plants, respectively. Gene expression analysis revealed that JA-related genes (MYC2) were dominant in FI plants, while SA-related genes (PR1) were upregulated in IF plants. Moreover, late-arriving herbivores showed significantly decreased relative growth rate, efficiency of conversion of ingested food (ECI) and digested food (ECD) when feeding on FA and IF plants, indicating that sequential treatments substantially induce plant responses. However, herbivory did not affect the late-arriving conspecific herbivore. Thus, biochemical responses and hormonal interplay of the plant are influenced by both sequence as well as the duration of the biotic stress. Furthermore, while the late-arriving conspecific herbivore is negatively affected by the presence of a pathogen, it remains unaffected by previous herbivory. (c) 2024 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Iron deficiency is the most common mammalian nutritional disorder. However, among mammalian species iron deficiency anemia (IDA), occurs regularly only in pigs. To cure IDA, piglets are routinely injected with high amounts of iron dextran (FeDex), which can lead to perturbations in iron homeostasis. Here, we evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of non-invasive supplementation with Sucrosomial iron (SI), a highly bioavailable iron supplement preventing IDA in humans and mice and various iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs). Analysis of red blood cell indices and plasma iron parameters shows that not all iron preparations used in the study efficiently counteracted IDA comparable to FeDex-based supplementation. We found no signs of iron toxicity of any tested iron compounds, as evaluated based on the measurement of several toxicological markers that could indicate the occurrence of oxidative stress or inflammation. Neither SI nor IONPs increased hepcidin expression with alterations in ferroportin (FPN) protein level. Finally, the analysis of the piglet gut microbiota indicates the individual pattern of bacterial diversity across taxonomic levels, independent of the type of supplementation. In light of our results, SI but not IONPs used in the experiment emerges as a promising nutritional iron supplement, with a high potential to correct IDA in piglets.

AB  - Ninety-four percent of CO2 emissions induced by final demand in the global construction sector stem from the supply chain. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the CO2 emission hotspots within the supply chain and implement targeted reduction measures. This study proposed a supply chain clustering approach considering the functional unit of houses and identified CO2 emission hotspots within the supply chain structure of wooden houses, which accounted for approximately 90% of the total housing stock in Japan. We founded that the top ten CO2 emission clusters (i.e., emission hotspots) account for approximately 40% of the carbon footprint (38 t-CO2) of a wooden house. Specifically, the iron and steel cluster, which includes the pig iron and crude steel sectors, and the cement cluster, comprising the cement and ready -mixed concrete sectors, collectively contribute to approximately 75% of the CO2 emissions within the top 10 clusters. Therefore, the reduction of CO2 emissions from these clusters is of paramount importance. Decision-makers should promote renovation and remodeling policies for vacant houses and prioritize the reuse of foundations, predominantly constructed using steel and cement products, to reduce the supply-chain emissions from wooden houses.

AB  - The aim was to undertake an Agroecological assessment of pre-emergence herbicides on the crops of the Aris sunflower hybrid in Krasnodar Territory. The experiment was carried out at the Federal Research Centre of Biological Plant Protection in 2023 on sunflower crops (Aris hybrid), according to the guidelines for testing herbicides in agriculture. Widely used pre-emergence herbicides were applied in the experiment. The biological and economic efficacy of herbicides was assessed by the number, weight and yield of sunflower seeds in comparison with the control. A comparative ecotoxicological assessment of the preparations was carried out based on the environmental load indicator. Application of the preparations: Frontiere Optima, CE (0.8 l/ha); Dual Gold CE (1.3 l/ha); Proponite, CE (2.0 l/ha), Gezadar, SC (2.0 l/ha), Begin Turbo, SC (1.5 l/ha); Acris, SE (2.0 l/ha); Versia, OD (3.0 l/ha) and Camelot, SE (3.0 l/ha) before sunflower germination provided 75...96 % herbicidal effect. No negative effect on the crop was observed and 149.1...155.5 % of the saved yield compared to the control was obtained. Herbicides: Frontiere Optima, CE, Dual Gold CE, Proponite, CE, Gezadar, SC are characterised by a lower environmental load compared to the preparations Begin Turbo, SC; Acris, SE; Versia, OD and Camelot, SE. When choosing herbicides for use on sunflower crops, it is necessary to take into account not only their biological effectiveness, but also their environmental load.

AB  - To investigate the effects of condensed tannins (CT) on immune functions and nitrogen (N) emissions of captive Sichuan black goat kids under cadmium (Cd) toxicity, a total of 18 Sichuan black goat kids (2 months old, 9.6 +/- 1.2 kg) were randomly used in this 30-day trial. The dietary treatments were (1) CON group, basic diet; (2) Cd group, basic diet + oral 10 mg Cd/kg center dot BW; and (3) CT group, Cd group + 400 mg/kg CT. Oral Cd supplementation significantly decreased the Cu and Fe contents in serums and livers of captive Sichuan black goat kids (P < 0.05), but adding CT in the Cd group increased the Fe and Mo contents and decreased the Cd content in serums and livers (P < 0.05). Additional CT supplementation in the Cd group extremely increased the activities of serum SOD, GSH-Px, and CAT (P < 0.05), and greatly decreased the serum MDA content (P < 0.05). The CT supplementation in the Cd group also extremely increased the concentrations of serum IgG, IgM, and IgA (P < 0.05), and greatly decreased the contents of IL-6, IL-1 beta, and TNF-alpha in serums (P < 0.05). Adding CT in the Cd group significantly increased the apparent digestibility of CP and EE and decreased the urinary nitrogen (UN) content (P < 0.05, Table 7). In conclusion, the application of additional CT improved antioxidant capacities and immune functions of captive black goats under Cd toxicity, then reduced the oxidative stress and toxic damage of Cd contamination. CT also improved the N digestibility and reduced the N emission, which was helpful to reduce environmental pollution.

AB  - Understanding the drivers of farmers' challenges and adoption of sustainable agricultural practices (SAPs) is crucial for the sustainable development of the small-scale urban pig enterprise in sub-Saharan Africa. A total of 160 structured questionnaires were individually administered to determine factors driving small-scale farmers' challenges and adoption of SAPs in the Cape Metropole District, South Africa. Key challenges reported by the farmers were piglet mortality (88% of respondents), limited access to communal water taps (42%), feed scarcity (36%), and shortage of pig housing material (30%). Marginal effects from logistic regression revealed that farmers' chances to experience key challenges were high (P <= 0.05) among African traditional religion believers, exotic pig breed owners, single source income earners and young farmers. Key SAPs adopted by farmers included restricted feeding (78% of respondents), controlled mating (70%), biosecurity (50%) and record keeping (50%). The probability of farmers' failure to adopt key SAPs was high among the less educated, young farmers and African traditional religion believers (P <= 0.05). In conclusion, consideration of farmer-oriented factors that have been associated with increasing the likelihood of experiencing challenges and non-adoption of SAPs in development initiatives could enhance small-scale urban pig production in the studied areas.

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous noncoding RNAs that produce a remarked effect on regulating posttranscriptional gene expression. Our previous study identified a decrease in the expression of oar-miR-411a-5p from umbilical plasma in intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) Hu lambs subjected to maternal heat stress. In this study, we demonstrated that oar-miR-411a-5p could modulate skeletal muscle development. Overexpression of oar-miR-411a-5p significantly enhanced proliferation and differentiation in heat-stressed Hu sheep myoblasts while suppressing apoptosis. Conversely, inhibition of oar-miR-411a-5p resulted in opposing effects. Subsequently, RNAhybrid analysis revealed targeted sites between oar-miR-411a-5p and the 3 ' untranslated region (UTR) of SMAD2. This suggested that SMAD2 is a direct target gene of oar-miR-411a-5p, as its expression was negatively modulated by oar-miR-411a-5p, a finding corroborated by dual-luciferase assay and RT-qPCR. Furthermore, co-transfection of oar-miR-411a-5p and SMAD2 into Hu sheep myoblasts indicated that oar-miR-411a-5p modulated heat-stressed myoblast growth by targeting SMAD2. In conclusion, these findings elucidate the function of oar-miR-411a-5p in promoting the development of heat-stressed Hu sheep myoblasts, thereby enhancing our understanding of how miRNAs influence skeletal muscle growth in heat-stressed Hu sheep.

AB  - BackgroundWith the easy availability and competitive prices of crystalline amino acids (AAs), the reduction of dietary crude protein (CP) for pigs during early and late finisher periods is possible under commercial conditions. Two experiments were conducted to assess the growth efficiency of early and late-finishing pigs fed with protein-restricted diets supplemented with Lys, Met, Thr, Trp, Val, Ile and His. In Experiment 1, 840 early finishing pigs were allocated to four dietary treatments with CP levels designed at 150, 142, 134, and 126 g kg(-1) diet. In Experiment 2, 768 late-finishing pigs were allotted to four dietary treatments providing CP levels at 140, 130, 120, and 110 g kg(-1) diet. ResultsIn Experiment 1, the data showed that CP levels could be decreased from 150 to 126 g kg(-1) without adversely affecting performance of early finishing pigs as no significant difference was observed for final bodyweight, average daily gain (ADG), feed to gain ratio (F:G), or average daily feed intake (ADFI). In Experiment 2, late-finishing pigs consuming 120 g kg(-1) CP tended to have the highest ADG and lowest F:G whereas those fed the 110 g kg(-1) CP diet showed the opposite trend. Based on quadratic analysis, the optimum CP levels to maximize ADG and minimize F:G were 126 and 127 g kg(-1), respectively. ConclusionThese findings showed that dietary CP levels could be decreased to 126 g kg(-1) for early finishing pigs while improved performance was noted in late-finishing pigs consuming 120 g kg(-1) CP.

AB  - Each view of our environment captures only a subset of our immersive surroundings. Yet, our visual experience feels seamless. A puzzle for human neuroscience is to determine what cognitive mechanisms enable us to overcome our limited field of view and efficiently anticipate new views as we sample our visual surroundings. Here, we tested whether memory-based predictions of upcoming scene views facilitate efficient perceptual judgments across head turns. We tested this hypothesis using immersive, head-mounted virtual reality (VR). After learning a set of immersive real-world environments, participants (n = 101 across 4 experiments) were briefly primed with a single view from a studied environment and then turned left or right to make a perceptual judgment about an adjacent scene view. We found that participants' perceptual judgments were faster when they were primed with images from the same (vs. neutral or different) environments. Importantly, priming required memory: it only occurred in learned (vs. novel) environments, where the link between adjacent scene views was known. Further, consistent with a role in supporting active vision, priming only occurred in the direction of planned head turns and only benefited judgments for scene views presented in their learned spatiotopic positions. Taken together, we propose that memory-based predictions facilitate rapid perception across large-scale visual actions, such as head and body movements, and may be critical for efficient behavior in complex immersive environments.

AB  - Carfentanil is a widely used opioid new psychoactive substance (NPS) that possesses a high risk of addiction. However, the positive and negative reinforcement, as well as the psychostimulant effects of carfentanil remain unclear. In the present study, we compared the rewarding (positive reinforcement) and psychostimulant effects between carfentanil and morphine, using the conditioned place preference (CPP, including acquisition, extinction, and reinstatement) and behavioral sensitization paradigms. The withdrawal syndrome and anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors were detected to reveal the drug withdrawal-induced somatic and psychiatric symptoms (associated with negative reinforcement). Our results demonstrated that a low dose (0.5 mu g/kg) of carfentanil could induce comparable CPP acquisition to 10 mg/kg morphine. Carfentanil, but not morphine, successfully induced behavioral sensitization. Both carfentanil and morphine withdrawal led to somatic and psychiatric (anxiety- and depressive- like behaviors) symptoms. Notably, carfentanil-exposed mice demonstrated more severe somatic withdrawal symptoms compared to morphine-exposed mice after naloxone-precipitation. In the drug-induced acquisition of CPP, carfentanil-exposed mice, but not morphine-exposed mice, showed an increase of c-Fos expression in the shell of nucleus accumbens (NAcSh) and caudate putamen (CPu). In the naloxone-precipitated drug withdrawal, carfentanil-exposed mice exhibited a higher level of c-Fos expression than morphine-exposed mice in the CPu. Carfentanil, but not morphine, activated the prefrontal cortex (PFC), NAcSh, and dorsal hippocampus (dHPC). Collectively, we found more potent reinforcing and psychostimulant effects of carfentanil compared to morphine. Our findings extend the knowledge and lay the foundation for the mechanistic studies of the reinforcing and psychostimulant effects of NPSs.

AB  - Neurobiological research in rodents has revealed that competing experiences of fear and extinction are stored as distinct memory traces in the brain. This divided organization is adaptive for mitigating overgeneralization of fear to related stimuli that are learned to be safe while also maintaining threat associations for unsafe stimuli. The mechanisms involved in organizing these competing memories in the human brain remain unclear. Here, we used a hybrid form of Pavlovian conditioning with an episodic memory component to identify overlapping multivariate patterns of fMRI activity associated with the formation and retrieval of fear versus extinction. In healthy adults, distinct regions of the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus showed selective reactivation of fear versus extinction memories based on the temporal context in which these memories were encoded. This dissociation was absent in participants with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. The divided neural organization of fear and extinction may support flexible retrieval of context-appropriate emotional memories, while their disorganization may promote overgeneralization and increased fear relapse in affective disorders.

AB  - Soil amendments can trigger bottom-up effects in crop-herbivorous pest interactions, thus impacting pest man- agement and biochars may enhance plant growth and resistance to plant pests. We studied bottom-up effects of regenera- tive biochar bamboo charcoal on tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and a major pest Bemisia tabaci, both under laboratory and field conditions. Plant height, stem diameter, and leaf dry-to-fresh weight ratio, as well as the content of free amino acids, starch, and soluble sugars, increased in the bamboo charcoal treatment compared with the control. Moreover, some plant-resistant substances or enzyme activities (e.g., flavonoids, phenylalanine ammonia lyase, and superoxide dismutase) were different among treatments. Applying bamboo charcoal reduced the survival rate and oviposition of B. tabaci. Y-tube olfactometer bioassay and volatilome analysis showed that the bamboo charcoal treatment reduced the attractiveness of tomato plants to B. tabaci by inducing the increasing release of the repellent volatile organic compound methyl salicylate. Field experiment showed that applying bamboo charcoal (5 L/m2) in the soil promoted the growth of tomato plants and sup- pressed the B. tabaci population. In conclusion, we demonstrate that applying bamboo charcoal could enhance the tomato plant growth and development and lower pest population by increasing the synthesis and accumulation of plant resistance substances. Therefore, it has the potential for large-scale field application to improve crop yield and significantly reduce B. tabaci occurrence.

AB  - Simple Summary The brain, as the central nervous system that controls the body's sensory, behavior, and mental symptoms, is sensitive to RF exposure, and lots of studies have explored the potential health hazards of RF-EMR with different frequencies to the brain. Our previous study found that 4.9 GHz radiofrequency radiation induced depression-like behavior in mice, but the mechanism of the behavioral changes was unclear. Studies have shown that changes in peripheral energy metabolism might affect brain lipid levels, and thereby cortical excitability, and a deregulated hippocampus proteome might influence the healthy functioning of the brain. Here, we provide evidence that 4.9 GHz RF exposure altered metabolite expression patterns in brain tissue and serum, especially glycerophospholipid metabolism. In addition, 4.9 GHz RF exposure induced an imbalance in the protein profile of brain tissue and may alter gap junction communication. Our results initially revealed the biological effects of 5G communication frequency exposure and provided a possible mechanism for electromagnetic radiation-induced behavioral changes from the perspective of metabolome and proteome.Abstract Electromagnetic exposure has become increasingly widespread, and its biological effects have received extensive attention. The purpose of this study was to explore changes in the metabolism profile of the brain and serum and to identify differentially expressed proteins in the brain after exposure to the 4.9 GHz radiofrequency (RF) field. C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into a Sham group and an RF group, which were sham-exposed and continuously exposed to a 4.9 RF field for 35 d, 1 h/d, at an average power density (PD) of 50 W/m2. After exposure, untargeted metabolomics and Tandem Mass Tags (TMT) quantitative proteomics were performed. We found 104 and 153 up- and down-regulated differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs) in the RF_Brain group and RF_Serum group, and the DEMs were significantly enriched in glycerophospholipid metabolism. Moreover, 10 up-regulated and 51 down-regulated differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were discovered in the RF group. Functional correlation analysis showed that most DEMs and DEPs showed a significant correlation. These results suggested that 4.9 GHz exposure induced disturbance of metabolism in the brain and serum, and caused deregulation of proteins in the brain.

AB  - Perilla is an edible oil crop containing high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), such as alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) and omega-3. The omega-3 helps in mitigating the risk of cardiovascular disease in humans. For industrial use, perilla seed is extracted for virgin oil, which is generally achieved by mechanical screw pressing. This process generates perilla cake that contains a fat content around 9-10%. In this study, we examined the effect of the supplementation of perilla cake in the pig diet on productive performance, pig carcass characteristics, meat quality, and fatty acid composition in fat tissue, and meat. The pig performance improved in terms of average daily gain after supplementation with perilla cake; however, the pig carcass and meat quality was unchanged. Moreover, the perilla cake supplement increased PUFA fatty acids and reduced the proportion of saturated fatty acids and unsaturated fatty acids in pork. The overall outcome of this study provides an alternative source of novel raw material for functional feed additives in livestock production.
   The objective of this study was to determine the effect of perilla cake (PC) supplementation in a growing pig diet on overall growing performance, meat quality, and fatty acid profile. A total of 24 barrow grower crossbred pigs (Large White x Landrace) x Duroc with an initial average body weight of 26.33 kg were fed with a basal diet supplemented with PC at 0%, 5%, and 10% in (PC0, PC5, and PC10, respectively) for 12 weeks. At the end of the experimental period, pigs were slaughtered to determine carcass traits and meat quality. Back fat, abdominal fat, and longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle were collected to investigate fatty acid composition. The results show that the average daily gain (ADG) in the PC10 significantly increased. However, PC supplementation did not influence carcass traits and meat quality except the color as described by lightness (L*). Dietary PC supplementation significantly increased the a-linolenic acid (ALA, C18:3 cis-9, 12, 15), whereas n6/n3 ratio decreased significantly in all tissues investigated. Thus, it can be concluded that the supplementation of PC in growing pig diet is a potential way to increase the fatty acid composition to that required for healthier meat.

AB  - Background The aim of this study was to study the relationship between the methylation level of the promoter region of follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) gene and the mRNA expression of Duolang sheep fed different energy diets. Methods In this study, polyembryo estrus Duolang sheep under different energy levels were selected as the experimental subjects. Dietary nutrient level reference (NY/T 816-2004), medium energy level was 10.88 MJ/day, high and low energy groups were increased and decreased by 15% on the basis of medium energy level, respectively 12.51 MJ/day, 9.25 MJ/day. Through RNA and DNA extraction, qPCR, bisulfitegenomicse-quencing PCR (BSP), sequence matching and other analysis of ovarian tissue of Duolang sheep. The difference of DNA methylation level and mRNA expression of FSHR gene during estrus in Duolang sheep fed with different energy diets was detected. Results The results showed the expression level of FSHR in high energy group was significantly higher than that in low energy group (P < 0.01), the expression level of FSHR in high energy group was significantly higher than that in medium energy group (P < 0.05), and the expression level of FSHR in medium energy group was significantly higher than that in low energy group (P < 0.05). In the target fragment of the promoter region of the FSHR gene, the methylation rate was 25% in the high energy group, 50% in the normal group, and 75% in the low energy group. Conclusions This study revealed that different dietary energy levels had certain effects on the FSHR gene DNA methylation level and mRNA expression, and the expression level was negatively correlated with methylation level.

AB  - Male seminal fluid proteins often show signs of positive selection and divergent evolution, believed to reflect male-female coevolution. Yet, our understanding of the predicted concerted evolution of seminal fluid proteins and female reproductive proteins is limited. We sequenced, assembled, and annotated the genome of two species of seed beetles allowing a comparative analysis of four closely related species of these herbivorous insects. We compare the general pattern of evolution in genes encoding seminal fluid proteins and female reproductive proteins with those in digestive protein genes and well-conserved reference genes. We found that female reproductive proteins showed an overall ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions (omega) similar to that of conserved genes, while seminal fluid proteins and digestive proteins exhibited higher overall omega values. Further, seminal fluid proteins and digestive proteins showed a higher proportion of sites putatively under positive selection, and explicit tests showed no difference in relaxed selection between protein types. Evolutionary rate covariation analyses showed that evolutionary rates among seminal fluid proteins were on average more closely correlated with those in female reproductive proteins than with either digestive or conserved genes. Gene expression showed the expected negative covariation with omega values, except for male-biased genes where this negative relationship was reversed. In conclusion, seminal fluid proteins showed relatively rapid evolution and signs of positive selection. In contrast, female reproductive proteins evolved at a lower rate under selective constraints, on par with genes known to be well conserved. Although our findings provide support for concerted evolution of seminal fluid proteins and female reproductive proteins, they also suggest that these two classes of proteins evolve under partly distinct selective regimes.

AB  - Psychological stress affects a wide spectrum of brain functions and poses risks for many mental disorders. However, effective therapeutics to alleviate or revert its deleterious effects are lacking. A recently synthesized psychedelic analog tabernanthalog (TBG) has demonstrated anti-addictive and antidepressant potential. Whether TBG can rescue stress-induced affective, sensory, and cognitive deficits, and how it may achieve such effects by modulating neural circuits, remain unknown. Here we show that in mice exposed to unpredictable mild stress (UMS), administration of a single dose of TBG decreases their anxiety level and rescues deficits in sensory processing as well as in cognitive flexibility. Post-stress TBG treatment promotes the regrowth of excitatory neuron dendritic spines lost during UMS, decreases the baseline neuronal activity, and enhances whisking-modulation of neuronal activity in the somatosensory cortex. Moreover, calcium imaging in head-fixed mice performing a whisker-dependent texture discrimination task shows that novel textures elicit responses from a greater proportion of neurons in the somatosensory cortex than do familiar textures. Such differential response is diminished by UMS and is restored by TBG. Together, our study reveals the effects of UMS on cortical neuronal circuit activity patterns and demonstrate that TBG combats the detrimental effects of stress by modulating basal and stimulus-dependent neural activity in cortical networks.

AB  - This is the first description of cutaneous mucormycosis in buffalo in the Brazilian Amazon biome. All buffalo showed apathy, inappetence, weight loss, reluctance to move, and prolonged sternal decubitus. Of the four affected animals, two died 15 and 30 days after the appearance of clinical signs. In the initial phase, the skin lesions were rounded areas with dry central regions, sensitive to palpation, with protruding edges and diameters ranging from 8 cm to 15 cm. These areas of necrosis were isolated or coalescing and present mainly on the limbs and sides. In an advanced stage of the disease, there was detachment of the skin from the necrotic areas with extensive wound formation, which sometimes exposed the subcutaneous tissue. The histopathology of the skin showed a multifocal inflammatory infiltrate composed of intact and degenerated eosinophils surrounded by epithelioid macrophages. At the center of these areas was a focally extensive area of epidermal ulceration characterized by intact and degenerated neutrophils, the necrosis of epithelial cells, and the accumulation of fibrin and erythrocytes. The mycological culture was positive for Rhizopus sp. The diagnosis of cutaneous dermatitis caused by Rhizopus sp. was based on clinical signs, macroscopic and histopathological findings, and the identification of the fungus by mycological and molecular techniques.

AB  - The nematode Trichinella pseudospiralis is a cosmopolitan parasite capable of infecting both birds and mammals including humans. T. pseudospiralis has a limited zoonotic importance in comparison to that of the other Trichinella species. However, it has been recognized as the etiological agent of two outbreaks of trichinellosis due to the consumption of wild boar meat. The role played by birds in the epidemiology of T. pseudospiralis is still unclear and needs to be deepened. The aim of our work was to show the results of an extensive wild bird sur-veillance carried out in the Emilia-Romagna (E-R) region, northern Italy, over the last 16 years. As part of the regional wildlife surveillance program, 14,933 raptors and carrion-eating birds' carcasses were necropsied from 2006 to 2021 and tested for the presence of Trichinella spp. larvae with only one positive result, an adult female of western marsh harrier. The larvae load (LPG) was evaluated on breast (100 LPG), wings (3.6 LPG), shoulder (2 LPG), head (4.5 LPG), thighs (8 LPG), lower legs (2 LPG) and tongue (0.77 LPG). The results of the present study confirm that also in northern Italy T. pseudospiralis has a low prevalence comparing to that of other Trichinella species. However, this study demonstrates that T. pseudospiralis can reach a high parasitic load in infested birds. The large distribution range, probably facilitated by its ability to infest birds, suggests the need for a continuous monitoring program.

AB  - Bisphenol A (BPA), a substance globally used to produce plastics, is part of many everyday items, including bottles, food containers, electronic elements, and others. It may penetrate the environment and living organisms, negatively affecting, among others, the nervous, immune, endocrine, and cardiovascular systems. Knowledge of the impact of BPA on the urinary bladder is extremely scarce. This study investigated the influence of two doses of BPA (0.05 mg/kg body weight (b.w.)/day and 0.5 mg/kg b.w./day) given orally for 28 days on the neurons situated in the ganglia located in the urinary bladder trigone using the typical double immunofluorescence method. In the study, an increase in the percentage of neurons containing substance P (SP), galanin (GAL), a neuronal isoform of nitric oxide synthase (nNOS-used as the marker of nitrergic neurons), and/or cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) peptide was noted after BPA administration. The severity of these changes depended on the dose of BPA and the type of neuronal factors studied. The most visible changes were noted in the cases of SP- and/or GAL-positive neurons after administering a higher dose of BPA. The results have shown that oral exposure to BPA, lasting even for a short time, affects the intramural neurons in the urinary bladder wall, and changes in the neurochemical characterisation of these neurons may be the first signs of BPA-induced pathological processes in this organ.

AB  - To elucidate whether cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES) improves depression-like behavior of post-stroke depression (PSD) via regulation of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4)-mediated brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression. Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) were used to develop a rat PSD model. CES was applied, and RAS-selective lethal 3 (RSL3) was injected into the hippocampus to inhibit GPX4 in PSD rats. The depression behavior was detected by sucrose preference and forced swimming tests. The structure and morphology of the hippocampus were observed and analyzed by histopathological hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. The mRNA and protein expressions of GPX4 and BDNF in the hippocampus were detected by qRT-PCR, western blot and immunohistochemical analysis.The degeneration and necrosis of hippocampal neurons, the depression-like behavior were severer and the expression of BDNF in the hippocampus were decreased in PSD rats than those in MCAO and control groups. CES promoted the hippo-campal neuron repair, alleviated the depression-like behavior and increased the expression of BDNF in PSD rats. The inhibition of GPX4 by RSL3 exacerbated the depression-like behavior and decreased the expression of BDNF in PSD rats. In addition, we found that RSL3 disrupted the positive effects of CES on the PSD rats. Conclusion: CES improves depression-like behavior of PSD rats through upregulation of GPX4-mediated BDNF expression in the hippocampus.

AB  - In diamond, nitrogen defects like the substitutional nitrogen defect (Ns) or the nitrogen -vacancy -hydrogen complex (NVH) outnumber the nitrogen -vacancy (NV) defect by at least one order of magnitude creating a dense spin bath. While neutral Ns has an impact on the coherence of the NV spin state, the atomic structure of NVH reminds of a NV center decorated with a hydrogen atom. As a consequence, the formation of NVH centers could compete with that of NV centers possibly lowering the N -to -NV conversion efficiency in diamond grown with hydrogen -plasma -assisted chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Therefore, monitoring and controlling the spin bath is essential to produce and understand engineered diamond material with high NV concentrations for quantum applications. While the incorporation of Ns in diamond has been investigated on the nano- and mesoscale for years, studies concerning the influence of CVD parameters and the crystal orientation on the NVH formation have been restricted to bulk N -doped diamond providing high -enough spin numbers for electron paramagnetic resonance and optical absorption spectroscopy techniques. Here, we investigate submicron-thick (100) -diamond layers with nitrogen contents of (13.8 +/- 1.6) ppm and (16.7 +/- 3.6) ppm, and exploiting the NV centers in the layers as local nanosensors, we demonstrate the detection of NVH- centers using double electronelectron resonance (DEER). To determine the NVH- densities, we quantitatively fit the hyperfine structure of NVH- and confirm the results with the DEER method usually used for determining Ns0 densities. With our experiments, we access the spin bath composition on the nanoscale and enable a fast feedback loop in CVD recipe optimization with thin diamond layers instead of resource- and time -intensive bulk crystals. Furthermore, the quantification of NVH- plays a very important role for understanding the dynamics of vacancies and the incorporation of hydrogen into CVD diamond optimized for quantum technologies.

AB  - (1) Background: There is growing interest in using insects to treat nutrient-rich organic wastes, such as the black soldier fly (BSF), one of the most efficient organic waste recyclers for upcycling nutrients into the food system. Although biochar (BC) was shown to enhance nutrient retention and the final product quality during the composting of livestock and poultry manure in many previous studies, little information is available on the effect of BC on livestock manure bioconversion by black soldier fly larvae (BSFL). (2) Methods: This study investigated the effect of adding a small amount of BC to chicken manure (CM) on the bioconversion system of the black soldier fly (including N2O and NH3 emissions and the final distribution of nitrogen during the treatment process). (3) Results: The lowest N2O and NH3 emission and highest residual nitrogen in the substrate were observed in the 15% BC treatment. The highest bioconversion rate of CM (8.31%) and the peak of larval biomass was obtained in the 5% BC treatment. (4) Conclusions: The results demonstrate the feasibility of adding 5% BC to reduce pollution and achieve a satisfactory BSFL-based CM bioconversion efficiency.

AB  - Introduction: The trace elements concentrations of blood might play a key role in the trace element concentration of seminal plasma, as well as in the improvement of semen volume and sperm morphology in boars.& nbsp;Objective: To assess the effect of supplementation of Cu, Zn and Mn on their concentrations in blood serum and seminal plasma and sperm quality in boars.& nbsp;Methods: Eighteen boars of the Duroc Jersey breed were selected and their blood and semen (54 ejaculates before supplementation) were extracted. Coinciding with the third sampling and after of blood taken, the boars were supplemented subcutaneously with 37.5 mg of Cu, 75 mg of Zn and 37.5 mg of Mn; 40 days after the supplementation the fourth sampling was taken. Cu and Zn concentrations in blood serum and seminal plasma were determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry, while the sperm pathologies were determined by microscopy and the concentrations of Cu and Zn in blood serum and seminal plasma, and semen pathologies were compared using the t-Student test for paired samples. A simple linear correlation was made between the minerals concentration in seminal plasma with the percentage of spermatozoa with abnormal forms.& nbsp;Results: Although the concentrations of Zn in blood serum did not show differences between sampling periods (P < 0.05), they were significantly higher (P < 0.01) in the seminal plasma after supplementation as compared to its levels before supplementation. In addition, the concentrations of Cu and Zn in seminal plasma were increased (P < 0.01), and the total spermatic pathologies were reduced; especially those of the head, neck and intermediate part of the tail (P < 0.001). Besides, macrocephaly, double head and broken acrosome were the most common pathologies (P < 0.05). Moreover, parenteral supplementation of Cu, Zn and Mn was a protective factor to the presentation of ejaculates with abnormal sperm percentages higher than 10% (chi(2) = 6.1544; P = 0.0131). The prevalence of abnormal shapes of boars' sperm before supplementation was 0.40; after supplementation the answer was 0.05 and the prevalence ratio was 0.13 with a confidence interval of 95% from 0.01 to 0.94. Moreover, Zn concentrations in blood serum were not correlated with those of the seminal plasma (P > 0.05, r = -0.0353); however, the concentrations of Cu in both fluids were correlated (P < 0.05, r = 0.2254). In addition, the Zn values in the seminal plasma and the percentage of abnormal spermatozoa had a negative and highly significant correlation (P < 0.0001, r = -0.5628). However, the Cu concentrations in the semen were not significantly correlated with the abnormal sperm forms (P > 0.05, r = 0.0200).& nbsp;Conclusion: From the present study it can be concluded that in boars fed with diets that meeting their requirements in trace minerals according to NRC (2012) [1], parenteral supplementation of 37.5 mg of Cu, 75 mg of Zn and 37.5 mg of Mn increased the Zn concentrations in the seminal plasma and reduced the sperm pathologies, which resulted in an increase of the boars' sperm quality.

AB  - Japanese green tea, an essential beverage in Japanese culture, is characterized by the initial steaming of freshly harvested leaves during production. This process efficiently inactivates endogenous enzymes such as polyphenol oxidases, resulting in the production of sencha, gyokuro and matcha that preserves the vibrant green color of young leaves. Although genome sequences of several tea cultivars and germplasms have been published, no reference genome sequences are available for Japanese green tea cultivars. Here, we constructed a reference genome sequence of the cultivar 'Seimei', which is used to produce high-quality Japanese green tea. Using the PacBio HiFi and Hi-C technologies for chromosome-scale genome assembly, we obtained 15 chromosome sequences with a total genome size of 3.1 Gb and an N50 of 214.9 Mb. By analyzing the genomic diversity of 23 Japanese tea cultivars and lines, including the leading green tea cultivars 'Yabukita' and 'Saemidori', it was revealed that several candidate genes could be related to the characteristics of Japanese green tea. The reference genome of 'Seimei' and information on genomic diversity of Japanese green tea cultivars should provide crucial information for effective breeding of such cultivars in the future.

AB  - Contamination of nano-biothreats, such as viruses, mycoplasmas, and pathogenic bacteria, is widespread in cell cultures and greatly threatens many cell-based bio-analysis and biomanufacturing. However, non-invasive trapping and removal of such biothreats during cell culturing, particularly many precious cells, is of great challenge. Here, inspired by the wake-riding effect, a biocompatible opto-hydrodynamic diatombot (OHD) based on optical trapping navigated rotational diatom (Phaeodactylum tricornutum Bohlin) for non-invasive trapping and removal of nano-biothreats is reported. Combining the opto-hydrodynamic effect and optical trapping, this rotational OHD enables the trapping of bio-targets down to sub-100 nm. Different nano-biothreats, such as adenoviruses, pathogenic bacteria, and mycoplasmas, are first demonstrated to be effectively trapped and removed by the OHD, without affecting culturing cells including precious cells such as hippocampal neurons. The removal efficiency is greatly enhanced via reconfigurable OHD array construction. Importantly, these OHDs show remarkable antibacterial capability, and further facilitate targeted gene delivery. This OHD serves as a smart micro-robotic platform for effective trapping and active removal of nano-biothreats in bio-microenvironments, and especially for cell culturing of many precious cells, with great promises for benefiting cell-based bio-analysis and biomanufacturing.

AB  - Local environmental conditions associated with different geographic areas may elicit variations in behavioural responses in animals, leading to concomitant differences in functional brain region volumes. We investigated the behavioural correlates of hippocampus and amygdala volumes in three sister taxa of the murid rodent genus Rhabdomys, occurring in different environments. We used a Barnes maze to test spatial memory, dyadic encounters to test social behaviour, and histological brain sections to calculate hippocampus and amygdala volumes. Arid-occurring R. pumilio made fewer errors and had shorter latencies in locating the escape tunnel compared to moist grassland-occurring R. d. dilectus and R. d. chakae in two probe trials, 48 and 96 h after the last learning trial. R. pumilio was more amicable than the R. dilectus subspecies in intra-specific dyadic encounters. R. pumilio had larger hippocampus and amygdala volumes than the other species. Smaller amygdala volumes were correlated with longer latencies in females for probe trial 1, but males showed similar latencies regardless of taxon. Higher amicability scores were correlated with larger amygdala volumes in all taxa. Higher amicability scores were correlated with larger hippocampus volumes in R. pumilio and R. d. chakae but smaller hippocampus volumes in R. d. dilectus. Correlative relationships between spatial memory and amygdala volume appeared 48 h, but not 96 h, after the last learning trial. Local environmental conditions may influence spatial navigation, but social correlates drive regional brain size within cryptic striped mouse taxa.

Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of dietary stevia residue extract (SRE) supplementation on the performance, meat quality, antioxidative capacity and gut microbiota in growing-finishing pigs. RESULTS The results showed that increasing the concentration of SRE supplementation linearly increased (P < 0.05) body weight from day 1 to 35. Supplementation with SRE significantly increased (P < 0.05) average daily gain (ADG) from day 1 to 75. 100 mg kg(-1) SRE supplementation significantly increased (P < 0.05) hot carcass weight and gastric index. Moreover, increasing the concentration of SRE linearly increased (P < 0.05) the score of appearance of longissimus thoracis, as well as serum albumin, triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol content. Further study found that increasing the concentration of SRE linearly increased (P < 0.05) serum total superoxide dismutase activity, and showed a significant quadratic relationship (P < 0.05) with activity of serum catalase, while linearly decreasing (P < 0.05) muscle malondialdehyde (MDA) content. Furthermore, supplementation with 100 mg kg(-1) SRE significantly decreased (P < 0.05) serum MDA content, while 600 and 800 mg kg(-1) SRE supplementation significantly decreased (P < 0.05) muscle MDA content. However, SRE supplementation had no significant effect on gut microbiota (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION These data indicated that dietary SRE supplementation improves the performance and antioxidative capacity of growing-finishing pigs. We recommend that the optimal supplemental level of SRE in the diet of growing-finishing pigs is 100 mg kg(-1). (c) 2022 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - The climatic instability of the Early Pleistocene induced regional paleoenvironmental changes, which impacted faunal composition and dynamics. It coincides with the Homo dispersal out of Africa. The role played by the Eastern Balkans in this dispersal is at the heart of current scientific debates. The rich fossil assemblage of Gerakarou-1 (2-1.8 Ma; northern Greece) can provide important insight into the environmental conditions of that time and area. In this study, we provide insights into the dietary habits of the herbivore guild of Gerakarou-1 at both short and long-term scales based on two complementary dental proxies, mesowear and microwear textures applied on 70 specimens and we infer the local paleoecology and paleoenvironment. As diet varies between and among populations within the same species, we conduct a population-level study, including a reference dataset of 144 extant individuals belonging to six populations of ruminants with well-known ecology. As we aim to contribute to the collective effort of the community to improve the mesowear methodology, we propose and discuss here the benefits of an alternative, quantitative Geometric Morphometric approach. We show that the occlusal relief, as calculated in the classical mesowear approach, is a variable of little relevance and that the quantitative approach allows better discrimination between dietary categories. By proposing for the first time a multi-scale and multi-proxies study of the entire herbivore guild at Gerakarou-1, we nuance and clarify the paleoecology and niche-partitioning of the ungulates from this site and improve past paleoenvironmental interpretations.

AB  - The consumer's interest in his/her health and the quality of his/her food has increased as well as in environmental issues such as animal welfare. Consumers believe that organic and similar (traditional) production systems are more advantageous for consumers (providing healthier food) and animals (providing better welfare). The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of different rearing systems (organic, conventional and traditional) on the physicochemical properties and oxidation states of pork meat. The meat samples were obtained from three different rearing systems of pigs: organic, conventional and traditional. The samples (M. biceps femoris) were obtained from producers directly 3 days after slaughtering for analysis. The following physical and chemical parameters were analyzed: color (according to the CIE L * a * b * system), pH, dry matter, protein, collagen, fat and ash. The oxidation state of the meat samples was measured by thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARSs), free fatty acid (FFA) and antioxidant capacity (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl). The results indicated that the rearing system affects most of the evaluated parameters. A significant difference (p < 0.05) was observed in color parameters L* and b*, where the conventional pork samples were darker and the organic pork yellower. Total protein content in meat of pigs raised in a conventional system was higher (22.23%) than for organic (20.36%) and traditional (21.21%). The fat content in the meat of organically reared pigs was higher (2.81%) than in pork from conventional and traditional systems (1.43% and 0.37%, respectively). Organic pork was more susceptible to oxidation processes due to its higher TBARS (1.24 mg/kg) and FFA (1.15% fat as oleic acid) values and lower antioxidant capacity (26.42% inhibition), which may result in inferior technological properties of meat.

AB  - Although Trichogramma principium (Sugonjaev & Sorokina) (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) is an effective natural enemy in agricultural ecosystems, its tri-trophic interactions should be investigated in more detail. In the present study, life table parameters of the parasitoid wasp and its population projection were investigated under controlled conditions (25 +/- 1 degrees C, 60 +/- 5% RH, and 16:8 h L:D) on Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). The herbivore was reared using three different cultivars, including Early Urbana, Super Strain-B, and Primo Early, as well as being treated with four nitrogen levels (0, 2100, 3000, and 3900 ppm). Data analysis was performed based on an age-stage two-sex life table by linking the life table parameters and population projection. Results indicated a significant increase in net reproductive rate (R-0) and intrinsic rate (r). Therefore, the fertilized treatments were relatively favorable hosts for the herbivore and consequently for the parasitoid wasps than unfertilized treatments. Population projection results also indicated differences in the stage population growth rate, age-staged population fluctuations and the parasitism capacity of the parasitoid. These findings indicated that linking life table and population projection is an appropriate method for clarifying the precise timing and the successful release of natural enemies.

AB  - Camelina [Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz] is an oilseed crop in the Brassicaceae family that is currently being developed as a source of bioenergy and healthy fatty acids. To facilitate modern breeding efforts through marker-assisted selection and biotechnology, we evaluated genetic variation among a worldwide collection of 222 camelina accessions. We performed whole-genome resequencing to obtain single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers and to analyze genomic diversity. We also conducted phenotypic field evaluations in two consecutive seasons for variations in key agronomic traits related to oilseed production such as seed size, oil content (OC), fatty acid composition, and flowering time. We determined the population structure of the camelina accessions using 161,301 SNPs. Further, we identified quantitative trait loci (QTL) and candidate genes controlling the above field-evaluated traits by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) complemented with linkage mapping using a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population. Characterization of the natural variation at the genome and phenotypic levels provides valuable resources to camelina genetic studies and crop improvement. The QTL and candidate genes should assist in breeding of advanced camelina varieties that can be integrated into the cropping systems for the production of high yield of oils of desired fatty acid composition.

AB  - The present research work investigates the impact of natural and anthropogenic inputs on the chemistry and quality of the groundwater in the Beenaganj-Chachura block of Madhya Pradesh, India. A total of 50 groundwater samples were examined for nitrates, fluoride, chlorides, total dissolved solids, calcium, magnesium, pH, total hardness, and conductivity, and their impact on entropy-weighted water quality index and pollution index of groundwater (PIG) was investigated via the response surface methodology (RSM) using the central composite design. According to analytical findings, Ca, Mg, Cl-, SO42-, and NO3- exceed the desired limit and permitted limit set by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) and the World Health Organization (WHO). According to PIG findings, 76, 16, and 8% of groundwater samples, respectively, fell into the insignificant, low, and moderate pollution categories. The regression coefficients of the quadratic RSM models for the experimental data provided excellent results. Thus, RSM provides an excellent means to obtain the optimized values of input parameters to minimize the PIG values.<br />

AB  - Hazardous accidents often happen in construction sites and bring fatal consequences, and therefore safety management has been a certain dilemma to construction managers for long time. Although computer vision technology has been used on construction sites to identify construction workers and track their movement trajectories for safety management, the detection effect is often influenced by limited coverage of single cameras and occlusion. A multi-angle fusion method applying SURF feature algorithm is proposed to coalesce the information processed by improved GMM (Gaussian Mixed Model) and HOG + SVM (Histogram of Oriented Gradient and Support Vector Machines), identifying the obscured workers and achieving a better detection effect with larger coverage. Workers are tracked in real-time, with their movement trajectory estimated by utilizing Kalman filters and safety status analyzed to offer a prior warning signal. Experimental studies are conducted for validation of the proposed framework for workers' detection and trajectories estimation, whose result indicates that the framework is able to detect workers and predict their movement trajectories for safety forewarning.

AB  - The immunotoxicity induced by heavy metals on herbivorous insects reflect the alterations of the susceptibility to entomopathogenic agents in herbivorous insects exposed to heavy metal. In the present study, the susceptibility of gypsy moth larvae to Bacillus thuringiensis under Cd treatment at low and high dosages was investigated, and the gut microbiome-hemolymph metabolome responses that affected larval disease susceptibility caused by Cd exposure were examined. Our results showed that mortality of gypsy moth larvae caused by B. thuringiensis was significantly higher in larvae pre-exposed to Cd stress, and there was a synergistic effect between Cd pre exposure and bacterial infection. Exposure to Cd significantly decreased the abundance of several probiotics (e.g., Serratia for the low Cd dosage and Weissella, Aeroonas, and Serratia for the high Cd dosage) and increased the abundances of several pathogenic bacteria (e.g., Stenotrophomonas, Gardnerella, and Cutibacterium for the low Cd dosage and Pluralibacter and Tsukamurella for the high Cd dosage) compared to the controls. Moreover, metabolomics analysis indicated that amino acid biosynthesis and metabolism were significantly perturbed in larval hemolymph under Cd exposure at both the low and high dosages. Correlation analysis demonstrated that several altered metabolites in larval hemolymph were significantly correlated with changes in the gut microbial community. The results demonstrate that prior exposure to Cd increases the susceptibility of gypsy moth larvae to B. thuringiensis in a synergistic fashion due to gut microbiota dysbiosis and hemolymph metabolic disorder, and thus microbial-based biological control may be the best pest control strategy in heavy metal-polluted areas.

AB  - Grain legumes are feedstuffs with high nutritional value that could replace soybean in dairy sheep nutrition. This could be beneficial in terms of economic efficiency and environmental sustainability. However, research regarding their potential effects on animal performance is scarce. The objective was to assess milk production and body condition score (BCS) of intensively reared dairy ewes after replacing soybean meal with a mixture of lupin, pea, vetch, and faba bean in their ration. A total of 40 Chios dairy ewes were randomly selected. They were allocated in two (n = 20) groups C and T; both were fed same amounts of Lucerne hay and wheat straw as well as a concentrate feed that was formulated with either inclusion of soybean meal for Group C or a mixture of legumes for Group T. Both feeds had equal energy and protein contents. Data collection was performed every 15 days for a 60-day period (a total of five measurements). In each measurement, ewe BCS was assessed, milk yield was recorded electronically, and individual milk samples were collected to assess chemical composition (fat, protein, lactose, and solids-non-fat content); energy corrected milk yield and milk components yield were calculated. Moreover, feed refusals from each group were weighed to calculate feed intake. Average individual daily concentrate feed intake was lower in Group T compared to C. Nutritional management did not significantly affect (p > 0.05) milk production and BCS. An exception was the last measurement where ewes in Group T had significantly (p < 0.05) higher milk protein, lactose and SNF yield, and lactose content. Results suggest that the studied legumes could replace soybean without compromising productivity of intensively reared dairy ewes.

AB  - Conversion of livestock manure to hydrochar through hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) could fix carbon and reduce pollution. The properties of hydrochar largely determined its application; thus, it is significant to comprehensively assess the manure-derived hydrochars (MHCs). However, relatively few systematic studies on MHCs are insufficient to support agricultural research on MHCs. This study investigated the basic properties, nutrient composition and speciation, and heavy metal content in pig/cattle manure and its MHCs (PCs and CCs). Results showed that MHCs were neutral and weakly acidic, which were milder than its alkalinity manure, and could not change the soil acidity too much when applied to the soil. After HTC, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) contents were enriched in CCs with 3.47-21.5% N and 69.6-135% P, and in PCs with 74.1-132% P. MHCs prepared at higher temperature had stronger resistance to degradation due to rich ash content, which was conducive to carbon sequestration as soil remediation agents. Besides, the MHCs with rich ash content could also supplement macro/micronutrients for plant growth. More calcium-bound P content (2.26-2.44 times for PCs, 4.78-5.38 times for CCs) suggested that HTC promoted P fixation in MHCs, further reduced nutrient loss, and relieved the eutrophication. Most concentrated heavy metals in MHCs were still up to the biochar-based organic fertilizer standard, which could not increase heavy metal risk compared with manure. Overall, the MHCs as energy-saving and value-added products with sufficient and balanced nutrients and limited heavy metal pollution risk, which can yield valuable agricultural potential. This research would provide theoretical support for the agricultural utilization of MHCs.

AB  - The metabolic effects of sugary drinks have been extensively studied, whereas the effects on psychological processes have received relatively limited attention. Several studies have found that high-sugar diets can produce impaired performance by rats on tests assessing spatial learning and memory. In contrast, despite claims that weakened inhibitory control underlies many sugar-induced deficits, evidence supporting this proposal has been limited. The aim of the present study was to assess the impact of high-sugar diets on response inhibition, as measured by rats' performance on a differential reinforcement of low rates schedule (DRL) in Experiments 1 and 2 and on a Pavlovian discrimination reversal task in Experiment 3. In all three experiments a 30-day diet stage, in which Sugar groups were given unrestricted access to 10% sucrose solution and Control groups had access to water only, was followed by behavioural tests. In Experiment 1 the Sugar group performed poorly on a spatial memory task, but no difference was detected between the performances of the two groups in the DRL test. In Experiment 2 longer DRL training was given and post-diet performance was assessed both before and after access to sugar was withdrawn. Null results were obtained under both conditions. In Experiment 3 rats' performance on a discrimination learned prior to the diet intervention was not affected by the high-sugar diet, but neither was performance once the discrimination was reversed. The implications of these results for understanding of sugar-induced psychological deficits are discussed.

AB  - Simple Summary China is an important country in the world for pig breeding and pork consumption, yet only two provinces have reported Entamoeba spp. infections. In this study, fecal samples of pigs with diarrhea were collected from three provinces in southern China, and Entamoeba spp. infection was detected by nested PCR. The results showed that the total infection rate was 58.4%. Entamoeba polecki and Entamoeba suis were detected. The ST1 and ST3 subtypes of Entamoeba polecki were detected, and a relatively serious mixed infection was found, with the most common form of mixed infection being Entamoeba polecki ST1 + Entamoeba polecki ST3. These findings provide baseline data for preventing and controlling Entamoeba spp. infection in southwestern China. Entamoeba spp. is a common zoonotic intestinal protozoan that can parasitize most vertebrates, including humans and pigs, causing severe intestinal diseases and posing a serious threat to public health. However, the available data on Entamoeba spp. infection in pigs are relatively limited in China. To characterize the infection of Entamoeba spp. within pigs in southern China, 1254 fecal samples of diarrheic pigs were collected from 37 intensive pig farms in Hunan, Jiangxi and Fujian provinces and the infection of Entamoeba spp. was investigated based on the small subunit rRNA (SSU rRNA) gene. The overall infection rate of Entamoeba spp. was 58.4% (732/1254), including 38.4% (118/307) in suckling piglets, 51.2% (153/299) in weaned piglets, 57.9% (55/95) in fattening pigs and 73.4% (406/553) in sows, respectively. Moreover, age and the sampling cities in Jiangxi and Fujian provinces were found to be the key factors influencing the infection of Entamoeba spp. (p < 0.05). Two subtypes (ST1 and ST3) with a zoonotic potential of Entamoeba polecki and Entamoeba suis were detected in all age groups of pigs and all sampling areas, with the predominant species and predominant subtype being E. polecki (91.3%, 668/732) and E. polecki ST1 (573/668), respectively, and E. polecki ST1 + E. polecki ST3 (78.6%, 239/304) being the most frequently detected form of mixed infection. Severe Entamoeba spp. infection and zoonotic subtypes were found in this study, exposing a large public health problem in the study area, and strategies need to be implemented to eliminate the risk in the future.

AB  - Integration of organic manures with biofertilizer consortium has emerged as a holistic and dynamic approach for long-term sustainability of agricultural systems. It involves maximum reliance on self-regulating biological processes and renewable resources. The present investigation was carried out during 2021-2023 to study the effect of organic manures and biofertilizers on phenological attributes, fruit set, fruit drop, yield and quality of purple passion fruit in Mizoram, north-east India. The treatments comprises of different doses of organic manures and biofertilizers viz T1: 100% recommended dose of fertilizers (RDF) through inorganic fertilizers, T2: farmyard manure (FYM) 100% RDF, T3: vermicompost (VC) 100% RDF, T4: pig manure (PIM) 100% RDF, T5: poultry manure (POM) 100% RDF, T6: FYM +Azospirillum + phosphate solubilizing bacteria (PSB) + potash solubilizing bacteria (KSB), T7: VC +Azospirillum + PSB + KSB, T8: PIM +Azospirillum + PSB + KSB, T9: POM + Azospirillum + PSB + KSB, T10: FYM +Azospirillum + PSB + KSB + VAM, T11: VC +Azospirillum + PSB + KSB + VAM, T12: PIM +Azospirillum + PSB + KSB + VAM, T13: POM + Azospirillum + PSB + KSB +VAM and T14: control. The maximum fruit set, fruit retention, yield per plant, minimum duration of fruiting and fruit drop was observed in T13 whereas for fruit physical and quality variables, T11 was found as best. It can be concluded that these two treatments may be recommended to achieve significant improvement in flowering and fruiting behavior and yield and quality of purple passion fruit.

AB  - Word learning is an iterative and dynamic process supported by multiple neural and cognitive systems. Converging evidence from behavioral, cellular, and systems neuroscience highlights sleep as an important support for memory and word learning over time. In many lab-based word learning experiments, participants encode and subsequently retrieve newly learned words in a single session. These designs are inadequate to capture the full dynamic word learning process, making them less ecologically valid. Single timepoint studies also limit investigation of the role of behavioral and lifestyle factors, like sleep, in supporting word learning over time. Adults with a history of traumatic brain injury (TBI), who commonly exhibit deficits in the memory systems that support word learning and report concomitant sleep disturbance, provide a unique opportunity to examine the link between memory, sleep, and word learning. Here we examined word learning over time and the in-fluence of sleep on short-and long-term word recall in 50 adults with chronic moderate-severe TBI and 50 demographically matched neurotypical peers. We used a randomized within-participant crossover design to assess immediate encoding of new words and the consolidation of those words over time across intervals that did or did not involve sleep. Participants completed this study over the course of two weeks in their own homes to capture the iterative, dynamic process of real-world word learning. We also measured sleep in free living con-ditions using actigraphy throughout the experiment. Participants with TBI exhibited a word learning deficit that began at encoding and persisted across time. Critically, this deficit grew over the course of the week. The per-formance gap between groups was larger at the 1-week post-test than the immediate post-test, suggesting deficits in both encoding and consolidation of new words in individuals with TBI. Participants with and without TBI remembered more words when they slept after learning. Ecologically valid research designs that examine the relationship between memory, sleep, and word learning over time promise to advance mechanistic accounts of word learning and improve the long-term retention of new words in individuals with and without brain injury.

AB  - Initially, the Rhinolophus hipposideros group was defined by two morphological traits, the structure of the nose-leaf and the shape of basioccipital bone of the skull. Originally, it consisted of two species, R. hipposideros and R. midas, whereas currently it is considered to contain a single species, R. hipposideros, under whose rank both original species have been joined. The interpretation of geographic variability within the group has traditionally been based on variation in body and skull size, nose-leaf shape, and several selected skull and tooth characters. This approach resulted in delimitations of up to seven subspecies, mostly in the Mediterranean area, a conception introduced more than a hundred years ago and accepted by many authors till today. We investigated the phylogenetic relationships among populations of R. hipposideros with the help of molecular genetic, morphological, and acoustic examinations. Our analysis uncovered the existence of an unexpected diversity within the R. hipposideros group, challenging its current phylogenetic and taxonomic arrangements. The molecular genetic analysis of almost 100 samples and morphological examinations of about 300 specimens showed two main, geographically exclusive, phylogenetic lineages within the group, well delimited by molecular characteristics and possessing two distinct morphotypes and two distinct echotypes. These two lineages are isolated deep enough to be considered separate species. One of them, R. hipposideros s.str., is widespread over the south-western Eurasia and north-western and north-eastern Africa, and the other, R. midas, is distributed in a small range around the Strait of Hormuz and Gulf of Oman. The extensive range of R. hipposideros s.str. is inhabited at least by two subspecies, separated mainly by the genetic characters, whereas the morphological and echolocation traits do not distinguish the populations sufficiently. The western R. h. hipposideros occurs in the Maghreb and Europe west of the Dnieper River, Bosporus, and the Strait of Karpathos, and the eastern R. h. minimus lives east of this boundary, including the populations of Crimea, Caucasus, the Middle East, and north-eastern Africa (Sudan to Djibouti). The two subspecies also differ in karyotype, with 2n = 58 in R. h. minimus and 2n = 54-56 in R. h. hipposideros. The taxonomic position of the easternmost populations of R. hipposideros s.str. (West Turkestan, Afghanistan, Kashmir) remains unresolved and has to be investigated more elaborately and using a more extensive sample set.

   The aim of this study was to determine the effect of partial and total replacement of protein from genetically modified soybean meal (GM-SBM) with protein from 00-rapeseed meal (00-RSM), alone or in combination with protein from low-tannin faba bean seeds (FB) or low-alkaloid yellow lupine seeds (YL) in grower-finisher diets on nutrient digestibility, nitrogen retention, and utilization, selected blood biochemical parameters and fattening performance of pigs. During two-phase fattening, hybrid Danbred growing-finishing pigs were fed grower diets where 50% of GM-SBM protein was replaced with 00-RSM protein, 00-RSM and FB protein or 00-RSM and YL protein, and finisher diets where 100% of GM-SBM protein was totally replaced with 00-RSM protein, and with 50% 00-RSM and FB protein or YL protein. It was found that GM-SBM protein can be partially (50% in grower diets) and totally (100% in finisher diets) replaced with 00-RSM protein (6%) combined with protein from low-tannin FB seeds (10%/12%) or low-alkaloid YL seeds (6%/7%) in pig diets. The evaluated diets contributed to high nutrient digestibility and N retention and improved fattening performance without compromising the health status of pigs.
   The aim of this study was to determine the effect of partial and total replacement of protein from genetically modified soybean meal (GM-SBM) with protein from 00-rapeseed meal (00-RSM), alone or in combination with protein from low-tannin faba bean (Vicia faba L.) seeds (FB) or low-alkaloid yellow lupine (Lupinus luteus L.) seeds (YL) in grower-finisher diets on nutrient digestibility, nitrogen retention and utilization, selected blood biochemical parameters, fattening performance of pigs and carcass quality traits. Two digestibility-balance trials and one feeding trial were performed during two-phase fattening on male hybrid Danbred growing-finishing pigs were divided into four groups. The pigs were fed grower diets where 50% of GM-SBM protein (diet S-c) was replaced with 00-RSM protein (diet R), 00-RSM and FB protein (diet R + FB) or 00-RSM and YL protein (diet R + YL), and finisher diets where 100% of GM-SBM protein (diet S-c) was totally replaced with 00-RSM protein (diet R), and with 00-RSM and FB protein (diet R + FB) or YL protein (diet R + YL) in 50%. It was found that partial (50% in grower diets) and total (100% in finisher diets) replacement of GM-SBM protein with 00-RSM protein combined with FB or YL protein had no adverse effect on nutrient and energy digestibility, N balance, serum of blood carbohydrate and protein metabolism or the biochemical parameters of liver and kidney function. Protein from 00-RSM (6%) and FB seeds (10%/12%) contributed to high daily gains and high feed conversion efficiency. Protein from 00-RSM (6%) and YL seeds (6%/7%) in grower-finisher diets led to a further improvement in fattening performance. The analyzed vegetable protein sources had no negative influence on carcass quality. The results of the present study indicate that 00-RSM protein combined with protein from low-tannin FB or low-alkaloid YL seeds can be valuable high-protein feed ingredients alternative to GM-SBM in pig nutrition.

AB  - Controlled indoor cultivation of duckweed plants can support remediation of wastewaters through generation of plant biomass. Despite numerous advantages, indoor cultivation of duckweeds on agri-food wastewaters remains underexplored. Lighting regimes need to be optimised for duckweed growth and affordability of energy consumption, as it has been shown that the composition of wastewater growth medium can alter light utilisation. In the present study, four duckweed (Lemna minor) clones were grown under four different light regimes on either optimised half-strength Hutner's medium or wastewater derived from the liquid fractions of anaerobically digested pig slurry. Cultivation of L. minor was assessed for the four light regimes using a commercial hydroponics plant growth medium in a 3.96 m2 multitiered cultivation system. When cultivated on optimised half-strength Hutner's medium or diluted pig slurry under laboratory conditions, it appeared that photoperiod rather than light intensity was more important for duckweed growth. Yet, under moderate flow conditions within a larger scale multitiered cultivation system, greater light intensity appeared to support duckweed cultivation irrespective of photoperiod. These findings emphasise the need to move beyond small-scale and static assessments of duckweed before embarking on larger, industry-relevant scales.

TI  - Preparation of antioxidant peptides from yak skin gelatin and their protective effect on myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury
T2  - FOOD & FUNCTION
LA  - English
AB  - We herein report a study on the antioxidant peptides that show potential in alleviating myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury (MI/RI). Yak skin gelatin fraction Ac (YSG-Ac), obtained through ultrafiltration and gel filtration with Sephadex G-15, exhibits a favorable nutrient composition, high foaming capacity and stability, and resistance against gastrointestinal digestion. LC-MS/MS analysis reveals that YSG-Ac contains 26 peptide segments with sequence lengths of 8 to 12 amino acids. Online screening suggests that the antioxidant capacity of YSG-Ac is mainly attributed to the presence of hydrophobic and antioxidant amino acids. In vitro, our results demonstrate the MI/RI protective effects of YSG-Ac by effectively repairing H2O2-induced oxidative damage in H9c2 cells, which is achieved by inhibiting malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, and increasing glutathione peroxidase (GSH-pX) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. In vivo, our results further confirm the effectiveness of YSG-Ac in narrowing the area of myocardial infarction, decreasing MDA levels, increasing SOD activity, and reducing the content of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in a mouse MI/RI model. Molecular docking analysis indicates that PGADGQPGAK with xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH) and GAAGPTGPIGS with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) exhibit strong bonding capability, and other related targets also show certain binding ability toward YSG-Ac. This suggests that YSG-Ac can regulate MI/RI through multiple targets and pathways. Overall, our findings highlight the potential of YSG-Ac as a functional food ingredient with antioxidant and MI/RI protective characteristics.

AB  - Neural components enabling flexible cognition and behavior are well-established, and depend mostly on proper intercommunication within the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and striatum. However, dense projections from the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) alter the functioning of the medial PFC (mPFC). Dysfunctional hippocampoprefrontal connectivity negatively affects the integrity of flexible cognition, especially in patients with schizophrenia. In this study, we aimed to test the role of the vHPC and mPFC in a place avoidance task on a rotating arena using two spatial flexibility task variants - reversal learning and set-shifting. To achieve this, we inactivated each of these structures in adult male Long-Evans rats by performing bilateral local muscimol (a GABAA receptor agonist) injections. A significantly disrupted performance was observed in reversal learning in the vHPC-inactivated, but not in the mPFC-inactivated rats. These results confirm the notion that the vHPC participates in some forms of behavioral flexibility, especially when spatial cues are needed. It seems, rather unexpectedly, that the mPFC is not taxed in these flexibility tasks on a rotating arena.

AB  - The molecular mechanisms underlying the diversity of cortical glutamatergic synapses are still incompletely understood. Here, we tested the hypothesis that presynaptic active zones (AZs) are constructed from molecularly uniform, independent release sites (RSs), the number of which scales linearly with the AZ size. Paired recordings between hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells and fast-spiking interneurons in acute slices from adult mice followed by quantal analysis demonstrate large variability in the number of RSs (N) at these connections. High-resolution molecular analysis of functionally characterized synapses reveals variability in the content of one of the key vesicle priming factors - Munc13-1 - in AZs that possess the same N. Replica immunolabeling also shows a threefold variability in the total Munc13-1 content of AZs of identical size and a fourfold variability in the size and density of Munc13-1 clusters within the AZs. Our results provide evidence for quantitative molecular heterogeneity of RSs and support a model in which the AZ is built up from variable numbers of molecularly heterogeneous, but independent RSs.

AB  - Prion diseases result from the misfolding of the physiological prion protein (PrPC) to a pathogenic conformation (PrPSc). Compelling evidence indicates that prevention and/or reduction of PrPSc replication are promising therapeutic strategies against prion diseases. However, the existence of different PrPSc conformations (or strains) associated with disease represents a major problem when identifying anti-prion compounds. Efforts to identify strain-specific anti-prion molecules are limited by the lack of biologically relevant high-throughput screening platforms to interrogate compound libraries. Here, we describe adaptations to the protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) technology (able to faithfully replicate PrPSc strains) that increase its throughput to facilitate the screening of anti-prion molecules. The optimized PMCA platform includes a reduction in sample and reagents, as well as incubation/sonication cycles required to efficiently replicate and detect rodent-adapted and cervid PrPSc strains. The visualization of PMCA products was performed via dot blots, a method that contributed to reduced processing times. These technical changes allowed us to evaluate small molecules with previously reported anti-prion activity. This proof-of-principle screening was evaluated for six rodent-adapted prion strains. Our data show that these compounds targeted either none, all or some PrPSc strains at variable concentrations, demonstrating that this PMCA system is suitable to test compound libraries for putative anti-prion molecules targeting specific PrPSc strains. Further analyses of a small compound library against deer prions demonstrate the potential of this new PMCA format to identify strain-specific anti-prion molecules. The data presented here demonstrate the use of the PMCA technique in the selection of prion strain-specific anti-prion compounds.

AB  - A calcium-dependent protein kinase positively regulates flowering time and negatively regulates resistance to the common cutworm in soybean and was artificially selected during domestication.
   Photoperiod-sensitive plants such as soybean (Glycine max) often face threats from herbivorous insects throughout their whole growth period and especially during flowering; however, little is known about the relationship between plant flowering and insect resistance. Here, we used gene editing, multiple omics, genetic diversity and evolutionary analyses to confirm that the calcium-dependent protein kinase GmCDPK38 plays a dual role in coordinating flowering time regulation and insect resistance of soybean. Haplotype 2 (Hap2)-containing soybeans flowered later and were more resistant to the common cutworm (Spodoptera litura Fabricius) than those of Hap3. gmcdpk38 mutants with Hap3 knocked out exhibited similar flowering and resistance phenotypes as Hap2. Knocking out GmCDPK38 altered numerous flowering- and resistance-related phosphorylated proteins, genes, and metabolites. For example, the S-adenosylmethionine synthase GmSAMS1 was post-translationally upregulated in the gmcdpk38 mutants. GmCDPK38 has abundant genetic diversity in wild soybeans and was likely selected during soybean domestication. We found that Hap2 was mostly distributed at low latitudes and had a higher frequency in cultivars than in wild soybeans, while Hap3 was widely selected at high latitudes. Overall, our results elucidated that the two distinct traits (flowering time and insect resistance) are mediated by GmCDPK38.

AB  - Background: The Norwegian sheep farming system relies on forages, such as grass silage during winter and grazing cultivated leys and rangeland pastures during summer. Sheep and other ruminants produce enteric methane (CH4), a greenhouse gas of interest, and there is a need for reliable data on gas emissions from sheep capturing both the indoor feeding period and the grazing season. This study utilized an in vitro gas technique (with standard cow rumen fluid) and modeling approach to estimate CH4 production and fermentation patterns based on two different qualities of Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum) pasture under sheep grazing. Results: Herbage quality was examined for two 10-day periods, in July and August. Differences in chemical composition of the herbage during these periods had an impact on herbage digestibility and CH4 production. Total gas production and CH4 levels were significantly higher for lower quality herbage grazed in July than for higher quality herbage grazed in August (p < 0.005). Production of volatile fatty acids in the rumen remained constant between the two periods, but the higher acetate to propionate (A/P) ratio correlated with the higher CH4 production. Conclusion: These findings suggest that pasture quality is an important factor to consider when implementing grazing strategies to reduce enteric CH4 production in sheep.

AB  - Oxidative stress is a significant factor in the death of granulosa cells (GCs), leading to follicular atresia and consequently limiting the number of dominant follicles that can mature and ovulate within each follicular wave. Follicular fluid contains a diverse array of metabolites that play crucial roles in regulating GCs' proliferation and oocyte maturation, which are essential for follicle development and female fertility. However, the mechanisms behind metabolite heterogeneity and its effects on GCs' function remain poorly understood. Here, we identified elevated nicotinamide levels in the follicular fluid of high-prolificacy sheep, correlated with oxidative stress in GCs, by an integrated analysis. In vitro experiments demonstrated that supplementation with beta-nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) significantly increased the levels of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in GCs. NMN treatment effectively reduced Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced apoptosis and mitigated mitochondrial dysfunction, while also decreasing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby enhancing the activity of the antioxidant defense system. Importantly, NMN treatment improved the impairments in steroid hormone levels induced by LPS. Mechanistically, the protective effects of NMN against GCs function were mediated via the AMPK/mTOR pathway. Collectively, our findings elucidate the metabolic characteristics associated with sheep prolificacy and demonstrate that NMN effectively protects GCs from LPS-induced dysfunction and enhances ovarian responsiveness via the AMPK/mTOR pathway. These findings also position NMN as a potential novel metabolic biomarker in enhancing ovarian function.

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNA) plays an important role in several mammalian biological regulatory processes by post-transcriptionally regulating gene expression. However, there is little information on the miRNAs involved in the photoperiodism pathway that controls seasonal activity. To enhance our knowledge on the effect of different photoperiod conditions on miRNA, we divided Kazakh sheep into two groups: one exposed to a long photoperiod (LP, 16L:8D) and another with exposed to a short photoperiod (SP, 8L:16D) under supplemental feeding conditions. Further we compared the related miRNAs and target genes between the two groups. Fifteen differentially expressed miRNAs were identified, which were associated with 310 regulatory pathways covering photoperiodism, reproductive hormones, and nutrition. The miR-136-GNAQ pair was selected and validated as a differentially expressed, and a dual-luciferase reporter assay showed that the negative feedback loop existed between them. Examination of the expression profile revealed that the GNAQ expression was low in the estrous females both under LP and SP conditions, but high expression of GNAQ was observed in the anestrous females under LP conditions. Moreover, functional analysis revealed that KISS1 and GnRH expression was upregulated when GNAQ expression was downregulated in the hypothalamic cells, whereas DIO2 and TSHB expression was downregulated. Thus, miR-136-GNAQ might act as a switch in the regulation of seasonal estrus under different photoperiod conditions. These findings further enrich our understanding of the relationship between miRNAs and seasonal regulation of reproductive activity. Furthermore, our study provides novel insights into the miRNA-mediated regulatory mechanisms for overcoming photoinhibition in the seasonally breeding mammals, such as Kazakh sheep.

AB  - Participatory variety selection (PVS) is a process that tests promising genotypes in farmers' fields through a close farmer-researcher collaboration approach, which enhances the acceptance of new varieties by farmers. However, limited studies have been conducted to select Amaranthus genotypes that have potential for future breeding programmes in South Africa. Therefore, this study was aimed at selecting Amaranthus genotype(s) that is/are preferred by farmers in northern KwaZulu-Natal, using the PVS approach. Seedlings of fifteen Amaranthus genotypes were each planted in separate 10 x 10 m plots. Fourteen local farmers managed these genotypes and also determined the preferred traits to be used to evaluate them. These traits were: mild taste; profuse stem branching; big and numerous leaves; soft texture; and longer shelf life. Plants at four months after transplant were then evaluated and ranked according to farmers' preferred traits using score sheets designed on a four-point Likert scale or five-point hedonic scale. However, genotype ACAT seed fair had the best scoring for appealing taste and aroma, and profuse branching. The TOT 8789 genotype had the largest and softest leaves. Again, A. thunbergii had the most numerous leaves of them all. These genotypes are thus recommended for multi-environment testing, seed multiplication, genetic improvement, and promotion for cultivation in South Africa.

AB  - The Ryukyu Archipelago represents the northern distribution limit for hydrophiine sea snakes, the largest group of marine reptiles. Ryukyuan sea snakes may have developed distinct local adaptations in morphology and ecology, but they have been poorly studied. We examined preserved specimens of 111 Hydrophis melanocephalus and 61 Hydrophis ornatusf rom the Ryukyu Archipelago to obtain data on morphology, diet, and reproduction. Sexual size dimorphism was detected in H. melanocephalus (meant standard deviation of adult snout-vent length: SVL, females 1062 +/- 141 mm vs. males 959 +/- 96 mm) but not in H. ornatus. Female H. melanocephalus had larger head widths and shorter tail lengths relative to SVL compared to males. Relative girth was low in neonates of both species (1.0-1.3), but increased in adults to about 1.7-2.6 in H. melanocephalus and 1.3-1.8 in female H. ornatus. Stomach contents of H. melanocephalus consisted of ophichthid and congrid eels, a sand diver, and gobies, whereas in H. ornatus, gobies and a goat fish were found. Litter size of three reproductive H. melanocephalus ranged from five to seven, and parturition seems to occur from August to October. Litter size of six H. ornatus ranged from two to seven, and was correlated with maternal SVL. Parturition in H. ornatus probably occurs around November. Different selective forces related to locomotion, feeding and predation risk, which influence the pregnant mother and neonates, may have resulted in having few, long but slender offspring that show positive allometric growth in hind-body girth.

AB  - Elucidating the regulatory factors that affect intramuscular fat (IMF) is essential for pork quality enhancement. While the psoas major muscle (PMM), as a prototypical oxidative muscle fiber, demonstrates exceptional tenderness and favorable sensory attributes, the molecular mechanisms governing IMF content and meat quality divergence remain to be exhaustively detailed. We conducted a systematic comparative transcriptomic analysis of the PMM between low- and high-IMF indigenous Chinese Saba pigs to investigate PMM IMF-specific differences in meat quality. We found that the high-IMF pigs exhibited significantly elevated saturated fatty acid and (mono)unsaturated fatty acid content. We also identified key genes governing adipose tissue accumulation in PMM and influencing meat quality that regulate fat deposition in PMM and overall pork quality. Our findings delineate key biomarkers and develop molecular regulatory networks associated with fat metabolism in skeletal muscle, thereby establishing a foundation for a comprehensive investigation into the molecular mechanisms that govern pork IMF deposition. The psoas major muscle (PMM) is a piece of pork with good tenderness and high value. Intramuscular fat (IMF) content, serving as a pivotal indicator of pork quality, varies greatly among pigs within the same breed. However, there is a paucity of studies focusing on investigating the molecular mechanism of PMM IMF deposition in the same pig breed. The present study aimed to identify the potential genes related to the IMF content of PMM in low- and high-IMF Saba pigs based on transcriptome data analysis. The data used in this study were the RNA sequences of PMM from 12 Saba pigs (PRJNA1223630, from our laboratory) and gene expression profiles (GSE207279) acquired from the NCBI Sequence Read Archive database and the GEO database, respectively, together with data on the fatty acid and amino acid composition of the 12 Saba pigs' PMM. It was found that the high-IMF pigs exhibited significantly elevated levels of saturated fatty acids and (mono)unsaturated fatty acids, especially C14:0, C16:0, C20:0, C16:1, C18:1n9c, and C20:2, compared with those in the low-IMF pigs (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01). A total of 370 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (221 up- and 149 down-regulated) were identified based on PRJNA1223630. Then, 20 hub genes were identified through protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis. Four potential fat-deposition-related genes (DGAT2, PCK1, MELK, and FASN) were further screened via the intersection of the candidate genes identified by the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) algorithm and the top five genes ranked by the Random Forest (RF) method based on the 20 hub genes and were validated in the test gene set (GSE207279). The constructed mRNA (gene)-miRNA-lncRNA network, involving miRNAs (miR-103a-3p, miR-107, and miR-485-5p), lncRNAs (XIST, NEAT1, and KCNQ1OT1), and FASN, might be crucial for IMF deposition in pigs. These findings might delineate valuable regulatory molecular mechanisms coordinating IMF deposition and could serve as a beneficial foundation for the genetic improvement of pork quality.

AB  - The enormous generation of fecal sludge without proper treatment is a major sanitation problem. Vermicomposting of fecal sludge is an innovative way of producing value added compost called vermicompost. A vermicomposting technique that involves augmenting vermibed substrates with organic rich materials to provide additional nutrients and underlying layers needed for microcosm development to produce desirable vermicompost is mostly referred to as substrate enrichment. This study investigated the substrate enrichment of using plant-derived materials, which include coconut coir, palm coir and saw dust, combined with agricultural soil for the production of vermicompost from fecal sludge. Enriched substrates were prepared with 80 g of agricultural soil as amending material, 120 g of fecal matter (65-70% dry matter) and 160 g of the plant-derived materials. The treatments were labeled T1-T3, thus, T1 contained coconut coir, T2 contained palm coir and T3 contained saw dust, followed by a control treatment (T4) that had no plant-derived material. Treatments were triplicated and about 3-week-old 20 clitellated, E. fetida (live weight similar to 255-275 mg) were used in the vermicomposting for 12 wk. Physicochemical parameters such as pH, Organic Carbon (Corg), Total Nitrogen (Ntot), Available Phosphorus (Pavail), Exchangeable Calcium (Caexch), Iron (Fe), Lead (Pb) and Aluminum (Al) test were performed. Vermicompost at T1 had the most Corg mineralization, most enhancement in Ntot, Pavail, Caexch, and least concentration of Fe, Pb and Al. Less than 20% earthworm mortality was recorded in all treatments except T4 (28.38 +/- 8.71%). The enriched substrates were suitable for vermiculture with a worm weight ranged from 593.77 to 569.39 +/- 2.30 mg and the vermicompost recorded high nutrient contents. The nutritious nature and the reduced metal concentration of the produced vermicompost might be safe and productive for agricultural use. However, further studies on the effectiveness of the vermicompost on plants growth and yield needs to be investigated.

AB  - Simple Summary Alpine Merino sheep are a new breed of sheep adapted to the cold and arid ecological zone 2400-4070 m above sea level; the breed has important economic significance for high-altitude areas. This study evaluated the effects of different dietary energy levels (9.7 MJ/kg, 10.1 MJ/kg, 10.5 MJ/kg) on the growth and meat quality of weaned Alpine Merino lambs. The results showed that compared with the low-energy diet (9.7 MJ/kg), the high-energy (10.5 MJ/kg) diet promoted the growth and development of lambs, increased the live weight and carcass weight of lambs before slaughter, significantly reduced the yellowness and redness scores of lamb muscles, and increased the meat's content of monounsaturated fatty acids.Abstract This experiment was conducted to study the effects of dietary energy level on the growth performance and meat quality of weaned Alpine Merino lambs. The study ran for a total of 104 days (20-day pretrial, 84-day trial). From three groups of test lambs, we randomly selected ten lambs per group to determine slaughter performance, meat quality characteristics, and organ indexes. The slaughter performances of the lambs improved as the dietary energy level increased. The live weight before the slaughter of the lambs was significantly higher in the high group than in the low and medium groups. The carcass weight was significantly higher in the high group than in the low group. Dietary energy level had little effect on the organ weight of lambs. Meat quality differed among the three dietary energy levels. The muscle yellowness and redness scores decreased significantly as the energy levels increased. The C18:0, C21:0, C20:1, C18:2n6c, and C20:2 contents in the muscle were significantly higher in the high group than in the medium and low groups. The C18:3n6 content in the muscle was significantly higher in the low group than in the medium group. The C20:5n3 content in the longissimus dorsi was significantly higher in the high group than in the medium and low groups. The monounsaturated and unsaturated fatty acid contents in the muscle were significantly higher in the high group than in the low group.

AB  - Formaldehyde is a key Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) and ozone precursor that plays a vital role in the urban atmospheric radical budget on par with water vapor, ozone, and nitrous acid. In addition to modulating radical and ozone production, ambient formaldehyde has both carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic inhalation health effects. This study concludes that ambient formaldehyde in the Southeast Michigan (SEMI) ozone nonattainment area may be underestimated up to a factor of two or more by regional air quality models. The addition of plausible amounts of primary formaldehyde to the U.S. National Emissions Inventory based on estimated formaldehyde-to-CO emission ratios partially alleviates this modeling deficit and indicates the presence of formaldehyde concentrations above 5 ppb at a previously unsuspected location northeast of Detroit. Standard 24-h formaldehyde samples obtained during the Michigan-Ontario Ozone Source Experiment (MOOSE) verified the presence of high ambient formaldehyde concentrations at this location. Moreover, the addition of plausible amounts of primary formaldehyde to VOC emissions inventories may add more than 1 ppb of ozone to ambient air in the SEMI nonattainment area, where ozone design values exceeded the U.S. National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) by 1-2 ppb for the 2018-2020 design value period.

AB  - Sorting nexin 4 (SNX4) is an evolutionary conserved organizer of membrane recycling. In neurons, SNX4 accumulates in synapses, but how SNX4 affects synapse function remains unknown. We generated a conditional SNX4 knock-out mouse model and report that SNX4 cKO synapses show enhanced neurotransmission during train stimulation, while the first evoked EPSC was normal. SNX4 depletion did not affect vesicle recycling, basic autophagic flux, or the levels and localization of SNARE-protein VAMP2/synaptobrevin-2. However, SNX4 depletion affected synapse ultrastructure: an increase in docked synaptic vesicles at the active zone, while the overall vesicle number was normal, and a decreased active zone length. These effects together lead to a substantially increased density of docked vesicles per release site. In conclusion, SNX4 is a negative regulator of synaptic vesicle docking and release. These findings suggest a role for SNX4 in synaptic vesicle recruitment at the active zone.

AB  - Mild cognitive deterioration, or minor cognitive impairment, is characterized by a decline in mental abilities without affecting daily functional independence; at the neurobiological level, the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus are often the first affected. Recent research highlights the role of the hippocampus in tactile processing, with the loss of tactile skills appearing as early signs of impairment. The relationship between tactile deterioration and cognitive decline may be attributed to neurodegenerative aging processes involving neuronal plasticity and synaptic density alterations, affecting both sensory and cognitive systems. Consequently, loss of tactile information could serve as an early indicator of cognitive decline, enabling timely interventions to delay the onset of dementia. Encouraging physical activities involving tactile feedback may further support cognitive health and overall well-being in older adults.

AB  - Tea plant cultivation has been demonstrated to change the physicochemical properties of soils and metal bioavailability. The present study reported the geochemistry of four selected metals (Fe, Mn, Cr, and Ni) in lateritic soil cores regarding various depths cultivated with tea plants of different ages (3, 6, and 10 years old). The ecological risk and bioaccumulation of these metals in tea plants were also evaluated. The results indicate the acidic property of tea plant cultivation soils (pH < 4.5) and highlight further soil acidification due to long-term cultivation. The soils were strongly affected by farming methods and showed high levels (average from all soil cores) of total organic carbon contents (4.0% w/w), total nitrogen (2806 mg kg(-1)), and total phosphorus (1730 mg kg(-1)). We suggest that the selected metals originated naturally, supported by a high percentage in residual fractions from the results of soil sequential extraction (over 95% for Mn, Fe, and Ni and similar to 90% for Cr). These metals exhibited no ecological risk to the adjacent environment. Mn showed the highest bioavailability, possibly due to the acidic soils and nitrogen fertiliser applications, increasing the release of Mn from soils. Mn also exhibited the highest bioconcentration factor (BCF) among four metals and 2.4 divided by 6.5-folds higher BCFs in tea leaves than in roots. Despite the dominant content of Fe in soils (average of 20% w/w), Fe indicated lower amounts in tea leaves than Mn (average of 513 mg kg(-1)vs 1354 mg kg(-1)). This could be attributed to the formation of Fe-rich root coatings on the tea plant root surface as a barrier to prevent Fe from translocating to other higher tea plant parts. Ni and Cr, as potentially toxic metals, were found at the lowest contents in tea leaves with low BCFs, indicating consumer safety in terms of exposure by these metals.

AB  - Background The fire at the Intercontinental Terminals Company (ITC, Deer Park, La Porte, TX, USA) from March 17 to 20, 2019 resulted in substantial releases of chemical contaminants to the environment, including the surface waters of the Houston Ship Channel. Objective To characterize spatial and temporal trends, as well as potential human health risks, from these releases. Methods Out of 433 substances with available data, seven were selected for analysis: benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes, oil and grease, suspended solids, and total petroleum hydrocarbons. Spatial and temporal concentration trends were characterized, and hazard quotients and cancer risks were calculated to estimate the potential for human health impacts from these contaminants. Results Temporal analysis showed presence of these chemical contaminants in water immediately after the event; their concentrations dissipated substantially within 4 weeks. The spatial distribution of contaminants indicated the highest concentrations in the waterways within about 1 km of the ITC. The greatest potential human health risks stemmed from presence of benzene. Significance A short-term but substantial spike in the concentrations of a number of hazardous contaminants occurred near the incident, with concentrations returning to apparent baseline levels within 1 month likely due to a combination of volatization, dilution and degradation.

AB  - Bordetella bronchiseptica is a significant contributor to respiratory disease in pigs, leading to substantial economic losses in the swine industry worldwide. We isolated 52 B. bronchiseptica strains from 542 samples collected from pigs with atrophic rhinitis and bronchopneumonia in central China. Multi-locus sequence typing identified two prevalent sequence types: ST6 (69.23%) and ST7 (30.77%). PCR-based detection of seven virulence genes (fhaB, prn, cyaA, dnt, bteA, fla, and bfrZ) revealed that six of these genes were present in over 90% of the isolates, with bfrZ being the exception at 59.62%. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing, performed using the K-B method, demonstrated high sensitivity to enrofloxacin, polymyxin, and doxycycline but a notable resistance to tylosin, trimethoprim, tobramycin, ciprofloxacin, and amikacin. Remarkably, 86.54% of the isolates exhibited a multidrug-resistant phenotype. Notably, we successfully screened a strain of B. bronchiseptica with a heteroresistance phenotype to gentamicin using population analysis profiling, which is a rare case. Biofilm-formation assays indicated that 96.15% of the isolates possessed biofilm-forming capabilities. These findings provide crucial insights into the prevalence of B. bronchiseptica in central China, facilitating the development of effective preventive measures to safeguard both animal and human health.

AB  - Background: Asthma exacerbations are an important cause of emergency department visits but much remains unknown about the role of environmental triggers including viruses and allergenic pollen. A better understanding of spatio-temporal variation in exposure and risk posed by viruses and pollen types could help prioritize public health interventions. Objective: Here we quantify the effects of regionally important Cupressaceae pollen, tree pollen, other pollen types, rhinovirus, seasonal coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza on asthma-related emergency department visits for people living near eight pollen monitoring stations in Texas. Methods: We used age stratified Poisson regression analyses to quantify the effects of allergenic pollen and viruses on asthma-related emergency department visits. Results: Young children (<5 years of age) had high asthma-related emergency department rates (24.1 visits/ 1,000,000 person-days), which were mainly attributed to viruses (51.2%). School-aged children also had high rates (20.7 visits/1,000,000 person-days), which were attributed to viruses (57.0%), Cupressaceae pollen (0.7%), and tree pollen (2.8%). Adults had lower rates (8.1 visits/1,000,000 person-days) which were attributed to viruses (25.4%), Cupressaceae pollen (0.8%), and tree pollen (2.3%). This risk was spread unevenly across space and time; for example, during peak Cuppressaceae season, this pollen accounted for 8.2% of adult emergency department visits near Austin where these plants are abundant, but 0.4% in cities like Houston where they are not; results for other age groups were similar. Conclusions: Although viruses are a major contributor to asthma-related emergency department visits, airborne pollen can explain a meaningful portion of visits during peak pollen season and this risk varies over both time and space because of differences in plant composition.

AB  - Hyperthermia is a therapeutic technique in which body tissue is exposed to temperatures in the region of 40-45 degrees C to induce a physiological or biological effect. Swarming motility is an important virulence factor for Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and swarming phenomenon is a coordinated multicellular move-ment of differentiated bacterial population over semi-solid surfaces. In this study, we aimed to investigate the inhibitory effect of hyperthermia on bacterial swarming motility using a modified thermobiogram method and show the potential of this thermal method to treat bacterial infections. Ten P. mirabilis and 10 P. aeruginosa clinical isolates were included in the study. Sheep blood agar (SBA) plates were prepared and inoculated with bacterial suspensions of clinical isolates. Inoculated SBA plates were incubated inside 2 different incubators; at 37 degrees C and 45 degrees C for 20 h. The diameter of bacterial growing zones (swarming diameters) were measured every 2 h and noted. Finally, Gram stains of the isolates were prepared for microscopic examination. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare the swarming inhibition rates of the isolates incubated at 37 degrees C and 45 degrees C. Regarding P. mirabilis species, a significant difference was found between two different temperatures (P = 0.0078). So, a temperature at the level of hyperthermia significantly inhibited the swarming motility of P. mirabilis isolates. In addition, transformation to coccus form was observed at 45 degrees C. We speculate that these findings might be useful for employing thermal therapies including hyperthermia method to treat infectious diseases caused by swarming bacterial pathogens in the future.

AB  - In this study, we investigated the length-dependent escape of groundfish underneath a commercial bottom trawl. Escaped fish were captured in three collecting bags (center (bosom) and wings (port and starboard)) mounted underneath the fishing line and behind the rockhopper footgear and compared to fish that were captured in the codend. Generally, how fish escaped under the trawl was often species-specific and differed according to size. For roundfish, length-dependent escape was pronounced for Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), whiting (Merlangius merlangus), and blue ling (Molva dypterygia) with the proportion of escapes decreasing as fish length increased. However, saithe (Pollachius virens) showed limited a length-based effect and redfish (Sebastes spp.) none. For flatfish, the escape proportion of American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides) and dab (Limanda limanda) decreased as fish length increased. However, European plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) had a very small length effect. Monkfish (Lophius piscatorius) escape decreased with size. However, monkfish retention probability remained less than 30% at the largest lengths observed. Differences in escape proportion between day and night were found for Atlantic cod, haddock, and dab, but not for other species. Small Atlantic cod and haddock escaped more often at night, and mid-sized dab (between 18 and 30 cm) escaped more often during the day. Results show that overall trawl selectivity is strongly affected at the trawl mouth, particularly for small fish of specific species.

AB  - Harnessing the potential yields of evergreen perennial crops like tea (Camellia sinensis L.) essentially requires the application of optimum doses of nutrients based on the soil test reports. In the present study, the soil pH, organic carbon (OC), available potassium as K2O (AK), and available sulphur (AS) of 7300 soil samples from 115 tea estates spread over the Dooars ranging from 88 degrees 52'E to 89 degrees 86'E longitude and 26 degrees 45'N to 27 degrees 00'N latitude of West Bengal, India have been documented. About 54% of soil samples were found within the optimum range of soil pH (4.50-5.50) for tea cultivation. The overall range of OC was found from 0.28% to 6.00% of which, 94% of the analyzed samples were within the range of satisfactory to excellent level of OC i.e. (>0.80% to 6.00%). Around 36.3% of soil samples were found to have high AK (>100 mg kg(-1)) but 37.1% of soils were found to have high AS content (>40 mg kg(-1)). The nutrient index status of soil pH was low in Dam Dim, Chulsa, Nagrakata, Binnaguri, and Jainti sub-districts. Soils from five sub-districts had a high nutrient index (2.47 to 2.83) for soil organic carbon. However, it existed in the medium index (1.69 and 2.22) for Dalgaon and Kalchini sub-districts. Only Nagrakata sub-district soil samples were in the high nutrient index (2.65) for AK. All analyzed samples showed a medium nutrient index (1.97 to 2.27) for AS. The result indicated that soil pH was significantly negatively correlated with soil OC (-0.336) and AK (-0.174). However, the soil OC was significantly positive correlated with AK (0.258) and AS (0.100). It could be concluded that a balanced fertilizer application would be needed as a part of the soil improvement program through soil chemical tests for sustainable tea cultivation.

AB  - Cumulus cells surrounding oocytes furnish nutritional support crucial for oocyte maturation in vitro, and thereby enhance oocyte quality significantly. Our previous studies affirmed the role of SIRT2 in regulation of mitochondrial function in sheep granulosa cells. However, the effect of SIRT2 action on mitophagy in these cells remain unclear. Here, RNA-seq was used to scrutinize pathways where differentially expressed genes (DEGs) are enriched following SIRT2 knockdown in cumulus cells. Prior to SIRT2 knock down, cumulus cells were treated with the mitophagy inhibitor Mdivi-1. Potential mechanisms by which SIRT2 affects apoptosis via mitophagy were explored. Results indicated that DEGs after SIRT2 knockdown were enriched in various pathways including mitochondria, mitophagy, and apoptosis. The expression levels of CASP3/CASP9 were significantly increased after mitophagy activation (P < 0.01), whereas inhibition of mitophagy had no effect on apoptosis (P > 0.05). Pretreatment of cumulus cells with Mdivi-1 prior to SIRT2 knockdown significantly reduced the expression of mitophagy-related genes, the number of autolysosomes, the expression of CASP3/CASP9, and the levels of Ca2+ and cytochrome C (P < 0.05). In addition, an improvement in mitochondrial morphology and increases in ATP levels and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy numbers were observed. Interestingly, double knockdown of SIRT2 and MAPK15 was found to reverse increased mitophagy and apoptosis activity caused by SIRT2 knockdown. Our findings indicate that SIRT2 modulate apoptosis in cumulus cells by regulating mitophagy, with MAPK15 likely playing a pivotal role in this process.

AB  - Charred masses of nearly 100,000 Linum usitatissimum (flax) seeds were found in house remains from Tjudn & auml;s on the & Aring;land Islands, Finland, and radiocarbon dated to ad 880-1020. The flax seeds were large and discovered in lumps, which indicates that they had been pressed for their oil. The flax was accompanied by seeds of Cuscuta epilinum, Lolium remotum, Galium spurium and Camelina alyssum/sativa, which are specific weeds of flax fields that mimic it in the flax fields and during crop processing. Several of these species have now become extinct or rare after the introduction of more effective methods of weed control and less flax growing. This find demonstrates the antiquity of this obligate flax weed flora, which appears to have been introduced to & Aring;land together with flax seeds intended for cultivation. Thousands of cereal grains discovered in Viking Age/early medieval (ad 750-1300) Kohagen show that a broad range of crops was grown, with high proportions of Triticum aestivum (naked wheat). Stable isotope analyses of carbon (delta 13C) and nitrogen (delta 15N) ratios were done on the flax from Tjudn & auml;s and other crops from Kohagen, all from samples dated ad 880-1020. The analyses showed high values of delta 15N, which can be explained by considerable soil enrichment with manure, possibly also with maritime resources such as seaweed and fish. The delta 13C values varied between crops, with those for flax being lower than for cereals and Pisum sativum (peas), which could reflect different environmental conditions or differences in plant physiology. The factors affecting delta 15N and delta 13C in flax are, however, poorly understood due to the lack of experimental studies.

AB  - Insect symbiotic microbiota acting as a third-party force of plant-insect interactions, play a significant role in insect hosts tolerance to phytochemical defences. However, it remains unknown whether insect symbiotic bacteria can assist the host in degrading phytochemical defences induced by egg deposition. Plagiodera versicolora is a worldwide forest pest. Our study showed that P. versicolora egg deposition on Populus davidiana x Populus bolleana induced significant changes in the transcriptome and metabolome of leaves. Combined qRT-PCR and LC-MS quantitative analysis of metabolic pathways showed that the contents of chlorogenic acid and rutin were significantly increased upon egg deposition in poplar. Bioassays indicated that the high concentration of chlorogenic acid induced by egg deposition could significantly reduce the performance of germ-free larvae. Six symbiotic bacterial strains with potential ability to degrade chlorogenic acid were isolated and identified. Their degradation products did not affect larval survival either. In vivo inoculation assays showed that four of those symbiotic bacteria could assist in the degradation of high concentration of chlorogenic acid induced by egg deposition and improve the larval survival. Our study provides clear evidence that the insect symbiotic bacteria can mediate the tolerance of herbivorous insects against plant toxins induced by egg deposition.

AB  - Oxalate druse synthesis in plants helps to reduce drought stress by maintaining osmotic balance and might also act as a defence against herbivory by reducing nutritional quality. This study experimentally investigated the role of druses in Atriplex lampa under drought and herbivory treatments. We propose that both stressors trigger druse synthesis. Furthermore, if druse production is an adaptation to stress, the allocation of resources to other physiological functions should not be affected. These hypotheses were experimentally tested under greenhouse and natural field conditions. Leaves of A. lampa were collected from eight rangelands in Monte Desert in Argentina, which shared similar environmental characteristics but differed in stocking rates. The manipulative experiment in the greenhouse consisted in applying drought and herbivory treatments to A. lampa seedlings. The highest druse abundance was observed at intermediate stocking rates, suggesting resource limitation for druse synthesis at extreme stocking rates. The adaptive advantage of druse synthesis was evident only for drought stress treatment, where higher druse abundance was correlated with improved growth rates. When both stressors were combined, there was no difference in druse abundance with respect to control treatment, indicating that herbivory negatively influenced the adaptive response to drought. Druse synthesis is an adaptation to drought that is susceptible to herbivory stress.

AB  - This study investigated intestinal oxidative damage caused by F18(+) Escherichia coli and its amelioration with antibacterial bacitracin fed to nursery pigs. Thirty-six weaned pigs (6.31 +/- 0.08 kg BW) were allotted in a randomized complete block design. Treatments were: NC, not challenged/not treated; PC, challenged (F18(+) E. coli at 5.2 x 10(9) CFU)/not treated; AGP challenged (F18(+) E. coli at 5.2 x 10(9) CFU)/treated with bacitracin (30 g/t). Overall, PC reduced (p < 0.05) average daily gain (ADG), gain to feed ratio (G:F), villus height, and villus height to crypt depth ratio (VH:CD), whereas AGP increased (p < 0.05) ADG, and G:F. PC increased (p < 0.05) fecal score, F18(+) E. coli in feces, and protein carbonyl in jejunal mucosa. AGP reduced (p < 0.05) fecal score and F18(+) E. coli in jejunal mucosa. PC reduced (p < 0.05) Prevotella stercorea populations in jejunal mucosa, whereas AGP increased (p < 0.05) Phascolarctobacterium succinatutens and reduced (p < 0.05) Mitsuokella jalaludinii populations in feces. Collectively, F18(+) E. coli challenge increased fecal score and disrupted the microbiota composition, harming intestinal health by increasing oxidative stress, and damaging the intestinal epithelium, ultimately impairing growth performance. Dietary bacitracin reduced reduced F18(+) E. coli populations and the oxidative damages they cause, thereby improving intestinal health and the growth performance of nursery pigs.

AB  - This study was focused on the effects of ovary acquisition season, embryo transfer season, and conditions of surrogate sows on cloning efficiency, with the objective of improving the production of cloned pigs. The statistical analysis documented that cloning efficiency was highest when ovary extraction and embryo transfer occurred in the spring, and lowest when such operations occurred in the autumn. This was evidenced by the higher number of recovered oocytes (3.2 +/- 0.47 vs. 2.5 +/- 0.51), rate of mature oocytes (57.4 +/- 0.07% vs. 48.9 +/- 0.06%), rate of developed cloned blastocysts (35.7 +/- 0.12% vs. 34.4 +/- 0.07%), pregnancy rate of surrogate sows (73.5% vs. 33.3%), delivery rate (67.6% vs. 16.7%), litter size (6.9 +/- 2.3 vs. 2.3 +/- 2.5), and the number of alive newborns (5.7 +/- 2.2 vs. 1.3 +/- 1.2). Cloning efficiency was little affected by the ovulatory status of the surrogate sow prior to embryo transfer. The length of pregnancy, the parity, and the length of labor of the surrogate sow significantly affected the efficiency of generating pigs cloned from somatic cells. Specifically, when length of pregnancy ranged from 111 to 117 days, surrogate sows with shorter gestation period had larger litter size (8.9 +/- 2.8) and a higher number of stillbirths per litter (2.1 +/- 2.0). Moreover, statistical analysis indicated that selecting sows with 2-4 parities as surrogates led to increased litter size (7.7 +/- 3.0) and the number of alive newborns (6.4 +/- 3.1). In comparison with naturally breeding sows, the surrogate sows spent more time giving birth and suffered higher rates of stillbirth. The data obtained in this study provide valuable insights for improving the production efficiency of somatic cell cloned pigs.

AB  - Rhinogobius rubromaculatus species complex is a group of freshwater gobies endemic to Taiwan. To understand the cryptic species diversity of R. rubromaculatus species complex, this study collected 501 specimens of the genus Rhinogobius from 34 rivers in Taiwan and used the sequences of mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b gene (1140 bp) as a DNA barcoding tool to identify species. In total, four allopatric lineages were found within R. rubromaculatus species complex, and large genetic divergences (p-distances > 0.043) support that they are distinct species. To better understand their evolutionary history, the complete mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) of these four lineages were sequenced. These results showed that (1) the mitogenomes characteristics of these four lineages were similar to those of other Rhinogobius species; (2) the mitogenome genetic distances (p-distances > 0.045) also supported that these four lineages are different species; (3) the results of the Approximate Bayesian Computation analyses support that these four species colonized Taiwan through four different colonization routes; (4) the R. rubromaculatus species complex reveal an evolutionary history similar to other Taiwanese freshwater fish such as Squalidus, Cobitis sinensis and Acrossocheilus paradoxus; and (5) the complex geological history of Taiwan has shaped the colonization history and distribution patterns ofR. rubromaculatus species complex. These results have important implications for the conservation, population genetics and evolution of freshwater fishes in Taiwan.

AB  - Immunodominant alloantigens in pig sperm membranes include 15 known gene products and a previously undiscovered Mr 20,000 sperm membrane-specific protein (SMA20). Here we characterize SMA20 and identify it as the unannotated pig ortholog of PMIS2. A composite SMA20 cDNA encoded a 126 amino acid polypeptide comprising two predicted transmembrane segments and an N-terminal alanine- and proline (AP)-rich region with no apparent signal peptide. The Northern blots showed that the composite SMA20 cDNA was derived from a 1.1 kb testis-specific transcript. A BLASTp search retrieved no SMA20 match from the pig genome, but it did retrieve a 99% match to the Pmis2 gene product in warthog. Sequence identity to predicted PMIS2 orthologs from other placental mammals ranged from no more than 80% overall in Cetartiodactyla to less than 60% in Primates, with the AP-rich region showing the highest divergence, including, in the extreme, its absence in most rodents, including the mouse. SMA20 immunoreactivity localized to the acrosome/apical head of methanol-fixed boar spermatozoa but not live, motile cells. Ultrastructurally, the SMA20 AP-rich domain immunolocalized to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, the outer acrosomal membrane, and the acrosomal contents of ejaculated spermatozoa. Gene name search failed to retrieve annotated Pmis2 from most mammalian genomes. Nevertheless, individual pairwise interrogation of loci spanning Atp4a-Haus5 identified Pmis2 in all placental mammals, but not in marsupials or monotremes. We conclude that the gene encoding sperm-specific SMA20/PMIS2 arose de novo in Eutheria after divergence from Metatheria, whereupon rapid molecular evolution likely drove the acquisition of a species-divergent function unique to fertilization in placental mammals.

AB  - Simple Summary: The prevalence of Johne's disease (JD) due to Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis (Map), responsible for considerable economic losses in the dairy industry worldwide, remains very high. In addition, recent studies have shown that Map may hamper the success of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) eradication programs due to frequent co-infection of hosts. Therefore, the risk of Map contamination by environmental sources must be studied given achieving improved control of this enzooty. Our previous work showed that environmental amoebae could function as reservoirs and vectors of these pathogenic mycobacteria. This study aims to describe amoeba-mycobacteria co-occurrence by sampling the water points of cattle herds monitored for Map and Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis) infection. Our study showed that a wide diversity of amoebae and non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) species, including Map, live closely together in water troughs of herds monitored for JD or bTB. The exact association between amoebae and mycobacteria calls for further investigation.One of the obstacles to eradicating paratuberculosis or Johne's Disease (JD) seems to be the persistence of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (Map) in the environment due to its ability to survive alone or vectorized. It has been shown that Map is widely distributed in soils and water. Previously, we isolated amoebae associated with Map strains in the environment of bovines from an infected herd. This work aims to verify our working hypothesis, which suggests that amoebae may play a role in the transmission of JD. In this study, we sampled water in the vicinity of herds infected with Map or Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis) and searched for amoebae and mycobacteria. Live amoebae were recovered from all samples. Among these amoebae, four isolates associated with the presence of mycobacteria were identified and characterized. Map and other mycobacterial species were detected by qPCR and, in some cases, by culture. This study suggests that amoebae and Map may be found in the same environment and might represent a risk of exposure of animals to pathogenic mycobacteria. These data open up new perspectives on the control measures to be put in place to prevent contamination by Map.

AB  - This study presents a comprehensive investigation into the evolutionary trajectories of Rhipicephalus ticks (Ixodidae) through the interpretation of molecular phylogenetics, elucidating their chromatographic spectrum. The use of advanced chromatographic tools in this study explored the dynamics chemical profiling, providing valuable insights into the evolutionary history and ecological adaptations. Prevalence of Rhipicephalus ticks was 4.5% in sheep and 3.9% in goats. The ITS2 sequence of the Rhipicephalus sanguineus (OK642408) and Rhipicephalus microplus (OK642409) form a distinct clade with sequences from other countries. The 16S rRNA sequences of R. sanguineus (OK560870) clustered with sequences form three lineages, tropical, temperate, and south-eastern. The Cox I gene-identified Rhipicephalus turanicus (OK623472) and R. microplus (OK623463) form separate clades with sequences. The HPLC chromatogram of tick samples reveals a diverse array of identified hydrocarbons, explained the complex chemical composition of their exoskeletons. This analytical approach provides valuable insights into the specific hydrocarbon profiles, allowing for potential applications in species differentiation, ecological studies, and a deeper understanding of the functional roles played by hydrocarbon compounds in tick physiology. The findings revealed the potential of applying molecular phylogenetics tools with chromatography not only to enhance our understanding of tick evolution but also to inform strategies for disease control and management in regions where Rhipicephalus ticks (Ixodidae) are endemic.Research Highlights Chemical mapping utilizing advanced chromatographic techniques.

AB  - The symbiosis between nitrogen-fixing rhizobia and plants is considered mutually beneficial, yet its indirect effects on other organisms remain understudied. We examined how rhizobia symbiosis in Phaseolus vulgaris influences the behaviour and performance of Diabrotica balteata larvae. Specifically, we tested larval preference for nodulated (R+) vs. non-nodulated (R-) roots and assessed the impact on larval growth. We also analysed root nutrient content and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to identify potential chemical cues driving feeding preferences. Larvae strongly preferred R+ roots, where they exhibited enhanced growth and higher survival post-metamorphosis. Nutritional analysis revealed that R+ roots had greater nutrient content, supporting improved larval performance. VOC profiles differed significantly between treatments, and olfactometer assays confirmed that larval attraction was mediated by VOCs, likely signalling enhanced nutritional benefits from rhizobia symbiosis. Our results demonstrate that rhizobia-induced metabolic changes in bean roots make them more attractive and nutritious to herbivorous larvae. This highlights a complex belowground interaction between nitrogen-fixing bacteria, host plants and herbivores, with potential implications for ecological theory and sustainable agriculture. Understanding these interactions could inform pest management strategies and improve legume cultivation by balancing plant-microbe mutualisms with herbivore dynamics.

AB  - Prominent ontogenetic changes of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) should occur in mammals whose neonatal diet of milk differs from that of adults, and especially in herbivores (as vegetation is particularly distinct from milk), and even more so in foregut fermenters, whose forestomach only becomes functionally relevant with vegetation intake. Due to the protracted lactation in marsupials, ontogenetic differences can be particularly well investigated in this group. Here, we report body mass (BM) scaling relationships of wet GIT content mass in 28 in-pouch young (50 g to 3 kg) and 15 adult (16-70 kg) western grey kangaroos Macropus fuliginosus melanops. Apart from the small intestinal contents, in-pouch young and adults did not differ in the scaling exponents ('slope' in log-log plots) but did differ in the scaling factor ('intercept'), with an implied substantial increase in wet GIT content mass during the out-of-pouch juvenile period. In contrast to forestomach contents, caecum contents were elevated in juveniles still in the pouch, suggestive of fermentative digestion of milk and intestinal secretion residues, particularly in the caecum. The substantial increase in GIT contents (from less than 1 to 10-20% of BM) was associated mainly with the increase in forestomach contents (from 25 to 80% of total GIT contents) and a concomitant decrease in small intestine contents (from 50 to 8%), emphasizing the shifting relevance of auto-enzymatic and allo-enzymatic (microbial) digestion. There was a concomitant increase in the contents-to-tissue ratio of the fermentation chambers (forestomach and caecum), but this ratio generally did not change for the small intestine. Our study not only documents significant ontogenetic changes in digestive morpho-physiology, but also exemplifies the usefulness of intraspecific allometric analyses for quantifying these changes.

AB  - BackgroundDromedary camel heart morphology is a crucial research topic with clinical applications. The study aims to understand the dromedary camel anatomy, morphology, and architecture of the ventricular mass. Results: Sagittal and transverse gross sections were compared to sagittal, transverse, and 3D render volume reconstruction computed tomography (CT) scans. The subepicardial fat, which covered the heart base, the coronary groove (sulcus coronarius), the left longitudinal interventricular groove (sulcus interventricularis paraconalis), and the right longitudinal interventricular groove (sulcus interventricularis subsinuosus), had a relatively low density with a homogeneous appearance in the 3D render volume CT. The pericardium in the color cardiac window was identified better than the black and white window (ghost). Transverse and sagittal CT scans demonstrated the internal structures of the heart, including the right atrioventricular orifice (ostium atrioventriculare dextrum), right atrioventricular orifice (ostium atrioventriculare sinistrum), and aortic orifice (ostium aortae), chordae tendineae, the cusps of the valves (cuspis valvae), and the papillary muscles (musculi papillares). The papillary muscle (musculi papillares) was presented with a more moderate density than the rest of the heart, and the cusps of the valves (cuspis valvae) had a lower density. The ventricular wall (margo ventricularis) exhibited different densities: the outer part was hyperdense, while the inner part was hypodense. The thicknesses of the ventricular mural wall and the interventricular septum (septum atrioventriculare) were highest at the midpoint of the ventricular mass, and the lowest value was present toward the apical part. The coronary groove (sulcus coronarius) circumference measured 51.14 & PLUSMN; 0.72 cm, and the fat in the coronary groove (sulcus coronarius) (56 & PLUSMN; 6.55 cm(2)) represented 28.7% of the total cross-sectional area. Conclusion: The current study provided more information about ventricular mass measurements by gross and CT analysis on the heart, which provides a valuable guide for future cardiac CT investigations in camels in vivo.

AB  - Aim of study: To estimate the changes in daily feed intake (DFI), daily weight gain (DWG) and feed conversion efficiency (FCE; DFI/DWG) of male and female Awassi lambs fed on dried olive leaves for six months growing period.
   Area of study: Deir-Al-Hajar area, Syria.
   Materials and methods: Twenty Awassi lambs (10 males and 10 females) were randomly allocated to four equal groups (n=5 animals/group, average weight 23.7 +/- 2.4 kg). The control groups were fed 250 g/kg wheat straw and 750 g/kg concentrate mixture. For the two other experimental groups, the total amount of wheat straw was replaced by dried olive leaves, i.e. the rations contained 250 g/kg dried olive leaves, 520 g/kg concentrate mixture and 230 g/kg barley. The rations of control and experimental groups were isocaloric and isonitrogenous.
   Main results: DWG values varied (p<0.05) according to the sex of lambs, reaching 161 g/d for male lambs as compared to 136 g/d for female lambs. Ration type had no effect (p>0.05) on DWG, with a mean value of 148 g/d. FCE value was better in male (7.21) compared to female (9.09) lambs. However, there were no differences (p>0.05) in the FCE values due to the effect of ration type (8.08 on average).
   Research highlights: Replacement of wheat straw by dried olive leaves in the rations of male and female Awassi lambs had no effect on FCE and could be used as alternative forage for Awassi lambs nutrition.

AB  - A continuous growth in commercial swine farm stock becomes alarming due to its environmental consequences. To evaluate the environmental impacts of commercial swine production in the Philippines, the commercial swine production system in the country was assessed using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) with the goal of calculating the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission of the entire production system from cradleto-farmgate. The carbon footprint of representative commercial swine farms was 2,001.63 g CO2 e kg per liveweight for farrow-to-finish enterprise, 3,142.72 g CO2 e kg per liveweight for farrow-to-feeder enterprise, and 2,062.86 g CO2 e kg per liveweight for farrow-to-breeder enterprise. Feed production module proved to have the greatest contribution in the entire commercial swine production system in which its emission ranged from 73.51% to 75.06% of the total GHG emission from cradle-tofarmgate system boundary. Therefore, innovative strategies to reduce GHG emissions in commercial swine production should focus on this critical segment.

AB  - Agasicles hygrophila Selman and Vogt (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) is a natural enemy of Alternanthera philoxeroides (Mart.) Griseb (Amaranthaceae: Alternanthera), a worldwide invasive weed. Elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations may have significant impacts plants, herbivorous insects, and natural enemies. To assess the concurrent effect of elevated CO2 on the development time, fecundity, and population parameters of A. hygrophila, the age-stage, two-sex life table was used to understand the fitness and population parameters of individually-reared and group-reared A. hygrophila under elevated CO2 concentration. In individually-reared population, the development time of preadults, adult pre-oviposition period, and total pre-oviposition period of A. hygrophila in the elevated CO2 (eCO(2), 750 ppm) treatment were shorter than those in the ambient CO2 (aCO(2), 420 ppm) treatment. In group-reared population, the developmental time of preadults, female adult longevity, female proportion, adult pre-oviposition period, and total pre-oviposition period of A. hygrophila in eCO(2) were longer than those in aCO(2). Additionally, in both individually-reared and group-reared population, fecundity and oviposition days of A. hygrophila in eCO(2) were higher than those in aCO(2), and a higher intrinsic rate of increase, finite rate of increase, and the net reproductive rate of A. hygrophila were observed at eCO(2). Moreover, shorter preadult development time, adult pre-oviposition period, total pre-oviposition period, male adult longevity, and higher fecundity were found in group-reared cohort at both aCO(2) and eCO(2). The results indicates that elevated CO2 has effects on the growth and reproduction of A. hygrophila, and the population growth rate of group-reared was faster and produced more offspring.

AB  - The defense mechanisms of plants evolve as they develop. Previous research has identified chemical defenses against Western flower thrips (WFT) in Gladiolus (Gladiolus hybridus L.). Consequently, our study aimed to explore the consistency of these defense variations against WFT across the various developmental stages of Gladiolus grown under different conditions. Thrips bioassays were conducted on whole plants at three developmental stages, using the Charming Beauty and Robinetta varieties as examples of susceptible and resistant varieties, respectively. Metabolomic profiles of the leaves, buds and flowers before thrips infestation were analyzed. The thrips damage in Charming Beauty was more than 500-fold higher than the damage in Robinetta at all plant development stages. Relative concentrations of triterpenoid saponins and amino acids that were associated with resistance were higher in Robinetta at all plant stages. In Charming Beauty, the leaves exhibited greater damage compared to buds and flowers. The relative concentrations of alanine, valine and threonine were higher in buds and flowers than in leaves. The Metabolomic profiles of the leaves did not change significantly during plant development. In addition, we cultivated plants under different environmental conditions, ensuring consistency in the performance of the two varieties across different growing conditions. In conclusion, the chemical thrips resistance markers, based on the analysis of vegetative plants grown in climate rooms, were consistent over the plant's lifetime and for plants grown under field conditions.

AB  - The results of structural studies on a series of halogen-substituted derivatives of 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) are reported. 2-DG is an inhibitor of glycolysis, a metabolic pathway crucial for cancer cell proliferation and viral replication in host cells, and interferes with D-glucose and D-mannose metabolism. Thus, 2-DG and its derivatives are considered as potential anticancer and antiviral drugs. X-ray crystallography shows that a halogen atom present at the C2 position in the pyranose ring does not significantly affect its conformation. However, it has a noticeable effect on the crystal structure. Fluorine derivatives exist as a dense 3D framework isostructural with the parent compound, while Cl- and I-derivatives form layered structures. Analysis of the Hirshfeld surface shows formation of hydrogen bonds involving the halogen, yet no indication for the existence of halogen bonds. Density functional theory (DFT) periodic calculations of cohesive and interaction energies (at the B3LYP level of theory) have supported these findings. NMR studies in the solution show that most of the compounds do not display significant differences in their anomeric equilibria, and that pyranose ring puckering is similar to the crystalline state. For 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose (2-FG), electrostatic interaction energies between the ligand and protein for several existing structures of pyranose 2-oxidase were also computed. These interactions mostly involve acidic residues of the protein; single amino-acid substitutions have only a minor impact on binding. These studies provide a better understanding of the structural chemistry of halogen-substituted carbohydrates as well as their intermolecular interactions with proteins determining their distinct biological activity.

AB  - Silicon (Si) fertilization alleviates biotic stresses in plants. Si enhances plant resistance against phytophagous insects through physical and biochemical mechanisms. In particular, Si modifies jasmonic acid levels and the emissions of herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs). Here, we investigated whether Si accumulation in the tissues of maize leaves modifies the emissions of constitutive and herbivore-induced plant volatiles, with cascade deterrent effects on oviposition site selection by Spodoptera exigua Hubner (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). Maize plants were cultivated in a hydroponic system under three Si concentrations, resulting in three groups of plants expressing different Si concentrations in their tissues (0.31 +/- 0.04, 4.69 +/- 0.49, and 9.56 +/- 0.30 g Si. Kg(- 1) DW). We collected volatiles from undamaged and caterpillar-infested plants, and found that Si concentration in plant tissues had no significant impact. Jasmonic acid content was high in insect-infested plants, but was similar across all Si treatments. Oviposition site selection bioassays using fertilized S. exigua females showed that Si concentration in plant tissues did not affect the number of eggs laid on Si-treated plants. In conclusion, our study shows that the Si content in maize tissues does not impact the semiochemical interactions with S. exigua.

AB  - A new species of giant guitarfish, Glaucostegus younholeei sp. nov., is described from 13 specimens, 730-933 mm total length, collected from fish landing center of Bangladesh Fisheries Development Corporation in Cox's Bazar district of Bangladesh. The new species is distinguished from congeners in having the following combination of characters: Body brownish or greyish in color with a narrowly wedge-shaped disc, and long narrow bluntly pointed snout (angle 31-40 degrees), and broad oblique nostrils with the narrow anterior opening. Nostrils about half of the mouth width, subequal (0.98-1.33) to internasal width; similar to 55-57 nasal lamellae; anterior nasal flaps slightly penetrating into internasal space, their interspace 2.20-2.61 in length of the posterior nasal aperture. Orbit very small in adults, diameter 8.19-11.62 in preorbital length, 2.25-2.69 in interorbital space. Rostral ridges almost joined along their entire length; margin of cranium sharply demarcated before eyes. Spiracular folds very short and widely separated. Skin rough, densely covered with small denticles, more coarsely granular on the dorsal surface than ventrally, enlarged between orbits and in a distinct band between nape and first dorsal fin. Tail relatively longer, length 1.15-1.48 in disc length; dorsal fins narrowly spaced, interspace 1.32-2.11 in base length of the first dorsal fin. Clasper length in adult male 4.37-5.70 in total length. Phylogenetic analysis of DNA barcode sequences also shows the clear divergence of Glaucostegus younholeei from other congeneric species obtained from GenBank. A key is provided to the 8 known members including new species of the genus Glaucostegus.

KW  - SUITE
AB  - The Animal QTLdb (https://www.animalgenome.org/QTLdb) and CorrDB (https://www.animalgenome.org/CorrDB) are unique resources for livestock animal genetics and genomics research which have been used extensively by the international livestock genome research community. This is largely due to the active development of the databases over the years to keep up with the rapid advancement of genome sciences. The ongoing development has ensured that these databases provide researchers not only with continually updated data but also with new web tools to disseminate the data. Through our continued efforts, the databases have evolved from the original Pig QTLdb for cross-experiment QTL data comparisons to an Animal QTLdb hosting 220 401 QTL, SNP association and eQTL data linking phenotype to genotype for 2210 traits. In addition, there are 23 552 correlations for 866 traits and 4273 heritability data on 1069 traits in CorrDB. All these data were curated from 3157 publications that cover seven livestock species. Along with the continued data curation, new species, additional genome builds, and new functions and features have been built into the databases as well. Standardized procedures to support data mapping on multiple species/genome builds and the ability to browse data based on linked ontology terms are highlights of the recent developments.

Subterranean lifestyle and low ambient temperatures are thought to affect an animal's "pace-of-life" in opposite directions, and it is currently unknown how LCV solve this trade-off. We report key aspects of reproduction and postnatal development as well as resting metabolic rate (RMR) and low critical temperature (T-lc) in captive LCV. Mean litter size was 2.9 (+/- 0.9 SD, range 1-4) and gestation lasted 32-33 days. The embryonic and pre-weaning postnatal growth rate was low when adult weight of 80-90 g was taken into account (0.14 g/day and 0.8 g/day, respectively). Juveniles developed very slowly (eyes opening at 22-25 days) and weaned at about 1 month. Members of breeding pairs exhibited permanent nest cohabitation. Males were present at birth and displayed paternal care of pups. Females may become pregnant by 50 days or even earlier. The T-lc was estimated as 18.9 (+/- 0.9 SE) degrees C. The mass-independent basal metabolic rate (BMR) was 1.65 (+/- 0.08 SD) mL O-2/g x h, which is close to the expected value calculated from the allometric relationship between body mass and BMR determined for other voles adapted to similar climate conditions. The unusual combination of several slow life history traits with relatively early sexual maturation and unreduced BMR apparently constitute elements of the unique adaptive complex of the relatively small, strictly herbivore subterranean rodent living in cold humid habitats.

AB  - Lyme and other tick-borne diseases are increasing in the United States. Development of tick control tools have focused primarily on the blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis Say. Application of acaricides or entomopathogenic fungal agents to kill host-seeking ticks or ticks on rodents can suppress I. scapularis abundance in residential landscapes, but evidence is lacking for impact on human tick bites or tick-borne disease. Similar studies remain limited for the lone star tick, Amblyomma americanum (L.). Other knowledge gaps include how well homeowners and pest control companies perform in the broadcast application of tick-killing products, relative to high efficacy reported in research studies, and the tick-killing potential of natural product formulations exempt from Environmental Protection Agency registration. Area-wide control based on preventing ticks from feeding on their main reproductive host, the white-tailed deer, can suppress populations of both I. scapularis and A. americanum. Some studies also suggest an impact on Lyme disease cases, but this needs to be further validated in larger-scale intervention studies. The effectiveness, scale, cost, and implementation of various tick management strategies are important considerations in efforts to reduce human tick encounters and tick-borne disease. Additional barriers include weak incentives for industry and academia to develop, test, and register new tick and pathogen control technologies, including vaccines targeting humans, tick reproductive hosts, or wildlife pathogen reservoirs. Solutions will need to be 'two-pronged': improving the tick and pathogen control toolbox and strengthening the public health workforce engaging in tick control at local and state levels.

AB  - The study of reproductive traits is crucial for improving genetic potential of goats because of their significant utility in meat production. Hence, genetic analysis was conducted for reproductive traits on Alpine x Beetal goats using animal model for first parity data. Information on 1462 reproductive records were collected over five decades from ICAR-National Dairy Research Institute, Karnal, Haryana (1971-2021). Single-trait and multi-trait animal models were used for genetic analysis. Estimates of (co)variance components and genetic parameters were obtained using Gibbs Sampler for Animal Model due to non-normal distribution of data. Six single-trait animal models (including or excluding maternal and environmental effects) were fitted and best models were determined based on Deviance Convergence Criterion values. The prolificacy for the A x B goats for first parity data was 32%, having 68% single births, 31% twins and 1% triplets/quadruplets. The least squares mean for age at first service (AFS), age at first kidding (AFK), service period (SP), dry period (DP), gestation length (GL), kidding interval (KI), litter weight (LW), number of kids born (NKB) and number of females kids born (NFKB) in first parity were 546.15 +/- 4.10 days, 679.05 +/- 4.07 days, 226.51 +/- 4.02 days, 67.96 +/- 2.76 days, 150.74 +/- 0.13 days, 362.53 +/- 3.35 days, 3.99 +/- 0.04 kg, 1.32 +/- 0.02 and 0.64 +/- 0.02, respectively. The heritability estimates obtained from best model for AFS, AFK, GL, KI, SP, and DP were 0.12 +/- 0.00, 0.10 +/- 0.00, 0.09 +/- 0.01, 0.03 +/- 0.00, 0.04 +/- 0.00, and 0.05 +/- 0.00, respectively. For NKB, NFKB and LW, heritability estimates were 0.16 +/- 0.01, 0.03 +/- 0.03, and 0.04 +/- 0.00, respectively. These results imply lower heritability estimates for reproductive traits, and hence meagre scope for selection for further improvement. Maternal effects contributed significantly for traits such as GL, NKB and NFKB. Genetic correlation for number of female kids born was negative with SP and DP which is favourable. Furthermore, genetic correlation was negative for dry period and litter weight which is favourable as number of kids born and litter weight are traits of direct economic importance. Results reveal high genetic potential of this breed for meat industry owing to high prolificacy, provided consistent efforts are made for the genetic improvement of this germplasm.

AB  - Engineered water nanostructures (EWNS) technology produces highly charged nanoscale water droplets with encapsulated reactive oxygen species (ROS) emerges as green microbial decontamination method. In this work, an electro-nanospray system was developed for the decontamination of common surfaces found in pig barns. Microbial inactivation of the device was tested at different conditions in a laboratory-scale on the inactivation of Escherichia coli (E. coli) at a bacterial concentration similar to pig barn surfaces levels. Pig barn surfaces were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and contact angle to understand the behaviors between the samples. Exposure time was the most influential operating parameter resulting in an E. coli log reduction of 2.66 after 40 min of exposure. On the other hand, decontamination efficiency was higher for wood, followed by concrete, metal and plastic with log reductions up to 2.96. EWNS technology was demonstrated as an efficient microbial decontamination method for animal confinement facilities surfaces treatment.

AB  - The tea collection of the FRC SSC RAS (Sochi, Maykop in Russia) represents one of the northernmost germplasm comprising a number of locally derived cultivars and gamma-irradiation mutants. The latter are often characterized by larger genome size, which may lead to better adaptation to biotic and abiotic stress. Such genotypes may be a valuable genetic resource for better adaptability to extreme environmental conditions, which could enable tea cultivation outside global growing regions. Microsatellite markers are often the best choice for genetic diversity analysis in genebank collections. However, their use in polyploid species is questionable because simple sequence repeat (SSR) allele dosage cannot be readily determined. Therefore, the efficiency of SSR and start codon targeted (SCoT) markers was investigated using 43 selected cultivars from the Russian genebank collection derived from mutant breeding and clonal selection. Previously, the increase in genome size was confirmed in 18 mutants within this collection. Despite the presence of polyploid tea genotypes, our study revealed higher efficiency of SSR markers than SCoT markers. Subsequent SSR analysis of the 106 genotypes in the Russian genebank collection revealed three distinct genetic clusters after STRUCTURE analysis. Greater genetic variation was observed within genetic clusters than between clusters, indicating low genetic variation between collections. Nevertheless, the northernmost tea collection exhibited a greater genetic distance from the other two clusters than they did from each other. Close genetic relationships were found between many cultivars with particularly large leaves and mutant forms. Pearson's correlation analysis revealed a significant, moderate correlation between genome size and leaf area size. Our study shows that microsatellite fingerprinting is useful to estimate the genetic diversity and genetic background of tea germplasm in Russia despite polyploid tea accessions. Thus, the results of our study contribute to the development of future tea germplasm conservation strategies and modern tea breeding programs.

AB  - Unstoppable global warming and increased frequency of extreme heat leads to human and animals easier to suffer from heat stress (HS), with gastrointestinal abnormalities as one of the initial clinical symptoms. HS induces intestinal mucosal damage owing to intestinal hypoxia and hyperthermia. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) activates numerous genes to mediate cell hypoxic responses; however, its role in HS-treated intestinal mucosa is unknown. This work aimed to explore HIF-1 alpha function and regulatory mechanisms in HS-treated pig intestines. We assigned 10 pigs to control and moderate HS groups. Physical signs, stress, and antioxidant levels were detected, and the intestines were harvested after 72 h of HS treatment to study histological changes and HIF-1 alpha, heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), and prolyl-4-hydroxylase 2 (PHD-2) expression. In addition, porcine intestinal columnar epithelial cells (IPEC-J2) underwent HS treatment (42 degrees C, 5 % O2) to further explore the functions and regulatory mechanism of HIF-1 alpha. The results of histological examination revealed HS caused intestinal villi damage and increased apoptotic epithelial cell; the expression of HIF-1 alpha and HSP90 increased while PHD-2 showed and opposite trend. Transcriptome sequencing analysis revealed that HS activated HIF-1 signaling. To further explore the role of HIF-1 alpha on HS induced IPEC-J2 apoptosis, the HIF-1 alpha was interfered and overexpression respectively, and the result confirmed that HIF-1 alpha could inhibited cell apoptosis under HS. Furthermore, HS -induced apoptosis depends on eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eif2 alpha)/activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4)/CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) pathway, and HIF-1 alpha can inhibit this pathway to alleviate IPEC-J2 cell apoptosis. In conclusion, this study suggests that HS can promote intestinal epithelial cell apoptosis and cause pig intestinal mucosal barrier damage; the HIF-1 alpha can alleviate cell apoptosis by inhibiting eif2 alpha/ATF4/CHOP signaling. These results indicate that HIF-1 alpha plays a protective role in HS, and offers a potential target for HS prevention and mitigation.

AB  - Adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (ASCs) are considered important tools in regenerative medicine and are being tested in several clinical studies. Porcine models are frequently used to obtain adipose tissue, due to the abundance of material and because they have immunological and physiological similarities with humans. However, it is essential to understand the effects and safe application of ASCs from pigs (pASCs) as an alternative therapy for diseases. Although minipigs are easy-to-handle animals that require less food and space, acquiring and maintaining them in a bioterium can be costly. Thus, we present a protocol for the isolation and proliferation of ASCs isolated from adipose tissue of farm pigs. Adipose tissue samples were extracted from the abdominal region of the animals. Because the pigs were not raised in a controlled environment, such as a bioterium, it was necessary to carry out rigorous procedures for disinfection. After this procedure, cells were isolated by mechanical dissociation and enzymatic digestion. A proliferation curve was performed and used to calculate the doubling time of the population. The characterization of pASCs was performed by immunophenotyping and cell differentiation in osteogenic and adipogenic lineages. The described method was efficient for the isolation and cultivation of pASCs, maintaining cellular attributes, such as surface antigens and multipotential differentiation during in vitro proliferation. This protocol presents the isolation and cultivation of ASCs from farm pig as an alternative for the isolation and cultivation of ASCs from minipigs, which require strictly controlled maintenance conditions and a more expensive process.

AB  - Pre-dispersal seed predation diminishes fitness and population growth rate of many plant species. Therefore, plants have developed multiple strategies to reduce the harmful effects of this type of herbivory. The present study aims to determine the effect of pre-dispersal seed predators (PSPs) on the fitness of a short-lived herb, and to discern the mechanisms allowing the plants to reduce the impact of pre-dispersal seed predation. Knowing that the interplay between pre-dispersal seed predators and plants is strongly shaped by the presence of other co-occurring organisms, we tested whether detritivores modulate plant responses towards pre-dispersal seed predators. To do so, we experimentally manipulated in the field pre-dispersal seed predators and detritivores interacting with the short-lived herb Moricandia moricandioides. We found that detritivores did not alter the response of plants to PSPs. Strikingly, the plant overcompensated for pre-dispersal seed predation, almost doubling the number of seeds produced. Plant response to PSPs led to substantial changes in shoot architecture, reproductive traits, chemical defences in leaves and seeds and in seed nutrient content. The overcompensating mechanism seems to be meristem activation, which allowed plants to produce more reproductive tissue, and increasing the proportion of ovules that became seeds, a response which specifically compensates for pre-dispersal seed predation. As far as we know, this is the first experimental evidence of a positive effect of PSPs on plant lifetime fitness as a consequence of plant overcompensation.

AB  - Selection together with variation in floral traits can act to mold floral form, often driven by a plant's predominant or most effective pollinators. To investigate the evolution of traits associated with pollination, we developed a phylogenetic framework for evaluating tempo and mode of pollination shifts across the genus Costus L., known for its evolutionary toggle between traits related to bee and bird pollination. Using a target enrichment approach, we obtained 957 loci for 171 accessions to expand the phylogenetic sampling of Neotropical Costus. In addition, we performed whole genome resequencing for a subset of 20 closely related species with contrasting pollination syndromes. For each of these 20 genomes, a high-quality assembled transcriptome was used as reference for consensus calling of candidate loci hypothesized to be associated with pollination-related traits of interest. To test for the role these candidate genes may play in evolutionary shifts in pollinators, signatures of selection were estimated as dN/dS across the identified candidate loci. We obtained a well-resolved phylogeny for Neotropical Costus despite conflict among gene trees that provide evidence of incomplete lineage sorting and/or reticulation. The overall topology and the network of genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) indicate that multiple shifts in pollination strategy have occurred across Costus, while also suggesting the presence of previously undetected signatures of hybridization between distantly related taxa. Traits related to pollination syndromes are strongly correlated and have been gained and lost in concert several times throughout the evolution of the genus. The presence of bract appendages is correlated with two traits associated with defenses against herbivory. Although labellum shape is strongly correlated with overall pollination syndrome, we found no significant impact of labellum shape on diversification rates. Evidence suggests an interplay of pollination success with other selective pressures shaping the evolution of the Costus inflorescence. Although most of the loci used for phylogenetic inference appear to be under purifying selection, many candidate genes associated with functional traits show evidence of being under positive selection. Together these results indicate an interplay of phylogenetic history with adaptive evolution leading to the diversification of pollination-associated traits in Neotropical Costus.

AB  - The water-energy crisis seriously affects the sustainable development of China's steel industry chain. To achieve a coordinated development new path from the perspective of circular economy, it is necessary to analyze "water -energy-economy" dependency relationship of the steel products. This study analyzes a variety of steel products from the perspective of industry chain and simulates the "water-energy-economy" potential changes of products under different scenarios by developing a multi-objective optimization model. In this model, Random Forest (RF) and GEne Network Inference with Ensemble of trees (GEINIE3) algorithms are combined to evaluate the 2013-2019 "water-energy-economy" dependency relationships firstly. Then, improved Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO) algorithm is applied to dynamically simulate potential changes of water, energy and economic performance in the steel industry chain under different scenarios, and to design an optimal develop-ment path from the perspective of optimizing economic performance within minimum water and minimum energy use constraints. Results firstly point out the current "water-energy-economy" triple dimension de-pendency relationship of China's steel industry is weak. Secondly, the "water-economy" dependence has changed from one-way dependence to two-way dependence, and the "energy-economy" relationship still shows a one-way dependence. Finally, when improving resource utilization rate, assigning priority to the reuse of scrap steel, while restricting pig iron and primary steel use, may help maximize the coordinated development of "water -energy-economy" in the steel industry chain. Policy implications are proposed based on the results and provided decision-making basis for the country and relevant enterprises to promote sustainable development of the steel industry chain.

AB  - A small isolated population of the snow sheep (Ovis nivicola Eschscholtz 1829) inhabits the Kodar Mountain Ridge in Transbaikalia; it has been listed in the Red Data Book of Russia since 2020. The Kodar Mountain Ridge is the southwesternmost part of the modern distribution range of the snow sheep. This study is aimed at revealing the modern population structure of snow sheep in the Kodar Ridge using camera traps for the monitoring of two subpopulations as an example. We collected photo and video material in July-September 2019 and July-September 2020, when the animals were sedentary on summer pastures. The average group size in summer was low: 2.4-3.5 for females with young and 1.1-1.8 for males. In summer, the maximum group size was six for males or eight for females with young. Adult males and females with juveniles were slightly separated spatially in summer, but the habitats of both overlap, or the distances between them do not exceed several kilometers. It has been shown that the Kodar snow sheep are characterized by high female fertility: the number of lambs is close to the number of adult females. In total, in all areas, the proportion of adult females amounted to about 30%, and was the same for lambs (30%), 15% for yearlings, and 26% for males (including 6% for sheep six years old or older). The low proportion of old males and some traces of hunting indicated that, at least until recently, the population had experienced certain poaching pressure. Because the study area on the left bank of Sredniy Sakukan River included important summer habitats of the snow sheep, it can be proposed for inclusion in the protected area of Kodar National Park.

AB  - Shading is an important practical method to improve the quality of green tea. Previous research of our group found that because the biosynthesis and distribution of theanine in tea plants were affected by down regulation of gene encoding amino acid permeases, theanine content in tea leaves that grown under shading condition was significantly higher than those under natural light. In this study, our group analyzed the changes of tea leaf area, free amino acid content and photosynthetic parameters under natural light and shading conditions, to ensure that moderate shading did not reduce but improved the quality of tea. Transcriptome sequencing and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis were conducted to reveal the expression levels of genes related to chlorophyll content and chlorophyll a/b ratio under natural light and shading conditions. Experimental results revealed the presence of the following differentially expressed genes in the porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism pathway of tea under natural light and shading conditions: the up regulation of CPOX expression may lead to an increase in the accumulation of raw materials of chlorophyll synthesis, while the down regulation of SGR expression may lead to a decrease in chlorophyll degradation. The combined effect of these two genes may lead to an increase in the total chlorophyll content of tea. The down regulation of NOL expression may lead to the obstruction of chlorophyll b transform to chlorophyll a, that is, the decrease of the chlorophyll a/b ratio. This study investigated the molecular mechanism of chlorophyll content and component alteration in Fuding white tea under natural light and shading conditions, and elucidated the effects of different light intensities on the porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism pathway of tea. Thus, it provided deep understanding of chlorophyll regulation under shading condition in tea cultivation, which could contribute to high-quality matcha production.

AB  - In times of widespread environmental pollution with heavy metals of anthropogenic origin and the increasing dynamics of this process, it is justified to collect as much data as possible on the concentration of metals in terrestial mammals from unpolluted areas. The purpose of this research was to present the concentration of essential (chromium, copper, iron, manganese, molybdenum, and zinc), probably essential (nickel, vanadium) and non-esential element (cadmium, lead, silver, strontium, and tin) in the liver, kidneys, muscles and brain of red fox (Vulpes vulpes) inhabiting north-western Poland. We revealed that the concentration of all metals, apart from Ni, was different between studied tissues. Sn and Mo have the highest affinity to the liver, whereas Ag, Sr, Cr had higher concentrations in the brain than in other organs. Various positive relationship between the con-centrations of metals were observed in the tissues. Moreover, we noted negative correlations between Ag and Sn in the kidneys and brain, and between Cu and Ag in the liver. In our study the red fox was used as biomonitor for the assessment of exposure of carnivores to metals, in the generally unpolluted areas of Central Europe. Data presented in the report may be used as comparative values in similar ecotoxicological studies.

AB  - The flavonoid myricitrin showed an antidepressant-like effect in the tail suspension test and increased hippocampal neurogenesis, as well as demonstrating anti-inflammatory effects. Interestingly, inflammation has been linked to depression, and anti-inflammatory drugs showed promising results as antidepressant-like drugs. Thus, the present study evaluated the effects of myricitrin in the chronic mild stress (CMS) model, a translational and valid animal model of depression, using the mini-experiment design to improve the reproducibility of the findings. The sucrose preference test (SPT), forced swim test (FST), and tail suspension test (TST) were the readouts of depressive-like phenotypes induced by CMS. Relative adrenal weight was employed as an index of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activation. Interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha levels were measured in the hippocampus. Myricitrin (10 mg/kg, intraperitoneally, for 14 days) reversed depressive-like behaviors induced by CMS (increased immobility in the FST, the TST and anhedonia), as well as decreased adrenal hypertrophy and hippocampal levels of IL-6 in stressed mice. Similar results were observed by imipramine (20 mg/kg, intraperitoneally, for 14 days), a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (positive control). A significant correlation was observed between immobility time in the TST, and hippocampal IL-6 levels. Hippocampal TNF-alpha levels were not affected by CMS or drug treatment. In conclusion, myricitrin exhibited an antidepressant-like profile in CMS, and this effect may be associated with its anti-inflammatory activity.

AB  - Reproductive performance is a key factor influencing the sustainability and economic viability of pig breeding, particularly in rare and endangered breeds. This study investigates the associations between polymorphisms in the estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) and prolactin receptor (PRLR) genes and reproductive traits in three rare pig breeds: Myrhorod, Poltava Meat, and Welsh. A total of 61 sows were examined, including 20 Myrhorod, 20 Poltava Meat, and 21 Welsh pigs. DNA was extracted from bristle samples, and genotyping for PvuII (ESR1) and AluI (PRLR) polymorphisms was conducted using PCR-RFLP analysis. The study assessed key reproductive indicators such as litter size, number of piglets born alive, piglet survival rate at weaning, weaning litter weight, and selection index of reproductive qualities of sows (SIRQS). Statistical analysis was performed to evaluate breed-specific differences and genotype-trait associations. Results indicate that the Myrhorod and Poltava Meat breeds exhibit lower reproductive performance compared to Welsh pigs, with significantly fewer piglets born alive and at weaning. Notably, the Myrhorod breed displayed a higher individual piglet weight at weaning, suggesting a trade-off between litter size and piglet growth rate. A significant negative correlation was observed between the number of piglets per litter and individual piglet weight, which became more pronounced at weaning. Genetic analysis revealed strong associations between ESR1 and PRLR polymorphisms and reproductive traits. The ESR1 BB genotype was linked to superior reproductive performance across all breeds, with the highest SIRQS values and larger litter sizes, while sows with the AA genotype exhibited significantly smaller litters. In contrast, the PRLR AA genotype was associated with increased piglet birth weight, confirming its role in early developmental traits. The findings underscore the importance of molecular genetics in improving reproductive efficiency, particularly in endangered breeds like Myrhorod pigs, where maintaining genetic diversity while enhancing productivity is a key challenge. The study highlights the necessity of integrating marker-assisted selection and genomic selection strategies to optimize fertility traits and ensure the long-term sustainability of small-population breeds. Further research is needed to explore additional genetic markers influencing reproductive traits and to refine breeding programs that balance genetic conservation and economic viability in rare pig breeds.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of the addition of BGP-15 ((Z)-N'-(2-hydroxy-3-(piperidin-1-yl) propoxy) nicotinimidamide) on goat sperm during cryopreservation. The semen from six rams was diluted with a soybean lecithin-based extender containing different doses of BGP-15 (0, 50, 100, 150, and 200 mu M). After the freeze-thawing process, sperm characteristics, plasma membrane integrity and functionality, acrosomal status, mitochondria activity, apoptosis status, and gene expression of post-thawed ram spermatozoa were assessed. Compared to fresh spermatozoa, the ultrastructure of frozen spermatozoa was damaged, and frozen spermatozoa had a reduced number of duplex microtubules with partially asymmetric distributions, localized disappearance of the central microtubule, and ambiguous submicrotubule structures. Moreover, the 100 mu M BGP-15 treatment group had the highest percentage of viability, plasma membrane and acrosome integrities, and mitochondrial activity of frozen-thawed spermatozoa when compared to the control (P < 0.05). In the Computer-Assisted Semen Analyzer, sperm motility parameters were significantly increased in the BGP-15 treatment group against the control group (P < 0.05), except wobble. Similarly, BGP-15 treatment increased the levels of T-AOC, SOD, CAT, and GHS-Px and decreased the level of ROS which compared to controls (P < 0.05). Only the 100 mu M BGP-15 treatment group had a higher MDA level than the control group (P < 0.05). In all BGP-15 treatment groups, the mRNA expressions of the ROMO1 gene were significantly reduced compared to controls (P < 0.05), and the mRNA expressions of the SMCP, MnSOD, and CuZnSOD genes were significantly increased (P < 0.05). While the difference in the mRNA expression of the SMOX gene between the 50 mu M BGP-15 treatment group and the control group was not significant (P > 0.05). Moreover, the apoptosis rate of freeze-thawed spermatozoa significantly decreased in the 100 mu M BGP-15 treatment group compared to the control (P < 0.05), while the MMP of freeze-thawed spermatozoa significantly enhanced in the 100 mu M BGP-15 treatment group (P < 0.05). In conclusion, BGP-15 enhances cryo-protective effects on goat spermatozoa, and 100 mu M BGP-15 addition to the extender during cryopreservation is beneficial to the goat breeding industry.

AB  - We have reconstructed Elasmotherium's head based on complete intact skulls morphology analysis. The bony protuberance on the frontal bone was covered with a horny substance that protected the dome's relatively thin bones. The keratinized cover grew from the base. clearly visible in the lower part of the bony dome, and its top was displaced dorso-aborally. The dome's inner surface was an overgrown nasal cavity and served to intensify sense of smell, and, possibly, enhance sounds emitted. A relatively small narrow terminal horn-like cornified pad was attached at nasal and intermaxillary bones' end, it served to loosen and dig up soil for lants' succulent underground parts searching. Powerful muscles were especially prominent on the neck, they used to carry out lateral and dorsolateral movements of the head.

AB  - Waste fermentation bed materials from pig farms are often used as organic fertilizers; however, they are a significant source of microorganisms carrying antibiotic-resistance genes (ARGs). Microbes from fermentation bed materials readily introduce ARGs into the soil, causing environmental pollution. We designed four treatments, including RH (rice husk 100 %), RS (rice stalks 50 %, sawdust 40 %, and rice husk 10 %), CS (corn stalks 50 %, sawdust 40 %, and rice husk 10 %), and CTS (cotton stalks 50 %, sawdust 40 %, and rice husk 10 %). The dynamic changes and distribution mechanisms of ARGs in different material fermentation beds are revealed through metagenomic sequencing. The research results indicate that (1) Glycoside hydrolases can increase the abundance of ARGs, while glycosyl transferases can decrease the abundance of ARGs. (2) Lignin promotes the accumulation of glycoside hydrolases, while cellulose and hemicellulose promote the accumulation of glycosyl transferases. (3) At the genus level, Pseudomonas, Parapedobacter, Sphingobacterium, Flavobacterium, Lysobacter, and Myroides mainly rely on their cell membranes to develop ARGs. (4) High lignin content can reduce the accumulation of ARGs, while high cellulose and hemicellulose content can increase the accumulation of ARGs. The results provide a theoretical basis for selecting padding materials that can be widely applied in fermentation bedding systems.

AB  - This study investigated the effect of auditory environmental enrichment on the behavior of pregnant and lactating sows housed in mixed (cage until 35 days after insemination and then collective pens) or collective housing (cage until 72 hours after insemination and then collective pens) during the gestation period, as well as the behavior of their litters. A sample of 56 sows of a commercial strain between second and sixth parity was submitted to the treatments from artificial insemination to piglet's weaning (21 days). The sows were assigned in 2 x 2 factorial randomized block designs in the treatments: mixed housing-control (MH-C), collective housing-control (CH-C), mixed housing-music (MH-M), and collective housing-music (CH-M). The sows in the treatments with auditory enrichment were exposed daily throughout gestation and lactation to 6 hours of classical music (Bach symphonies) divided into 2-hour periods. Behavioral assessment was performed on 10 sows of each treatment once a week. At 21 days of age, their piglets were subjected to tests of novel arena, novel object, and voluntary human approach. In both phases, regardless of the housing system evaluated (CH or MH), females submitted to music had a lower incidence of agonistic and stereotyped behaviors and greater social interaction with other sows and their piglets in relation to the control group. Piglets from the CH-M treatment vocalized less and showed better results in the voluntary approach test. Music as an environmental enrichment reduced agonistic interactions between pregnant and lactating sows and the incidence of stereotypies. Piglets from sows housed in a collective system exposed to sound stimuli in the pre- and postnatal periods were more fearless at 21 days of age. (c) 2024 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Human heart failure, a leading cause of death worldwide, is a prominent example of a chronic disease that may result from poor cell renewal. The Hippo signaling pathway is an inhibitory kinase cascade that represses adult heart muscle cell (cardiomyocyte) proliferation and renewal after myocardial infarction in genetically modified mice. Here, we investigated an adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9)-based gene therapy to locally knock down the Hippo pathway gene Salvador (Sav) in border zone cardiomyocytes in a pig model of ischemia/reperfusion-induced myocardial infarction. Two weeks after myocardial infarction, when pigs had left ventricular systolic dysfunction, we administered AAV9-Sav-short hairpin RNA (shRNA) or a control AAV9 viral vector carrying green fluorescent protein (GFP) directly into border zone cardiomyocytes via catheter-mediated subendocardial injection. Three months after injection, pig hearts treated with a high dose of AAV9-Sav-shRNA exhibited a 14.3% improvement in ejection fraction (a measure of left ventricular systolic function), evidence of cardiomyocyte division, and reduced scar sizes compared to pigs receiving AAV9-GFP. AAV9-Sav- shRNA- treated pig hearts also displayed increased capillary density and reduced cardiomyocyte ploidy. AAV9-Sav-shRNA gene therapy was well tolerated and did not induce mortality. In addition, liver and lung pathology revealed no tumor formation. Local delivery of AAV9Sav-shRNA gene therapy to border zone cardiomyocytes in pig hearts after myocardial infarction resulted in tissue renewal and improved function and may have utility in treating heart failure.

AB  - In Asia, Culex mosquitoes are of particular interest because of their role in maintaining endemic mosquito-borne viral diseases, including the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). Nonetheless, host-feeding preferences, along with naturally infecting RNA viruses in certain Culex species, remain understudied. In this study, selected blood-fed mosquitoes were processed for avian and mammalian blood meal source identification. Concurrently, cell culture propagation and high-throughput sequencing (HTS) approaches were used to determine the RNA virome of Culex mosquitoes collected in Ishikawa Prefecture, Japan. The identification of blood meal sources from wild-caught Culex spp. revealed that Culex (Culex) tritaeniorhynchus Giles, 1901, has a robust preference toward wild boar (62%, 26/42), followed by heron (21%, 9/42). The other two species, Culex (Oculeomyia) bitaeniorhynchus Giles, 1901, and Culex (Culex) orientalis Edwards, 1921, showed a distinct preference for avian species, including migratory birds. From the HTS results, 34 virus sequences were detected, four of which were newly identified virus sequences of unclassified Aspiviridae, Qinviridae, Iflaviridae, and Picornaviridae. The absence of observable cytopathic effects in mammalian cells and phylogenetic analysis suggested that all identified virus sequences were insect-specific. Further investigations involving other mosquito populations collected in different areas are warranted to explore previously unknown vertebrate hosts that may be linked to JEV dispersal in nature.

AB  - BACKGROUND The endosymbiont Wolbachia is known for manipulating host reproduction. Wolbachia also can affect host fitness by mediating interactions between plant and herbivores. However, it remains unclear whether saliva proteins are involved in this process. RESULTS We found that Wolbachia infection decreased the number of deposited eggs but increased the egg hatching rate in the spider mite Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae), a cosmopolitan pest that infects >1000 species of plants. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses revealed that Wolbachia-infected mites upregulated the gene expression levels of many T. urticae salivary proteins including a cluster of Tetranychidae-specific, functionally uncharacterized SHOT1s (secreted host-responsive proteins of Tetranychidae). The SHOT1 genes were expressed more in the feeding stages (nymphs and adults) of mites than in eggs and highly enriched in the proterosomas. RNA interference experiments showed that knockdown of SHOT1s significantly decreased Wolbachia density, increased the number of deposited eggs and decreased the egg hatching rate. CONCLUSION Together, these results indicate that SHOT1s are positively correlated with Wolbachia density and account for Wolbachia-mediated phenotypes. Our results provide new evidence that herbivore salivary proteins are related to Wolbachia-mediated manipulations of host performance on plants. (c) 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Osteoarthritis (OA) of the glenohumeral (GH) joint is a common cause of shoulder pain, resulting in considerable invalidity. Unfortunately, the study of its pathogenesis is challenging. Models of OA are necessary to identify specific targets for therapy and to be able to interfere with the development and evolution of OA. This study aims to assess the effect of an arthroscopic tenotomy of the long head of the biceps tendon (LHBT) and section of the anterior glenohumeral joint capsule on the ovine glenohumeral joint. In addition, the authors aim to validate and evaluate the reliability of a modified semi-quantitative MRI score to assess joint degeneration in a sheep's shoulder. Eight skeletally mature sheep received an arthroscopic tenotomy of the LHBT and section of the anterior joint capsule and were euthanized four months after surgery. All animals tolerated the surgery well, and no complication was recorded for six weeks. Moderate degenerative changes to the ovine shoulder joint were found on MRI and histological evaluation. The arthroscopic tenotomy of the LHBT and the anterior glenohumeral joint capsule section caused moderate degenerative changes to the ovine shoulder joint.

AB  - Evaluating translocation success is essential for wildlife management and conservation; short-term success can be evaluated by analysing settlement behaviour after release. We analysed GPS collar data from 47 white (Ceratotherimum simum simum, Burchell, 1817) and 25 black (Diceros bicornis minor, Drummond, 1876) rhinoceros translocated to the Okavango Delta in Botswana between 2014 and 2018. We tested for effects of age and sex on site fidelity and compared movement ranges after translocations between different release sites and between newly released and established individuals. White rhinoceros adults displayed higher site fidelity than subadults and males higher than females. Adults may therefore be better translocation candidates. Site fidelity of black rhinoceros did not differ between sexes or ages. Established rhinoceros movement ranges were smaller than those of newly released ones, pointing towards extended post-translocation exploratory movements and later settlement in smaller home ranges. Movement ranges of white rhinoceros released on an island were significantly smaller than others, which shows together with annual home range sizes compared with the literature that reserve size and rhinoceros density affect home range size. All rhinoceros in this study survived for more than 1-year post-translocation, so these translocations can be deemed successful in the short term.

AB  - Abnormalities in paracingulate gyrus (PCG) were found in both patients with temporal lobe epilepsy and patients with sleep disorders. These abnormalities include reduced functional connectivity between PCG and other brain regions, abnormal activity and reduced volume of PCG. PCG may be associated with comorbid sleep disorders in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). This study aimed to explore the relationship between abnormal PCG function and comorbid sleep disorders in patients with TLE. We used Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index -8/9 to divide fifty-eight patients into a group with sleep disorders and group without sleep disorders. Using the PCG as the seed, we examined the task-based seed-to-voxel functional connectivity identified by group-independent component analysis. Compared with the normal sleep group, we observed longer disease duration, higher frequency of seizures, higher Self-Rating Anxiety Scale scores in the comorbidity group (p < 0.05). During the verbal fluency character task, functional connectivity from the PCG to the right frontal and parietal regions was decreased in the comorbidity group (p < 0.05, FDR-corrected). Sensitivity analyses confirmed that our conclusions were not affected by factors such as laterality or hippocampal sclerosis. These abnormalities reveal brain lesions in patients with TLE comorbid sleep disorders, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of the comorbidity and be related to patients' preserved verbal functions.

AB  - Background: Tea is one of the most popular non-alcoholic beverages in the world for its flavors and numerous health benefits. The tea tree (Camellia sinensis L.) is a well-known aluminum (Al) hyperaccumulator. However, it is not fully understood how tea plants have adapted to tolerate high concentrations of Al, which causes an imbalance of mineral nutrition in the roots.
   Results: Here, we combined ionomic and transcriptomic profiling alongside biochemical characterization, to probe the changes of metal nutrients and Al responsive genes in tea roots grown under increasing concentrations of Al. It was found that a low level of Al (similar to 0.4 mM) maintains proper nutrient balance, whereas a higher Al concentration (2.5 mM) compromised tea plants by altering micro- and macro-nutrient accumulation into roots, including a decrease in calcium (Ca), manganese (Mn), and magnesium (Mg) and an increase in iron (Fe), which corresponded with oxidative stress, cellular damage, and retarded root growth. Transcriptome analysis revealed more than 1000 transporter genes that were significantly changed in expression upon Al exposure compared to control (no Al) treatments. These included transporters related to Ca and Fe uptake and translocation, while genes required for N, P, and S nutrition in roots did not significantly alter. Transporters related to organic acid secretion, together with other putative Al-tolerance genes also significantly changed in response to Al. Two of these transporters, CsALMT1 and CsALS8, were functionally tested by yeast heterologous expression and confirmed to provide Al tolerance.
   Conclusion: This study shows that tea plant roots respond to high Al-induced mineral nutrient imbalances by transcriptional regulation of both cation and anion transporters, and therefore provides new insights into Al tolerance mechanism of tea plants. The altered transporter gene expression profiles partly explain the imbalanced metal ion accumulation that occurred in the Al-stressed roots, while increases to organic acid and Al tolerance gene expression partly explains the ability of tea plants to be able to grow in high Al containing soils. The improved transcriptomic understanding of Al exposure gained here has highlighted potential gene targets for breeding or genetic engineering approaches to develop safer tea products.

AB  - Insect fluid-feeding on fossil vascular plants is an inconspicuous and underappreciated mode of herbivory that can provide novel data on the evolution of deep-time ecological associations and indicate the host-plant preferences of ancient insect herbivores. Previous fossil studies have documented piercing-and-sucking herbivory but often are unable to identify culprit insect taxa. One line of evidence are punctures and scale-insect impression marks made by piercing-and-sucking insects that occasionally provide clues to the systematic identities and relationships of particular insect herbivores. We report here the earliest occurrences of piercing and sucking on early angiosperms as evidenced by scale insect covers, impression marks, punctures and body fossils - notably a mealybug - from the Lower Cretaceous Rose Creek Flora of the Dakota Formation (c. 103 Ma), in southeastern Nebraska, USA. The mealybug, two other scale insect taxa, and several distinctive damage types on laurel leaves and seed-plant stems at Rose Creek document a diverse guild of piercing-and-sucking insects on early angiosperms. The discovery of an Early Cretaceous female mealybug indicates an early herbivorous association with a laurel host. These data provide direct evidence for co-associations and possible coevolution of scale insects and their plant hosts during early angiosperm diversification.

AB  - The disruption of mitochondrial dynamics has been identified in cardiovascular diseases, including pulmonary hypertension (PH), ischemia-reperfusion injury, heart failure, and cardiomyopathy. Mitofusin 2 (Mfn2) is abundantly expressed in heart and pulmonary vasculature cells at the outer mitochondrial membrane to modulate fusion. Previously, we have reported reduced levels of Mfn2 and fragmented mitochondria in pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (PAECs) isolated from a sheep model of PH induced by pulmonary over-circulation and restoring Mfn2 normalized mitochondrial function. In this study, we assessed the effect of increased expression of Mfn2 on mitochondrial metabolism, bioenergetics, reactive oxygen species production, and mitochondrial membrane potential in control PAECs. Using an adenoviral expression system to overexpress Mfn2 in PAECs and utilizing 13C labeled substrates, we assessed the levels of TCA cycle metabolites. We identified increased pyruvate and lactate production in cells, revealing a glycolytic phenotype (Warburg phenotype). Mfn2 overexpression decreased the mitochondrial ATP production rate, increased the rate of glycolytic ATP production, and disrupted mitochondrial bioenergetics. The increase in glycolysis was linked to increased hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) protein levels, elevated mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mt-ROS), and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential. Our data suggest that disrupting the mitochondrial fusion/fission balance to favor hyperfusion leads to a metabolic shift that promotes aerobic glycolysis. Thus, therapies designed to increase mitochondrial fusion should be approached with caution.

AB  - Cytochromes P450 have been confirmed to be involved in plant terpenoid biosynthesis and the degradation and metabolism of exogenous terpenoids in herbivorous organisms. Nevertheless, the underlying molecular mechanisms of P450-mediated terpenoid metabolism in numerous non-model insects remain largely unclear, which impedes our understanding of the chemical interactions between plants and insects. Herein, we identified a novel P450 gene belonging to CYP6 family, designated as CYP6HX3, from a specialist herbivore on camphor trees, Pagiophloeus tsushimanus. CYP6HX3 transcripts were constitutively abundant in the gut and fat body of larvae, and its expression in various tissues (except for head) was significantly induced by specific terpenoids in camphor trees (D-camphor, linalool, and eucalyptol) to varying degrees. Additionally, the CYP6HX3 protein model was constructed accurately, and it could stably bind to the three terpenoid molecules mainly via hydrophobic forces. The capability of CYP6HX3 to metabolize the three terpenoids was verified using metabolic assays in vitro, and this monooxygenase catalyzed the epoxidation of linalool to (R/S)-furanoid-linalool oxide. These results will enhance our understanding of insect metabolic resistance to natural chemicals and offer new targets for pest management.

AB  - Green plant bugs Apolygus lucorum Meyer-Dur (Hemiptera: Miridae) are among the most important piercing-sucking insect pests of the tea plant Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze (Theaceae) and severely reduce the quality and economic benefits of tea. The preference of A. lucorum for tea plants and weed hosts, including Humulus scandens (Lour.) (Moraceae), Artemisia lavandulaefolia DC., Conyza canadensis (L.) Cronq, and Artemisia annua L. (all Asteraceae), was evaluated using an olfactometer bioassay. Volatiles from weed host plants were analyzed by electronic nose and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The A. lucorum adults had a significant preference for the volatiles from A. lavandulaefolia compared to volatiles from tea. Myrcene, 1,8-cineole, and sabinene were the three dominant components in the A. lavandulaefolia flower volatiles. Artemisia lavandulaefolia was selected as a trap plant to assess the attractiveness to A. lucorum and the effects on natural enemies. The population density of A. lucorum on A. lavandulaefolia planted in tea plantations was significantly higher than that on tea. In particular, in tea fields with A. lavandulaefolia at 2 m spacing, the number of A. lucorum on trap strips of A. lavandulaefolia was higher than on tea at 10, 20, and 30 m away from the trap strips. The trap strips of A. lavandulaefolia also promoted a small increase in the presence of natural enemies in the tea agroecosystem, especially lacewings. Our research indicated that planting A. lavandulaefolia as a trap plant at 2 m spacing has the potential to manipulate the population of A. lucorum in tea plantations.

AB  - While the sources of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the open ocean are relatively well identified, its fate due to microbial activity is still evolving. Here, we explored how microbial community structure, growth, and grazing of phytoplankton and heterotrophic bacteria influenced the DOM pool and the transformation of its fluorescent fraction. Dilution experiments were performed during the productive season on the Patagonian Shelf (SW Atlantic Ocean), a region of intense biological activity, with peak productivity observed at the shelf break front. Although phytoplankton biomass was higher than that of bacteria, protists selectively preyed on the faster-growing bacterial population, denoting trophic specificity of grazers. High trophic coupling was suggested by the biomass distribution of protistan consumers and their prey, which predominantly exhibited an inverted trophic pyramid structure. An exception to this pattern was observed at the highly productive shelf break front, where a traditional bottom-heavy pyramid emerged, indicating that most phytoplankton evaded protist predation despite evidence of herbivory. Bacterial consumption of DOM appeared uncoupled from its total amount but was influenced by DOM complexity, while the bacterial production of humic-like substances from protistan plankton precursors observed in most experiments highlighted a potential pathway for carbon sequestration. Protistan grazers also significantly influenced DOM dynamics by scaling their DOM contribution in response to the intensity of grazing on heterotrophic bacteria, regardless of productivity levels. This effect likely arises from reducing the number of active DOM-consuming bacteria and by providing egestion DOM compounds. At the onset of the productive season, high bacterial growth rates stimulate protistan grazing, which serves as a link between bacterial biomass and higher trophic levels. However, as grazing pressure increases, protists can also contribute to the accumulation of a fraction of DOM.

AB  - Monitoring of emerging plant diseases in the Apennine mountains (central Italy) identified Cryptostroma corticale as the cause of the disease sooty bark of maple trees. The identified sites were located in rural or forested areas, next to buildings, in villages or suburbs, and one site was in a forest. Samples of symptomatic tissues were taken from Acer pseudoplatanus and/or A. campestre, as well as asymptomatic samples from A. campestre and Aesculus hippocastanum. All samples tested positive to a species-specific gPCR assay for the presence of C. corticale, indicating wide incidence of the disease in the northern Apennines of Italy, after attempted eradication of the first small group of infected plants were found in 2012.

AB  - Cadmium (Cd), a persistent and harmful heavy metal in the environment, can accumulate in the kidneys and cause nephrotoxicity. Selenium (Se) is a beneficial natural element that alleviates the toxicity of Cd. To ascertain the relationship between the protective mechanism of Se against Cd nephrotoxicity and ferroptosis and pyroptosis, we randomly divided 48 sheep into four groups and treated them with Cd chloride and/or sodium selenite for 50 days. The data confirmed that Cd apparently resulted in impaired kidney histology and function, depletion of GSH and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate contents and CAT and SOD activities, elevation of MDA level, as well as the reduction in selenoprotein mRNA (GPX1, GPX4, TXNRD1, SELP) levels and GPX4 protein level and immunofluorescence intensity. Meanwhile, Cd induced ferroptosis by causing iron overload, up-regulating PTGS2, NCOA4, TFR1, and LC3B mRNA levels and PTGS2 and LC3B-II/LC3B-I protein levels, reducing SLC7A11 and FTH1 mRNA and protein levels, and enhancing the immunofluorescence co-localization of FTH1/LC3B. Moreover, it was also found that Cd triggered pyroptosis, which was evidenced by the increase of NLRP3 immunohistochemical positive signal, GSDMD-N immunofluorescence intensity, IL-1 beta and IL-18 release and the levels of pyroptosis-related mRNA (NLRP3, ASC, Caspase-1, GSDMD, IL-1 beta and IL-18) and proteins (NLRP3, Caspase-1p20, GSDMD-N, IL-1 beta and IL-18). Notably, Se increased the expression level of GPX4 and the transcription factors TFAP2c and SP1, and ameliorated Cd-induced changes in aforementioned factors. In conclusion, GPX4 utilization by Se might be required to alleviate Cd-induced ferroptosis and pyroptosis in sheep kidney.

AB  - Microcystins (MCs), produced by harmful cyanobacterial blooms, pose a threat to aquatic ecosystems and public health in the Yangtze River basin, including Lake Chaohu, which implemented a ten-year fishing ban in 2021 for ecological restoration. This study provides the first basin-wide assessment of MC contamination in fish muscle tissues from Lake Chaohu and its major tributaries during the ban's initial phase (2022-2023), with comparisons to pre-ban data. Using UHPLC-MS/MS, we quantified MC-LR and MC-RR in fish from four trophic levels (planktivorous, omnivorous, herbivorous, and carnivorous). Results revealed that MC-RR was the predominant variant, and planktivorous fish exhibited the highest MC levels, followed by omnivorous, herbivorous, and carnivorous species, reflecting dynamics of trophic transfer. Overall, fish MC concentrations were significantly lower during the ban compared to pre-ban levels, demonstrating positive initial effects. Seasonal analysis revealed higher MC levels in warmer seasons, but detectable MCs persisted during cold seasons, reflecting ongoing contamination. Spatially, while fish in the lake exhibited higher MC concentrations, contamination was also detected in riverine fish, highlighting the basin-wide spread. Despite a lower overall health risk from fish consumption relative to the pre-ban period, high consumption of planktivorous species, especially during warm seasons and in lake regions, may still pose potential health risks. Additionally, MCs likely pose ecological risks to fish populations. These findings provide a crucial baseline for evaluating the long-term effectiveness of the fishing ban and underscore the need for integrated watershed management to safeguard both ecological and public health.

AB  - There are few existing methods for shortening the decellularization period for a human-sized whole-liver scaffold. Here, we describe a protocol that enables effective decellularization of the liver obtained from pigs weigh 120 +/- 4.2 kg within 72 h. Porcine livers (approx. 1.5 kg) were decellularized for 3 days using a combination of chemical and enzymatic decellularization agents. After trypsin, sodium deoxycholate, and Triton X-100 perfusion, the porcine livers were completely translucent. Our protocol was efficient to promote cell removal, the preservation of extracellular matrix (ECM) components, and vascular tree integrity. In conclusion, our protocol is efficient to promote human-sized whole-liver scaffold decellularization and thus useful to generate bioengineered livers to overcome the shortage of organs.

AB  - Simple Summary Inappropriate use of regular anthelmintic drugs has led to the development of anthelmintic resistance in sheep gastrointestinal nematodes (GINs) and consequently caused huge economic losses. Therefore, researchers worldwide are making efforts in finding novel strategies to control these parasites, which are mostly based on the rational use of synthetic drugs and the use of various alternatives, such as botanical anthelmintics. The aim of this study was to evaluate the anthelmintic efficacy of the essential oil (EO) of oregano (Origanum vulgare (L.)) against sheep GINs and to demonstrate the possibility of its use in veterinary practice. For obtaining clear results, both in vitro (egg hatch test) and in vivo efficacy tests (fecal egg count reduction test), as well as toxicity studies, on the hosts (clinical examination, blood count, and liver or kidney function test) were performed. The egg hatch test demonstrated the anthelmintic potential of the tested EO with an efficacy of 71.3%-93.7%, which was also demonstrated in the fecal egg count reduction test with an efficacy of 60.1% in total (on the second farm, 78.26%) shown on day 14 after treatment. Moreover, no negative or side effects of the applied EO formulation to the sheep were noticed in toxicity studies. The obtained results indicate the high potential of the O. vulgare EO for use in veterinary practice to control sheep GINs, as a part of an integrated strategy aimed to reduce the use of conventional anthelmintics. Therefore, these results may be significant for the future management of these infections. The development of anthelmintic resistance in sheep gastrointestinal nematodes (GINs) requires novel strategies for the sustainable control of these parasites. This study aimed to evaluate the anthelmintic efficacy of the Origanum vulgare (L.) essential oil (EO) against sheep GINs and to evaluate the possibility of its use in control practice. The in vitro egg hatch test was conducted at eight different concentrations (50, 12.5, 3.125, 0.781, 0.195, 0.049, 0.025, and 0.0125 mg/mL) of the tested EO. For the in vivo fecal egg count reduction test, the EO of O. vulgare was administrated orally at a mean single dose of 150 mg/kg to sheep from two farms in Southern Italy, whereby potential toxic effects to the hosts were also evaluated. In the egg hatch test, the inhibition of egg hatchability varied from 71.3% to 93.7%, depending on the concentration used. The high anthelmintic potential was confirmed in the fecal egg count reduction test with an average reduction of nematode eggs in feces of 43.2% and 60.1% on days 7 and 14 after treatment, respectively. In addition, no toxic effects were noticed during the clinical examination of sheep or by observing blood count and liver or kidney function test results. The obtained results suggest the strong activity of the O. vulgare EO against sheep GINs, probably due to a high percentage of carvacrol (76.21%), whereby it can be considered safe for sheep at the dose tested in vivo. Therefore, it is suitable for use in veterinary practice as a part of an integrated strategy for the control of sheep GINs.

AB  - ObjectiveStudies have suggested that prenatal exposure to inflammation increases the risk of neuropsychiatric disorders, including anxiety, depression, and cognitive dysfunction. Because of anatomical and hormonal alterations, pregnant women frequently experience sleep dysfunction, which can enhance the inflammatory response. The aim of this study was to explore the effects of maternal sleep deprivation on prenatal inflammation exposure-induced behavioral phenotypes in offspring and identify the associated mechanisms. MethodsPregnant mice received an intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on gestational day 15 and were subsequently subjected to sleep deprivation during gestational days 15-21. Anxiety-like behavior was evaluated by the open field test and the elevated plus maze test. Depression-like behavior was assessed by the tail suspension test and the forced swimming test. Cognitive function was determined using the Morris water maze test. The levels of markers of inflammation and synaptic function were examined employing general molecular biological techniques. ResultsThe results showed that prenatal exposure to LPS resulted in anxiety- and depression-like symptoms and learning and memory deficits, and these effects were exacerbated by maternal sleep deprivation. Furthermore, maternal sleep deprivation aggravated the prenatal LPS exposure-induced increase in the expression of interleukin (IL)-1 & beta;, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-& alpha; and decrease in the levels of postsynaptic density-95 and synaptophysin in the hippocampus. DiscussionCollectively, these results suggested that maternal sleep deprivation exacerbates anxiety, depression, and cognitive impairment induced by prenatal LPS exposure, effects that were associated with an inflammatory response and synaptic dysfunction.

AB  - Phosphorus (P) is one of the most abundant and essential nutrient elements for crop growth; however, it is often not available to plants in sufficient quantity. Organic amendment can enhance its availability in acid tropical soils. In this study, we investigated the effects of manure type on the pattern of P release in highly weathered tropical soils of contrasting lithology and mineralogy. Two fallow-land soils from Isinyi-Nando and UNN-Nsukka in southeastern Nigeria with antecedent Bray-2 available P of 3.73 and 20.83 mg kg-1, respectively, were amended with poultry droppings, pig slurry and cattle dung at soil-manure mass ratio of 100:6 and incubated. They were sub-sampled at 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 28 weeks of incubation. In the two soil types, the highest increases in soil pH and available P always occurred with poultry droppings, with P release peaking at 16 weeks. Manure-induced increases in available P were greater in the less oxide-rich Isinyi-Nando soil compared with the more oxide-rich UNN-Nsukka soil over the incubation duration, with lower values in the former than the latter without amendment (5.79 and 23.57 mg kg-1, respectively) and across treatments (40.59 and 45.16 mg kg-1, respectively). The P release patterns were defined more by increases and decreases in soil pH and organic carbon with incubation time, respectively, and less by soil aggregation. Poultry droppings could enhance P release around 16 weeks post-amendment of these soils. Further studies are needed on its synchronized bioavailability and the prospects of slow-mineralizing cattle dung beyond 28 weeks.

AB  - The aim of this research was to develop a solution based on existing methods and tools that would allow the automatic classification of selected images of cast iron microstructures. As part of the work, solutions based on artificial intelligence were tested and modified. Their task is to assign a specific class in the analyzed microstructure images. In the analyzed set, the examined samples appear in various zoom levels, photo sizes and colors. As is known, the components of the microstructure are different. In the examined photo, there does not have to be only one type of precipitate in each photo that indicates the correct microstructure of the same type of alloy, different shapes may appear in different amounts. This article also addresses the issue of data preparation. In order to isolate one type of structure element, the possibilities of using methods such as HOG (histogram of oriented gradients) and thresholding (the image was transformed into black objects on a white background) were checked. In order to avoid the slow preparation of training data, our solution was proposed to facilitate the labeling of data for training. The HOG algorithm combined with SVM and random forest were used for the classification process. In order to compare the effectiveness of the operation, the Faster R-CNN and Mask R-CNN algorithms were also used. The results obtained from the classifiers were compared to the microstructure assessment performed by experts.

AB  - Substituting nitrogen fertilizer with organic manure is a common fertilization practice in farmland, but its potential effect on heavy metal pollution and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions remains unclear. A three-year field experiment was conducted in the rice-wheat rotation system, with two different substitution ratios (25% and 50%) of sewage sludge compost (SS) and pig manure compost (PM). With the substitutions of SS and PM, the heavy metals, including Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb were accumulated in the soil, but the pollution load index was < 1 (0.39-0.66), indicating that soil was not polluted. Heavy metals Ni and Cu were mainly found in rice chaff, while Zn and Cd were accumulated in rice stalk, and the accumulation of Pb occurred in the leaf. For wheat, Ni, Cu, and Pb were accumulated in chaff, while grain and stalk had the highest concentrations of Zn and Cd, respectively. Moreover, the bioconcentration factor of heavy metals was 0-0.787, and their contents were below the standard limits for foods for rice and wheat in China, implying that the grains were unpolluted. Given the 5-8 fold increase in the sequestration rate of soil organic carbon with SS and PM substitutions, the annual net GHG emissions were reduced by 115-166%. Most importantly, 50% SS substitution exhibited the lowest net GHG emissions and highest rice and wheat yields. Overall, the results suggested that 50% SS substitution would be a feasible fertilization strategy that not only is unlikely to pose a high risk of soil and grain pollution but also significantly mitigates net GHG emissions and maintains high yields.

AB  - The generation of genetically engineered pig models that develop pancreas-specific tumors has the potential to advance studies and our understanding of pancreatic cancer in humans. TP53 mutation causes organ-nonspecific cancers, and PDX1-knockout results in the loss of pancreas development. The aim of the present study was to generate a PDX1-knockout pig chimera carrying pancreas complemented by TP53 mutant cells via phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-mediated blastomere aggregation using PDX1 and TP53 mutant blastomeres, as a pig model for developing tumors in the pancreas with high frequency. First, the concentration and exposure time to PHA to achieve efficient blastomere aggregation were optimized. The results showed that using 300 mu g/mL PHA for 10 min yielded the highest rates of chimeric blastocyst formation. Genotyping analysis of chimeric blastocysts derived from aggregated embryos using PDX1- and TP53-edited blastomere indicated that approximately 28.6% carried mutations in both target regions, while 14.3-21.4% carried mutations in one target. After the transfer of the chimeric blastocysts into one recipient, the recipient became pregnant with three fetuses. Deep sequencing analysis of the PDX1 and TP53 regions using ear and pancreas samples showed that one fetus carried mutations in both target genes, suggesting that the fetus was a chimera derived from embryo-aggregated PDX1 and TP53 mutant blastomeres. Two out of three fetuses carried only the PDX1 mutation, indicating that the fetuses developed from embryos not carrying TP53-edited blastomeres. The results of the present study could facilitate the further improvement and design of high-frequency developing pancreatic tumor models in pigs.

AB  - In nature, insects are constantly exposed to various environmental stressors. Heavy metals are one of the important factors of environmental pollution. Heavy metals can cause adverse effects on the growth rate and the survival of herbivores, as well as immune function. In addition to heavy metals, another factor that insects are exposed to in nature is entomopathogens. The cellular and the antioxidant enzyme responses of insects are major bioindicators against the stressors. In this study, the differences in the hemocyte counts and the antioxidant enzyme activities of Hyphantria cunea larvae exposed to the different amounts of zinc, copper, and nickel and Bacillus thuringiensis infection were determined. With metal exposure, the superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase activities increased, but the hemocyte counts decreased. Additionally, both the hemocyte counts and the enzyme activities increased with Bacillus thuringiensis infection. Although heavy metal exposure decreased the hemocyte counts and increased the antioxidant enzyme activities, the increase in the hemocyte counts with bacterial infection and the increased antioxidant enzyme activities demonstrated that the response to infection in the insect was stronger and the synergistic effect was occurred. As a result of this study, we found that the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase and the hemocyte counts varied in response to both metal exposure and bacterial infection.

AB  - In Italy, the number of farmed dairy buffaloes rose up to approximately 436,000 heads in 2023 (+22% in the last 15 years), a fourfold increase compared to the 1980s, due to the growing market interest in mozzarella cheese. The increased demand for mozzarella cheese, in turn, requires higher production, which can result in increased methane emission from the sector. Therefore, it is necessary to establish mitigation and selection schemes for low-emission strategies. The current study aimed to highlight sources of variation in methane emission from lactating Italian Mediterranean buffaloes measured using a laser methane detector in order to identify practical and methodological aspects to consider when designing experiments focused on methane emission evaluation. Methane (CH4), exhaled from 60 cows, was recorded twice a day during milking, over two weeks per month for at least three months throughout a whole lactation cycle. The animal (individual), days in milk, parity, month, operator, milking entry order, and milking session effects were significant for methane emission (p < 0.0001). Our results showed that laser methane detector may be used as a rapid tool for methane emission studies and highlighted which factors can account for individual measures. This instrument is easy to use, fast, versatile, and not too expensive. These characteristics make it suitable for large-scale herd screening and monitoring.

AB  - The surfactant protein-G (SP-G) has recently been discovered in the brain and linked to fluid balance regulations. Stroke is characterized by impaired vessel integrity, promoting water influx and edema formation. The neurovascular unit concept (NVU) has been generated to cover not only ischemic affections of neurons or vessels but also other regionally associated cells. This study provides the first spatio-temporal characterization of SP-G and NVU elements after experimental stroke. Immunofluorescence labeling was applied to explore SP-G, vascular and cellular markers in mice (4, 24, and 72 h of ischemia), rats (24 h of ischemia), and sheep (two weeks of ischemia). Extravasated albumin indicated vascular damage within ischemic areas. Quantifications revealed decreasing SP-G signals in the ischemia-affected neocortex and subcortex. Inverse immunosignals of SP-G and vascular elements existed throughout all models. Despite local associations between SP-G and the vasculature, a definite co-localization was not seen. Along with a decreased SP-G-immunoreactivity in ischemic areas, signals originating from neurons, glial elements, and the extracellular matrix exhibited morphological alterations or changed intensities. Collectively, this study revealed regional alterations of SP-G, vascular, and non-vascular NVU elements after ischemia, and may thus stimulate the discussion about the role of SP-G during stroke.

AB  - Stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders are often accompanied by dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. In patients suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), increased sensitivity of glucocorticoid negative feedback has regularly been observed. The single prolonged stress (SPS) paradigm was developed to model increased negative feedback and other aspects of PTSD in rats. In this study, we used a setup that precluded the evaluation of negative feedback but rather served to test the hypothesis of the enhanced glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling in higher brain areas. We injected corticosterone or vehicle 7 days after SPS and evaluated plasma corticosterone, as well as gene expression in the dorsal hippocampus and amygdala. We observed a strikingly rapid change in the expression of established GR target genes (t = 30 min) only in the SPS group on exogenous corticosterone injection. Our results extend the notion of increased GR sensitivity in PTSD to include transcriptional responses in the hippocampus.

AB  - In order to improve the slope movement stability and flexibility of quadruped robot, a theoretical design method of a flexible spine of a robot that was based on bionics was proposed. The kinematic characteristics of the spine were analyzed under different slopes with a Saanen goat as the research object. A Qualisys track manager (QTM) gait analysis system was used to obtain the trunk movement of goats under multiple slopes, and linear time normalization (LTN) was used to calibrate and match typical gait cycles to characterize the goat locomotion gait under slopes. Firstly, the spatial angle changes of cervical thoracic vertebrae, thoracolumbar vertebrae, and lumbar vertebrae were compared and analyzed under 0 degrees, 5 degrees, 10 degrees, and 15 degrees slopes, and it was found that the rigid and flexible coupling structure between the thoraco-lumbar vertebrae played an obvious role when moving on the slope. Moreover, with the increase in slope, the movement of the spine changed to the coupling movement of thoraco-lumbar coordination movement and a flexible swing of lumbar vertebrae. Then, the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) clustering algorithm was used to analyze the changes of the thoraco-lumbar vertebrae and lumbar vertebrae in different directions. Combined with anatomical knowledge, it was found that the motion of the thoraco-lumbar vertebrae and lumbar vertebrae in the goat was mainly manifested as a left-right swing in the coronal plane. Finally, on the basis of the analysis of the maximin and variation range of the thoraco-lumbar vertebrae and lumbar vertebrae in the coronal plane, it was found that the coupling motion of the thoraco-lumbar cooperative motion and flexible swing of the lumbar vertebrae at the slope of 10 degrees had the most significant effect on the motion stability. SSE, R-2, adjusted-R-2, and RMSE were used as evaluation indexes, and the general equations of the spatial fitting curve of the goat spine were obtained by curve fitting of Matlab software. Finally, Origin software was used to obtain the optimal fitting spatial equations under eight movements of the goat spine with SSE and adjusted-R-2 as indexes. The research will provide an idea for the bionic spine design with variable stiffness and multi-direction flexible bending, as well as a theoretical reference for the torso design of a bionic quadruped robot.

AB  - In nature, insect herbivory exerts continuous selective pressure on plants that, in turn, have developed a wide array of constitutive and inducible defenses to fight against attackers. Since plant defenses may affect higher trophic levels, including entomopathogens, further research is required to understand how plant compounds influence insect-pathogens interactions and their implications for integrated pest management programs. Here, we evaluated the impact of tomato defenses on the lethality produced by the bacterial entomopathogen Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) against second instar larvae of Spodoptera exigua. We first examined the effect of constitutive defenses from fifteen wild tomato species and forty cultivated varieties (Solanum lycopersicum) on S. exigua larval growth and susceptibility to Bt. The results showed larvae fed on wild tomato species had a reduced larval growth compared to larvae fed on cultivated varieties, whereas susceptibility to Bt was similar between both groups. We then selected six cultivated varieties, including those with high and low impacts on larval growth and Bt-induced mortality, to further explore the effect of inducible defenses. Elicitation of defenses by methyl jasmonate (MeJA) reduced larval growth and increased basal mortality. Additionally, when larvae were infected with Bt, MeJA treatment further increased their susceptibility to the entomopathogen. Metabolomic analysis confirmed a reprogramming of tomato leaf metabolism following MeJA elicitation, with an induced accumulation of bioactive compounds, such as saponins or flavonoids, known for their anti-herbivory properties in most tomato varieties. Overall, these data reveal that both constitutive and inducible tomato defenses not only protect the plant by directly affecting the insect pest but also enhance the efficacy of bacterial entomopathogens.

AB  - Sleep is considered to promote gist abstraction on the basis of spontaneous memory reactivation. As speculated in the theory of 'information overlap to abstract (iOtA) ', 'overlap ' between reactivated memories, beyond reactivation, is crucial to gist abstraction. Yet so far, empirical research has not tested this theory by manipulating the factor of 'overlap '. In the current study, 'overlap ' itself was manipulated by targeted memory reactivation (TMR), through simultaneously reactivating multiple memories that either contain or do not contain spatially overlapped gist information, to investigate the effect of overlapping reactivation on gist abstraction. This study had a factorial design of 2 factors with 2 levels respectively (spatial overlap/no spatial overlap, TMR/no-TMR). Accordingly, 82 healthy college students (aged 19 similar to 25, 57 females) were randomized into four groups. After learning 16 pictures, paired with 4 auditory cues (4 pictures - 1 cue) according to the grouping, participants were given a 90-minute nap opportunity. Then TMR cueing was conducted during N2 and slow wave sleep of the nap. Performance in memory task was used to measure gist abstraction. The results showed a significant main effect of TMR on both implicit and explicit gist abstraction, and a marginally significant interaction effect on explicit gist abstraction. Further analyses showed that explicit gist abstraction in the spatial overlap & TMR group was significantly better than in the control group. Moreover, explicit gist abstraction was positively correlated with spindle density. The current study thus indicates that TMR facilitates gist abstraction, and explicit gist abstraction may benefit more from overlapping reactivation.

AB  - Simple Summary: The redness of longissimus dorsi can be improved significantly by administrating growing-finishing pigs with glycerin, vitamin C, and niacinamide; however, it remains unclear if these supplements can have significant impacts on the compositions of gut microbiota and metabolites. The results indicated that dietary supplementation with glycerin, vitamin C, and niacinamide significantly promoted the growth of iron-acquiring microbiota in feces, reduced the expression of some virulence factor genes of fecal pathogens, and increased the fecal levels of ferric ion, L-proline and some secondary bile acids. The findings of this study provide new ideas for improving meat quality by modulating gut flora and metabolites with feed interventions. The addition of glycerin, vitamin C, and niacinamide to pig diets increased the redness of longissimus dorsi; however, it remains unclear how these supplements affect gut microbiota and metabolites. A total of 84 piglets (20.35 +/- 2.14 kg) were randomly allotted to groups A (control), B (glycerin-supplemented), C (vitamin C and niacinamide-supplemented), and D (glycerin, vitamin C and niacinamide-supplemented) during a feeding experiment. Metagenomic and metabolomic technologies were used to analyze the fecal compositions of bile acids, metabolites, and microbiota. The results showed that compared to pigs in group A, pigs in group D had lower virulence factor expressions of lipopolysaccharide (p < 0.05), fatty acid resistance system (p < 0.05), and capsule (p < 0.01); higher fecal levels of ferric ion (p < 0.05), allolithocholic acid (p < 0.01), deoxycholic acid (p < 0.05), tauroursodeoxycholic acid dihydrate (p < 0.01), glycodeoxycholic acid (p < 0.05), L-proline (p < 0.01) and calcitriol (p < 0.01); and higher (p < 0.05) abundances of iron-acquiring microbiota (Methanobrevibacter, Clostridium, Clostridiaceae, Clostridium_sp_CAG_1000, Faecalibacterium_sp_CAG_74_58_120, Eubacteriales_Family_XIII_Incertae_Sedis, Alistipes_sp_CAG_435, Alistipes_sp_CAG_514 and Methanobrevibacter_sp_YE315). Supplementation with glycerin, vitamin C, and niacinamide to pigs significantly promoted the growth of iron-acquiring microbiota in feces, reduced the expression of some virulence factor genes of fecal pathogens, and increased the fecal levels of ferric ion, L-proline, and some secondary bile acids. The administration of glycerol, vitamin C, and niacinamide to pigs may serve as an effective measure for muscle redness improvement by altering the compositions of fecal microbiota and metabolites.

Both collar and backpack with Iridium transmission achieved high success rates of locations and the rate increased with decreasing interval length between locations. The collar with Globalstar transmission had very low fix rates at 13-h intervals and was insufficient to produce robust results. The backpack harness was still functional after 20 months of use and proved to be a reliable alternative to collars.

AB  - Current study was conducted to appraise the cryoprotective influence of crocetin on quality, oxidative status, and fertility potential of bubaline spermatozoa. Collected semen from four bulls was diluted in five aliquots with (10 mu M, 5 mu M, 2 mu M, 1 mu M, and control [0 mu M] supplementation of crocetin). After gentle dilution (37 ?), cooling (4 C, in 2 h), equilibration (4 ?, for 4 h) and packaging of samples was done in straws (polyvinyl French, 0.5 ml), and then frozen (programmable cell freezer). This study established that crocetin supplementation significantly (p < 0.05) improves CASA (Computer Assisted Sperm motion Analyzer) total motility (%), rapid velocity (%), average-path, and curved-line velocities (mu m/sec, 10 mu M vs. control), and progressive motility (%), straight-line velocity (mu m/sec), total antioxidant capacity (TAC, mu Mol/l), ATP concentrations (nmol/million), and fertility potential (%) (10 mu M vs. control, and 1 mu M), and mitochondrial potential (%) of buffalo spermatozoa (5, and 10 mu M vs. control). Crocetin supplementation significantly (p < 0.05) alleviates DNA fragmentation, seminal plasma ROS (10(4) RLU/20/25 million, RLU = Relative light unit) levels, and lipid peroxidation (LPO, mu Mol/ml) in buffalo spermatozoa (10 mu M vs. control). In a nutshell, crocetin supplementation improves post-thaw quality by means of motility parameters, motion kinematics, TAC, and ATP concentrations, and fertility potential, and abolished DNA fragmentation parameters, seminal plasma ROS, and LPO concentrations of buffalo spermatozoa. The exact mechanism by which crocetin acts are not fully elucidated; however, it is probable to speculate that the reduction in ROS, and LPO recorded in this study may be related to scavenging ability of this antioxidant during cryopreservation.

AB  - In the fields of agricultural, food and medical research, the potential impacts of tea on human health are of special interest because tea (Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze) is continuously consumed by many people in the world. The evaluation of the diversity of genotypes found in tea germplasm can aid in the improvement of the breeding programme. In this study, the genetic diversity of 30 tea genotypes from two commercial sites of tea production in Iran was investigated by using morphological and 12 ISSR markers. Morphological analysis showed that the diversity between samples of tea was limited, and the narrow matching range was calculated. In cluster analysis at level 0.63, samples were divided into four groups. The application of 12 ISSR primers produced 91 polymorphic bands. PIC test showed a range of 0.41-0.48. Based on the ISSR data, the matching range was obtained in the range of 0.24-0.93. In cluster analysis, samples at level 0.58 were divided into five groups. According to the results, it can be understood that these series of traits and primers can very well recognize genetic differences. Using these markers, genetic diversity was observed among tea genotypes, but this diversity was not such as to be able to separate genotypes of various regions from each other. The results showed that the tea genotypes in Iran had high genetic diversity. As a consequence, the findings of our study will help the development of tea germplasm conservation strategies and their sustainable use in breeding programmes.

AB  - Manure management systems have a major impact on odor from swine operations. A study was conducted to compare deep-pit manure management systems to flushing barn manure management systems for odor reduction and organic matter degradation. Bioreactors were used to mimic manure management systems in which manure and lagoon effluent were loaded initially, and subsequent manure was added daily at 5% of its storage capacity (1 L). Final manure-to-lagoon effluent ratios were 10:0 (deep-pit manure management system), 7:3 (Korean flushing systems), 5:5 (enhanced flushing systems), and 2:8 (enhanced flushing systems). At the end of the trial, at 4 (2:8), 10 (5:5), or 14 (10:0, 7:3) d, manure and gas concentrations of odorants were measured, including total solids (TS), total N (TN), and total C (TC) of manure. Odor was evaluated using the odor activity values (OAVs), and regression analysis was used to determine the effects of dilution and TS on manure properties and OAVs. Solids in the manure were positively correlated to TN, TC, straight chain fatty acids (SCFAs), branch chain fatty acids (BCFAs), total phenols, and total indoles and positively correlated to OAV for SCFAs, BCFAs, ammonia, total phenols, and total indoles. Reducing TS by 90% reduced BCFA, ammonia, phenols, and indoles by equal amounts in air. Carbon dioxide was the main C source evolved, averaging over 90%, and CH4 increased with dilution quadratically. Overall, reducing solids in manure by dilution had the biggest impact on reducing odor and increasing organic C degradation.

AB  - Shoot herbivores may influence the communities of herbivores associated with the roots via inducible defenses. However, the molecular mechanisms and hormonal signaling underpinning the systemic impact of leaf herbivory on root-induced responses against nematodes remain poorly understood. By using tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) as a model plant, we explored the impact of leaf herbivory by Manduca sexta on the performance of the root knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita. By performing glasshouse bioassays, we found that leaf herbivory reduced M. incognita performance in the roots. By analyzing the root expression profile of a set of oxylipin-related marker genes and jasmonate root content, we show that leaf herbivory systemically activates the 13-Lipoxigenase (LOX) and 9-LOX branches of the oxylipin pathway in roots and counteracts the M. incognita-triggered repression of the 13-LOX branch. By using untargeted metabolomics, we also found that leaf herbivory counteracts the M. incognita-mediated repression of putative root chemical defenses. To explore the signaling involved in this shoot-to-root interaction, we performed glasshouse bioassays with grafted plants compromised in jasmonate synthesis or perception, specifically in their shoots. We demonstrated the importance of an intact shoot jasmonate perception, whereas having an intact jasmonate biosynthesis pathway was not essential for this shoot-to-root interaction. Our results highlight the impact of leaf herbivory on the ability of M. incognita to manipulate root defenses and point to an important role for the jasmonate signaling pathway in shoot-to-root signaling.

AB  - Simple Summary Simple Summary: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are adult stem cells capable of differentiating into various cell types, including osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and adipocytes. Renowned for their immunomodulatory and regenerative properties, MSCs hold great promise as tools for tissue repair and therapeutic applications. To facilitate the large-scale production of sheep umbilical cord MSCs (UCMSCs), the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene was introduced into UCMSCs to promote immortalization. This study provides valuable insights into (a) the proliferation and anti-aging capabilities of transgenic MSCs compared to primary MSCs; (b) the absence of potential tumorigenicity exhibited in TERT-UCMSCs; and (c) the differentiation potential of TERT-UCMSCs. Immortalized MSCs exhibit enhanced proliferation and anti-aging abilities without tumorigenicity concerns, making them a safe immortalized cell line suitable for medical treatments.Abstract Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) possess significant differentiation potential, making them highly promising in medicine and immunotherapy due to their regenerative capabilities and exosome secretion. However, challenges such as limited cell divisions and complex testing hinder large-scale MSC production. In this study, we successfully established an immortalized MSC line by transfecting the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene into MSCs isolated from pregnant sheep umbilical cords. This approach effectively inhibits cell senescence and promotes cell proliferation, enabling the generation of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UCMSCs) on a larger scale. Our findings demonstrate that these transfected TERT-UCMSCs exhibit enhanced proliferative capacity and a reduced aging rate compared to regular UCMSCs while maintaining their stemness without tumorigenicity concerns. Consequently, they hold great potential for medical applications requiring large quantities of functional MSCs.

AB  - Short cutting is the main method of tea propagation. The callus formation at the base of cuttings has a certain absorption function. The early callus emergence is conducive to the resistance of cuttings to water and nutrient stress, thus promoting rooting and survival. In order to investigate the effect of light quality on the callus formation at the base of cuttings, this study used white (WL), red (660 nm, RL), and blue (430 nm, BL) light emitting diodes (LEDs) to treat tea cuttings. The results showed that compared with WL, BL promoted callus formation and RL inhibited callus formation. In order to explore the internal molecular mechanism of light quality affecting the difference of cutting callus formation, phytohormone determination and full-length transcriptome sequencing were conducted on mature leaves under different light quality treatments. The analysis of phytohormone showed that the contents of abscisic acid (ABA), indole-3-carboxylic acid (ICA), trans-zeatin (tZ), gibberellin 9 (GA9) and 5-deoxystrigol (5DS) were consistent with the callus formation trend, which showed BL > WL > RL. Full-length transcriptome sequencing was performed on mature leaves of cuttings under darkness (DL, CK), WL, RL and BL. Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) analysis of genes, many genes participated in the "plant hormone signal transduction (ko04075)", such as auxin early response protein AUX/IAA, auxin response factor ARF, two-component response regulator B-ARR, and DELLA genes had highest expression under BL. Meanwhile, auxin synthesis and transport related genes were analyzed,, including L-tryptophan-pyruvate aminotransferase 1-like TAA1, flavin monooxygenase gene YUCCA, PIN1,3,4 and PIN-LIKES6 and 7, which also had the highest expression under BL. In conclusion, this study revealed the molecular mechanism of light quality regulating the callus formation of tea cutting, and provided new insights for the application of light quality in tea breeding.

AB  - Alfalfa silage due to its high protein can lead to easier feeding management, but its high proportion of rumen-degradable protein can reduce rumen nitrogen utilization. Nevertheless, increasing dietary energy can enhance ruminal microbial protein synthesis. Thirty-two Suffolk female sheep were used in this study, with a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement of treatment. The four treatments were a combination of two forage types (alfalfa hay; AH vs. alfalfa silage; AS) and two rumen-degradable starch levels (low RDS; LR vs. high RDS; HR) with a 15 d adaptation and 60 d experimental period. The rumen content and rumen epithelium samples were collected after slaughter. Feeding AS increased the rumen isobutyrate, valerate, ammonia-N (NH3-N) concentration, urase activity, and papillae height (p < 0.05) and reduced the feed to gain (F:G), rumen bacterial protein (BCP), rumen lactic acid concentration, and papillae width (p < 0.05) of sheep. Increased RDS in the diet improved the daily matter intake, average daily gain, and rumen weight, reduced the F:G, and enhanced the rumen nitrogen capture rate by decreasing total amino acids and the NH3-N concentration to increase BCP, aquaporins 3 gene, and protein expression. The rumen microbiota also changed as the HR diet reduced the Chao index (p < 0.05). The metabolomics analysis showed that feeding AS upregulated the rumen tryptophan metabolism and steroid hormone biosynthesis, while the purine metabolism, linoleic acid metabolism, and amino acid biosynthesis were downregulated. Furthermore, increased RDS in the diet upregulated rumen lysine degradation and sphingolipid metabolism, while aromatic amino acid biosynthesis was downregulated. Additionally, the correlation analysis results showed that ADG was positively correlated with 5-aminopentanoic acid, and three microorganisms (unclassified_f__Selenomonadaceae, Quinella, Christensenellaceae_R-7_group) were positively correlated with the rumen isobutyrate, valerate, NH3-N concentration, urase activity, tryptophan metabolism, and steroid hormone biosynthesis and negatively correlated with linoleic acid metabolism and amino acid biosynthesis in sheep. In summary, increased RDS in the diet improved the growth performance and rumen N utilization and reduced bacterial diversity in sheep. The alfalfa silage diet only increased feed efficiency; it did not affect growth performance. Additionally, it decreased rumen nitrogen utilization, linoleic acid, and amino acid biosynthesis. Nevertheless, there were limited interactions between forage and RDS; increased RDS in the AS diet enhanced the nitrogen capture rate of rumen microorganisms for alfalfa silage, with only slight improvements in the purine metabolism, linoleic acid, and amino acid synthesis.

AB  - To reduce the utilization of chemical fertilisers, which cause substantial nitrogen loss and widespread nonpoint source pollution, the application of organic manure has become an increasingly popular alternative in rice agriculture. It plays key roles in improving soil quality and maintaining rice yields, but its integrated impacts on trace gas emissions and heavy metal contents in rice grains remain poorly documented. We conducted a three-year field experiment with two application ratios (25% and 50%) of sewage sludge compost (S) and pig manure compost (P) during the rice season in eastern China. The emissions of methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), ammonia (NH3), and the grain contents of nickel (Ni), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd), and lead (Pb) were measured. Compared with urea, partial organic application, particularly 50%S and 50%P, led to a considerable increase in CH4 emission (52%-71%), global warming potential (GWP, 50%-69%), and greenhouse gas intensity (46%-68%). However, it substantially decreased N2O emission and NH3 volatilisation, thus lowering the cumulative nitrogen loss by 32%-62%. Moreover, the average concentrations of Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb in rice grains were 100-151 mu g kg(-1), 2.31-2.78 mg kg(-1), 20.3-24.3 mg kg(-1), 44.3-123 mu g kg(-1), and 8.69-15.2 mu g kg(-1), respectively, which were significantly lower than food standard limits for rice in China. Both 25%S and 50%S achieved the highest grain yields while significantly decreasing grain Ni and Cd contents. Health risk assessment showed that the target hazard quotient of all the metals was < 1 (0.006-0.73), and the hazard index that represents additive effects of pollutants was higher than the threshold, except for 25%S and 50%S. The results suggested 25%S as a potential fertilisation practice in rice fields that not only maintains low GWP and high yields but also seldom poses grain pollution or health risks.

AB  - Air pollution (AP) is a critical environmental factor influencing public health, with well-documented associations with upper respiratory tract (URT) diseases. This study investigates the relationship between ENT emergency department (ENT-ED) visits at Azienda Ospedale Universit & agrave; di Padova (AOPD) and daily concentrations of environmental pollutants during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic (March 2020-March 2021), compared to pre-pandemic data from 2017. The study focuses on patients diagnosed with URT inflammatory diseases, excluding those with COVID-19 infection, who sought care at the AOPD ENT-ED. Environmental data, including meteorological variables, air pollutants, and major aeroallergen levels, were collected from regional monitoring stations. A total of 4594 patients were admitted in 2020/2021, marking a 37% reduction from 2017, with URT inflammatory admissions decreasing by 52%. A significant decline in PM10, NO2 and Alternaria levels was observed, whereas Betullaceae and Corylaceae concentrations significantly increased. Multivariate analyses revealed strong associations between aeroallergen exposure and ENT admissions, particularly for Alternaria, which had a notable impact on total admissions (p < 0.001) and was significantly linked to cases of otitis media and tonsillitis. PM10 concentrations on specific days preceding ED visits were associated with increased incidences of pharyngitis and rhinosinusitis (p < 0.05). These findings reinforce the connection between environmental pollutants and ENT emergency visits, highlighting the adverse effects of AP and climate variables on URT diseases, even during a pandemic when enhanced airway protection measures were in place. This study underscores the necessity of stringent air quality regulations and interdisciplinary strategies to mitigate environmental health risks and inform future public health policies.

AB  - The accumulation of potentially harmful substances in tea garden soils and tea leaves, especially persistent organic pollutants (POPs), is a special concern for tea consumers worldwide. However, their potential health and ecological risks in tea gardens have rarely been investigated. This study proposed measures to improve the degradation ability of POPs by the tea rhizosphere and to reduce the human health risks caused by POPs after tea consumption. In this study, the binding energy values of six types of POPs and the degraded protein were used to reflect the degradation ability and calculated using molecular dynamic simulations. The main root secretions (i. e., catechin, glucose, arginine, and oxalic acid) were selected and applied with a combination of tea fertilizer and trace element combination (i.e., urea, straw, and copper element), leading to an improved degradation ability (49.59 %) of POPs. To investigate the mechanisms of the factors that affect the degradation ability, molecular docking, tensor singular value decomposition methods, multivariate correlation analysis and 2D-QSAR model were used. The results showed that the solvation energy and solvent accessible surface area are the main forces, and the molecular weight, boiling point, and topological radius of the POPs were the key molecular features affecting their degradation ability. Based on the three key characteristics, a diet avoidance scheme (i.e., avoiding lysine, maslinic acid, ethanol, perfluorocaproic acid, and cholesterol with tea), which can reduce the binding ability of POP residues to aromatic hydrocarbon receptors by 506.13 %. This work will provide theoretical strategies to improve the quality and safety of tea production and reduce the potential risks of harmful substance residues in tea garden soils and tea leaves.

AB  - Systematics and taxonomy are the backbone of all components of biology and ecology, yet cryptic species present a major challenge for accurate species identification. This is especially problematic as they represent a substantial portion of undiscovered biodiversity, and have implications for not only species conservation, but even assaying potential risk of zoonotic spillover. Here, we use integrative approaches to delineate potential cryptic species in horseshoe bats (Rhinolophidae), evaluate the phenotypic disparities between cryptic species, and identify key traits for their identification. We tested the use of multispecies coalescent models (MSC) using Bayesian Phylogenetic and Phylogeography (BPP) and found that BPP was useful in delineating potential cryptic species, and consistent with acoustic traits. Our results show that around 40% of Asian rhinolophid species are potentially cryptic and have not been formally described. In order to avoid potential misidentification and allow species to be accurately identified, we identified quantitative noseleaf sella and acoustic characters as the most informative traits in delineating between potential cryptic species in Rhinolophidae. This highlights the physical differences between cryptic species that are apparent in noseleaf traits which often only qualitatively described but rarely measured. Each part of the noseleaf including the sella, lateral lappets, and lancet furrows, play roles in focusing acoustic beams and thus, provide useful characteristics to identify cryptic Rhinolophus species. Finally, species delimitation for cryptic species cannot rely on genetic data alone, but such data should be complemented by other evidence, including phenotypic, acoustic data, and geographic distributions to ensure accurate species identification and delineation.

AB  - The green seaweed Ulva is close to becoming popular due to its suitability as potential feedstock production and for food items. However, there is a general lack of studies on the aversion or acceptability of this alga by marine organisms, particularly on its role as a chemoattractant and/or phagostimulant activity. Here we tested the effect of Ulva compressa and other biochemicals as potential chemostimulating compounds for a valuable sea urchin species, Paracentrotus lividus, selected as model species for our tests. Sea urchins' chemical sensitivity was estimated by analysing movements of spines, pedicellariae, tube feet, and individual locomotion using an innovative bioassay. Our results showed that all forms of Ulva (fresh, defrosted, and fragmented) resulted in an effective stimulus, evoking in sea urchins strong responses with robust activation of spines and tube feet, where the defrosted one was the most stimulating. Among the amino acids tested, glycine, alanine, and glutamine produced a significant response, highlighting for the latter a concentration-response relationship. Sea urchins responded to glucose, not to fructose and sucrose. Spirulina resulted as the most effective stimulus, acting in a dose-dependent manner. Major results indicate the role of Ulva as a chemostimulant and strongly attractant for such herbivore species. From an applied point of view, the presence of potential Ulva's feed-related compounds, acting as chemoattractants (to reduce food searching time) and/or feeding stimulants (to stimulate ingestion), would improve the several applications of Ulva in the formulation of the feeds for sustainable aquaculture.

AB  - Urban groundwater contamination poses significant challenges to environmental sustainability and public health, yet comprehensive risk assessments using advanced computational methods remain limited in African contexts. This research addresses this gap by integrating the Pollution Index for Groundwater (PIG) and the novel Human Health Risk (HHRISK) code to evaluate multi-pathway exposure risks from potentially toxic elements (PTEs) in Onitsha, Nigeria. Results show that 87.5% of samples were severely contaminated, primarily driven by alarming exceedances of Pb (4000% above World Health Organization guidelines), Cd (2570% above), and Ni (471% above). HHRISK analysis revealed significant health risks, with mean cumulative non-carcinogenic Hazard Index (HI) values of 16.3 (children) and 9.7 (adults), and carcinogenic risks averaging 2.1E-02 (children) and 1.1E-03 (adults); both orders of magnitude exceeding the acceptable thresholds. Regional comparisons indicated that risk magnitude scales directly with industrial intensity and anthropogenic inputs, contradicting progress toward Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 3 (Good Health and Well-being) and 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) while challenging SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) principles. The disproportionate impact on children highlights environmental justice concerns. This study advances scientific understanding of environmental chemistry and provides a basis for urban water management in rapidly urbanizing regions. Urgent remediation strategies and policies are proposed to safeguard public health and ensure critical environmental sustainability.

AB  - Simple Summary: Mulberry leaves have high nutritional and bioactive substance contents and are considered an alternate livestock feeding resource in China. However, due to the high content of antinutritional factors (e.g., tannin), the use of mulberry leaves is limited in animal production. Microbial fermentation reduces the content of antinutritional substances and increases the content of probiotics and bioactive constituents. Therefore, we fed finishing pigs 10% fermented mulberry leaves, which improved the digestion and absorption of nutrients, intestinal morphology, antioxidant ability, and immunity to enhance the gut health of finishing pigs. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of supplementing fermented mulberry leaves (FML) on intestinal morphology, antioxidant capacity, and immune function in the gut of finishing pigs. Eighteen 132-day-old healthy crossbred (Duroc x Landrace x Yorkshire) male castrated pigs were randomly divided into two treatment groups with nine replicates per group. The control (CON) group was fed the basal diet, and the FML group was fed the basal diet supplemented with 10% FML. The experiment lasted 69 days. The results showed that 10% FML improved gut health. The apparent total tract digestibility in dry matter, crude protein, crude fiber, neutral detergent fiber, acidic detergent fiber, ether extract, and crude ash increased in the 10% FML group of finishing pigs compared to the CON group (p < 0.05). Duodenal, jejunal, and ileal intestinal morphology, such as villus height and villus-height-to-crypt-depth ratio, increased in the 10% FML group compared to the CON group, whereas crypt depth decreased in the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum (p < 0.05). Total antioxidant capacity increased in the ileum of the 10% FML group compared with the CON group (p < 0.05). The FML supplementation improved the contents of duodenal immunoglobulin A, jejunal interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-8, ileal interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-6, interferon-gamma, and immunoglobulins A and M compared to the control group (p < 0.05). Moreover, FML downregulated the mRNA expression levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha in the duodenum, Toll-like receptor 4, nuclear factor-kappa B-P65, and myeloid differentiation factor 88 in the jejunum, and Toll-like receptor 4 and nuclear factor-kappa B-P65 in the ileum (p < 0.05). The FML also upregulated Montrose uniting church 1 in the duodenum and claudin 2 in the ileum (p < 0.05). In conclusion, dietary supplementation with 10% FML improved the gut health of finishing pigs and FML is a potential feed ingredient for pig breeding.

AB  - Fipronil is a phenylpyrazole insecticide that is widely used as a pesticide and a veterinary drug, although studies suggest that it could be toxic to mammals. The objectives of this study were to examine the pharmacokinetic profile of fipronil in mice, dogs, and cats, and to evaluate its effects on emotional and cognitive behaviors of dogs and cats using the data obtained from mice. The assessment of in vivo kinetics of fipronil was conducted in mice and dogs. We also performed behavioral tests (elevated plus-maze and Y-maze) and measured the levels of neurotransmitters in mice exposed to fipronil. In addition, the in vitro metabolism of fipronil were evaluated using liver microsomes of rats, mice, dogs, and cats. The results revealed that fipronil is distributed throughout the body (blood, brain, adipose tissue, and liver) of mice after dermal application. It was metabolized to fipronil sulfone primarily in the liver. The data on kinetics show that both fipronil and fipronil sulfone have a longer halflife in dogs and cats than in mice. The behavioral tests indicated that fipronil and fipronil sulfone could affect emotional and cognitive behaviors and alter the levels of neurotransmitters (dopamine in the striatum and serotonin in the hippocampus) in mice. Furthermore, we found that dogs and cats have a low ability to metabolize fipronil than mice and rats. However, further comprehensive studies are needed to determine whether fipronil affects the emotional and cognitive behaviors when administered to dogs and cats. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the pharmacokinetic data and verify the effects of fipronil on emotional and cognitive behaviors of dogs and cats using the data obtained from mice.

AB  - Zinc deficiency during adolescence poses a significant yet understudied risk to brain development. The study aimed to investigate the effects of marginal zinc deficiency during adolescence on emotion and cognition, morphological changes and neuronal arrangement of hippocampus and cortical, and proBDNF, mBDNF and TrkB expression levels. The emotion was assessed using the open-field test and three-chamber test. Additionally, cognition was evaluated using the Morris water maze test and novel object recognition test. Morphological changes were evaluated using H&E staining, while Nissl staining was employed to analyze neuronal arrangement. Additionally, proBDNF, mBDNF and TrkB expression levels were quantified by western blot. The results showed that adolescent marginal zinc deficiency induced risk-taking behavior, impaired spatial learning and memory, and caused new object recognition deficits without affecting sociability. Moreover, marginal zinc deficiency critically disrupted hippocampal and cortical development, and aberrant neuronal arrangement. The expression levels of BDNF for both form states were not statistically significant upregulation in marginal zinc deficiency mice compared to controls, along with significantly increased TrkB expression. These findings suggested that adolescent marginal zinc deficiency increased the expression of BDNF and TrkB, as well as abnormal hippocampal and cortical development. These alterations may explain the observed abnormal behavior, including risk-taking behavior, impaired spatial learning and memory, and new object recognition decay.

AB  - Tidal estuaries provide crucial pathways for contaminant transport. The salinity levels in estuaries and coasts are conserved substances that function as natural tracers to easily understand the offshore transport of substances that are subject to environmental factors. A three-dimensional (3D) circulation and mass transport model were utilized to delineate the salinity plume in a tidal estuary and continental shelf. The numerical modeling results were compared with the tidal amplitudes and phases, velocities, and salinities at different gauging stations in 2017. Quantitatively, the simulation and measurement results are in reasonably good agreement. Furthermore, the validated model was adopted to estimate the recovery times in tidal estuaries that are subjected to extreme freshwater discharges that come from the upstream reaches during typhoon events and to analyze the influences of freshwater discharge and wind stress on the river plume around the continental shelf. The simulated results revealed that the salinity recovery time at the river mouth due to Typhoon Saola in 2012 was less than 8 days. Increased inputs from freshwater discharge resulted in changes in the distances and areas of the river plumes. Linear regression relationships between the plume distance/plume area and the total freshwater discharge inputs were established. Neap and high slack tides were associated with the maximum plume distances and areas. Excluding tidal forcing resulted in larger plume distances and areas compared to the case in which tidal forcing was considered. The southward-favorable and northward-favorable plumes were controlled by northeasterly winds and southwesterly winds, respectively. The relative importance of freshwater discharges and wind forcing was explored. The results indicate that freshwater discharges frequently dominated the river plume, except when strong southwesterly or northeasterly winds prevailed.

AB  - Employing animal models to study heart failure (HF) has become indispensable to discover and test novel therapies, but their translatability remains challenging. Although cytoskeletal alterations are linked to HF, the tubulin signature of common experimental models has been incompletely defined. Here, we assessed the tubulin signature in a large set of human cardiac samples and myocardium of animal models with cardiac remodeling caused by pressure overload, myocardial infarction or a gene defect. We studied levels of total, acetylated, and detyrosinated & alpha;-tubulin and desmin in cardiac tissue from hypertrophic (HCM) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) patients with an idiopathic (n = 7), ischemic (n = 7) or genetic origin (n = 59), and in a pressure-overload concentric hypertrophic pig model (n = 32), pigs with a myocardial infarction (n = 28), mature pigs (n = 6), and mice (n = 15) carrying the HCM-associated MYBPC32373insG mutation. In the human samples, detyrosinated & alpha;-tubulin was increased 4-fold in end-stage HCM and 14-fold in pediatric DCM patients. Acetylated & alpha;-tubulin was increased twofold in ischemic patients. Across different animal models, the tubulin signature remained mostly unaltered. Only mature pigs were characterized by a 0.5-fold decrease in levels of total, acetylated, and detyrosinated & alpha;-tubulin. Moreover, we showed increased desmin levels in biopsies from NYHA class II HCM patients (2.5-fold) and the pressure-overload pig model (0.2-0.3-fold). Together, our data suggest that desmin levels increase early on in concentric hypertrophy and that animal models only partially recapitulate the proliferated and modified tubulin signature observed clinically. Our data warrant careful consideration when studying maladaptive responses to changes in the tubulin content in animal models.

AB  - Tactile information from the whiskers (vibrissae) travels through the somatosensory cortex to the entorhinal cortex and the hippocampus, influencing development and psychological well-being. The lack of whiskers affects cognitive functions, spatial memory, neuronal firing, spatial mapping, and neurogenesis in the dorsal hippocampus. Recent studies underline the importance of tactile experiences in emotional health, noting that while tactile stimuli modulate the dorsal hippocampus, the effects of tactile deprivation on anxiety-like behaviors and neural activity in regions like the ventral hippocampus and amygdala are less understood. This study aims to investigate the impact of permanent tactile deprivation on modifying anxiety-like behaviors and c-Fos expression (a marker of neuronal activity) in the dorsolateral and central nucleus of the amygdala and the ventral hippocampus, two regions involved in emotional memory and anxiety. We sectioned the infraorbital nerve, responsible for transmitting whisker information, in CD1 mice to examine how tactile deprivation modifies the behavioral activity in the Elevated Plus Maze and Open-Field Test. Our data revealed a reduction in anxiety-related behaviors post-deprivation, which was linked to a significant decrease in c-Fos expression in the barrel cortex, as well as ventral hippocampus (CA1, dentate gyrus) and dorsolateral, central nucleus of the amygdala, suggesting impaired processing in emotional-regulator brain regions. In conclusion, tactile inputs reduce neuronal activity regulators in brain regions related to emotional regulation, which may trigger possible failures in risk perception or self-protective behaviors associated with the lack of appropriate anxiety responses.

AB  - Fibroblasts are the main producers of extracellular matrix (ECM) responsible for ECM maintenance and repair, a process often disrupted in chronic lung diseases. The accompanying mechanical changes adversely affect resident cells and overall lung function. Numerous models have been used to elucidate fibroblast behavior that are now evolving toward complex three-dimensional (3-D) models incorporating ECM, aiming to replicate the cells' native environment. Little is known about the cellular changes that occur when moving from two-dimensional (2-D) to 3-D cell culture. This study compared the gene expression profiles of primary human lung fibroblasts from seven subjects with normal lung function, that were cultured for 24 h on 2-D collagen I-coated tissue culture plastic and in 3-D collagen I hydrogels, which are commonly used to mimic ECM in various models, from contraction assays to intricate organ-on-a-chip models. Comparing 3-D with 2-D cell culture, 6,771 differentially expressed genes (2,896 up, 3,875 down) were found; enriched gene sets within the downregulated genes, identified through Gene Set Enrichment Analysis and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, were involved in the initiation of DNA replication which implied downregulation of fibroblast proliferation in 3-D. Observation of cells for 72 h in 2-D and 3-D environments confirmed the reduced progression through the cell cycle in 3-D. A focused analysis, examining the Hippo pathway and ECM-associated genes, showed differential patterns of gene expression in the 3-D versus 2-D culture. Altogether, the transcriptional response of fibroblasts cultured in 3-D indicated inhibition of proliferation, and alterations in Hippo and ECM pathways indicating a complete switch from proliferation to ECM remodeling.

   Microsporidia are widespread insect pathogens and a single species may infect different hosts. Nosema pyrausta from the corn borer was tested against the gypsy moth. Thirty days after larvae were fed with spores, infection was established in the salivary glands and fat body of pupae and prepupae. Up to 10% of insects became infected. The gypsy moth can be referred to as a resistant host of N. pyrausta.
   The gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar, is a notorious forest defoliator, and various pathogens are known to act as natural regulators of its population density. As a widespread herbivore with a broad range of inhabited areas and host plants, it is potentially exposed to parasitic microorganisms from other insect hosts. In the present paper, we determined the susceptibility of gypsy moth larvae to the microsporidium Nosema pyrausta from the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis. Gypsy moth samples from two localities of Western Siberia were used. N. pyrausta developed infections in the salivary gland and adipose tissue of gypsy moth prepupae and pupae, forming spore masses after 30 days of alimentary exposure to the second instar larvae. Among the experimental groups, the infection levels ranged from 0 to 9.5%. Effects of a covert baculovirus infection, phenylthiourea pretreatment and feeding insects on an artificial diet versus natural foliage were not significant in terms of microsporidia prevalence levels. Thus, L. dispar showed a low level of susceptibility to a non-specific microsporidium. It can be referred to as a resistant model host and not an appropriate substitute host for laboratory propagation of the microsporidium.

AB  - Mesothelial cells, in the outermost layer of internal organs, are essential for both organ development and homeostasis. Although the parietal mesothelial cell is the primary origin of mesothelioma that may highjack developmental signaling, the signaling pathways that orchestrate developing parietal mesothelial progenitor cell (MPC) behaviors, such as MPC pool expansion, maturation, and differentiation, are poorly understood. To address it, we established a robust protocol for culturing WT1+ MPCs isolated from developing pig and mouse parietal thorax. Quantitative qPCR and immunostaining analyses revealed that BMP4 facilitated MPC differentiation into smooth muscle cells (SMCs). In contrast, FGF2 significantly promoted MPC progenitor pool expansion but blocked the SMC differentiation. BMP4 and FGF2 counterbalanced these effects, but FGF2 had the dominant impact in the long-term culture. A Wnt activator, CHIR99021, was pivotal in MPC maturation to CALB2+ mesothelial cells, while BMP4 or FGF2 was limited. Our results demonstrated central pathways critical for mesothelial cell behaviors.

AB  - Advances in the study of reproductive traits indicate that functional variation in fertility genes may be useful for improving sheep fertility. The aim of this study was to search for variation in the bone morphogenetic protein 15 gene (BMP15) and ascertain any association with litter size in purebred Finnish Landrace sheep (n = 148), Finnish Landrace x Texel-cross sheep (n = 45), and composite sheep (of varying breed background; n = 58) from New Zealand (NZ). A 482 bp and 312 bp fragment of exon 1 and 2, respectively, of BMP15 were analysed using polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP). The additive and dominance effect of BMP15 variation on litter size were estimated using animal and sire models. Two variants (A and B) were detected in exon 1; no sequence variation was detected in exon 2. Variant A had the nucleotide sequence CTT between positions c.31 and c.33, while variant B had a deletion (c.31_33del). The observed frequency for variant A in the Finnish Landrace sheep, Finnish Landrace x Texel-cross sheep and the composite sheep, was 0.77, 0.92, and 0.68, respectively while the frequency of variant B (c.31_33del) was 0.23, 0.08, and 0.32, respectively. An association between litter size and c.31_33del (P < 0.001) was observed in composite sheep. Analysis of more sheep will be required to confirm these results. Litter size did not differ significantly between sheep breeds regardless of the presence/absence of c.31_33del. Results suggested that c.31_33del might be a genetic marker for improving fecundity in some NZ sheep.

AB  - Simple Summary Colostrum is of interest to the scientific community because of its nutritional and therapeutic capabilities. The aims of this study were to characterize the macro and micro composition of colostrum from Sarda dairy sheep and to compare it with the composition of the mature milk of the same breed. The results of this survey showed a large variation in the immunoglobulin concentration in colostrum, which could affect the acquisition of passive immunity by lambs. The strong correlation between immunoglobulin G and the total protein content suggests that this can be used to estimate the immunoglobulin content in sheep colostrum. The concentration of essential minerals is higher in colostrum than in milk as a result of mineral salt block supplementation at the end of gestation. Colostrum has a significantly different fatty acid profile than milk, and this is due to the specific needs of newborn lambs. Colostrum is a major source of immunity in ruminants. It allows the transfer of antibodies from the mother to the fetus, and it is the exclusive source of nutrients for the newborn. The objectives of this study were (i) to characterize the macro and the micro composition of colostrum; (ii) to analyze the antioxidant capacity, fatty acid profile, and essential and toxic mineral content of colostrum; and (iii) to compare FA profiles and the amount of trace elements between colostrum and mature milk. For these purposes, samples of colostrum and milk were collected from a representative sample of animals from eight sheep dairy farms in the north of Sardinia (Italy). Fat, proteins, and seven essential and toxic minerals were measured in all samples of colostrum and milk. Furthermore, the FA profile was also measured in both matrices, while total antioxidant capacity was measured only in colostrum samples. The average amounts of fat and protein (TP) concentration in colostrum were 7.8% and 16%, respectively. Additionally, an average amount of 40 +/- 20 g dm(-3) was found for immunoglobulin G (IgG). As regards the antioxidant capacity of colostrum, a large variation was observed between samples from different farms for test 2, 2 '-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), which was 30 +/- 10% (mean +/- standard deviation). High levels of selenium (Se), zinc (Zn), and copper (Cu) were found in colostrum (200 mu g kg(-1), 25,000 mu g kg(-1), and 1200 mu g kg(-1), respectively). A strong positive correlation between TP and IgG was observed (r = 91%). In colostrum, the amount of IgG is positively correlated with Se and Zn, as they are essential minerals to the immune system. The FA profile demonstrated higher levels of medium and long chain fatty acids in colostrum than in mature milk, and this is mainly true for arachidonic acid (ARA), ecosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosapentaenoic acid (DPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). This study provided new information on the quality of colostrum in Sarda dairy sheep and showed the different composition of fatty acids between colostrum and mature milk.

AB  - BACKGROUND Pesticides can be noxious to non-target beneficial arthropods and their negative effects have been recently recognized even at low doses. The predator Nesidiocoris tenuis (Reuter) (Hemiptera: Miridae) plays an important role in controlling insect pests in solanaceous crops, but its concurrent herbivory often poses relevant concerns for tomato production. Although insecticide side effects on N. tenuis have been previously studied, little is known on the potential implications of neurotoxic chemicals at low concentrations. We assessed the baseline toxicity of three neurotoxic insecticides (lambda-cyhalothrin, spinosad and chlorpyrifos) on N. tenuis by topical contact exposure. The behavioral and reproduction capacity of the predator was then investigated upon exposure to three estimated low-lethal concentrations (LC1, LC10 and LC30). RESULTS Predator survival varied among insecticides and concentrations, with LC30/label rate ratios ranging from 8.45% to 65.40% for spinosad and lambda-cyhalothrin, respectively. All insecticides reduced the fertility of N. tenuis females at all estimated low-lethal concentrations. Chlorpyrifos seriously compromised predator orientation towards a host plant even at LC1, while the same effect was observed for lambda-cyhalothrin and spinosad solely at LC30. Lambda-cyhalothrin (at all concentrations) and chlorpyrifos (at LC10 and LC30) also affected the time taken by N. tenuis females to make a choice. CONCLUSION The results indicate that all three insecticides can be detrimental to N. tenuis and should be avoided when presence of the predator is desirable.

AB  - Simple Summary In China, soup is widely perceived as a nutritional tonic, and pig bones are a primary ingredient in its preparation. Consequently, the market price of pig bones, even when of equal weight, surpasses that of pork, particularly in southern China. Despite this economic significance, the trait of pig bone weight has not been a focus in pig breeding programs due to the inherent challenges associated with in vivo measurement. The genetic selection method stands out as an effective approach for targeting the trait of pig bone weight in pig breeding. Recognizing its significance, our research endeavors have delved into molecular genetics to gain insights into the genetic aspects of pig bone weight. In order to unravel the genetic underpinnings of specific traits, we employed bioinformatics methodologies to conduct an analysis on three-way hybrid commercial pigs. Our primary objective was to identify genetic markers and genes associated with four distinct bone weight traits. Utilizing genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we scrutinized a population comprising 571 three-way hybrid commercial pigs to pinpoint single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and genes linked to these traits. The results identified twelve genes, namely OPRM1, SLC44A5, WASHC4, NOPCHAP1, RHOT1, GLP1R, TGFB3, PLCB1, TLR4, KCNJ2, ABCA6, and ABCA9, that were related to four bone weight traits. This comprehensive genetic insight provides valuable information on the mechanisms governing bone growth and weight in the context of pig breeding.Abstract The pig bone weight trait holds significant economic importance in southern China. To expedite the selection of the pig bone weight trait in pig breeding, we conducted molecular genetic research on these specific traits. These traits encompass the bone weight of the scapula (SW), front leg bone weight (including humerus and ulna) (FLBW), hind leg bone weight (including femur and tibia) (HLBW), and spine bone weight (SBW). Up until now, the genetic structure related to these traits has not been thoroughly explored, primarily due to challenges associated with obtaining the phenotype data. In this study, we utilized genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to discern single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and genes associated with four bone weight traits within a population comprising 571 Duroc x (Landrace x Yorkshire) hybrid pigs (DLY). In the analyses, we employed a mixed linear model, and for the correction of multiple tests, both the false discovery rate and Bonferroni methods were utilized. Following functional annotation, candidate genes were identified based on their proximity to the candidate sites and their association with the bone weight traits. This study represents the inaugural application of GWAS for the identification of SNPs associated with individual bone weight in DLY pigs. Our analysis unveiled 26 SNPs and identified 12 promising candidate genes (OPRM1, SLC44A5, WASHC4, NOPCHAP1, RHOT1, GLP1R, TGFB3, PLCB1, TLR4, KCNJ2, ABCA6, and ABCA9) associated with the four bone weight traits. Furthermore, our findings on the genetic mechanisms influencing pig bone weight offer valuable insights as a reference for the genetic enhancement of pig bone traits.

AB  - The industrial production of insects for waste management or as a protein source is becoming vital to our society. Large volumes of manure are produced by concentrated animal facilities around the globe that must be managed, utilized, and disposed of properly. Flies offer a partial solution with their abilities to reduce these wastes and heavy metal pollutants. Meat and crop proteins are being supplemented by insect proteins for many feeds across the globe, yet science-based studies behind the mass-rearing of insects are still in their infancy. In the current study, the percent change in the composition of nutrients, heavy metals, and fiber, in dairy, poultry, and swine manure degraded by either black soldier fly (BSF) or house fly (HF) larvae was explored. Pre-digested and post-digested manure samples were collected from four independent studies that differed in production scale (number of larvae and feeding regimen): 1) BSF small-scale (100 larvae fed incrementally), 2) HF small-scale (100 larvae fed incrementally), 3) BSF large-scale (10,000 larvae fed a single time), and 4) HF large-scale (4,000 larvae fed a single time). Results indicate that nitrogen is a key nutrient impacted by larval digestion of manure by both species, regardless of scale. However, scale significantly impacted reductions of other nutrients, as did the type of manure in which the insects were reared. Ultimately, this study demonstrated that manure type and rearing scale impact the ability of BSF and HF larvae to reduce nutrients and heavy metals in manure, and thus insect management procedures need to be congruent with production emphases of the insects for waste management or protein products. Failure to take scale into consideration could lead to inaccurate assumptions related to industrialized efforts on this topic. 0 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Stevenia deceptoria is a woodlouse-parasitizing fly species that has recently been introduced into South America and was until now known only in Argentina. In those countries it has invaded, this exotic fly prospers in cities because of the abundance of potential hosts in gardens and public parks. Here we show that S. deceptoria has been detected in urban ecosystems in the Metropolitan and Valparaiso Regions using citizen science and we describe its current range in the city and the degree of overlap between its range and that of its potential hosts. Records of both woodlouse-parasitizing flies and their hosts were obtained from two citizen science platforms: Facebook and iNaturalist. The extent of occurrence (EOO) and area of occupancy (AOO) were calculated for S. deceptoria and different woodlouse species. We assessed the advance of S. deceptoria into the city, comparing classic EOO and alpha-hull mode with a chi-squared test with Yates' continuity correction. We found that S. deceptoria was widely distributed in the Metropolitan Region, with a significant expansion over time. Woodlouse species, although common in the city, are sparsely sampled and so their EOO and AOO are underestimated. Stevenia deceptoria had a medium to complete overlap in distribution with potential woodlice hosts. The rapid expansion of S. deceptoria is probably due to its native host invading the Metropolitan Region. It is therefore likely that this fly species will expand its current distribution to neighboring regions where exotic woodlouse species are present.

AB  - Simple Summary Examination of lung lesions at slaughterhouses provides important information regarding swine respiratory disease presence in farms worldwide. This study evaluated pulmonary lesions in pigs at slaughter and assessed their effect on productive parameters. We observed a high occurrence (73.1%) of lung lesions in a cohort of 108 pigs; these lesions were associated with primary bacterial disease or a combination of bacterial and viral pathogens. The animals with more severe lesions had lower weight gain, remained at the farm longer, and were exposed to reinfection. Through laboratory tests, we demonstrated coinfections between Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, porcine circovirus type 2, and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus in affected lungs. We suggest that pigs that do not reach the desired weight at slaughter age should be sent to slaughter regardless, thus avoiding economic losses due to suboptimal productive parameters and aggravated respiratory disease by reinfection. Swine respiratory disease is associated with productive losses. We evaluated the prevalence of lung lesions with an emphasis on Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (Mh), porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), as well as the impact on productive parameters in 108 finishing pigs at slaughter. Pathologic, immunohistochemical (IHC) and serologic analyses were performed. Pneumonic processes were observed in 73.1% of the animals. They mainly consisted of cranioventral bronchopneumonia (CBP) (46.3%) and pleuritis (17.6%). Microscopically, bronchointerstitial pneumonia (67.4%) was common and was occasionally combined (27.9%) with interstitial pneumonia (IP). Mh and PCV2-antigens were detected in bronchointerstitial pneumonia (70.7%) and IP cases (33.3%). There were low titers against Mh (18%) and high titers against PRRSV (100%) and PCV2 (65%). Animals with CBP remained at the farm longer; those with >10% of lung parenchyma involvement were sent later (208.8 days old) and had a lower average carcass weight (74.1 kg) and a lower daily weight gain (500.8 gr/day) compared with animals without lesions (567.2 gr/day, 77.7 kg, 200.8 days old). We suggest that animals that do not reach the weight at slaughter should be sent to slaughter regardless to avoid further negative impacts of respiratory disease in productive parameters.

AB  - Goat milk (GM) is an excellent alternative to cow milk and has recently been used in commercial infant formula preparation due to its superior fat composition. Here, the fatty acid (FA) composition, triacylglycerol (TAG) molecular species, thermal behavior and infrared spectra of extracted milk fat from the milk of the two main breeds of dairy goat bred in China (Guanzhong GM (GZG) and Xinong Saanen GM (XSG)) are investigated. Gas chromatography, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry and ultra-performance convergence chromatography with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry are applied. The obtained results evidence significant fat compositional differences based on the breed that produced the considered GM. The major FAs in both GM fats were capric (C10:0), myristic (C14:0), palmitic (C16:0), stearic (C18:0) and oleic (C18:1 n-9c). GZG presented a higher content of medium-chain saturated FAs, while XSG had higher unsaturated FAs with higher ratios of L/Ln and n-6/n-3. A total of 339 and 359 TAGs were detected and quantified in GZG and XSG, and the major TAGs were those of m/z 740.6712 (14.10 +/- 0.27%) and m/z 684.6094 (10.94 +/- 0.02%), respectively. Milk TAGs of GZG and XSG showed 24-54 and 26-54 total acyl carbon numbers with a 0-4 and 0-5 double bond number at 68 and 72 various retention times, respectively. Thermal analysis showed that all GM fat samples melted below normal body temperature. Infrared spectra revealed higher absorption values of GZG milk fat. This study provides valuable information to the dairy industry sector about GM fat produced in China, assessing the appropriateness of Chinese GM fat to be applied in Chinese infant formula.

AB  - The development and quality of tea plants (Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Ktze.) are greatly hampered by drought stress (DS), which affects them in a number of ways, including by interfering with their metabolism of nitrogen (N). Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are known to enhance water and nutrient absorption in plants, but their specific effects on tea plant N metabolism under DS and the associated regulatory mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of Claroideoglomus etunicatum inoculation on N assimilation in tea plants (C. sinensis cv. Fuding Dabaicha) under well-watered (WW) and DS conditions, and to explore potential molecular mechanisms. After 8 weeks of DS treatment, root mycorrhizal colonization was significantly inhibited, and the biomass of tea shoots and roots, as well as the contents of various amino acids (AAs) were reduced. However, AMF inoculation significantly increased the contents of tea polyphenols and catechins in leaves by 13.74%-36.90% under both WW and DS conditions. Additionally, mycorrhizal colonization notably increased N content by 12.65%-35.70%, various AAs by 11.88%-325.42%, and enzymatic activities associated with N metabolism by 3.80%-147.62% in both leaves and roots. Gene expression analysis revealed a universal upregulation of N assimilation-related genes (CsAMT1;2, CsAMT3;1, CsGS1, CsNADH-GOGAT, CsTS2, CsGGT1, and CsADC) in AMF-colonized tea roots, regardless of water status. Under DS condition, AMF inoculation significantly upregulated the expressions of CsNRT1;2, CsNRT1;5, CsNRT2;5, CsNR, CsGS1, CsGDH1, CsGDH2, CsTS2, CsGGT1, CsGGT3, and CsSAMDC in tea leaves. These findings suggest that AMF improved tea plant adaptability to DS by enhancing N absorption and assimilation, accompanied by the synthesis and accumulation of various AAs, such as Glu, Gln, Asp, Lys, Arg, GABA and Pro. This is achieved through the upregulation of N metabolism-related genes and the activation of related enzymes in tea plants under DS condition. These findings provide valuable insights into the role of AMF in regulating tea plant N metabolism and enhancing stress tolerance.

AB  - Flies of the family Calliphoridae, commonly called blow flies, are important in the decomposition process. Knowledge on their succession pattern on corpses, species identification and the duration of their life cycle stages can be useful in forensic investigations especially when estimating the post-mortem interval. We performed linear-based morphometrics on the cephalopharyngeal skeleton of four blow fly species found in Jamaica to distinguish species and determine larval development stage. We collected eggs from pigs' heads used as bait in the field and conducted rearing exercises in the laboratory. We used the internal skeletonized structure, the cephalopharyngeal skeleton, to develop a practical and efficient method for species identification. For the first instar, we found species can be differentiated using all the measurements analysed in the study. We found that the mouth hook length may be useful in distinguishing larvae in the second instar. For the larvae in the third instar, the whole length of the skeleton, from mouth hook to length of the dorsal cornue, may be useful for separating species. We provide information on the cephalopharyngeal skeleton of Lucilia lucigerens (James), a blow fly species endemic to Jamaica, for the first time. Our work provides relevant information that could be utilized for species identification and life stage determination if fly evidence is to be incorporated in forensic investigations in Jamaica.

AB  - Air pollution particulate matter (PM) is a world risk factor that the effects of long-term exposure to these factors in terms of damage to cardiovascular and pulmonary function are well known, but little is known comparatively about the effects of PM on emotional and cognitive processes. Exposure to PM can adversely affect the central nervous system (CNS) by inflammatory pathways and activation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) associated with urban air pollution PM. Therefore, we investigated whether prolonged exposure to diesel exhaust particles (DEPs) affects hippocampal inflammatory cytokines and emotional and cognition responses. Male mice were exposed to DEPs for 6 and 12 weeks. DEP-exposed mice indicated more disorders in depressive-like responses and spatial memory and learning than in control groups. Pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in tge hippocampus was increased among mice exposed to DEPs. The number of activated microglia increased in the dentate gyrus (DG) and CA1 regions of the hippocampus in DEP-exposed mice. These results show that chronic exposure to DEPs can alter neurobehavioral and impair cognition. Generally, these findings reaffirm the importance of protecting from exposure to ambient PM2.5 and also advance our understanding of the toxic actions of air pollution nanoparticles.

AB  - The Camellia weevil, Curculio chinensis (Chevrolat, 1978), is a dominant oligophagous pest that bores into the fruit of oil-tea Camellia. Genetic differentiation among populations in various hosts can easily occur, which hinders research on pest management. In this study, the genetic structure, genetic diversity, and phylogenetic structure of local C. chinensis populations were examined using 147 individuals (from 6 localities in Jiangxi), based on 2 mitochondrial COI markers. Results indicated that the C. chinensis population in Jiangxi exhibits a high haplotype diversity, especially for the populations from Cam. meiocarpa plantations. Structural differentiation was observed between Haplogroup 1 (73 individuals from Ganzhou, Jian, and Pingxiang) in the monoculture plantations of Cam. meiocarpa and Haplogroup 2 (75 individuals from Pingxiang and Jiujiang) in Cam. oleifera. Two haplogroups have recently undergone a demographic expansion, and Haplogroup 1 has shown a higher number of effective migrants than Haplogroup 2. This suggests that C. chinensis has been spreading from Cam. meiocarpa plantations to other oil-tea Camellia, such as Cam. oleifera. The increased cultivation of oil-tea Camellia in Jiangxi has contributed to a unique genetic structure within the C. chinensis population. This has, in turn, expanded the distribution of C. chinensis and increased migration between populations.

AB  - Research on the invasive plant Phytolacca americana (L.) mostly focuses on its medicinal value and enrichment of heavy metals. However, little is known regarding its impact on native herbivorous insects. In this study, we explored the effects of P. americana and the exotic noninvasive Phytolacca icosandra (L.) on the Spodoptera litura (Fabricius) (native tobacco cutworm) via bioassay, oviposition preference, detoxifying enzyme activity analysis, and phytochemical determination. We found that the oviposition preference index (OPI) of S. litura feeding on P. icosandra was higher than that of P. americana. The developmental duration of S. litura feeding on P. icosandra was shorter than that of P. americana. Additionally, the Acetylcholinesterase (AchE) and Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activities of S. litura feeding on P. americana were higher than that of S. litura feeding on artificial diets or P. icosandra. The content of lignin and flavonoids in P. americana was relatively high, whereas starch content was relatively low. These findings suggest invasive plants have higher resistance to herbivores, thereby suffering less damage than exotic noninvasive plants.

AB  - Bitter taste perception is important in preventing animals from ingesting potentially toxic compounds. Whole-genome assembly (WGA) data have revealed that bitter taste receptor genes (TAS2Rs) comprise a multigene family with dozens of intact and disrupted genes in primates. However, publicly available WGA data are often incomplete, especially for multigene families. In this study, we employed a targeted capture (TC) approach specifically probing TAS2Rs for ten species of cercopithecid primates with diverse diets, including eight omnivorous cercopithecine species and two folivorous colobine species. We designed RNA probes for all TAS2Rs that we modeled to be intact in the common ancestor of cercopithecids ("ancestral-cercopithecid TAS2R gene set"). The TC was followed by short-read and high-depth massive-parallel sequencing. TC retrieved more intact TAS2R genes than found in WGA databases. We confirmed a large number of gene "births" at the common ancestor of cercopithecids and found that the colobine common ancestor and the cercopithecine common ancestor had contrasting trajectories: four gene "deaths" and three gene births, respectively. The number of intact TAS2R genes was markedly reduced in colobines (25-28 detected via TC and 20-26 detected via WGA analysis) as compared with cercopithecines (27-36 via TC and 19-30 via WGA). Birth or death events occurred at almost every phylogenetic-tree branch, making the composition of intact genes variable among species. These results show that evolutionary change in intact TAS2R genes is a complex process, refute a simple general prediction that herbivory favors more TAS2R genes, and have implications for understanding dietary adaptations and the evolution of detoxification abilities.

AB  - This study explores the effects of the coevolution of the host genome (the first genome) and gut microbiome (the second genome) on nutrition stress in Tibetan sheep during the cold season. The rumen epithelial tissue of six Tibetan sheep (Oula-type) was collected as experimental samples during the cold and warm seasons and the study lasted for half a year. The cDNA library was constructed and subjected to high-throughput sequencing. The circRNAs with significant differential expression were identified through bioinformatics analysis and functional prediction, and verified by real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR). The results showed that a total of 56 differentially expressed (DE) circRNAs of rumen epithelial tissue were identified using RNA-seq technology, among which 29 were significantly upregulated in the cold season. The circRNA-miRNA regulatory network showed that DE circRNAs promoted the adaptation of Tibetan sheep in the cold season by targeting miR-150 and oar-miR-370-3p. The results of correlation analysis among circRNAs, microbiota, and metabolites showed that the circRNA NC_040275.1:28680890|28683112 had a very significant positive correlation with acetate, propionate, butyrate, and total volatile fatty acid (VFA) (p < 0.01), and had a significant positive correlation with Ruminococcus-1 (p < 0.05). In addition, circRNA NC_040256.1:78451819|78454934 and metabolites were enriched in the same KEGG pathway biosynthesis of amino acids (ko01230). In conclusion, the host genome and rumen microbiome of Tibetan sheep co-encoded a certain glycoside hydrolase (beta-glucosidase) and coevolved efficient VFA transport functions and amino acid anabolic processes; thus, helping Tibetan sheep adapt to nutrient stress in the cold season in high-altitude areas.

AB  - Polymeric microneedles fabricated via two-photon polymerization (2PP) lithography enable safe medical access to the inner ear. Herein, the material class for 2PP-lithography-based microneedles is expanded by pyrolyzing 2PP-fabricated polymeric microneedles, resulting in glassy carbon microneedles. During pyrolysis the microneedles shrink up to 81% while maintaining their complex shape when the exposed surface-area-to-volume ratio (SVR) is 0.025<SVR<0.04, for the temperature history protocol used herein. The derived glassy carbon is confirmed with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy. The pyrolyzed glassy carbon has Young's modulus 9.0 GPa. As a brittle material, the strength is stochastic. Using the two-parameter Weibull distribution, the glassy carbon has Weibull modulus of 3.1 and characteristic strength of 710 MPa. The viscoelastic response has characteristic time scale of about 10000 s. In vitro experiments demonstrate that the glassy carbon microneedles introduce controlled perforations across the guinea pig round window membrane (RWM) from the middle ear space into the inner ear, without damaging the microneedle. The resultant controlled perforation of RWM is known to enhance diffusion of therapeutics across the RWM in a predictable fashion. Hence, the glassy carbon microneedles can be deployed for mediating inner ear delivery.

AB  - An individual's energetic demands and hence metabolic rate can strongly change during adolescence, a phase characterized by profound morphological, physiological, and endocrine changes. Glucocorticoid hormones (e.g. cortisol) are released in response to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal-axis activity, modulate several metabolic processes, and can also be linked to increased metabolic rate. In domestic guinea pigs (Cavia aperea f. porcellus) housed in same-sex groups, cortisol concentrations increase during adolescence in males but remain stable in females, which was suggested to be related to different energetic demands by age. We therefore measured metabolic rate through oxygen (O2) consumption over 2.5 h in male and female guinea pigs housed in same-sex groups during adolescence at ages of 60, 120, and 180 days, which was paralleled by analyses of saliva cortisol concentrations before and after the measurement. The statistical analyses involved whole body metabolic rate (ml O2/h), body mass-corrected metabolic rate (ml O2/h/kg), and body mass-independent metabolic rate (ml O2/h statistically corrected for body mass). We found increasing cortisol concentrations with age in males only, but none of the three metabolic rate analyses revealed a sex difference by age. On the individual level, repeatability across ages was found in metabolic rate as well as in body mass and cortisol concentrations after the measurement, but not in "basal" cortisol concentrations. Our results suggest no sex-specific changes in metabolic rate and hence equal energetic demands in male and female guinea pigs during adolescence. Moreover, metabolic rate clearly represents a highly stable physiological trait already early in a guinea pig's life irrespective of rather fluctuating cortisol concentrations.

AB  - It is critical to attribute faecal contamination to its original source in order to assess public health risks and implement effective interventions to mitigate future contamination. This study aimed to identify the primary sources of faecal contamination in water using microbial source tracking markers in water-stressed rural communities. A total of 1128 water samples were collected sequentially from the main source (river/borehole) to the households. Six host-specific genetic markers were used to detect faecal contamination in the water samples (BacHum and HF183, BacCow, Pig-2-Bac, Cytb and BacCan). Of the 564 water samples tested during the wet season, 37.94% (n = 214) were positive for human and animal-specific Bacteroidales marker genes, while 31.73% (n = 179) of the 564 tested during the dry season were also positive. During the wet season, animal faecal contamination was more prevalent among the positive samples (Cytb: 20.56%, n = 44; BacCan: 19.16%, n = 41). By contrast, human-origin faecal contamination was dominant during the dry season (BacHum: 23.46%, n = 42; HF183: 21.23%, n = 38). Identifying the origin of faecal contamination will assist in implementing targeted intervention strategies for the effective prevention of pathogen transmission in water-stressed rural communities in order to protect public health.

   Fermented pickle of Rakkyo (Japanese leek) is a popular dish because it has several proven human health benefits. We tested the effects of dietary adding Lactiplantibacillus plantarum N14 fermented rakkyo pickled juice on the immunocompetence and production performance of pigs. The results showed that the use of 5% mixture of fermented rakkyo pickled juice and the rakkyo residues in the porcine feed could be a cost-effective approach to promote the immune-health and production performance of pigs. This approach might contribute to exploring the sustainable management of food waste through utilizing them as livestock feed supplement.
   Rakkyo (Allium chinense), is a Japanese leek that is primarily used to make a popular sweet or sour pickled dish. Lactic acid bacteria are often involved in the preparation steps of fermented pickles, which helps in the effective preservation of the natural bioactive compounds of fruits and vegetable, and thereby exert several health benefits including immunomodulation and growth performance. This work aimed to evaluate the in vivo effects of adding Lactiplantibacillus plantarum N14 fermented rakkyo pickled juice as feed supplement on the immunocompetence and production performance of pigs. We first analyzed the nutritional composition, which revealed that the proportion of protein, lipid, and water-soluble fiber content were estimated as of 4%, 5%, and 5% in rakkyo residual liquid or juice, while 22%, 15% and 14%, respectively, were estimated in rakkyo residual powder. For the in vivo feeding trials, three groups of pigs were treated either with 5%, 20%, or 40% mixture (v/v) of fermented rakkyo pickled juice and the grinded residual liquid supplemented in the drinking water in addition to standard feed. The results of the feeding trials showed that the administration of a juice mixture of 5% or 20% (fermented pickled juice and residual liquid) had a similar trend of effects in improving the complement activity, phagocytic activity and leucocytes counts in the peripheral blood when compared to pigs fed with 40% mixture or untreated controls. Those changes were related to an improved resistance to enteric infections. Moreover, animals receiving a mixture of fermented pickled juice and fermented rakkyo residues had a higher growth rate and carcass quality than controls. The results suggested that the use of 5% mixture of fermented rakkyo pickled juice and the residual liquid through drinking water could be a cost-effective approach to promote the immune-health and production performance of pigs. This approach would contribute not only to the sustainable management of food wastes but also to the application of a value-added feed supplement for the promotion of animal health and production.

AB  - As consumers prioritize safer and more sustainable skincare ingredients, the traditional facial mask industry faces challenges due to the use of non-biodegradable materials and chemical preservatives that irritate the skin and harm the environment. In the present investigation, an innovative all-biomass solid facial mask was developed using electrospinning technology to incorporate naturally effective ingredients into bio-based fibers made of gelatin and pullulan polysaccharide. This process produced a nanofiber-based, fast-dissolving facial mask with essence uniformly embedded throughout the fibers. Unlike traditional facial masks that rely on preservatives, this solid mask avoids their use while offering excellent water and moisture retention. Owing to its nanostructured architecture and water-soluble fiber materials, it dissolves completely in water within just 7 s. Yak skin collagen peptides incorporated into the nanofiber film demonstrated strong antioxidant activity, scavenging 88.3% of DPPH free radicals. Biocompatibility testing combined with animal skin and eye irritation testing further confirmed the safety of the facial mask. This innovative approach not only supports the sustainable development of environment and resources but also delivers safer, more effective skincare solutions for consumers.

AB  - Flying insects are potential mobile samplers of airborne particulate matter (PM). However, current knowledge on their susceptibility to PM is limited to pollinators. Insects' capacity for particle surface accumulation depends on the lifestyle, structure of the body integuments, and behavioral patterns. Here, we investigate how two species of flying omnivorous insects from the genus Vespula, possessing direct interactions with air, soil, plants, and herbivores, indicate industrial pollution by accumulating coarse (PM10) and fine (PM2.5) particles on their bodies. The internal accumulation of par-ticles in wasps' gut tissues is assessed considering heavy metals exposure to reveal and discuss the potential magnitude of ecotoxicological risks. Female individuals of Vespula vulgaris and V. germanica were sampled with a hand-netting near to Harjavalta Cu-Ni smelter and in the control areas in southwestern Finland. They were analyzed with light mi-croscopy (LM), electron microscopy (SEM, TEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) methods. Near to the smelter, wasps trapped significantly more particles, which were of bigger size and their surface optical density was higher. Vespula vulgaris accumulated larger particles than V. germanica, but that wasn't associated with morpholog-ical characteristics such as body size or hairiness. In both areas, accumulated surface PM carried clays and silicates. Only in polluted environments PM consistently contained metallic and nonmetallic particles (from high to moderate weight %) of Fe, Ni, Cu, and S - major pollutants emitted from the smelter. Wasps from industrially polluted areas car-ried significantly more granules in the columnar epithelial midgut cells. TEM-EDX analyses identified those structures were associated with metal ions such as Cr, Cu, Ni, and Fe. As epithelial gut cells accumulated metal particles, midgut confirmed as a barrier for metal exposure in wasps. External PM contamination in wasps is suggested as a qualitative, yet a natural and simple descriptor of local industrial emissions.

AB  - Most forests and woodlands of south-eastern Australia are fire prone. These landscapes are typically dominated by tree species of the genus Eucalyptus, and many of these are proficient epicormic resprouters after fire. Several marsupial folivores rely on Eucalyptus foliage, including the koala. Little is known about the nutritional composition of epicormic leaves and whether folivores can utilise them. Following the 2019-20 megafires, we offered koalas epicormic leaves from eight eucalypt species that occur in the New South Wales Southern Tablelands and measured concentrations of foliar chemical constituents known to influence koala feeding (total and available nitrogen, formylated phloroglucinol compounds (FPCs), and unsubstituted B-ring flavanones (UBFs)). Captive koalas ate epicormic leaves from the four eucalypt species belonging to the subgenus Symphyomyrtus but ate relatively little from the species of the subgenus Eucalyptus. Available nitrogen was significantly higher in symphyomyrtle epicormic regrowth than in monocalypts and differed between species. Concentrations of FPCs and UBFs also differed between eucalypt species. Our results suggest that post-fire epicormic regrowth from symphyomyrtle species may be more readily browsed than that of monocalypts by koalas in the NSW Southern Tablelands. Therefore, some burnt areas are likely to be better quality habitat for koalas than others.
   Many Eucalyptus species produce epicormic regrowth after fire. The koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) relies on eucalypt foliage; however, it is unknown whether they can consume epicormic regrowth. We conducted a feeding trial with captive koalas to determine if they would consume epicormic foliage from different eucalypt species and found consumption was dependent on both the species and subgenus.

AB  - Background: The path(ophysiology of traumatic brain injury (TBI) is caused by the initial physical damage and by the subsequent biochemical damage (secondary brain injury). Oxidative stress is deeply involved in secondary brain injury, so molecular hydrogen therapy may be effective for TBI. Hydrogen gas shows the optimal effect at concentrations of 2% or higher, but can only be used up to 1.3% in the form of a gas cylinder mixed with oxygen gas, which may not be sufficiently effective. The partial pressure of hydrogen increases in proportion to the pressure, so hyperbaric hydrogen therapy (HBH2) is more effective than that at atmospheric pressure.
   Methods: A total of 120 mice were divided into three groups: TBI + non-treatment group (TBI group; n = 40), TBI + HBH2 group (n = 40), and non-TBI + non- treatment group (sham group; n = 40). The TBI and TBI + HBH2 groups were subjected to moderate cerebral contusion induced by controlled cortical impact. The TBI + HBH2 group received hyperbaric hydrogen therapy at 2 atmospheres for 90 minutes, at 30 minutes after TBI. Brain edema, neuronal cell loss in the injured hippocampus, neurological function, and cognitive function were evaluated.
   Results: The TBI + HBH2 group showed significantly less cerebral edema (p < 0.05). Residual hippocampal neurons were significantly more numerous in the TBI + HBH2 group on day 28 (p < 0.05). Neurological score and behavioral tests showed that the TBI + HBH2 group had significantly reduced hyperactivity on day 14 (p < 0.01).
   Conclusion: Hyperbaric hydrogen therapy may be effective for posttraumatic secondary brain injury.

AB  - Simple Summary Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (LDB) is an important candidate for antibiotic replacement in pig production. In this study, LDB and antibiotic diets were fed to the LDB and antibiotic groups of female growing-finishing pigs, respectively. 16S rRNA sequencing was used to identify different microbiota. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based non-targeted metabolomics approaches were used to identify different metabolites. The co-occurrence network of the fecal microbiota and metabolite was analyzed. The results contain information on pig growth performance, microbiota data, metabolite data and co-occurrence networks, supporting the possibility of LDB as an antibiotics replacement in pig production. Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (LDB) is an approved feed additive on the Chinese 'Approved Feed Additives' list. However, the possibility of LDB as an antibiotic replacement remains unclear. Particularly, the effect of LDB on microbiota and metabolites in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) requires further explanation. This study aimed to identify the microbiota and metabolites present in fecal samples and investigate the relationship between the microbiota and metabolites to evaluate the potential of LDB as an antibiotic replacement in pig production. A total of 42 female growing-finishing pigs were randomly allocated into the antibiotic group (basal diet + 75 mg/kg aureomycin) and LDB (basal diet + 3.0 x 10(9) cfu/kg LDB) groups. Fecal samples were collected on days 0 and 30. Growth performance was recorded and assessed. 16S rRNA sequencing and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based non-targeted metabolomics approaches were used to analyze the differences in microbiota and metabolites. Associations between the differences were calculated using Spearman correlations with the Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment. The LDB diet had no adverse effect on feed efficiency but slightly enhanced the average daily weight gain and average daily feed intake (p > 0.05). The diet supplemented with LDB increased Lactobacillus abundance and decreased that of Prevotellaceae_NK3B31_group spp. Dietary-supplemented LDB enhanced the concentrations of pyridoxine, tyramine, D-(+)-pyroglutamic acid, hypoxanthine, putrescine and 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid and decreased the lithocholic acid concentration. The Lactobacillus networks (Lactobacillus, Peptococcus, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-004, Escherichia-Shigella, acetophenone, tyramine, putrescine, N-methylisopelletierine, N1-acetylspermine) and Prevotellaceae_NK3B31_group networks (Prevotellaceae_NK3B31_group, Treponema_2, monolaurin, penciclovir, N-(5-acetamidopentyl)acetamide, glycerol 3-phosphate) were the most important in the LDB effect on pig GIT health in our study. These findings indicate that LDB may regulate GIT function through the Lactobacillus and Prevotellaceae_NK3B31_group networks. However, our results were restrained to fecal samples of female growing-finishing pigs; gender, growth stages, breeds and other factors should be considered to comprehensively assess LDB as an antibiotic replacement in pig production.

AB  - Kynurenic acid (KYNA), a tryptophan metabolite, is believed to exert neuromodulatory and neuroprotective effects in the brain. This study aimed to examine KYNA's capacity to modify gene expression and the activity of cellular antioxidant enzymes in specific structures of the sheep brain. Anestrous sheep were infused intracerebroventricularly with two KYNA doses-lower (4 x 5 mu g/60 mu L/30 min, KYNA20) and higher (4 x 25 mu g/60 mu L/30 min, KYNA100)-at 30 min intervals. The abundance of superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx1) mRNA, as well as enzyme activities, were determined in the medial-basal hypothalamus (MBH), the preoptic (POA) area of the hypothalamus, and in the hippocampal CA1 field. Both doses of KYNA caused a decrease (p < 0.01) in the expression of SOD2 and CAT mRNA in all structures examined compared to the control group (except for CAT in the POA at the KYNA100 dose). Furthermore, lower levels of SOD2 mRNA (p < 0.05) and CAT mRNA (p < 0.01) were found in the MBH and POA and in the POA and CA, respectively, in sheep administered with the KYNA20 dose. Different stimulatory effects on GPx1 mRNA expression were observed for both doses (p < 0.05-p < 0.01). KYNA exerted stimulatory but dose-dependent effects on SOD2, CAT, and GPx1 activities (p < 0.05-p < 0.001) in all brain tissues examined. The results indicate that KYNA may influence the level of oxidative stress in individual brain structures in sheep by modulating the expression of genes and the activity of at least SOD2, CAT, and GPx1. The present findings also expand the general knowledge about the potential neuroprotective properties of KYNA in the central nervous system.

AB  - As one of the most common human genetic disorders, Down syndrome (DS) is characterized by a mild-tomoderate cognitive disability, which mainly results from genes overexpression on chromosome 21. The expression of miR-99a, a gene harboring on chromosome 21, is increased by 50 folds in DS brain samples. This study aims to investigate the effect of miR-99a overexpression in the hippocampus on mouse behaviors and explore the underlying mechanisms. Lentivirus vectors were delivered into the hippocampus for focal miR-99a overexpression in mice. Then behaviors were observed by an open field, elevated plus maze, rotarod motor test, and Morris water maze. The genes affected by miR-99a were identified by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) in samples isolated from the hippocampus injected with lentivirusGFP-miR-99a or lentivirus-GFP vectors. It was found that the expression of miR-99a with intrahippocampal delivery of lentivirus-GFP-miR-99a resulted in reversal learning impairment in mice although it had no influence on motor function and anxiety. Meanwhile, RNA-seq results showed that 92 genes including mRNAs and microRNAs were significantly regulated by miR-99a, consistent with qRT-PCR consequence. Moreover, dualluciferase reporter assay showed that miR-99a could directly bind to the 3'-untranslated regions (3'UTR) of target genes (Clic6 and Kcnj13) with an inhibitory effect on their activity. Furthermore, we also found that miR99a overexpression affected different biological processes by bioinformatic analyses. Our study showed that miR99a overexpression in the hippocampus leads to cognitive impairment through regulating the expressions of various genes, which reveals a novel function of miR-99a and provides new insights into understanding the pathophysiologic process of DS.

AB  - Objective: Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, EC 3.4.15.1) is a very important factor in the regulation of blood pressure. Also, the inhibition of ACE with natural compounds has been a very important research area in the treatment of high blood pressure. ACE was purified and characterized from sheep plasma. Molecular docking studies and the inhibition effect of thiamine, riboflavin, and captopril on ACE were investigated. Methods: Herein, ACE was purified from sheep plasma by affinity chromatography. The effect of thiamine and riboflavin on ACE was researched. Molecular docking studies were performed to understand the molecular interactions between thiamine, riboflavin, and captopril with ACE. Results: The purification coefficient was found to be 8636 fold. The binding energy of thiamine, riboflavin, and captopril was found to be -6.7 kcal/mol, -8.1 kcal/mol, and -5.5 kcal/mol, respectively. Thiamine conformed to three conventional hydrogen bonds with ASP:415, HIS:513, and LYS:454. Riboflavin formed four conventional hydrogen bonds with GLN:281, GLU:376, THR:282, and TYR:520. Captopril formed two conventional hydrogen bonds with ARG:124, one conventional hydrogen bond with TYR:62 and ASN:85, and one carbon-hydrogen bond with ASN:66. Molecular docking results showed that thiamine, riboflavin, and captopril interacted with ACE through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions. Thiamine and riboflavin indicated significant inhibition effects on ACE. The IC50 values of thiamine, riboflavin, and captopril were found as 960.56 mu M, 11.02 mu M, and 1.60 nM, respectively. K-i values for thiamine, riboflavin, and captopril were determined as 1352.04 mu M, 12.30 mu M, and 1.06 nM, respectively. Conclusion: In this work, it was concluded that thiamine and riboflavin may have preventive and therapeutical impacts against high blood pressure with their ACE inhibitor effect. Thiamine and riboflavin showed a lower inhibitory effect with a higher IC50 than captopril. However, when the inhibitory effect of thiamine and riboflavin vitamins is compared to captopril, it is concluded that they may be natural inhibitors with fewer side effects.

AB  - In photopolymerization-induced 3D printing of glass and ceramics, the demand for a slurry that has high photosensitivity, low viscosity, and high solid content leads to a limited selection of suspended particles. To this end, ultravioletassisted direct ink writing (UV-DIW) is proposed as a new 3D printing compatible approach. A curable UV ink is synthesized, which overcomes the material limitation. Benefiting from the advantage of the UV-DIW process, CaAlSiN3:Eu2+/BaMgAl10O17:Eu2+ phosphors in glass (CASN/BAM-PiG) as chromaticity-tunable specially shaped all-inorganic color converters are prepared for plant growth lighting using an optimized heat treatment procedure. Size compatible dome-type and flat-type CaAlSiN3:Eu2+ phosphors in glass (CASN-PiG) are constructed in batches. The manufactured dome-type PiG-based light-emitting diodes (LEDs) exhibit better heat dissipation capacity and a larger divergence angle. The advantage of CASN/BAM-PiG in plant growth lighting is confirmed by the high degree of resemblance between the emission spectra of CASN/BAM-PiG and the absorption spectra of carotenoid and chlorophyll. A series of dome-type CASN/BAM-PiG based LEDs with selective region doping are constructed, which can weaken reabsorption effects and scientifically match the requirements of different plants. The excellent color-tunable ability and high degree of spectral resemblance indicate the superiority of the proposed UV-DIW process in all-inorganic CASN/BAM-PiG color converters for intelligent agricultural lighting.

AB  - Simple Summary The trophoblast is an original placental tissue whose normal proliferation, differentiation, migration, adhesion, and angiopoiesis are essential for placenta formation and fetal survival during early pregnancy. However, the key genes and molecular mechanisms involved in placenta development in goats are unknown. Herein, the morphology and histological structures of trophoblast tissues from day 20 to 30 of pregnancy were determined. RNA-sequencing was used to screen potential functional genes in common highly expressed and differentially expressed genes. RAP1 signaling pathway was used as the contact center and coordinated with other pathways to regulate placenta development. This study could provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying ruminant placentation. This study explored the trophoblast transcriptome to understand potential functional genes involved in early placental development in goats and their enriched signaling pathways. Trophoblast samples were collected from nine Dazu Black goats on days 20, 25, and 30 of pregnancy (D20, D25, and D30). As the pregnancy progressed, the morphology and histological structures showed significant growth, adhesion, and angiogenesis. A total of 23,253 commonly expressed genes (CEGs) and 4439 differently expressed genes (DEGs) were detected by RNA sequencing. The common highly expressed genes (ChEGs) (the top 100 CEGs) with the highest FPKM percentage (29.9%) of all CEGs were annotated to the ribosome pathway and maintain pregnancy. DEGs were abundant in D30 vs. D20 (3715 DEGs). Besides, the DEGs were associated with the inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation and activation of PI3K-Akt, focal adhesion, ECM-receptor interaction, Rap1, and CAM signaling pathways. The RAP1 may be a central pathway since it coordinates with others to regulate the cell proliferation, invasion, migration, and fusion of trophoblasts. qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis confirmed the transcriptional expression in IGF1, VEGFC, RAPGEF3, PIK3CA, AKT3, ITGB3, ITGA11, SPP1, NOS1, and ATP6V0B genes and protein levels in VEGF, RAPGEF3, and Akt. This is the first study of transcriptome profiling in goat placenta and provides diverse genetic resources for further research on placenta development.

AB  - Many call for a broad approach to valuation of nature's contribution to people, one that provides a contextualized understanding of what may be experienced as a value in different cultures, groups and settings. In the present paper we address contributions of nature to psychological well-being as realized through restorative processes during encounters with wildlife. Although restorative benefits of nature experience have received much consideration, sparse attention has been given to the role of the presence or absence of different animals in the settings investigated. The presence of a liked species may increase appreciation for and engagement with a natural setting, but fear of encountering some species may counter the desire to visit a setting with otherwise high restorative quality. This paper proposes a psychological framework for understanding how wildlife may contribute to or hinder people's opportunities to restore in local natural settings. The framework addresses the transaction between the individual and their surroundings, making use of an appraisal theory of emotion and theories about the restorative benefits of nature experience. We focus upon encounters in landscapes shared by humans and wildlife, and we elaborate on our reasoning with scenarios from Sweden involving local people's appraisal of wolves and roe deer. An integrated understanding of the psychological processes at work would facilitate communication and decision-making about the contribution of wildlife in nature conservation and management.

AB  - Ovine pulmonary adenocarcinoma (OPA) is a model of human lung cancer and fatal viral disease that causes neoplasia in sheep respiratory cells. In the current study, 986 lung samples was inspected in the slaughterhouse, and finally twenty OPA lung organs were clinically diagnosed and five healthy lung organs were assigned as the control sample. Three SSCP patterns were detected for the affected lungs animals in comparison with the healthy lungs. In addition, sequencing results indicated three different single point mutations in exon 4 of TP53 within infected lungs, whereas no mutations were observed in exon 9 of this gene. Real-time PCR results showed up-regulation of the TP53 gene in all the infected lung cells compared to healthy cells. There was significant correlation between the mutations in exon 4 and OPAand can be used as a useful tool in determining the mechanism of lung cancer. (c) 2022 Urmia University. All rights reserved.

AB  - The studies of epileptogenesis have revealed not only a dysregulation of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission, but also pronounced alterations in the astrocyte functioning. Here we explored how the establishment of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) affected the astrocytes in the hippocampus of Krushinsky-Molodkina (KM) rats genetically prone to audiogenic seizures (AGS). To reproduce the different stages of epileptogenesis, we used audiogenic kindling (daily AGS stimulations) of three durations: (1) 7 days, the initial stage; (2) 14 days, when the neurochemical and behavioral signs of TLE are almost stabilized; (3) 23 days, after which TLE in KM rats is fully established. Naive KM rats without any AGS experience were used as a control. The expression of such astrocyte markers, as glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), excitatory amino acid transporters EAAT1 and 2, aquaporin 4 (AQP4), and aldolase C (AldoC), was analyzed. Our data demonstrated that GFAP expression was unchanged after 7 AGS, but significantly upregulated after both 14 and 23 AGS indicating the development of reactive astrogliosis. Similar dynamics was observed for AldoC, one of the main metabolic astrocyte proteins. EAAT1 expression was not affected by kindling, while EAAT2 was significantly downregulated after 23 AGS. Analysis of AQP4 revealed a significant decrease of expression already after 7 AGS which persisted during further kindling progression. Thus, our data revealed that audiogenic kindling of KM rats induced astroglia aberrations similar to those observed in human epileptic hippocampus and animal models of TLE.

AB  - We investigated the effect of healthy ageing on the lexical and syntactic processes involved in sentence production. Young and older adults completed a semantic interference sentence production task: we manipulated whether the target picture and distractor word were semantically related or unrelated and whether they fell within the same phrase ("the watch and the clock/hippo move apart") or different phrases ("the watch moves above the clock/hippo"). Both age groups were slower to initiate sentences containing a larger, compared to a smaller, initial phrase, indicating a similar phrasal scope of advanced planning. However, older adults displayed significantly larger semantic interference effects (slower to initiate sentences when the target picture and distractor word were related) than young adults, indicating an age-related increase in lexical competition. Thus, while syntactic planning is preserved with age, older speakers encounter problems managing the temporal co-activation of competing lexical items during sentence production.

Specifically, CNV-1 (ARS1_chr14:24950001-24953600), which overlaps with protein-coding regions, showed that a higher copy number (>= 3) was significantly associated with increased ANGPT1 mRNA expression in muscle and improved traits such as carcass weight and muscle quality. These results suggest CNV-1's gain-of-copies genotype could be an effective marker for enhancing growth and meat quality in targeted breeding programs. The ANGPT1 gene plays a crucial role in the regulation of angiogenesis and muscle growth, with previous studies identifying copy number variations (CNVs) within this gene among Leizhou black goats. In this study, we investigated three ANGPT1 CNVs in 417 individuals of LZBG using quantitative PCR (qPCR), examining the impact of different CNV types on the ANGPT1 gene expression and their associations with growth and meat quality traits. Notably, the ANGPT1 CNV-1 (ARS1_chr14:24950001-24953600) overlaps with protein-coding regions and conserved domains; its gain-of-copies genotype (copies >= 3) was significantly correlated with ANGPT1 mRNA expression in muscle tissue (p < 0.01). Furthermore, the gain-of-copies genotype of CNV-1 demonstrated significant correlations with various phenotypic traits, including carcass weight, body weight, shear stress, chest circumference, and cross-sectional area of longissimus dorsi muscle. These findings indicate that the CNV-1 gain-of-copies genotype in the ANGPT1 gene may serve as a valuable marker for selecting Leizhou black goats exhibiting enhanced growth and muscular development characteristics, thereby holding potential applications in targeted breeding programs aimed at improving meat quality.

AB  - Congenital developmental abnormalities in piglets, such as intersex and aproctia, adversely affect survival rates, growth performance, and genetic breeding efficiency in pig populations. To elucidate their genetic basis, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on 1030 Large White pigs. We combined 50 K SNP chip data with SWIM-based genotype imputation to enhance the resolution of genetic variation detection, followed by MLM analysis. Our results identified 53 significant SNPs, with 52 associated with intersex and 1 with aproctia. Key candidate genes included MAD1L1, ID4, EFNA5, and PPP1R16B for intersex and ARNT2 for aproctia. Functional enrichment analysis highlighted pathways related to gonadal development (e.g., progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation) and embryonic morphogenesis. Collectively, the identification of these SNPs and candidate genes advances our understanding of the genetic architecture of intersex and aproctia in piglets. These findings provide actionable insights for optimizing genetic breeding strategies and improving health management in Large White pig production, with potential implications for reducing economic losses caused by congenital disorders.

AB  - The variability in the chemical composition of cereal ethanol coproducts is a limiting factor in the precise use of these ingredients in swine feed. The growth of the corn ethanol industry in Brazil has boosted the availability of diverse coproducts but still lacks proper nutritional characterization, which may differ from other places in the world. The purpose of this study was to determine the values of the net, digestible and metabolizable energy and digestibility coefficients of corn ethanol coproducts produced in Brazil and their effects on the nitrogen balance and blood parameters of pigs. Pigs fed diets with high-protein distiller's dried grain and corn bran with solubles showed greater nitrogen retention efficiency than pigs fed distiller's dried grains with solubles, while pigs fed diets containing corn bran with solubles had lower urea and higher blood triglycerides. This study aimed to determine the values of net energy (NE), digestible energy (DE) and metabolizable energy (ME) and digestibility coefficients of corn ethanol coproducts produced in Brazil and their effects on the nitrogen balance and blood parameters of pigs. Ten barrows were housed in metabolic study cages for total collection and fed a reference diet (RD) or 800 g/kg RD + 200 g/kg of a coproduct of corn ethanol. Distiller's dried grains with solubles (DDGS), corn bran with solubles (CBS), distiller's dried grains (DDG) and high-protein distiller's dried grain (HPDDG) were evaluated. The experimental design was randomized blocks with three repetitions per period, totaling six repetitions per diet. Diets containing the HPDDG had greater DE and ME than those containing CBS and DDGS and greater DE than those containing the DDG (p < 0.05). HPDDG, DDG, CBS and DDGS showed 4498, 3419, 3029 and 3335 kcal/kg DE; 4366, 3305, 2934 and 3214 kcal/kg ME; and 2515, 1938, 1649 and 1725 kcal/kg NE, respectively. Pigs fed diets containing HPDDG and CBS showed greater nitrogen retention efficiency than pigs fed DDGS (p < 0.05). Pigs fed diets containing HPDDG had higher blood urea levels than pigs fed CBS and RD, while triglyceride levels in animals that received the CBS diet were greater than those in animals that received all other diets. The HPDDG had the highest energy levels and the best digestibility coefficients. The chemical composition of coproducts influences the nitrogen balance and circulating levels of urea and triglycerides in pigs.

AB  - PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) is a mitochondrial kinase that protects against oxidative stress-induced cellular death. PINK1 deletion, on the other hand, disrupts mitochondrial calcium (Ca2+) homeostasis in various brain disorders. This study looked at how PINK1 affects hippocampal intracellular Ca2+ changes in mice with septic encephalopathy. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 5 mg/kg) to induce septic encephalopathy; then, fiber photometry was used to record hippocampal Ca2+ transients during behav-ioral tests in freely moving mice. Basal cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels were detected under a fluorescent microscope. LPS induced PINK1 expression and neuronal loss in the hippocampus of mice, whereas no difference in neuronal counts was shown between PINK1 knockout LPS mice and WT LPS mice. PINK1 deficiency led to inhibited Ca2+ transients and increased intracellular Ca2+ levels in the hippocampus of mice, thus, significantly aggravating the cognitive dysfunction in septic mice. An analysis of Parkin and PLC-gamma 1, downstream effectors of PINK1, showed that they are associated with the effects of PINK1. These results demonstrate that PINK1 deficiency disrupts intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis and exacerbates septic encephalopathy. This observation suggests a protective role of PINK1 in septic encephalopathy.

AB  - Dufulin is a biologically derived antiviral agent chemically synthesized by alpha-phosphoramidate in sheep and is effective against viral diseases in plants such as tobacco, rice, cucumber and tomato. However, the environmental behaviors and fate of Dufulin under different cultivation systems remain unknown. This study investigates the absorption, translocation and accumulation of 14C-Dufulin stereoisomers introduced by pesticide leaf daubing and by mixing the pesticide with soil in different tissues of cherry radish. We particularly focused on whether the behaviors of Dufulin enantiomers in plants were stereoselective. In the leaf uptake experiments, S-Dufulin and RDufulin were transported both up and down, while more than 93% of the pesticide remained in the labeled leaves. During the radicular absorption experiments, both enantiomers of Dufulin were taken up by radish roots and moved to the upper part of the plant, while less than 0.2% Dufulin was absorbed from the soil. Hence, it was easier for Dufulin to enter plants through the leaf surface than through the roots. However, we found in this trial that the stereoisomers of Dufulin underwent nonstereoselective absorption and translocation, which implies that rac-Dufulin and its metabolites should be a major research priority. Overall, our results provide a relatively accurate prediction of the risk assessment of Dufulin, which will help guide its rational use in the environment as well as ensure eco-environmental safety and human health.

AB  - Naturally occurring withanolides are secondary metabolites with interesting biological activities in vivo and in vitro. The role of withanolide production in plants is still conjectural though numerous studies strongly indicate a potent feeding deterrent effect against insects and other herbivores. In contrast to the potential medical applications of withanolides, the ecological effects on herbivores have not been studied intensively. In this article, we collect and summarise present studies on herbivore-plant interactions in the light of potential insecticidal functions of withanolides. Moreover, taking the case of the specialist noctuid moth Chloridea (Heliothis) subflexa, we not only illustrate the known negative effects of these compounds seem to have on herbivorous insect species but also discuss how C. subflexa larvae might benefit from adaptation to their host plants in the genus Physalis. Further, we describe potential activation and detoxification mechanisms based on the current state of knowledge.

AB  - Energy balance is essential for normal reproduction of ram. However, the effect of energy restriction (ER) on reactive oxygen species (ROS) of sheep Leydig cells (LCs) and the rescuee methods are still unclear. To investigate the in vitro effect of melatonin on cellular ROS in fER-treated sheep LCs and explore the underlying mechanism, Hu sheep LCs were restricted energy using no serum culture medium and resaved with 10 ng/ml melatonin, respectively. The results showed that ER significantly increased MDA level, while decreased CAT, GHS-px expression and DJm (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, ER decreased testos-terone concentration and cell proliferation rate (p < 0.05). And the expression of testosterone synthesis-related enzymes was also down-regulated by ER (p < 0.05). Furthermore, we revealed that melatonin reversed the defective phenotypes in ER-treated LCs via Sirt1/Sod2 pathway. The interference of Sirt1 abolished the melatonin-mediated improvement of cellular ROS and testosterone secretion. Taken together, our study firstly indicated that melatonin could alleviate the excessive ROS accumulation and promote testosterone biosynthesis in ER-treated sheep LCs via the activation of Sirt1/Sod2 pathway.

AB  - The ovicidal and larvicidal effect of a full aqueous extract (FE) and two phases: an aqueous (Aq-Ph) and an ethyl acetate (EtOAc-Ph) from Ruta chalepensis (Rc) stems and leaves against Haemonchus contortus (Hc) were assessed. The egg hatching inhibition (EHI) assay and larval mortality (LM) test were performed by triplicate in 96-well micro-titration plates (n=4 wells). The FE against Hc eggs and larvae was assessed at 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10 and 20 mg/mL; and 30, 60, 90, 120,150 and 200 mg/ mL, respectively. The ovicidal effect of Aq-F and EtOAc-F was assessed at 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10 and 20 mg/mL. Plates were incubated at 28 degrees C for 48 (ovicidal assay) and 72 h (larvicidal assay). The EHI results were considered based on the mean number of eggs hatching failure after 48 h exposure. The LM was recorded after 72 h exposure to the Rc phases and expressed as mortality percentage. The Rc FE caused 96 and 100% EHI at 10 and 20 mg/mL, respectively; meanwhile, 74% LM was recorded at 200 mg/mL (p<0.05). The Aq-Ph showed 78.5% EHI at 2.5 mg/mL. Likewise, the EtOAc-Ph caused 100% EHI in almost all concentrations. Eighteen compounds including alkaloids, cumarins, triterpens, flavonoids, tannins, saponins and sterols were identified by GC-MS analysis. The results indicate that the aqueous extract from Rc possesses bioactive compounds with in vitro nematocidal activity against Hc; mainly in the EtOAc-Ph. Further studies should be performed to elucidate those compounds searching for alternative methods of control of the sheep haemonchosis.

AB  - Plants transmit ecologically relevant messages to neighbouring plants through chemical cues. For instance, insect herbivory triggers the production of herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs), which can enhance neighbouring plant defences. HIPVs are emitted from directly damaged plant tissues and from systemic, nondamaged tissues. Although volatile-mediated interplant interactions have been observed both above- and belowground, it remains unknown whether belowground herbivory induces systemic HIPVs aboveground that influence neighbouring plants. To explore how belowground herbivory affects interplant interactions aboveground, we characterised systemic HIPVs from squash induced by belowground striped cucumber beetle (Acalymma vittatum) larval herbivory. We exposed squash 'receiver plants' to systemic HIPVs or volatiles from nondamaged plants. We then measured herbivore resistance by challenging 'receiver plants' with aboveground-feeding herbivores: adult beetles (A. vittatum) or squash bugs (Anasa tristis). We discovered belowground-damaged plants emitted more (E)-beta-ocimene, a key volatile from the systemic HIPV blend, than nondamaged controls, and that exposure to systemic HIPVs enhanced neighbouring plant resistance to aboveground squash bugs, but not adult beetles. Further investigations into the mechanism of interplant interaction revealed beta-ocimene alone can elicit plant resistance against squash bugs. Overall, our findings reveal a novel form of volatile-mediated interactions between plants spanning across aboveground-belowground plant systems.
   Belowground insect herbivory alters aboveground volatiles emitted by squash plants. Exposing neighbouring plants to these volatiles enhances plant resistance to an aboveground heterospecific insect herbivore, but not aboveground conspecifics.

AB  - Bisphenol A (BPA) is related to neurological disorders involving mitochondrial dysfunction, while the mechanism remains elusive. Therefore, we explored it through in vitro and in vivo experiments. In vitro, hippocampal neurons derived from neonatal rats of different genders were exposed to 1-100 nM and 100 mu M BPA, autophagy activator Rapa and inhibitor 3-MA for 7 d. The results suggested that even nanomolar BPA (1-100 nM) disturbed Ca2+ homeostasis and damaged the integrity of mitochondrial cristae in neurons (p < 0.05). Furthermore, BPA increased the number of autophagic lysosomes, LC3II/LC3I ratio, and p62 expression, and decreased parkin expression (p < 0.05), suggesting that the entry of damaged mitochondria into autophagic pathway was prompted, while the autophagic degradation pathway was blocked. This further disrupts neuronal energy metabolism and promotes neuronal apoptosis. However, Rapa attenuated the adverse effects caused by BPA, while 3-MA exacerbated these reactions. In vivo, exposure of juvenile rats to 0.5, 50, 5000 mu g/kg.bw/day BPA during PND 7-21 markedly impaired the structure of hippocampal mitochondria, increased the number of autophagosomes, the rate of neuronal apoptosis, and the expression levels of pro-apoptotic proteins Cyt C, Bax, Bak1, and Caspase3, and decreased the expression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl2 (p < 0.05). Particularly, male rats are more sensitive to low-dose BPA than females. Overall, environmental-doses BPA can induce the imbalance of energy metabolism in hippocampal neurons via PINK1/parkin mitophagy, thereby inducing their apoptosis. Importantly, this study provides a theoretical basis for attenuating BPA-related neurological diseases.

AB  - Simple Summary Young cervids build their skeleton during the growth of their first antlers, which is why this is a period of great demand for minerals. The mineral compositions of bone marrow, plasma, bones, and antlers are good indicators of changes that occur in the metabolism of farmed fallow deer. The aim of the study was to analyze the concentrations of 21 mineral elements (bulk elements: Ca, P, Mg, K, Na; trace elements: Li, Cr, Mn, Co, Cu, Zn, Se, Mo; and toxic elements: Be, Al, As, Cd, Sb, Ba, Pb, Ni) in the aforementioned tissues. The highest content was characterized by bulk elements whose content increased in bone, bone marrow and antlers according to the following series: Ca > P > Na > Mg > K. The plasma was characterized by a different concentration of individual elements in the order of Na > K > Ca > P > Mg. The analysis of trace and toxic elements indicated that higher levels were recorded in bone tissues (in antlers and then in bones). It is worth emphasizing that the research indicates a negative correlation between Ca and Cd and between Ca and Pb and between P and Pb in tissues. An adequate supply of essential nutrients is particularly important during the skeletal growth and development of young deer, especially in males, who build new antlers each year. The aim of the research was to analyze the levels of 21 mineral elements (including the bulk elements: Ca, P, Mg, K, Na; trace elements: Li, Cr, Mn, Co, Cu, Zn, Se, Mo; and toxic elements: Be, Al, As, Cd, Sb, Ba, Pb, Ni) in the bone marrow, plasma, bones, and first antlers of farmed fallow deer (Dama dama). The mineral compositions of tissues were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Higher concentrations of Ca, P, Mg, Cr, Zn, Se, Al, Ba and Ni were found in bone marrow than in plasma. The highest concentrations of Ca, P and Ba were recorded in fallow deer bone, while the highest concentrations of Mg, K, Na, Li, Cr, Mn, Co, Cu, Zn, Se, Mo, Be, Al, As, Sb, Pb and Ni were found in the antlers. Moreover, the research showed a significant negative relationship between Ca and Cd, and between Ca and Pb, and P and Pb (r(S) = -0.70, r(S) = -0.80, and r(S) = -0.66, respectively; p < 0.05) in the tissues.

AB  - Heterosis is extensively used to improve crop productivity, yet its allelic and chromatin regulation remains unclear. Based on our resolved genomes of the maternal TGY and paternal HD, we analyzed the contribution of allele-specific expression (ASE) and chromatin accessibility of JGY and HGY, the artificial hybrids of oolong tea with the largest cultivated area in China. The ASE genes (ASEGs) of tea hybrids with maternal-biased were mainly related to the energy and terpenoid metabolism pathways, whereas the ASEGs with paternal-biased tend to be enriched in glutathione metabolism, and these parental bias of hybrids may coordinate and lead to the acquisition of heterosis in more biological pathways. ATAC-seq results showed that hybrids have significantly higher accessible chromatin regions (ACRs) compared with their parents, which may confer broader and stronger transcriptional activity of genes in hybrids. The number of ACRs with significantly increased accessibility in hybrids was much greater than decreased, and the associated alleles were also affected by differential ACRs across different parents, suggesting enhanced positive chromatin regulation and potential genetic effects in hybrids. Core ASEGs of terpene and purine alkaloid metabolism pathways with significant positive heterosis have greater chromatin accessibility in hybrids, and were potentially regulated by several members of the MYB, DOF and TRB families. The binding motif of CsMYB85 in the promoter ACR of the rate-limiting enzyme CsDXS was verified by DAP-seq. These results suggest that higher numbers and more accessible ACRs in hybrids contribute to the regulation of ASEGs, thereby affecting the formation of heterotic metabolites.

AB  - Simple Summary Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS) is an infectious disease of viral etiology characteristic of the swine species. Although almost three decades have passed since its emergence, control of the disease still presents significant issues, representing a source of concern for veterinarians and breeders. In addition to management difficulties, the PRRS virus (PRRSV) causes severe economic losses in terms of abortions, a decrease in animal growth, increased mortality, and the massive use of drugs. Understanding the genetic markers involved in the response to the infection is challenging and crucial and represents the main goal of this study. CD163, which encodes the membrane receptor used by the PRRSV to enter macrophages and initiate infection, has been identified as one of the most promising marker genes associated with genetic susceptibility to the disease. In this study, detection by sequencing of the more significant polymorphisms on the CD163 gene was conducted for the first time on 377 pigs reared in different farms distributed in some areas of Central Italy. The genotyping data obtained in this work, together with the assessment of the virological status of the animals and the comparison with the findings from other PRRSV conditioned and experimental infection trials, will allow a better understanding of whether some Italian pig populations can represent a good genetic resource and a reservoir of resistance/"resilience" markers to PRRS. Indeed, marker-assisted selection (MAS) could represent an alternative and a more valid tool than vaccination to control the spread of this impactful disease. Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS) caused by the PRRS virus affects farmed pigs worldwide, causing direct and indirect losses. The most severe manifestations of PRRS infection are observed in piglets and pregnant sows. The clinical outcome of the infection depends on the PRRSV strain's virulence, the pregnancy state of the female, environmental factors, the presence of protective antibodies due to previous infections, and the host's genetic susceptibility. The latter aspect was investigated in this study, in particular, evaluating the most significant polymorphisms (SNPs) of the CD163 gene in slaughtered pigs reared in Central Italy. Total RNAs were extracted from 377 swine samples and subjected to RT-PCR targeted to the CD163 gene, followed by sequencing analysis. Contextually, the viral RNA was detected by RT-qPCR in order to phenotypically categorize animals into infected and not infected. In particular, 36 haplotypes were found, and their frequencies ranged from 0.13% to 35.15%. There were 62 resulting genotypes, three of which were associated with a putative resistance to the disease. Both the haplotypes and genotypes were inferred by PHASE v.2.1 software. To the best of our knowledge, this type of investigation was conducted for the first time on pig livestock distributed in different regions of Central Italy. Thus, the obtained findings may be considered very important since they add useful information about swine genetic background in relation to PRRS infection, from the perspective of adopting Marker-Assisted Selection (MAS) as a possible and alternative strategy to control this still widespread disease.

AB  - Anthropogenic factors are those that occur due to human activities. The exposome is proposed to complement the genome, wherein an individual's exposure begins before birth. The range of exposures includes physical, chemical, dietary, lifestyle, biological, and occupational sources. Exposome has a positive or negative influence on neuroplasticity during different stages of life. A comprehensive study of the exposome is thus necessary to incorporate these factors and their influence on the individual, community, and the population as a whole. Exposomic research and global health present significant opportunities for interdisciplinary research. This review gives an overview of the exposome and its influence on neuroplasticity. It proposes methods to study the exposome on neuroplasticity across the lifespan of the individual. This is possible with the use of self-reported data, large-scale cohort formation, physiological sensors, neuroimaging, omics, molecular biology, and systems approaches. These approaches aim to provide a holistic understanding of an individual's neurological well-being and its implications for the population at large. This will also enable the designing of novel preventive and treatment strategies for managing neurological disorders.

AB  - Background: Prior studies show that neighborhood disadvantage negatively impacts children's cognitive function and brain volume. However, despite their co-occurrence, there is a lack of cohesive examination of the joint effects of environmental and social factors on brain volumes. Objectives: Using environmental mixture methods, we investigated the association between a child's neighborhood environment and brain volume in regions relevant for cognitive and cognitive-affective function. Methods: We leveraged a sample of 8574 nine and ten-year-old children from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study. Exposures included 22 social and 7 environmental exposures linked to participants' baseline addresses. Neighborhood exposome profiles were represented using self-organizing maps. Baseline cortical and subcortical volumes in 16 regions were analyzed using linear mixed effects models with neighborhood exposome profile as a categorical exposure, adjusting for individual-level demographic variables and multiple testing. We used Weighted Quantile Sum (WQS) regression to examine the total mixture effect and the relative contribution of each individual exposure to the total mixture effect. Results: Participants living in profiles defined by moderate neighborhood deprivation, high ozone, and poor walkability had greater right caudal middle frontal gyrus volumes compared to those in the reference cluster (beta: 0.11; 95% CI: 0.05, 0.17). WQS indicated that this association was primarily driven by home value and ozone concentration. Discussion: We identified multiple social and environmental factors in association with greater right caudal middle frontal gyrus volume. These results provide evidence of how multiple facets of the neighborhood environment can impact the developing brain and potentially increase the risk of future psychopathology.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Semen cryopreservation is a complex process during which there is alteration in the expression of sperm and seminal plasma proteins, molecular weight of protein or loss of membrane proteins during the process. In order to compensate for these changes, different membrane stabilizers are used in freezing semen extenders. However, there is scarcity of such studies during cryopreservation of goat semen. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of membrane stabilizers on sperm membrane protein expression during cryopreservation of goat semen. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 36 semen ejaculates from nine Assam Hill Goat bucks aged 2 to 2.5 years was collected by artificial vagina method. Three membrane stabilizers, each at two different concentrations viz. 50 and 80 mM sucrose, 50 and 100 mM trehalose, and 100 and 150 ng/mL IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor 1 protein) were added to Tris-citric acid fructose egg yolk glycerol (TCFEYG) extender and semen samples were cryopreserved. The sperm membrane protein profile was studied in fresh and cryopreserved semen by SDS-PAGE. RESULTS: SDS-PAGE of sperm membrane extract of fresh semen revealed the presence of 24 protein bands with molecular weights ranging from 10 kDa to 240 kDa. Samples supplemented with 50 mM sucrose and 80 mM sucrose revealed 21 protein bands with molecular weights ranging from 10 kDa to 240 kDa. All the 21 protein bands were same as those observed in the sperm membrane of fresh spermatozoa, except that the 23 kDa, 29 kDa and 42 kDa bands were absent in frozen semen. Similarly, frozen semen extended with 50 mM trehalose and 100 mM trehalose revealed 22 protein bands with molecular weights ranging from 10 kDa to 240 kDa, but lacking the 29 kDa and 42 kDa bands. Proteins with molecular weights of 29 kDa, 130 kDa and 240 kDa were absent in frozen semen supplemented with 100 ng/mL IGF-1 and 150 ng/mL IGF-1. CONCLUSION: The present study revealed that supplementation of tris basic extender with trehalose at 100 mM and or IGF-1 at 100 ng/mL or 150 ng/mL improves the post-thaw semen characteristics and protects certain fertility related sperm membrane proteins.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) is a limited nutrient for both plants and herbivores. How plants reallocate N upon herbivore attack is vital for plant tolerance to herbivores. Here we investigated N reallocation in rice during a 2-day herbivore attack by a generalist herbivore Spodoptera litura and 2 days after herbivore removal. Labeled N-15 was translocated during insect attack from feeding-damaged leaves to roots, particularly to young roots. The amounts of chlorophyll and Rubisco were significantly reduced in the attacked leaves. Both free amino acids and nitrate accumulated in the damaged leaves and young roots, while ammonium content was decreased. Activities of nitrate reductase and glutamine synthetase were enhanced in feeding-damaged leaves but inhibited in young roots. The expression of amino acid transporters OsAAP6, OsAAT15, and jasmonate-responsive genes OsAOS, OsMAPK3, OsMAPK6 was induced in the damaged leaves. However, 2 days after herbivore removal, N uptake was increased and herbivory-induced N-15 transfer to roots was partially reverted back to the damaged leaves, resulting in N levels in the previously damaged leaves were even higher than that in control leaves. Collectively, our results indicate a dynamic N reallocation in rice responses to insect herbivory.

AB  - Simple Summary In this study, bioinformatics approaches were used to better understand the genetic architecture of internal organ weights in three-way crossbred commercial pigs and to map genetic markers and genes. For this purpose, we used single-trait and multi-trait genome-wide association studies (GWASs) followed by a haplotype block analysis. We explored the key genetic markers and genes from the internal organ weight genome-wide association study results of three-way crossbred commercial pigs. In this manner, five genes, TPK1, POU6F2, PBX3, UNC5C, and BMPR1B, were defined as central in affecting internal organ weight in pigs. Moreover, APK1, ANO6, and UNC5C were identified to be pleiotropic in multi-trait GWASs. These results can be applied to various types of genomic studies of pigs. Internal organ weight is an essential indicator of growth status as it reflects the level of growth and development in pigs. However, the associated genetic architecture has not been well explored because phenotypes are difficult to obtain. Herein, we performed single-trait and multi-trait genome-wide association studies (GWASs) to map the genetic markers and genes associated with six internal organ weight traits (including heart weight, liver weight, spleen weight, lung weight, kidney weight, and stomach weight) in 1518 three-way crossbred commercial pigs. In summation, single-trait GWASs identified a total of 24 significant single- nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 5 promising candidate genes, namely, TPK1, POU6F2, PBX3, UNC5C, and BMPR1B, as being associated with the six internal organ weight traits analyzed. Multi-trait GWAS identified four SNPs with polymorphisms localized on the APK1, ANO6, and UNC5C genes and improved the statistical efficacy of single-trait GWASs. Furthermore, our study was the first to use GWASs to identify SNPs associated with stomach weight in pigs. In conclusion, our exploration of the genetic architecture of internal organ weights helps us better understand growth traits, and the key SNPs identified could play a potential role in animal breeding programs.

AB  - The objective of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of a porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) double vaccination in weaning piglets reared for gilts under field conditions. The study was conducted at a Greek farrow-to-finish conventional pig farm with a previous history of PCV2 infections. The trial included 96 female piglets at 21 days of age, which were equally allocated to two different study groups. Piglets of the group-1 received a single PCV2 vaccination at 21 days of age, while piglets of the group-2 were double vaccinated against PCV2, at 21 and 42 days of age. The results indicated that the piglets of group-2 had better growth performance, as they showed higher body weight (BW) and average daily weight gain (ADWG). In addition, ELISA tests showed that the double-vaccinated piglets presented a better humoral response against PCV2, as higher levels of IgG antibodies were detected in them than the piglets of the group-1. In conclusion, the current results suggested that a double PCV2 vaccination of piglets, reared for gilts, on a PCV2-affected farm could lead to higher protection against the virus.

AB  - Silicon is important for antiherbivore defence in crops: a new mechanism involving the movement of soluble silicon in the phloem is proposed to explain localized induction of silicon defences.
   In response to herbivory, many grasses, including crops such as wheat, accumulate significant levels of silicon (Si) as an antiherbivore defence. Damage-induced increases in Si can be localized in damaged leaves or be more systemic, but the mechanisms leading to these differences in Si distribution remain untested. Ten genetically diverse wheat landraces (Triticum aestivum) were used to assess genotypic variation in Si induction in response to mechanical damage and how this was affected by exogenous Si supply. Total and soluble Si levels were measured in damaged and undamaged leaves as well as in the phloem to test how Si was allocated to different parts of the plant after damage. Localized, but not systemic, induction of Si defences occurred, and was more pronounced when plants had supplemental Si. Damaged plants had significant increases in Si concentration in their damaged leaves, while the Si concentration in undamaged leaves decreased, such that there was no difference in the average Si concentration of damaged and undamaged plants. The increased Si in damaged leaves was due to the redirection of soluble Si, present in the phloem, from undamaged to damaged plant parts, potentially a more cost-effective defence mechanism for plants than increased Si uptake.

AB  - The precipitation gradient (PG) is a crucial parameter for watershed hydrological models. Analysis of daily precipitation and elevation data from 30 stations in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau (SETP) during the active phase of the Indian monsoon reveals distinct patterns. Below 3000 m, precipitation generally decreases with increasing altitude. Between 3000 and 4000 m, precipitation patterns are more complex; in western regions, precipitation increases with elevation, whereas in eastern regions, it decreases. Above 4000 m, up to the highest observation point of 4841 m, precipitation continues to decrease with elevation, with a more pronounced decline beyond a critical height. In the SETP, PGs for LYR and NYR are positive, at 11.3 +/- 2.7 mm/100 m and 17.3 +/- 3.8 mm/100 m, respectively. Conversely, PLZB exhibits a negative PG of -22.3 +/- 4.2 mm/100 m. The Yarlung Zangbo River (YLZBR) water vapor channel plays a significant role in these PGs, with the direction and flux of water vapor potentially influencing both the direction and magnitude of the PG. Additional factors such as precipitation intensity, the number of precipitation days, precipitation frequency, and station selection also significantly impact the PG. Notable correlations between elevation and variables such as the number of precipitation days, non-precipitation days, and precipitation intensity. The precipitation intensity gradients (PIGs) are 0.06 +/- 0.02 mm/d/100 m, 0.11 +/- 0.04 mm/d/100 m, and -0.18 +/- 0.04 mm/d/100 m for the three catchments, respectively. Future research should incorporate remote sensing data and expand site networks, particularly in regions above 5000 m, to enhance the accuracy of precipitation-elevation relationship assessments, providing more reliable data for water resource simulation and disaster warning.

AB  - Although white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum) are common in captivity, few behavioral studies have been conducted and there is seemingly no research for immersive exhibits where potential for visitor effects is high. Moreover, little information exists on possible effects of weather and temperature on rhino outside their native range. Here we analyze 14,501 observations of rhino in a drive-through enclosure. Data were collected by researchers (n = 12,160 datapoints) and keepers (n = 2341 datapoints) over a 4-month period. We aimed to: (1) quantify behavior using detailed researcher-collected data and contemporaneous but ad hoc keeper-collected data; (2) compare datasets statistically; (3) establish effects of visitors, temperature, and weather on behavior; and (4) assess the influence of visitors on similarity of researcher/keeper datasets. Activity budgets were similar to the wild and the single previous study from a traditional (nondrive-through) enclosure. There was some discrepancy in activity budgets between researcher and keeper data due to significant differences in recorded frequency of two rare behaviors (horn rub; social interaction) and two behaviors that could be easily confused (grazing vs. standing with head-down): recording of other behaviors matched well. Weather and temperature affected behavior, with rhino becoming more sedentary (-locomotion, grazing; +resting, standing, and sedentary eating of hay) on hot/sunny days compared to cool/wet days. The number of visitor vehicles had a fairly negligible effect but resting was lower on busy days, possibly as vigilance increased. The match between researcher/keeper datasets was lowest when visitor numbers were high, suggesting visitors might affect keeper ability to accurately record behavior.

AB  - Sheep farming is a common agricultural practice in Greece, with many sheep populations belonging to Greek breeds. However, their genetic makeup remains relatively unexplored and limited information is available for their genetic variability. Here, we provide the first whole genome sequencing (WGS) data for six Greek sheep breeds, namely Chios, Kalarritiko, Karagouniko, Lesvos, Serres, and Thraki breeds. We performed variant discovery analysis on the data and identified 23,526,500 high-quality variants. The high average variant depth (148.7X +/- 28.3) and low Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) density (1 variant per 111 bases) in the callset demonstrated the high quality of the data. The vast majority of the variants (97.46%) were located in non-coding regions, while a small percentage (1.32%) was positioned in exonic regions. The overall transition to transversion-Ti/Tv (2.449) and heterozygous to non-reference homozygous-Het/Hom (1.49) ratios further confirmed the callset's high quality. This dataset comprises the first WGS data for six Greek sheep breeds, providing invaluable information to the Greek agricultural sector for the design and implementation of targeted breeding schemes, for traceability purposes, and for the overall enhancement of the sector, in terms of performance and sustainability.

AB  - The silverleaf whitefly Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius, 1889) (Homoptera: Aleyrodidae) is a serious invasive herbivorous insect pest worldwide. The excessive use of pesticides has progressively selected B. tabaci specimens, reducing the effectiveness of the treatments, and ultimately ending in the selection of pesticide-resistant strains. The management of this crop pest has thus become challenging owing to the level of resistance to all major classes of recommended insecticides. Here, we used in silico techniques for detecting sequence polymorphisms in ace1 gene from naturally occurring B. tabaci variants, and monitor the presence and frequency of the detected putative mutations from 30 populations of the silverleaf whitefly from Egypt and Pakistan. We found several point mutations in ace1-type acetylcholinesterase (ace1) in the studied B. tabaci variants naturally occurring in the field. By comparing ace1 sequence data from an organophosphate-susceptible and an organophosphate-resistant strains of B. tabaci to ace1 sequence data retrieved from GenBank for that species and to nucleotide polymorphisms from other arthropods, we identified novel mutations that could potentially influence insecticide resistance. Homology modeling and molecular docking analyses were performed to determine if the mutation-induced changes in form 1 acetylcholinesterase (AChE1) structure could confer resistance to carbamate and organophosphate insecticides. Mutations had small effects on binding energy (Delta G(b)) interactions between mutant AChE1 and insecticides; they altered the conformation of the peripheral anionic site of AChE1, and modified the enzyme surface, and these changes have potential effects on the target-site sensitivity. Altogether, the results from this study provide information on genic variants of B. tabaci ace1 for future monitoring insecticide resistance development and report a potential case of environmentally driven gene variations.

AB  - This study investigates the effect of de-SUMOylated hexokinase 1 (HK1) degradation on sperm capacitation in vitro. Sperm from adult Landrace pigs was divided into three groups: non-capacitated group, capacitated group, and 16 mM 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) group. Immunoprecipitation was performed to detect the binding levels of HK1 and small ubiquitin-like modifier 1 (SUMO1) before and after capacitation. Western blotting was used to assess the degradation pathways of HK1 and tyrosine phosphorylation levels after capacitation. Immunofluorescence was employed to localize HK1 and SUMO1 in sperm. A kit was used to measure pyruvate and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content. Fluorescent staining was used to detect reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, zinc (Zn2+) levels, calcium (Ca2+) levels, and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in sperm. Hoechst 33342 staining was used to visualize sperm nuclei and assess sperm-oocyte adhesion rates. The results showed that inhibition of HK1 activity significantly reduced pyruvate and ATP content, sperm capacitation markers (tyrosine phosphorylation, Zn2+), MMP, and sperm adhesion rates (P < 0.05), while significantly increasing ROS levels in capacitated sperm (P < 0.01). Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting results indicated that HK1 undergoes de-SUMOylation during capacitation and is selectively degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (P < 0.01). Our findings suggest that de-SUMOylated HK1 activates the glycolytic pathway through ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP) degradation, thereby promoting sperm capacitation. These results provide new theoretical insights into the molecular mechanisms of sperm capacitation.

AB  - Simple Summary Subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA) is a most prevalent metabolic disorder of ruminants which poses a great threat to the health and wellbeing of animals. The purpose of this research was to induce SARA in in vitro conditions and to determine the potential of active dry yeast (ADT) and thiamine synergistically in mitigating the adverse effects of SARA. Both the supplements ADY and thiamine synergistically enhanced the ruminal pH, decreased the abundance of negative rumen bacteria and increased the abundance of useful rumen bacteria and protozoa. It was concluded that the combined use of ADY and thiamine as a supplement could mitigate SARA. SARA not only damages the health of the animals but also has detrimental effects on the economic conditions of the farmers. Therefore, this research could be beneficial for society. Ruminal acidosis is a type of metabolic disorder of high-yielding ruminants which is associated with the consumption of a high-grain diet. It not only harms the productive efficiency, health and wellbeing of the animals but also has detrimental effects on the economy of the farmers. Various strategies have been adapted to control ruminal acidosis. However, none of them have produced the desired results. This research was carried out to investigate the potential of active dry yeast (ADY) and thiamine in a synergistic mode to mitigate in vitro-induced ruminal acidosis. The purpose of this study was to determine how active dry yeast alone and in combination with thiamine affected the ruminal pH, lactate, volatile fatty acids, lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and microbial community in in vitro-induced ruminal acidosis. The experiment comprises three treatment groups, (1) SARA/control, (2) ADY and (3) ADYT (ADY + thiamine). In vitro batch fermentation was conducted for 24 h. The results indicated that ruminal induced successfully and both additives improved the final pH (p < 0.01) and decreased the LPS and lactate (p < 0.01) level as compared to the SARA group. However, the ADYT group decreased the level of lactate below 0.5 mmol/L. Concomitant to fermentation indicators, both the treatment groups decreased (p < 0.05) the abundance of lactate-producing bacteria while enhancing (p < 0.01) the abundance of lactate-utilizing bacteria. However, ADYT also increased (p < 0.05) the abundance of protozoa compared to the SARA and ADY group. Therefore, it can be concluded that ADY and thiamine in synergistic mode could be a better strategy in combating the adverse effects of subacute ruminal acidosis.

AB  - Plants are naturally subjected to various types of biotic stresses, including pathogenic microorganisms and herbivory by insects, which trigger different signaling pathways and related defense mechanisms. Inoculation with microorganisms, such as plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR), can be seen as a form of stress because it triggers a systemic resistance response in plants similar to that caused by insect herbivory. However, these interactions have typically been studied independently, which has limited the understanding of their combined effects. This study examines the effects of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens GB03 inoculation and Spodoptera frugiperda herbivory on the total phenolic contents of Ocimum basilicum. We also analyze the levels of endogenous phytohormones and the activity of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), a crucial enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of phenolic defense-related metabolites. The results indicate that the total phenolic content significantly increased only in plants that were both inoculated by GB03 and damaged by larvae. Additionally, PAL activity showed an increase in plants that were damaged by larvae and in those subjected to the combined treatment of larval damage and inoculation with GB03. Regarding phytohormones, in plants damaged by insects, the levels of salicylic acid (SA) increased, regardless of whether they were inoculated or not, while the levels of jasmonic acid-isoleucine (JA-ile) rose in all treatments compared to the control. This study highlights the intricate relationships among beneficial microbes, herbivores, and plant defense mechanisms, emphasizing their potential impact on improving plant resilience and the production of secondary metabolites. Furthermore, understanding the independent effects of PGPR inoculation, beyond its interaction with herbivory, could provide valuable insights into its role as a sustainable alternative for enhancing plant defense responses and promoting crop productivity.

AB  - Simple Summary: Ram semen frequently presents with bacterial contamination, which may affect the resulting sperm vitality and fertilization ability. Since semen quality is of paramount importance for the successful artificial insemination of ewes, we focused on the description of bacterial profiles of ejaculates collected from three Slovak sheep breeds. Furthermore, we strived to unravel the effect of bacteriospermia on the immunological characteristics and oxidative profile of semen, both of which seem to play a role in bacteria-inflicted damage to male gametes.
   Bacterial contamination of semen is an often overlooked, yet important, factor contributing to decreased sperm vitality. Understanding the impact of bacterial presence on sperm structural integrity and functional activity may assist the development of effective strategies to prevent, or manage, bacteriospermia in the breeding practice. The aim of this study was to describe the bacterial profiles of ram semen (n = 35), and we also focused on the associations between bacteriospermia, sperm structure, and function, as well as oxidative and inflammatory characteristics of semen. For a better insight, the samples were divided into three groups, according to the breeds used in the study: nativeWallachian (NW), improvedWallachian (IW), and Slovak dairy (SD) breeds. The results showed a significantly lower motility and membrane integrity in the NW group in comparison to the IW and SD groups, which was accompanied by a significantly higher concentration of leukocytes, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and subsequent oxidative insults to the sperm lipids and proteins. Accordingly, the NW group presented with the highest bacterial load, in which Staphylococcus and Escherichia were the predominant representatives. The Pearson correlation analysis uncovered positive relationships amongst the bacterial load and leukocytospermia (r = 0.613), the extent of lipid peroxidation (r = 0.598), protein oxidation (r = 0.514), and DNA fragmentation (r = 0.638). Furthermore, positive correlations were found between the bacterial load and proinflammatory molecules, such as the C-reactive protein (r = 0.592), interleukin 1 (r = 0.709), and interleukin 6 (r = 0.474), indicating a possible involvement of the immune response in the process of bacteriospermia. Overall, our data indicate that ram semen quality may be equally affected by the bacterial load and diversity. Furthermore, we can assume that the presence of bacteria in ejaculates triggers inflammatory processes, causes ROS overproduction, and, thereby, contributes to alterations in the sperm structure, while at the same time compromising the fertilization ability of male gametes.

AB  - Optimal dietary calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) requirements remain undetermined for Ningxiang pigs, a valuable indigenous Chinese breed. This study conducted a continuous feeding trial with two growth phases (grower: 30-50 kg; finisher: 50-80 kg) using fixed Ca/P ratios to systematically evaluate the effects of Ca/P levels on growth performance and mineral metabolism. A total of 180 pigs per phase were allocated to four Ca/P levels. During the grower phase, a dietary regimen of 0.83% Ca/0.67% P significantly increased the average daily feed intake (ADFI), average daily gain (ADG), and apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of energy and P. In the finisher phase, 0.60/0.48% Ca/P showed optimal growth performance, upregulated jejunal mineral transporters (CaSR and SLC34A2), enhanced bone mineralization (metatarsal ash content), and improved intestinal morphology (duodenal and jejunal villus height, jejunal villus surface area). This regimen also selectively enriched Peptostreptococcaceae abundance, indicating improved host-microbe interactions. Based on these findings, stage-specific nutritional strategies were recommended: 0.83% Ca/0.67% P during the grower phase and 0.60% Ca/0.48% P during the finisher phase. These protocols synergistically improve microbial ecology, intestinal function, and bone metabolism, thereby maximizing the growth potential of Ningxiang pigs.

AB  - Background PGF2 alpha is essential for the induction of the corpus luteum regression which in turn reduces progesterone production. Early growth response (EGR) proteins are Cys2-His2-type zinc-finger transcription factor that are strongly linked to cellular proliferation, survival and apoptosis. Rapid elevation of EGR1 was observed after luteolytic dose of PGF2 alpha. EGR1 is involved in the transactivation of many genes, including TGF beta 1, which plays an important role during luteal regression. Methods The current study was conducted in buffalo luteal cells with the aim to better understand the role of EGR1 in transactivation of TGF beta 1 during PGF2 alpha induced luteal regression. Luteal cells from mid stage corpus luteum of buffalo were cultured and treated with different doses of PGF2 alpha for different time durations. Relative expression of mRNAs encoding for enzymes within the progesterone biosynthetic pathway (3 beta HSD, CYP11A1 and StAR); Caspase 3; AKT were analyzed to confirm the occurrence of luteolytic event. To determine if EGR1 is involved in the PGF2 alpha induced luteal regression via induction of TGF beta 1 expression, we knocked out the EGR1 gene by using CRISPR/Cas9. Result The present experiment determined whether EGR1 protein expression in luteal cells was responsive to PGF2 alpha treatment. Quantification of EGR1 and TGF beta 1 mRNA showed significant up regulation in luteal cells of buffalo at 12 h post PGF2 alpha induction. In order to validate the role of PGF2 alpha on stimulating the expression of TGF beta 1 by an EGR1 dependent mechanism we knocked out EGR1. The EGR1 ablated luteal cells were stimulated with PGF2 alpha and it was observed that EGR1 KO did not modulate the PGF2 alpha induced expression of TGF beta 1. In PGF2 alpha treated EGR1 KO luteal cell, the mRNA expression of Caspase 3 was significantly increased compared to PGF2 alpha treated wild type luteal cells maintained for 12 h. We also studied the influence of EGR1 on steroidogenesis. The EGR1 KO luteal cells with PGF2 alpha treatment showed no substantial difference either in the progesterone concentration or in StAR mRNA expression with PGF2 alpha-treated wild type luteal cells. Conclusion These results suggest that EGR1 signaling is not the only factor which plays a role in the regulation of PGF2 alpha induced TGF beta 1 signaling for luteolysis.

AB  - Recently, we found that 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) - the most toxic dioxin - affected multiple cellular processes in AhR-knocked-down granulosa cells, including the expres-sion of genes and the abundance of proteins. Such alterations may imply the involvement of noncoding RNAs in the remodeling of intracellular regulatory tracks. The aims of the current study were to examine the effects of TCDD on the expression of lncRNAs in AhR-knocked-down granulosa cells of pigs and to indicate potential target genes for differentially expressed lncRNAs (DELs). In the current study, the abundance of AhR protein in porcine granulosa cells was reduced by 98.9% at 24 h after AhR targeted siRNA transfection. Fifty-seven DELs were identified in the AhR-deficient cells treated with TCDD mostly after 3 h (3 h: 56, 12 h: 0, 24 h: 2) after the dioxin treatment. This number was 2.5 times higher than that of intact TCDD-treated granulosa cells. The high number of DELs identified in the early stages of the TCDD action may be associated with a rapid defensive response of cells to harmful actions of this persistent environmental pollutant. In contrast to intact TCDD-treated granulosa cells, AhR-deficient cells were characterized by a broader representation of DELs enriched in GO terms related to the immune response and regulation of transcription and cell cycle. The obtained results support the notion that TCDD may act in an AhR-independent manner. They increase our knowledge on the intracellular mechanism of TCDD action and may in the future contribute to better coping with detrimental consequences of human and animal exposure to TCDD.

AB  - Hunting has a long tradition in human evolutionary history and remains a common leisure activity or an important source of food. Herein, we first briefly review the literature on the demographic consequences of hunting and associated analytical methods. We then address the question of potential selective hunting and its possible genetic/evolutionary consequences. Birds have historically been popular models for demographic studies, and the huge amount of census and ringing data accumulated over the last century has paved the way for research about the demographic effects of harvesting. By contrast, the literature on the evolutionary consequences of harvesting is dominated by studies on mammals (especially ungulates) and fish. In these taxa, individuals selected for harvest often have particular traits such as large body size or extravagant secondary sexual characters (e.g. antlers, horns, etc.). Our review shows that targeting individuals according to such genetically heritable traits can exert strong selective pressures and alter the evolutionary trajectory of populations for these or correlated traits. Studies focusing on the evolutionary consequences of hunting in birds are extremely rare, likely because birds within populations appear much more similar, and do not display individual differences to the same extent as many mammals and fishes. Nevertheless, even without conscious choice by hunters, there remains the potential for selection through hunting in birds, for example by genetically inherited traits such as personality or pace-of-life. We emphasise that because so many bird species experience high hunting pressure, the possible selective effect of harvest in birds and its evolutionary consequences deserves far more attention, and that hunting may be one major driver of bird evolutionary trajectories that should be carefully considered in wildlife management schemes.

AB  - Simple Summary Guinea pigs are reared not only to be kept as pets, but also for human consumption. This happens mostly in the Andean countries (Ecuador, Bolivia, and Peru), where guinea pig meat is one important source of animal protein. In this region, animal husbandry is performed usually by small farmers, who enter into frequent and close contact with guinea pigs. This poses a potential threat to human health because these (and other domestic) animals carry opportunistic human pathogens in their tissues and organs. Using traditional microbiological procedures and molecular biology techniques, we show here that the nasal mucosa of guinea pigs may contain up to 11 species of potentially pathogenic yeasts. Several of these yeasts are resistant to compounds used to treat fungal infections, which warns against their virulence potential if acquired by humans or other animals. We suggest that more attention should be given to this situation to prevent the risk of infectious diseases caused by microbes that are transmitted from animals to humans (=zoonoses). Guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus) have been reared for centuries in the Andean region for ceremonial purposes or as the main ingredient of traditional foods. The animals are kept in close proximity of households and interact closely with humans; this also occurs in western countries, where guinea pigs are considered pets. Even though it is acknowledged that domestic animals carry pathogenic yeasts in their tissues and organs that can cause human diseases, almost nothing is known in the case of guinea pigs. In this work we used traditional microbiological approaches and molecular biology techniques to isolate, identify, and characterize potentially zoonotic yeasts colonizing the nasal duct of guinea pigs raised as livestock in Southern Ecuador (Canar Province). Our results show that 44% of the 100 animals studied were colonized in their nasal mucosa by at least eleven yeast species, belonging to eight genera: Wickerhamomyces, Diutina, Meyerozyma, Candida, Pichia, Rhodotorula, Galactomyces, and Cryptococcus. Noticeably, several isolates were insensitive toward several antifungal drugs of therapeutic use, including fluconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole, and caspofungin. Together, our results emphasize the threat posed by these potentially zoonotic yeasts to the farmers, their families, the final consumers, and, in general, to public and animal health.

AB  - Concrete component shear strength is a complex phenomenon that depends on a number of governing bodies and regulatory mechanisms. Moreover, the addition of new concrete variations like fibered concrete and light-weight concrete increases the complexity of the topic. Consequently, in order to estimate the shear resistance (Vu) of normal-weight concrete (NWC) and light-weight concrete (LWC) components, three machine learning-based methods were developed. The work gives researchers significant tools to predict concrete structural integrity. This helps design safer, more efficient buildings by accounting for complicated material qualities and concrete variants like fibered or lightweight concrete in real-world construction settings. Extreme gradient boosting (XGB) was taken into consideration for this aim. The Chaos Game Optimization (CGO), Giant Trevally Optimizer (GTO), and Mountain Gazelle Optimizer (MGO) algorithms were used in order to identify the hyperparameters effectively (abbreviated as XGBMGO, XGBGTO, and XGBCGO). The collected big data was divided into three subsets: training (75%: 1194), validating (15%: 256), and testing (15 %: 256). The XGBGTO, XGBMGO and XGBCGO algorithms have a considerable capacity to precisely forecast the Vuof NWC and LWC. The R2 values for the XGBCGO net were determined to be 0.9959, 0.9957, and 0.9961, respectively, throughout the training, verification, and testing phases. The reasons put forward generally suggest that the XGBCGO analysis can achieve more than the XGBGTO, and XGBMGO frameworks.

AB  - Paratuberculosis (Johne's disease) is a contagious infectious disease, the etiological agent of which affects various species of mammals, mainly ruminants. The causative agent is the acid-resistant bacterium Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP), which belongs to the family Mycobacteriaceae. The most sensitive to it are domestic ruminants (cattle, sheep, goats etc.), which are the main reservoirs of infection for the various species of animals and humans (the zoonotic potential of the pathogen requires further study). In Ukraine, the main methods for diagnosing paratuberculosis are serological and bacteriological techniques. The authors analyzed the epizootic situation of paratuberculosis among cattle in Ukraine during 2019-2023 by systematizing the data of their own research and official reports of state veterinary laboratories in regions. The results of the investigation are presented without taking into account the temporarily occupied territories of Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts and the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, as well as part of the territory where military operations were conducted. In total, over the five-year period, 41 679 samples were examined serologically in the complement fixation test and 13 405 - bacteriologically, by microscopy and cultivation of biological materials on the nutrient media. During the investigation, specific antibodies to the pathogen were detected in 36 samples (prevalence, about 0.1%; BCI, 0.06-0.12%) from the ten regions. The analysis of the serological studies shows that the disease is sporadic and has a significant downward trend in the number of positive cases (17 positive samples were detected in 2019 and 2020, and only two in 2023). As for bacteriological examination, no positive cases have been registered during the 5-year period. In addition to the scrupulous work of the veterinary medicine service, both the persistent decrease in the cattle population and the ongoing hostilities in Ukraine have a considerable impact on improving the epizootic situation., as the number of serological tests conducted after 2022 has almost halved (especially in the eastern and southern regions), and bacteriological tests have decreased fivefold. The visualization of the data shows that antibodies were mostly detected in animals from the central, eastern, northern, and northwestern regions of the country.

AB  - Manure application performed in autumn requires regulation due to the risk of nitrogen (N) leaching during winter. On the other hand, application of manure in spring can pose some practical problems depending on the risk for N immobilization and the difficulty in ploughing heavy clay soils during this time of year. The risk for leaching is likely to differ between different soil texture and manure characteristics. In this study, we sought to estimate the risk for nitrogen leaching depending on the carbon/nitrogen ratio (C/N) of the manure, time for manure application, and soil type. We combined 3-year lysimeter experiments with 2-year field plot experiments and laboratory soil incubations and compared results with those from an empirical model. We compared effects of manure application on two soils (silty clay and loamy sand) and solid manures with different representing C/N ratios. In incubations, only manure with a C/N-ratio below 14 contributed with significant amounts of leachable N during the first months after application. In the lysimeter study, N leaching was unaffected by the timing of the application of the manure with C/N-ratio 18. However, regarding manure with C/N-ratio 10, N leaching was elevated with 10-15 kg N per ha after manure application in October compared to November and March on both soil types. The mineral N analyses from soil profiles in the field experiments showed a similar pattern, however, the increase was higher on the loamy sand compared to the silty clay. The ammonia emissions did not differ between manure types, but were on average 24% of applied NH4-N after application in October when air temperature was on average 12 degrees C compared to only 3% of applied NH4-N in November and March when air temperature was on average 5 degrees C. Similar to lysimeter results, the modelled N leaching was higher the earlier the manure application occurred in autumn. However, the model also predicted increased leaching for the manure with a high C/N-ratio, and a smaller effect on leaching on clay soil. Considering this, the model calculations overestimated the leaching effects from manure with a high C/N-ratio and underestimated the leaching effects on clay soil.

AB  - Body size is an important biological phenotypic trait that has attracted substantial attention. Small domestic pigs can serve as excellent animal models for biomedicine and also help meet sacrificial culture needs in human societies. Although the mechanisms underlying vertebral development regulating body size variation in domestic pigs during the embryonic period have been well described, few studies have examined the genetic basis of body size variation in post embryonic developmental stages. In this study, seven candidate genes-PLIN1, LIPE, PNPLA1, SCD, FABP5, KRT10 and IVL-significantly associated with body size were identified in Min pigs, on the basis of weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), and most of their functions were found to be associated with lipid deposition. Six candidate genes except for IVL were found to have been subjected to purifying selection. PLIN1 had the lowest omega value (0.139) and showed heterogeneous selective pressure among domestic pig lineages with different body sizes (p < 0.05). These results suggested that PLIN1 is an important genetic factor regulating lipid deposition and consequently affecting body size variation in pigs. The culture of whole pig sacrifice in Manchu during the Qing Dynasty in China might have contributed to the strong artificial domestication and selection of Hebao pigs.

AB  - Ngalau Gupin is a broad karstic cave system in the Padang Highlands of western Sumatra, Indonesia. Abundant fossils, consisting of mostly isolated teeth from small-to large-sized animals, were recovered from breccias cemented on the cave walls and unconsolidated sediments on the cave floor. Two loci on the walls and floors of Ngalau Gupin, named NG-A and NG-B respectively, are studied. We determine that NG-B most likely formed as a result of the erosion and redeposition of material from NG-A. The collection reveals a rich, diverse Pleistocene faunal assemblage (Proboscidea, Primates, Rodentia, Artiodactyla, Perissodactyla, Carnivora) largely analogous to extant fauna in the modern rainforests of Sumatra. The hippopotamid Hexaprotodon represents the only globally extinct taxon in deposits from Sumatra and the first record of this animal from the island. This fossil assemblage is dated using combined U-series/ESR dating analyses of several teeth that yield a finite age of between-160 and-115 ka, depending on the modalities of the dose rate evaluation. Moreover, a direct U-series age estimate of-70 ka is obtained on the Hexaprotodon specimen, providing a minimum age constraint for the fossil that is compatible with the combined U-series/ESR results. These results suggest that the faunal assemblage at Ngalau Gupin correlates with late MIS 6 or early MIS 5. Ngalau Gupin likely reflects the formation of a fossil assemblage with two primary taphonomic pathways: a prime-aged dominated macrofauna component initially produced by carnivores but subsequently accumulated by porcupines and transported to the cave, and a microfauna component likely accumulated by small carnivores. Decalcification of the cemented deposit has further resulted in loss of fossil and other sedimentary material. This site adds important new chronologically constrained fossil mammal data for the Pleistocene record of Sumatra, an island relatively poorly investigated for Southeast Asia.

AB  - This study aimed to determine the effects of Zn sources, used with potato fiber (PF) or lignocellulose (LC), on electrolyte concentration and the mucus layer in the large intestine of pigs. The experiment involved 24 barrows with an initial body weight of 10.8 +/- 0.82 kg, divided into four groups fed the following diets: LC and ZnSO4, LC and Zn glycinate (ZnGly), PF and ZnSO4, or PF and ZnGly. Fiber supplements provided 10 g crude fiber/kg diet, while Zn additives introduced 120 mg Zn/kg diet. After four weeks of feeding, the pigs were sacrificed and digesta and tissue samples were taken from the cecum and colon. PF increased the water content and decreased the phosphorus concentration in the large intestine in comparison with LC. PF also increased calcium, iron, and chloride concentrations in the descending colon. Mucus layer thickness and histological parameters of the large intestine were not affected. ZnGly diets increased MUC12 expression in the cecum as compared to the LC-ZnSO4 group. In the ascending colon, the PF-ZnGly diet increased MUC5AC expression, while both PF groups had greater MUC20 expression in comparison with the LC-ZnSO4 group. In the transverse colon, the LC-ZnGly group and both PF groups had higher MUC5AC expression in comparison with the LC-ZnSO4 group, and both ZnGly groups had higher MUC20 expression than ZnSO4 groups. PF and ZnGly increased MUC4 and MUC5AC expression in the descending colon. PF and ZnGly may exert a beneficial effect on colon health in pigs by upregulating the expression of the MUC5AC and MUC20 genes and are more effective than LC and ZnSO4.

AB  - Camellia sinensis var. Assamica cv. Duntsa (C.duntsa), a valuable Theaceae from Hunan Province, has been looked at as a precious tea resource by local farmers because of its economic and ecological value. Genomics study on C.duntsa is essential for the domestication and enhancement of tea tree varieties. In the present study, we used a hybrid approach based on Illumina and PacBio data to sequence and assemble the mitochondrial genome of C.duntsa. The mitochondrial genome of C.duntsa was estimated to be 1,081,996 base pairs (bp) and eighty-one genes consisting of one pseudogene, three ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes, thirty transfer RNA (tRNA) genes, and forty-seven protein-coding genes (PCGs). Tetramer repetitions made up 43.90% of simple sequence repeats (SSRs). The codon usage bias of the Theaceae mitochondrial gene atp9 was altered by mutation, but the codon usage of other genes was shaped by natural selection. Besides, there are eighteen gene-containing homologous regions between the chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes of C. duntsa.Some genomes including atp8, cox1, cox3, nad7, nad9, rpl16, rpl2, rps19, rps4, and sdh4 are absent in the mitochondrial genome of several Theaceae plant. However, C. duntsa maintains these genes integrity and functionality. Another gene, rps16, is either lacking from the mitochondrial genome of C. duntsa or is present as a pseudogene. C. duntsa and C. sinensis (OM809792) are very similar, as shown by a collinear match across four species of Theaceae; the most conservative genes are nad5, atp9, cox2, rps3, trnA-TGC, trnI-GAT, rrn18, trnV-GAC, and ccmFN. Similarly, the genome's phylogenetic trees revealed that C. duntsa was the sister species to C. sinensis. The results confirmed that the C. duntsa and C. sinensis (OM809792) mitochondrial genome underwent gene rearrangement.In general, our results shows that genomic information from organelles can help us understand plant phylogeny and can also be used to make molecular markers and study how genetic traits change over time. Our research will contribute to the population genetics and evolution of tea plant.

AB  - Goat production in the dry forest of northern Peru is essential for rural livelihoods but remains poorly characterized regarding its productivity and sustainability. This study used multivariate techniques-a multiple correspondence analysis (MCA), principal component analysis (PCA), factor analysis of mixed data (FAMD), and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA)-to analyze data from 284 producers in Tumbes, Piura, and Lambayeque. Surveys captured 48 variables (41 qualitative, seven quantitative) on productivity, socioeconomics, and management. The MCA explained 22.07% of the variability in two dimensions, while the PCA accounted for 63.9%, focusing on productivity and diversification. The FAMD integrated these variables, explaining 51.12% of variability across five dimensions, emphasizing socioeconomic and management differences. The HCA identified three clusters: cluster 1 featured intensive systems with advanced management and commercial focus, cluster 2 included extensive systems limited by water scarcity, and cluster 3 reflected semi-intensive systems with irrigation and diversified production. These findings provide a detailed understanding of goat systems in northern Peru, identifying opportunities to improve resource use and tailor strategies to enhance sustainability. The multivariate analysis proved effective in capturing the complexity of these systems, supporting productivity and improving livelihoods in rural areas.

AB  - Sheep have historically been bred globally as a vital food source. To explore the transcriptome of adipose tissue and investigate key genes regulating adipose metabolism in sheep, adipose tissue samples were obtained from F1 Dorper x Hu sheep. High-throughput sequencing libraries for second- and third-generation sequencing were constructed using extracted total RNA. Functional annotation of differentially expressed genes and isoforms facilitated the identification of key regulatory genes and isoforms associated with sheep fat metabolism. SMRT-seq generated 919,259 high-accuracy cDNA sequences after filtering. Full-length sequences were corrected using RNA-seq sequences, and 699,680 high-quality full-length non-chimeric (FLNC) reads were obtained. Upon evaluating the ratio of total lengths based on FLNC sequencing, it was determined that 36,909 out of 56,316 multiple-exon isoforms met the criteria for full-length status. This indicates the identification of 330,375 full-length FLNC transcripts among the 370,114 multiple-exon FLNC transcripts. By comparing the reference genomes, 60,276 loci and 111,302 isoforms were identified. In addition, 43,423 new genes and 44,563 new isoforms were identified. The results identified 185 (3198), 394 (3592), and 83 (3286) differentially expressed genes (transcripts) between tail and subcutaneous, tail and visceral, and subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissues, respectively. Functional annotation and pathway analysis revealed the following observations. (1) Among the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of TF and SF tissues, the downregulation of ACADL, ACSL6, and NC_056060.1.2536 was observed in SF, while FFAR4 exhibited upregulation. (2) Among the DEGs of TF and VF tissues, expressions of ACADL, ACSL6, COL1A1, COL1A2, and SCD were downregulated in VF, with upregulation of FFAR4. (3) Among SF and VF expressions of COL1A1, COL1A2, and NC_056060.1.2536 were downregulated in VF. Specific differentially expressed genes (ACADL, ACSL6, COL1A1, COL1A2, FFAR4, NC_056060.1.2536, and SCD) and transcripts (NC_056066.1.1866.16 and NC_056066.1.1866.22) were identified as relevant to fat metabolism. These results provide a dataset for further verification of the regulatory pathway associated with fat metabolism in sheep.

AB  - Floral secretory structures have been reported for Gentianaceae; however, morphoanatomical studies of these glands are rare. We described the development and secretory activity of the colleters and nectaries throughout the floral development of Chelonanthus viridiflorus. We collected flower buds, flowers at anthesis, and fruits to be investigated using light and scanning electron microscopy. We performed histochemical tests on the secretion of colleters and used glycophyte to confirm the presence of glucose in nectar. Colleters are located on the ventral surface of sepals and nectaries occur in four regions: (i) the dorsal and (ii) ventral surfaces of sepals; (iii) apex of petals; and (iv) base of ovary. The colleters have a short peduncle and a secretory portion with homogeneous cells. They are active in flower buds and secrete polysaccharides and proteins. In flowers at anthesis, they begin to senescence presenting protoplast retraction, cell collapse, and lignification; these characteristics are intensified in fruit. The nectaries of sepals and petals have two to five cells surrounding a central cell through which the secretion is released. Nectaries are numerous, forming a nectariferous area on the dorsal surface of sepals, like that observed on petals, and can form isolated units on the ventral surface of sepals. They are active from flower buds to fruits. A region with secretory activity was identified at the base of the ovary. The secretion of colleters acts in the protection of developing organs, while nectaries are related to defenses against herbivores and the supply of nectar to potential robbers or pollinators.

KW  - HIGH-CONCENTRATE DIET
AB  - Long-term consumption of high-concentrate diets leads to subacute ruminalacidosis (SARA). Butyric acid is a small molecule that can inhibit the growth of harmful bacteriathrough cell membranes. As a type of organic acid, butyric acid functions to regulate body materialmetabolism and improve body immunity. Our findings suggest that a high-concentrate diet withsodium butyrate (SB) improves the SARA status of lactating goats. In addition, metabolomics studiesrevealed that an SB diet can activate the liver pentose phosphate and lipid anabolism pathway,causing changes in fatty acid distribution and redistribution in the liver. Subsequently, more milk fatprecursors (fatty acids) enter the mammary gland through the milk artery to synthesise milk fat. This study aimed to explore the effects of sodium butyrate on liver metabolism in goats subjected to a high-concentrate diet. We randomly assigned twelve Saanen-lactating goats into two groups, one of which received a high-concentrate diet (concentrate: forage = 60:40, control group), while the other received the same basal diet supplemented with sodium butyrate (SB) (10 g/kg basal diet, SB group). Compared with the control diet, the SB diet considerably increased the milk fat percentage and content (p < 0.05), with an increase of 0.67% in the milk fat content of the SB group. By employing a global metabolomics approach based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS), we identified 6748 ions in ESI+ mode and 3573 ions in ESI- mode after liver isolation from both groups. A total of twenty-three metabolites, including phospholipids, fatty acids, and ribose phosphate, were found to be dysregulated according to a search against the human metabolome database (HMDB). Pathway analysis revealed activation of the pentose phosphate pathway, glycerophospholipid metabolism, and unsaturated fatty acid synthesis. The SB diet also modulated the expression of key lipogenic enzymes, such as acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD-1), which are downstream targets of the transcription factor sterol regulatory element-binding proteins-1c (SREBP-1c), inducing a significant upregulation (p < 0.05). Furthermore, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGDH) levels in the liver were elevated after the lactating goats were fed the SB diet (p < 0.05). Our study reveals that the SB diet may offer substantial benefits in enhancing the milk quality of subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA) goats. This is accomplished by augmenting the activity of the liver pentose phosphate pathway and the process of de novo fatty acid synthesis in lactating goats.

AB  - Remembering an experience entails linking what happened, where the event transpired, and when it occurred. Most rodent hippocampal studies involve tests of spatial memory, but fewer investigate temporal and sequential order memory. Here we provide a demonstration of rats learning an aversive sequential order task using a radial arm water maze. Male rats learned a fixed sequence of up to seven spatial locations, with each decision session separated by a temporal delay. Rats relied on visuospatial cues and the number of times they had entered the maze for a given day in order to successfully perform the task. Behavioral patterns during asymptotic perfor-mance showed similarities to the serial-position effect, especially with regards to faster first choice latency. Rats at asymptotic performance were implanted with bilateral cannula in medial prefrontal cortex, dorsal, and ventral hippocampus. After re-training, we injected muscimol to temporarily disrupt targeted brain regions. While control rats made prospective errors, rats with mPFC muscimol exhibited more retrospective errors. Rats with hippocampal muscimol no longer exhibited a prospective bias and were at chance levels in their error choices. Taken together, our results suggest disruption of mPFC, but not the hippocampus, produced an error choice bias during an aversive sequential order spatial processing task.

AB  - Heparin is a glycosaminoglycan polymer that is commonly used as an anticoagulant. Heparin also induces in vitro capacitation in spermatozoa, although its molecular mechanism is elusive. This study investigated the effect of heparin on in vitro capacitation and spermatozoal RNA (spRNA) population in goats. Goat spermatozoa were treated with 20 mu M heparin for 0-6 h and evaluated for motility, capacitation, acrosome reaction, and spRNA population by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). It was observed that heparin enhanced sperm motility up to 6 h of incubation (p < 0.05). Heparin also induced capacitation and acrosome reaction within 4 h. RNA-seq identified 1254 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between heparin-treated and control spermatozoa. Most DEGs (1251 nos.) were upregulated and included 1090 protein-coding genes. A few genes (PRND, ITPR1, LLCFC1, and CHRM2) showed >5-fold increased expression in heparin-treated spermatozoa compared to the control. The upregulated genes were found to be involved in cAMP-PKA, PI3-Akt, calcium, MAPK signaling, and oxidative stress pathways. DCFDA staining confirmed the increased oxidative stress in heparin-treated spermatozoa compared to the control (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest that heparin enhances sperm motility and induces capacitation by upregulation of the spRNA population and oxidative stress pathway.

AB  - Necrophobia is a widespread phenomenon in animals. Contact with a dead body may involve a potentially fatal threat, as corpses are often sources of infections. Ants recognize corpses based on specific chemical cues and dispose of them by taking them out from their activity zone, frequently piling them up in so-called `cemeteries: Necrophoresis (active disposal of corpses by physical removal), besides reducing the risk of infection for the particular species performing it, can also elicit necrophobia in other species living nearby. Some field observations suggest that in certain ant species corpses can be used to limit the activity of neighbouring colonies of competing species. In our study, we experimentally tested the effects of carcasses of dominant territorial Formica polyctena on the activity of F. cinerea ant under field conditions. We used F. polyctena workers freshly killed at low temperature with a preserved cuticular hydrocarbon profile and, for comparison, corpses stripped of their natural chemical label (washed in n-hexane). Our results confirmed the inhibitory effect of corpses, as the activity of workers correlated negatively with the number of corpses. On average the washed corpses reduced the ant activity by 9%, whereas the corpses with the preserved CHCs signature by 30%. Moreover, in some cases, the presence of washed corpses even increased the activity that did not happen in the other corpse type. Therefore, ant carcasses could be used as signals in interspemon is their use should be the subject of further studies.

AB  - There has been increasing concern that the overuse of antibiotics in livestock farming is contributing to the burden of antimicrobial resistance in people. Farmed animals in Europe and North America, particularly pigs, provide a reservoir for livestock-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (LA-MRSA ST398 lineage) found in people. This study is designed to investigate the contribution of MRSA from Chinese pig farms to human infection. A collection of 483 MRSA are isolated from 55 farms and 4 hospitals in central China, a high pig farming density area. CC9 MRSA accounts for 97.2% of all farm isolates, but is not present in hospital isolates. ST398 isolates are found on farms and hospitals, but none of them formed part of the "LA-MRSA ST398 lineage" present in Europe and North America. The hospital ST398 MRSA isolate form a clade that is clearly separate from the farm ST398 isolates. Despite the presence of high levels of MRSA found on Chinese pig farms, the authors find no evidence of them spilling over to the human population. Nevertheless, the ST398 MRSA obtained from hospitals appear to be part of a widely distributed lineage in China. The new animal-adapted ST398 lineage that has emerged in China is of concern.

AB  - The aim of this study was to identify effective genetic markers for the Antigen Processing Associated Transporter 1 (TAP1), alpha (1,2) Fucosyltransferase 1 (FUT1), Natural Resistance Associated Macrophage Protein 1 (NRAMP1), Mucin 4 (MUC4) and Mucin 13 (MUC13) diarrhea-resistance genes in the local pig breeds, namely Shanghai white pigs, Fengjing pigs, Shawutou pigs, Meishan pigs and Pudong white pigs, to provide a reference for the characterization of local pig breed resources in Shanghai. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLR) and sequence sequencing were applied to analyze the polymorphisms of the above genes and to explore the effects on the immunity of Shanghai local pig breeds in conjunction with some immunity factors. The results showed that both TAP1 and MUC4 genes had antidiarrheal genotype GG in the five pig breeds, AG and GG genotypes of the FUT1 gene were detected in Pudong white pigs, AA antidiarrheal genes of the NRAMP1 gene were detected in Meishan pigs, the AB type of the NRAMP1 gene was detected in Pudong white pigs, and antidiarrheal genotype GG of the MUC13 gene was only detected in Shanghai white pigs. The MUC13 antidiarrhea genotype GG was only detected in Shanghai white pigs. The TAP1 gene was moderately polymorphic in Shanghai white pigs, Fengjing pigs, Shawutou pigs, Meishan pigs and Pudong white pigs, among which TAP1 in Shanghai white pigs and Shawutou pigs did not satisfy the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The FUT1 gene of Pudong white pigs was in a state of low polymorphism. NRAMP1 of Meishan pigs and Pudong white pigs was in a state of moderate polymorphism, which did not satisfy the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The MUC4 genes of Shanghai white pigs and Pudong white pigs were in a state of low polymorphism, and the MUC4 genes of Fengjing pigs and Shawutou pigs were in a state of moderate polymorphism, and the MUC4 genes of Fengjing pigs and Pudong white pigs did not satisfy the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The MUC13 gene of Shanghai white pigs and Pudong white pigs was in a state of moderate polymorphism. Meishan pigs had higher levels of IL-2, IL-10, IgG and TNF-alpha, and Pudong white pigs had higher levels of IL-12 than the other pigs. The level of interleukin 12 (IL-12) was significantly higher in the AA genotype of the MUC13 gene of Shanghai white pigs than in the AG genotype. The indicator of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in the AA genotype of the TAP1 gene of Fengjing pigs was significantly higher than that of the GG and AG genotypes. The indicator of IL-12 in the AG genotype of the Shawutou pig TAP1 gene was significantly higher than that of the GG genotype. The level of TNF-alpha in the AA genotype of the NRAMP1 gene of Meishan pigs was markedly higher than that of the AB genotype. The IL-2 level of the AG type of the FUT1 gene was obviously higher than that of the GG type of Pudong white pigs, the IL-2 level of the AA type of the MUC4 gene was dramatically higher than that of the AG type, and the IgG level of the GG type of the MUC13 gene was apparently higher than that of the AG type. The results of this study are of great significance in guiding the antidiarrhea breeding and molecular selection of Shanghai white pigs, Fengjing pigs, Shawutou pigs, Meishan pigs and Pudong white pigs and laying the foundation for future antidiarrhea breeding of various local pig breeds in Shanghai.

AB  - Phencynonate hydrochloride (PCH) is a drug that crosses the blood-brain barrier. Cellular experiments confirmed that PCH protects against glutamate toxicity and causes only weak central inhibition and limited side effects. As shown in our previous studies, PCH alleviates depression-like behaviours induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). Here we administered PCH at three different doses (4, 8 and 16 mg/kg) to male rats for two continuous days after CUMS and conducted behavioural tests to assess the dose-dependent antidepressant effects of PCH and its effects on the neuroplasticity in the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Meanwhile, we measured the spine density and expression of related proteins to illustrate the mechanism of PCH. PCH treatment (8 mg/kg) significantly alleviated depression-like behaviours induced by CUMS. All doses of PCH treatment reversed the spine loss in prelimbic and CA3 regions induced by CUMS. Kalirin-7 expression was decreased in the hippocampus and mPFC of the CUMS group. The expression of the NR1 and NR2B subunits in the hippocampus, and NR2B in mPFC are increased by CUMS. PCH treatment (8 and 16 mg/kg) reversed all of these changes of Kalirin-7 in PFC and hippocampus, as well as NR1 and NR2B expression in the hippocampus. PCH is expected to be developed as a new type of rapid antidepressant. Its antidepressant effect may be closely related to the modulation of dendritic spine density in the prelimbic and CA3 regions and the regulation of Kalilin-7 and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor levels in the hippocampus.

AB  - Human hair is increasingly employed as a non-invasive biomonitoring matrix for exposure to organic contaminants (OCs). Decontamination procedures are generally needed to remove external contamination from hair prior to analysis of OCs. Despite various existing decontamination protocols, their impacts on internally incorporated (endogenous) OCs in hair remain poorly understood. This study aims to quantitatively assess the impact of decontamination procedures on endogenous OCs in hair, and investigate optimal decontamination processes and factors influencing the removal of endogenous OCs. In this study, guinea pig was exposed to 6 OCs (triphenyl phosphate (TPHP), tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCPP), and tri-n-butyl phosphate (TNBP), bisphenol A (BPA), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and phenanthrene (PHE)), and 6 decontamination procedures with different solvents (methanol, n-hexane, acetone, ultrapure water, Triton X-100, and sodium dodecyl sulfate) were used to rinse exposed guinea pig hair. All OCs and three metabolites (diphenyl phosphate (DPHP), dibutyl phosphate (DBP), and bis(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (BDCPP)) were detected in the majority of washing solutions. The decontamination procedures apparently resulted in the release of endogenous OCs from hair. The percentages of residual OCs in hair exhibited a linear or exponential decrease with more washing cycles. Furthermore, the residuals of OCs in hair washed with organic and aqueous solvents showed negative correlations with molecular weight, polarizability, and their initial concentrations. Although these findings need to be validated with a broader range of OCs, the results obtained in this study provide compelling evidence that current hair decontamination procedures have significant impacts on the analysis of endogenous OCs in hair. Therefore, it is important to interpret quantitative data on hair OC concentrations with caution and to thoroughly consider each decontamination procedure during analysis.

AB  - Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are closed-loop RNAs forming a covalent bond between their 3 ' and 5 ' ends, the back splice junction (BSJ), rendering them resistant to exonucleases and thus more stable compared to linear RNAs. Identification of circRNAs and distinction from their cognate linear RNA is only possible by sequencing the BSJ that is unique to the circRNA. CircRNAs are involved in the regulation of their cognate RNAs by increasing transcription rates, RNA stability, and alternative splicing. We have identified circRNAs from C. sativa that are associated with the regulation of germination, light response, and lipid metabolism. We sequenced light-grown and etiolated seedlings after 5 or 7 days post-germination and identified a total of 3447 circRNAs from 2763 genes. Most circRNAs originate from a single homeolog of the three subgenomes from allohexaploid camelina and correlate with higher ratios of alternative splicing of their cognate genes. A network analysis shows the interactions of select miRNA:circRNA:mRNAs for regulation of transcript stabilities where circRNA can act as a competing endogenous RNA. Several key lipid metabolism genes can generate circRNA, and we confirmed the presence of KASII circRNA as a true circRNA. CircRNA in camelina can be a novel target for breeding and engineering efforts.

AB  - Hulun Buir Grassland is a world-famous natural pasture. The Chenbalhu Banner coalfield, the hinterland of the grassland, is located on the west slope of the Great Khingan Mountains and on the north bank of the Hailar River in China. The proven geological reserves of coal are 17 billion tons. Hulun Buir Grassland plays a role in the ecological barrier, regional coal industry, power transmission from west to east and power transmission from north to south. The proportion of local groundwater in irrigation, domestic and industrial production water sources is about 86%. The large-scale exploitation of coal resources and the continuous emergence of large unit and coal-fired power plants have consumed a large amount of local water resources, resulting in the decrease of the local groundwater level and changing the natural flow field of groundwater. This paper studies the background hydrochemical values and evaluates the irrigatibility of the whole Chenbaerhu Banner coalfield, and studies the impact of coal industry chains such as mining areas and coal chemical plants on the hydrochemistry characteristics of groundwater. The above two studies provide important guiding values for guiding local economic structure planning, groundwater resources exploitation and ecological governance. The study found that Na+ and HCO3- in the groundwater in the study area occupy a dominant position. Referring to the comparison of the lowest values of three types of water standards in the Quality Standards for Groundwater (GB/T14848-2017), the amount of NH4+, Na+ and NO2- exceeding the standard is close to more than 30%. The main chemical types of river water in the study area are HCO3- Na and HCO3- Ca center dot Na, the main chemical types of surface water are HCO3- Na and HCO3- Na center dot Ca, and the main chemical type of confined water is HCO3-Na. The formation of hydrochemical types is mainly affected by the dissolution, filtration and evaporation of rocks, specifically the dissolution and filtration of sodium and calcium salts. The chemical correlation analysis of groundwater shows that there are abnormal values at many points in the study area. Further combining with the horizontal comparison of surface human activities in the study area, it shows that the influence scope of coal mine production and coal chemical plants on groundwater is extremely limited. The local groundwater is mainly polluted by a large quantity of local cattle and sheep manure, industrial and domestic sewage pollution and farmland fertilizer.

AB  - BACKGROUNDPlants emit volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which serve as critical cues for herbivorous insects to locate hosts for feeding and oviposition. Understanding how adults identify host plants is essential to develop pest management strategies, particularly for hemiedaphic insects like click beetles, the larvae of which are significant soil-dwelling pests. To investigate click beetle attraction towards plant VOCs and their relevance for oviposition, we tested the attractiveness of constitutive VOCs (emitted by intact plants) and damage-induced VOCs (released by chopped plants) from 11 plant species to male and female Agriotes sputator beetles.RESULTSAgriotes sputator beetles exhibit plant species-specific olfactory preferences, which are influenced by beetle sex and female maturity and differ between constitutive and damage-induced VOCs. Female beetles showed the greatest attraction to buckwheat VOCs, especially during their main oviposition period, whereas males were more attracted to clover and ryegrass. EAG recordings show strong female antennal responses to ryegrass, carrot, maize, wild carrot, barley, and buckwheat VOCs, while male antennae responded significantly only to peas. Antennae from female beetles show overall stronger responses to constitutive VOCs than those of males (P = 0.02).CONCLUSIONThese findings facilitate the development of new approaches for Agriotes pest management. Understanding preferred plant VOCs aids in identifying attractive semiochemicals that can be used for monitoring female beetles. Additionally, recognizing attractive plants aids wireworm management by either avoiding them in crop rotations before sensitive crops (thus reducing oviposition) or by attracting beetles to specific areas where they can be targeted by control measures.

AB  - This study was conducted in the Gurupi Biological Reserve (REBIO-Gurupi), the largest area of Amazon rainforest in Maranh & atilde;o State, Brazil. The objectives were to survey the sand fly (Diptera: Psychodidae) fauna of REBIO-Gurupi, identify blood meal sources, and investigate the presence of Leishmania (Ross, 1903) (Kinetoplastida: Trypanosomatidae) DNA. Individuals were collected using Centers for Disease Control (CDC) light traps and black and white Shannon traps in May and Jun 2022 and Jan 2023. DNA was extracted from female sand flies and subjected to amplification and sequencing of cytochrome b molecular marker (CYTB) for identification of blood meal sources and the first internal transcribed spacer (ITS-1) of ribosomal DNA for Leishmania detection. A total of 514 sand flies individuals were sampled, of which 93 were identified at the genus or series level (9 taxa) and 421 were identified at the species level (24 taxa). Psychodopygus davisi (Root, 1934) (41.1%), Nyssomyia antunesi (Coutinho, 1939) (10.3%), and Psychodopygus (Mangabeira, 1941) Chagasi Series Barretto, 1962 (9.7%) were the most frequently collected. Human (Homo sapiens, Primates, Hominidae) and tapir (Tapirus terrestris, Perissodactyla, Tapiridae) DNA was detected in 10 female sand flies. Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum Cunha and Chagas, 1937 DNA was detected in 2 specimens of Ps. davisi. Given the presence of vectors of Leishmania in REBIO-Gurupi, it is imperative to conduct more comprehensive studies on the interactions among sand flies, Leishmania, and pathogen reservoirs in the area.

AB  - Camellia sinensis and C. japonica plant leaves with spots were collected in Zhejiang Province, China. Three representative isolates resembling Nigrospora were selected for identification and pathogenicity test. Based on morphological characteristics and phylogenetic analyses of the partial regions of internal transcribed spacer (ITS), beta-tubulin (TUB2), and translation elongation factor 1-alpha (TEF) sequences, the isolates from C. japonica were identified as Nigrospora. oryzae and N. philosophiae-doctoris, while the one from C. sinensis as N. camelliae-sinensis. Inoculation of the isolates on healthy leaves showed symptoms similar to those observed in the field, and the fungi were reisolated from the lesions. To our knowledge, this represents the first report of leaf spot disease caused by Nigrospora species on C. japonica worldwide. The result further confirms that species residing the genus of Nigrospora act as causal agents of plant leaf spot disease, and their potential impact deserves further investigation.

AB  - The Cambrian explosion represents the rapid emergence of complex marine ecosystems on Earth. The propagation of predator-prey interactions within these systems was almost certainly one of the major drivers of this evolutionary event, sparking an arms race that promoted the proliferation of biomineralised exoskeletons and shells, and the evolution of the first durophagous (shell-crushing) predators. The most commonly documented evidence of Cambrian durophagous predation comes from injured trilobites. However, quantitative analysis based on multiple specimens from single localities is lacking. Such studies are required to reveal the dynamics of ancient predator-prey systems at fine ecological scales (e.g. at the population or community level). This study documents injured specimens of two trilobite species, Redlichia takooensis and Redlichia rex, from the Emu Bay Shale Konservat-Lagersta center dot tte (Cambrian Series 2, Stage 4) on Kangaroo Island, South Australia. A total of 38 injured specimens exhibiting various healed cephalic and thoracic injuries are documented, in addition to the mangled remains of two individuals that probably resulted from the activities of a durophagous predator or scavenger. Specimens of both species show that most injuries are located on the posterior portion of the thorax, indicating that predators preferentially attacked from behind and/or prey individuals presented the posterior of the trunk towards the predator when threatened or fleeing. The larger sample of injured R. takooensis shows that while unilateral injuries are more common than bilateral ones, there is no evidence for a left-or right-side bias, contrasting with previous suggestions that Cambrian trilobites exhibit right-sided injury stereotypy. Comparing the position of injured and non-injured R. takooensis and R. rex in bivariate space, we illustrate that injured specimens of both species typically represent some of the largest individuals of these taxa. This suggests that smaller individuals were completely consumed during an attack and/or larger individuals were more likely to survive an attack and thus record a healed injury. We argue that R. rex, rather than radiodonts, was likely the chief producer of exoskeletal injuries and large shelly coprolites in the Emu Bay Shale biota, and represents one of the earliest cannibalistic trilobites.

AB  - In mammals, the dominant theory postulates a causal link between three sexual characters: first, sexual selection promoted the evolution of polygyny; then sexual size dimorphism (SSD) evolved due to male competition for mates in a polygynous context, finally sexual segregation occurred as a consequence of the different requirements generated by size difference between sexes. I reviewed the literature on artiodactyls to test an alternative hypothesis that SSD evolved by natural selection as a result of niche separation between sexes, which implies the reversal of the causal evolutionary relationships. I used phylogenetic confirmatory path analysis to test models that differ in the evolutionary links between characters and in the selection process (ecological pressures or competition for mates) involved. Path analysis indicated that the trigger for the evolutionary pathway toward polygyny was a shift from close to open habitats, which in turn caused an increase in body size, an increase in gregariousness, and dietary specialization. The subsequent transition was to a polygynous mating system, after which sexual segregation evolved, and SSD evolved mostly after niche separation between males and females. This alternative causal link 'polygyny -> sexual segregation -> SSD' can help to understand diverse phenomena, such as the ecological drivers of sexual segregation, the existence of many artiodactyl families that are monomorphic and polygynous and the correlated evolution of oral morphology.

AB  - Simple Summary The use of fats derived from palm is becoming very common in dairy sheep farms to increase the energy concentration of the diet and therefore the milk production. However, these fats may negatively affect the nutritional quality of milk, whereas feeding unsaturated oils may improve milk fatty acid profile. In this regard, our results in dairy sheep suggested that using palm fat had no evident disadvantage in terms of milk fatty acid composition compared with a diet without supplementation. Nevertheless, it had no positive effects on production or indicators of feed efficiency (for example, milk yield per unit of feed consumed). By contrast, supplementation with oils rich in unsaturated fatty acids (specifically olive oil and soybean oil) improved milk fatty acid profile, with stronger effects with the use of the most unsaturated fat: soybean oil. For example, the latter oil induced the greatest increases in fatty acids with potentially positive effects on human health (e.g., conjugated linoleic acid). In addition, from a practical point of view, the use of soybean oil might also be recommendable to improve the amount of milk produced per unit of feed consumed, compared with the use of palm fat. Lipids of different unsaturation degree were added to dairy ewe diet to test the hypothesis that unsaturated oils would modulate milk fatty acid (FA) profile without impairing or even improving feed efficiency. To this aim, we examined milk FA profile and efficiency metrics (feed conversion ratio (FCR), energy conversion ratio (ECR), residual feed intake (RFI), and residual energy intake (REI)) in 40 lactating ewes fed a diet with no lipid supplementation (Control) or supplemented with 3 fats rich in saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated FA (i.e., purified palmitic acid (PA), olive oil (OO), and soybean oil (SBO)). Compared with PA, addition of OO decreased milk medium-chain saturated FA and improved the concentration of potentially health-promoting FA, such as cis-9 18:1, trans-11 18:1, cis-9 trans-11 CLA, and 4:0, with no impact on feed efficiency metrics. Nevertheless, FA analysis and decreases in FCR and ECR suggested that SBO supplementation would be a better nutritional strategy to further improve milk FA profile and feed efficiency in dairy ewes. The paradox of differences observed depending on the metric used to estimate feed efficiency (i.e., the lack of variation in RFI and REI vs. changes in FCR and ECR) does not allow solid conclusions to be drawn in this regard.

AB  - Plants in the genus Erysimum produce both glucosinolates and cardenolides as a defense mechanism against herbivory. Two natural isolates of Erysimum cheiranthoides (wormseed wallflower) differed in their glucosinolate content, cardenolide content, and their resistance to Myzus persicae (green peach aphid), a broad generalist herbivore. Both classes of defensive metabolites were produced constitutively and were not further induced by aphid feeding. To investigate the relative importance of glucosinolates and cardenolides in E. cheiranthoides defense, we generated an improved genome assembly, genetic map, and segregating F2 population. The genotypic and phenotypic analysis of the F2 plants identified quantitative trait loci, which affected glucosinolates and cardenolides, but not the aphid resistance. The abundance of most glucosinolates and cardenolides was positively correlated in the F2 population, indicating that similar processes regulate their biosynthesis and accumulation. Aphid reproduction was positively correlated with glucosinolate content. Although the overall cardenolide content had little effect on aphid growth and survival, there was a negative correlation between aphid reproduction and helveticoside abundance. However, this variation in defensive metabolites could not explain the differences in aphid growth on the two parental lines, suggesting that processes other than the abundance of glucosinolates and cardenolides have a predominant effect on aphid resistance in E. cheiranthoides.

AB  - Simple Summary Fasciola hepatica is a parasite that affects ruminants. This study evaluated the occurrence of fasciolosis in ovine livestock from central Portugal during a 2-year period. Positive animals were found in most locations and in both years (19.6% and 18.5% seropositive in the first year and second year, respectively). Correct anthelmintic treatment could further reduce egg elimination and pasture contamination. Fasciola hepatica is a parasite that is widespread in Europe, having been reported in ruminants of several European countries and causing an important economic impact. This study ascertained the occurrence and distribution of fasciolosis in Portuguese ovine livestock by assessing F. hepatica IgG antibodies in a cohort of confined sheep from a high-altitude region of central Portugal in a 2-year period. Positive animals were found in most locations and in both years, with 18 of the 92 animals (19.6% [95% confidence interval CI: 12.03-19.15]) and 17 of the same 92 animals (18.5% [95% CI: 11.15-27.93]) showing to be seropositive in the first year and second year, respectively (p = 0.85). Pasture contamination by F. hepatica eggs could be reduced by thorough anthelmintic treatments.

AB  - Host specificity determination of weed biocontrol agents has historically relied on evidence generated through quarantine trials in the region of introduction. These trials could give 'false positive' results due to a maximum type I error probability, and where possible, more research under field conditions should be conducted in the region of origin. The oligophagous, semiaquatic grasshopper, Cornops aquaticum Bruner (Orthoptera: Acrididae, Tetrataeniini), was released in South Africa for the biological control of Pontederia crassipes Pellegrini and Horn (Pontederiaceae). The aim of this study was to assess how the performance and field host range of C. aquaticum varies according to its stages of development, and how this contributes to the understanding of the relationship between the fundamental (laboratory-based) and the ecological (field-based) host range of this grasshopper, and its implications for water hyacinth biocontrol. We conducted post-release laboratory no-choice trials, confining early instars (instars 1 and 2), later instars (instars 3-6), and adult females and males in mesh cages, to determine insect performance on wetland plants growing in sympatry with P. crassipes. Also, gut analysis from field-collected C. aquaticum was done to determine the ecological host range of this insect, identifying epidermal tissue of consumed plants. In no-choice trials, survival rates of the later instars and adult C. aquaticum were similar on Pistia stratiotes L. (Araceae), Oxycaryum cubense (Poepp. & Kunth) Lye (Cyperaceae), and P. crassipes. However, under field conditions, P. crassipes and the congeneric Pontederia azurea Sw. were the only plant contents in the guts of early instars and the most abundant species in later instars and adults. The results support the hypothesis that C. aquaticum is an oligophagous insect on the genus Pontederia, and that different life stages should be considered when conducting host-specificity trials in externally feeding mobile herbivore species. Diet composition of field-collected insects thus could help detect false positives in laboratory trials, being an additional and realistic approach in understanding and predicting the selection processes of the insect in the new environment. Retrospective analysis of potential agents that were rejected due to lack of host-specificity, using the methods from this study, could add a suite of additional agents to programs where invasive weeds remain unmanaged.

AB  - Background: Articular cartilage has limited self-repair capacity, and current clinical treatment options for cartilage defects are inadequate. However, deer antler cartilage possesses unique regenerative properties, with the ability to rapidly repair itself. This rapid self-repair process is closely linked to the paracrine factors released by deer antler stem cells. These findings present potential for the development of cell-free therapies for cartilage defects in clinical settings. The aim of this study was to investigate a novel method for repairing cartilage. Methods: A rat model with articular cartilage defects was established through surgery. Hydrogels loaded with exosomes (Exos) derived from antler stem cells (ASC-Exos) were implanted into the rat cartilage defects. The extent of cartilage damage repair was assessed using histological methods. The effects of ASC-Exos on chondrocytes and rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) were evaluated using cell viability assays, proliferation assays, and scratch assays. Additionally, the maintenance of the chondrocyte phenotype by ASC-Exos was assessed using real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (qPCR) and western blot analysis. The protein components contained of the Exos were identified using data-independent acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry. Results: ASC-Exos significantly promoted the repair of cartilage tissue damage. The level of cartilage repair in the experimental group (ASC-Exos) was higher than that in the positive control (human adipose-derived stem cells, hADSC-Exos) and negative control (dulbecco's modified eagle medium) groups (p < 0.05). In vitro experiments demonstrated that ASC-Exos significantly enhanced the proliferation abilities of chondrocytes and the proliferation abilities and the migration abilities of BMSCs (p < 0.05). ASC-Exos up-regulated the expression levels of Aggrecan, Collagen II (COLII), and Sox9 mRNA and proteins in chondrocytes. Analysis of ASC-Exos protein components revealed the presence of active components such as Serotransferrin (TF), S100A4, and Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1 (IGF1). Conclusions: ASC-Exos have a significant effect on cartilage damage repair, which may be attributed to their promotion of chondrocyte and BMSCs proliferation and migration, as well as the maintenance of chondrocyte phenotype. This effect may be mediated by the presence of TF, S100A4, and IGF1.

AB  - Zagros Mountains in the southwest Iran was created by the closure of the Neo-Tethys and collision of Arabian and Eurasian plates. The Fars Group (Miocene to Pliocene) formed during this collision. The Agha Jari Formation (upper Miocene- lower Pliocene) is uppermost rock unit of the Fars Group, which has high potential for terrestrial vertebrate ichnology. This formation mostly deposited in the continental environment and a section of the formation studied in the east Gotvand, north Khuzestan province, southwest Iran. Agha Jari Formation, includes alternations of sandstone, siltstone, and marl in red to brown colour layers in the studied section. Numerous vertebrate footprints have been reported from the middle part of the formation in Gotvand section, among which artiodactyl footprints are abundant and diverse. Re-examination of artiodactyl footprints led to the discovery of a new ichnogenus and ichnospecies, Pazhanipeda kiyani, characterised by small-sized didactyl hooves, asymmetric and gracile imprints, and a wide interdigital angle. Based on the comparison of size, morphology and asymmetry of digit imprints with artiodactyl hooves, goats were considered as track makers of Pazhanipeda kiyani.

AB  - Detection/non-detection data are increasingly collected in continuous time, e.g., via camera traps or acoustic sensors. Application of occupancy modeling approaches to these datasets typically requires discretizing the dataset to detections over individual days or weeks, which precludes analysis of temporal interactions between species or covariate relationships that change over fine temporal scales. To address this limitation, we developed a two-species occupancy model that assumes a temporal point process detection model. This model permits simultaneous analysis of species interactions in space (i.e., site occupancy) and time (i.e., activity patterns). The model is also capable of estimating the amount of time animals are available for detection, i.e., availability. We applied the model to detections of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and coyote (Canis latrans) collected via camera trapping. We found evidence of both temporal and spatial interactions between deer and coyote. Detection intensity of deer was greater and proportionally more diurnal where coyotes were present. At hunted sites, coyotes were more likely to occur at sites where deer were also present (and vice versa). These results highlight how two-species occupancy models with a continuous-time detection process can be used to infer temporal interactions between species. Our approach broadens the set of questions ecologists can ask regarding both spatial and temporal interactions between species, as well as fine-scale temporal covariates (e.g., weather). Our model should be increasingly applicable given the increasing availability of ecological data collected in continuous time. Supplementary materials accompanying this paper appear on-line

AB  - Classification of sheep behaviour from a sequence of tri-axial accelerometer data has the potential to enhance sheep management. Sheep behaviour is inherently imbalanced (e.g., more ruminating than walking) resulting in underperforming classification for the minority activities which hold importance. Existing works have not addressed class imbalance and use traditional machine learning techniques, e.g., Random Forest (RF). We investigated Deep Learning (DL) models, namely, Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional LSTM (BLSTM), appropriate for sequential data, from imbalanced data. Two data sets were collected in normal grazing conditions using jaw-mounted and earmounted sensors. Novel to this study, alongside typical single classes, e.g., walking, depending on the behaviours, data samples were labelled with compound classes, e.g., walking_grazing. The number of steps a sheep performed in the observed 10 s time window was also recorded and incorporated in the models. We designed several multi-class classification studies with imbalance being addressed using synthetic data. DL models achieved superior performance to traditional ML models, especially with augmented data (e.g., 4Class + Steps: LSTM 88.0%, RF 82.5%). DL methods showed superior generalisability on unseen sheep (i.e., F1-score: BLSTM 0.84, LSTM 0.83, RF 0.65). LSTM, BLSTM and RF achieved sub-millisecond average inference time, making them suitable for real-time applications. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of DL models for sheep behaviour classification in grazing conditions. The results also demonstrate the DL techniques can generalise across different sheep. The study presents a strong foundation of the development of such models for real-time animal monitoring.(c) 2022 China Agricultural University.

AB  - The present study assessed the health and growth of goat kids raised in stall-fed and free-range grazing systems during summer and winter. Parameters measured included Temperature Humidity Index (THI), weight gain, rectal temperature, hemoglobin (Hb), total leukocyte count (TLC), packed cell volume (PCV), antioxidant enzymes (SOD, GSH), total proteins, glucose, triglycerides, and cholesterol. Stall-fed kids gained significantly more weight (P<0.05) than free-range kids in both seasons. Although rectal temperature increased in summer, it remained within physiological limits. Hemoglobin levels were significantly higher (P<0.05) in winter, while TLC, Hb, and PCV decreased in summer. Free-range kids had significantly higher antioxidant enzyme levels (SOD, GSH) in both seasons. During summer a significant increase in total proteins and a decrease in glucose, triglycerides, and cholesterol in both groups was reported. Stall-reared kids exhibited better overall growth and health, but antioxidant status was superior in free-range kids.

AB  - Abiotic stresses adversly effect the growth and physiological processes in crop plants, which ultimately lead to significant reduction in the yield. Based upon emerging threats of salinity and drought stresses, present investigation was done to evaluate the effect of foliar applied salicylic acid (SA) on the growth, gas exchange attributes and leaf pigments in wheat under water and salt stress. The experiment was conducted in a warehouse upon three commercial wheat varieties (Galaxy-2013, Punjab-2011 & Millat-2011) treated with two levels of foliar application of SA (Control, SA @ 100 mg/L) under CRD-factorial arrangement which was replicated thrice. According to the results, all the growth attributes, pigments and gas exchange parameters were significantly (p <= 0.01) affected by the salt and drought stresses, and foliar application of SA remarkably remediated the adverse effects of stresses and improved the studied traits in all wheat cultivars. Elevated levels of chlorophyll a (2.31 mg g-1 FW), chlorophyll b (3.24 mg g-1 FW) and total chlorophyll content (5.55 mg g-1 FW) were found in SA treated plants under both types of stresses. Similarly, the maximum leaf photosynthetic rate (5.33 & micro;mol CO2 m-2 s-1), leaf transpiration rate (3.47 mmol H2O m-2 s-1) and stomatal conductance (0.85 mmol H2O m-2 s-1) were recorded by Glaxy-2013 under foliage applied SA (100 mg/L. In conclusion, wheat cultivar Glaxy-2013 surpassed all other cultivars by exhibiting significantly improved growth attributes salt and drought stresses.

AB  - Many plant species exhibit diurnal flower opening and closing, which is an adaptation influenced by the lifestyle of pollinators and herbivores. However, it remains unclear how these temporal floral movements are modulated. To clarify the role of the circadian clock in flower movement, we examined temporal floral movements in Arabidopsis thaliana. Wild-type (accessions; Col-0, Ler-0 and Ws-4) flowers opened between 0.7 and 1.4h in a 16-h light period and closed between 7.5 and 8.3h in a diurnal light period. In the arrhythmic mutants pcl1-1 and prr975, the former flowers closed slowly and imperfectly and the latter ones never closed. Under continuous light conditions, new flowers emerged and opened within a 23-26 h window in the wild-type, but the flowers in pcl1-1 and prr975 developed straight petals, whose curvatures were extremely small. Anti-phasic circadian gene expression of CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1), LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYLE (LHY) and TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION 1 (TOC1) occurred in wild-type flowers, but non-rhythmic expression was observed in pcl1-1 and prr975 mutants. Focusing on excised petals, bioluminescence monitoring revealed rhythmic promoter activities of genes expressed (CCA1, LHY and PHYTOCLOCK 1/LUX ARRHYTHMO, PCL1/LUX) in the morning and evening. These results suggest that the clock induces flower opening redundantly with unknown light-sensing pathways. By contrast, flower closing is completely dependent on clock control. These findings will lead to further exploration of the molecular mechanisms and evolutionary diversity of timing in flower opening and closing.

AB  - The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are important processes for various energy devices, including polymer electrolyte fuel cells, rechargeable metal-air batteries, and water electrolyzers. We herein report the preparation of a rare metal-free and highly efficient ORR/OER electrocatalyst by calcination of a mixture of blood meal and ascidian-derived cellulose nanofibers. The obtained carbon alloys showed high ORR/OER performances and proved to be promising electrocatalysts. The carbon alloys synthesized entirely from biomass resources not only lead to a new electrocatalyst fabrication process but also contribute to CO2 reduction and the realization of a good life-cycle assessment value in fabrication of a sustainable energy device.

AB  - Premise The optimal defense theory (ODT) predicts that the allocation of chemical defenses in plants will be concentrated in parts or tissues that are of higher fitness value for the individuals that produce them. Chemicals are known to be allocated to certain parts of aquatic plants, and the morphological architecture of Nymphoides humboldtiana, a species that exposes its parts to different environmental factors and consumers, may be an excellent model to evaluate within-plant susceptibility to consumers according to the ODT. Methods Under laboratory experimental conditions, we evaluated the defensive properties of extracts from vegetative (leaves, rhizomes, roots) and reproductive (long stem internodes, flowers, fruits) parts of N. humboldtiana against consumption by the generalist herbivorous gastropod Biomphalaria glabrata. Extracts were also subjected to chemical analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography, principal component analysis, and analysis of their relationships to defensive actions. Results Extracts of all vegetative and internode (reproductive) parts of N. humboldtiana exhibited defensive properties against B. glabrata, but the long stem internodes exhibited the highest percentage of inhibition. Chemical profiles of these parts were qualitatively and quantitatively different, but a major unidentified compound is presumably responsible for the higher defensive property found in internodes. Conclusions Our results support the ODT, since chemical defense was more effective in long stem internodes, which have a high fitness value for N. humboldtiana to keep the flowers emerged on the water surface in response to the rapid and dynamic changes in water levels typical of freshwater environments.

AB  - Standard UO2 fuel pellets used in light-water reactors fracture during irradiation due to the large ther-mal gradient in the radial direction. Over the decades, numerous researchers have explored fuel cracking from experimental and modeling points of view. To date, there have been both empirical and mechanis-tic approaches to predict the number of fragments that form in UO2. The empirical models only consider maximum power and burnup as inputs. Existing mechanistic approaches for normal operation have not accounted for irradiation effects. This work employs a mechanistic fuel cracking model using the ex-tended finite element method to explore radial crack formation while including a sensitivity analysis that accounts for the randomization of tensile strength within the fuel, the strength randomization crite-ria (uniform or volume-weighted Weibull), power ramping rates, computational mesh density, maximum power level, and irradiation (burnup) effects. The results indicate that the uncertainty in this mechanistic modeling approach envelopes the predicted values from three different empirical correlations in almost all cases. This means that, for computationally intensive analyses involving UO2 fragmentation, the em-pirical correlations can be used. However, since the mechanistic calculations bound those of the empirical correlations, there is confidence in the applicability of the mechanistic approach developed in this work to generate a correlation for fuel types where limited data exists (e.g., doped-UO2, U3Si2).

AB  - Scenedesmus almeriensis microalgae-bacteria consortia were evaluated for the removal of a mixture of tetracycline (TET), ciprofloxacin (CIP), and sulfadiazine (SDZ) from the real liquid fraction of pig slurry in a pilot scale photobioreactor. After 15 days of operation, the reactor was spiked with a mixture of 100 mu g/L of each antibiotic. The experiment ran for 20 additional days. From the liquid phase, antibiotic removal were 77 +/- 5 %, 90 +/- 14 %, and 60 +/- 27 % for TET, CIP, and SDZ, respectively. The antibiotics found in the solid phase were 979 +/- 382 ng/g for TET and 192 +/- 69 ng/g for SDZ; CIP was not detected in the biomass. The parameters analyzed before and after antibiotic addition showed that the antibiotics did not have a negative effect on the reactor biomass. The removal efficiencies of the analyzed parameters were 64.6 +/- 0.6 % for TOC, 56.9 +/- 0.6 % for IC, 63.9 +/- 0.6 % for TN, 88.6 +/- 0.9 % for N-NH+4 , 64.9 +/- 0.6 % for N-NO-3 , and 30.1 +/- 0.3 % for P-PO3- 4 . This study demonstrated the good performance of microalgaebased technology for swine manure wastewater treatment, not only in terms of organic matter and nutrient removal, but also regarding the removal of antibiotics. The mass balance analysis of the entire process is presented. Additionally, the present study is a validation of previous laboratory scale batch studies operating in a quasi-continuous mode on veterinary antibiotics (VA) removal efficiencies and kinetics.

AB  - Strong genetic structure has prompted discussion regarding giraffe taxonomy,1-3 1-3 including a suggestion to split the giraffe into four species: Northern ( Giraffa c. camelopardalis), ), Reticulated ( G. c. reticulata), ), Masai ( G. c. tippelskirchi), ), and Southern giraffes ( G. c. giraffa).4-6 ). 4-6 However, their evolutionary history is not yet fully resolved, as previous studies used a simple bifurcating model and did not explore the presence or extent of gene flow between lineages. We therefore inferred a model that incorporates various evolutionary processes to assess the drivers of contemporary giraffe diversity. We analyzed whole-genome sequencing data from 90 wild giraffes from 29 localities across their current distribution. The most basal divergence was dated to 280 kya. Genetic differentiation, F ST , among major lineages ranged between 0.28 and 0.62, and we found significant levels of ancient gene flow between them. In particular, several analyses suggested that the Reticulated lineage evolved through admixture, with almost equal contribution from the Northern lineage and an ancestral lineage related to Masai and Southern giraffes. These new results highlight a scenario of strong differentiation despite gene flow, providing further context for the interpretation of giraffe diversity and the process of speciation in general. They also illustrate that conservation measures need to target various lineages and sublineages and that separate management strategies are needed to conserve giraffe diversity effectively. Given local extinctions and recent dramatic declines in many giraffe populations, this improved understanding of giraffe evolutionary history is relevant for conservation interventions, including reintroductions and reinforcements of existing populations.

AB  - Mosquito-borne diseases represent a significant threat to human and animal health in the United States. Several viruses, including West Nile, Saint Louis encephalitis, and Eastern equine encephalitis are endemic. In humans, the disease is typically detected during the summer months, but not during the winter months. The ability of these viruses to reemerge year after year is still not fully understood, but typically involves persistence in a reservoir host or vector during periods of low transmission. Mosquito species are known to overwinter at different life stages (adults, larvae, or eggs) in manufactured or natural sites. Gopher tortoise burrows are known to serve as refuge for many vertebrate and invertebrate species in pine savannas. In this study, we surveyed the interior of gopher tortoise burrows for overwintering mosquitoes. We identified 4 species (Anopheles crucians s.l., Culex erraticus, Mansonia dyari, and Uranotaenia sapphirina). Cx. erraticus was the most abundant, and its presence and abundance increased in winter months, implying that this species utilized gopher tortoise burrows for overwintering. Bloodfed Cx. erraticus and An. crucians s.l. females were detected. While An. crucians s.l. fed exclusively on the white-tailed deer, Cx. erraticus had a more diverse host range but fed primarily on the gopher tortoise. Tortoises and other long-lived reptiles like the American alligator have been shown to sustain high viremia following West Nile virus (WNV) and Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) infection and therefore could play a role in the maintenance of these viruses. In addition, Cx. erraticus is naturally infected with WNV and is a known bridge vector for EEEV. As such, these overwintering sites may play a role in perpetuating over-winter arboviral activity in Florida.

AB  - In the United States (US), surgical castration of male piglets is typically performed without any form of analgesia. This may raise concerns with the public; however, there is no information regarding current public knowledge on swine industry practices in the US. In this study we gained insight into public knowledge and perception on castration with and without analgesia in comparison to knowledge of industry stakeholders on these same topics. Through an online survey, 119 respondents were asked four questions about castration in the US swine industry. Industry respondents were contacted via social media and networking. The general public sample was accessed through Mechanical Turk. Survey responses were categorised by experience (industry vs public). Industry respondents were more aware of practices compared to the general public. Most public respondents were unaware of castration practices and the lack of analgesia use. Respondents from rural communities were more aware of castration practices than (sub)urban communities and more aware of analgesia use than those from urban communities. Those with more education had greater awareness of castration practices (occurrence not frequency). Based on the results from this first US sample, knowledge on industry practices was especially lacking for public respondents, but also for a minority of industry respondents, indicating opportunities for education and further research on the topic.

AB  - Camelina [(Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz], an oilseed species of Brassicaceae, does not have approved herbicides for weed control, which limits its expansion as a commercial crop. To evaluate agronomic traits and ecosystem services of non-transgenic cultivars of sulfonylurea-resistant camelina and canola (Brassica napus L.), a field study was conducted near Fargo, North Dakota. Two replicated locations (NDSU and NW22) were set up in a randomized complete block design including four blocks of camelina, canola, and fallow per location. Camelina and canola were seeded (18 May) at 4.9 and 2.9 kg ha(-1), respectively, using 19-cm row spacing. Data was collected mid- and late-season (29 June and 22 July 2020 respectively) for crop and weed stem count (no. m(-2)), biomass dry matter (kg m(-2)), and nutrient (N, P, K, S) content (kg ha(-1)), as-well-as final season (7 August) seed yield (kg ha(-1)) for camelina and canola treated with and without sulfonylurea. Using Prefer 90 (NIS) at 0.25% v/v, camelina was treated with thifensulfuron at 6.3 g a.i. ha(-1), and canola was treated with thifensulfuron at 10.5 g a.i. ha(-1) and tribenuron at 5.3 g a.i. ha(-1). Sulfonylurea-resistant camelina and canola reduced late-season dry weight biomass of weeds by >75% and >= 60%, respectively, compared with fallow plots. Application of sulfonylurea herbicides to camelina or canola prior to mid-season analyses was not a significant factor (p <= 0.05) for reducing weed pressure and generally had little impact on altering crop biomass, seed yield, and nutrient retention. However, in some cases, herbicide treatment had an additive effect of reducing weed pressure over that of camelina or canola alone. Depending on the rotational cropping system, sulfonylurea-resistant camelina and canola should provide additional options for integrated weed management approaches and reducing nutrient leaching in the upper Midwest and northern Great Plains of the USA.

AB  - Purpose Water scarcity is expected to extend to more regions of the world and represents an alarming threat to food security worldwide. Under such circumstances, water holding capacity is an important agronomic trait, which is primarily controlled by soil texture. Methods Our work examined three different soil textures from three cities of Shaanxi Province in China, i.e., silt-sandy loam from Yulin (north of Shaanxi), loam-clay loam from Yangling (middle and western part of Shaanxi), and clay loam-clay from Hanzhong soil (south of Shaanxi), at two moisture levels, i.e., field capacity of 70-75% (well-watered) and 50-55% (water deficit). Results The differences in soil particle sizes altered the soil physiochemical properties and soil enzymatic activities. Soil urease and ss-glucosidase activities were significantly higher in the Yangling soil under the well-watered treatment, while the differences were nonsignificant under the water deficit conditions. The leaf photosynthesis rate and total chlorophyll content were significantly higher in Hanzhong soil after 15 days of treatment; however, the overall highest plant length, root cortex diameter, and xylem element abundance were significantly higher in Yangling soil under the water deficit conditions. Furthermore, comparable differences were observed in antioxidant defence enzymes and endogenous hormones after every 15 days of treatments. The auxin, gibberellic acid and cytokinin concentrations in leaves and roots were comparably high in Yangling soil, while the abscisic acid concentrations were higher in Hanzhong soil under the water deficit conditions. Conclusions Our findings concluded that soil compaction has a significant role not only in root morphology, growth, and development but also in the soil physicochemical properties and nutrient cycle, which are useful for the growth and development of tomato plants.

AB  - Fecal contamination is an important source for the emergence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) worldwide. Identifying the host sources of ARG contamination and distinguishing whether the increased abundance of ARGs in the environment is due to on-site selection or the result of fecal contamination can effectively protect water quality and predict human health risks. In this study, the occurrence of 5 ARGs (sul1, sul2, tetO, tetW, and ermF), 1 mobile element intI1 and 7 microbial source tracker (MST) markers (CPQ_064, BacHum, Rum-2-Bac, BacCow, P.ND5, Pig-1-Bac, and GFD) was analyzed in the Chishui River watershed of Southwest China. The results showed that the detection frequencies of most ARGs exceeded 90% except for tetO. The abundance of the ARGs was higher in sediments than those in water. There was no significant difference in the ARG abundance in the sediments between the dry season and wet season, but the abundance of most ARGs in water during the dry season was significantly higher than those of the wet season. For MST markers, the abundance was also higher in sediments than that in water. Temporal distribution analysis showed that the abundance of most MST markers in water during the dry season was higher than that of the wet season, but the opposite result was found in sediments. Correlation analysis revealed that the prevalence of most ARGs in water was largely attributed to human fecal contamination. The results suggested that ruminant fecal contamination was a significant contributor to the distribution of tetW and ermF in water. In contrast, ARGs showed poor correlation with most MST markers in the sediments. Considering the lower specificity of Pig-1-Bac and ruminant-associated markers (Rum-2-Bac and BacCow), as well as the different decay rates between two human-associated markers (CPQ_064 and BacHum), the accuracy of ARG source tracking may be affected. Thus, this study suggested that multiple MST markers should be applied simultaneously to characterize ARGs sources. These findings provide critical guidance for mitigating ARG dissemination in agricultural and rural regions reliant on surface water, where fecal contamination poses dual threats to drinking safety and livestock productivity.

AB  - Enriched environment (EE), characterized by multi-sensory stimulation, represents a non-invasive alternative for alleviating epileptic seizures. However, the mechanism by which EE exerts its therapeutic impact remains incompletely understood. Here, it is elucidated that EE mitigates seizure susceptibility through the augmentation of adult neurogenesis within the entorhinal cortex (EC) circuit. A substantial upregulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis concomitant with a notable reduction in seizure susceptibility has been found following exposure to EE. EE-enhanced adult-born dentate granule cells (abDGCs) are functionally activated during seizure events. Importantly, the selective activation of abDGCs mimics the anti-seizure effects observed with EE, while their inhibition negates these effects. Further, whole-brain c-Fos mapping demonstrates increased activity in DG-projecting EC CaMKII alpha+ neurons in response to EE. Crucially, EC CaMKII alpha+ neurons exert bidirectional modulation over the proliferation and maturation of abDGCs that can activate local GABAergic interneurons; thus, they are essential components for the anti-seizure effects mediated by EE. Collectively, this study provides compelling evidence regarding the circuit mechanisms underlying the effects of EE treatment on epileptic seizures, shedding light on the involvement of the EC-DG circuit in augmenting the functionality of abDGCs. This may help for the translational application of EE for epilepsy management.
   In this study, Li et al reveal circuit mechanisms underlying the enriched environment (EE) treatment on epilepsy. EE recruits entorhinal cortex circuit, promoting the proliferation and maturation of adult-born dentate granule cells (abDGCs), which can activate local GABAergic interneurons, thus resulting in seizure attenuation. This may hold therapeutic significance for the translational application of EE in the treatment of epilepsy. image

AB  - Osteocytes play an important role in bone metabolism. The interactions of osteocytes with the surrounding microenvironment can alter cellular and lacunar morphological changes. However, objective quantification of osteocyte lacunae is challenging due to their deep location in the bone matrix. This project established a novel method for the analytical study of osteocytes/lacunae, which was then used to evaluate the osteocyte morphological changes in diabetic pig mandibular bone. Eight miniature pigs were sourced, and diabetes was randomly induced in four animals using streptozotocin (STZ) administration. The mandibular tissues were collected and processed. The jawbone density was evaluated with micro-CT. Osteocyte lacunae were effectively acquired and identified using backscattered electron scanning microscopy (BSE). A significantly decreased osteocyte lacunae size was found in the diabetic group. Using the acid etching method, it was demonstrated that the area of osteocyte and lacunae, and the pericellular areas were both significantly reduced in the diabetes group. In conclusion, a standard and relatively reliable method for analyzing osteocyte/lacunae morphological changes under compromised conditions has been successfully established. This method demonstrates that diabetes can significantly decrease osteocyte/lacunae size in a pig's mandibular cancellous bone.

AB  - Perennial rye grass is a widely used forage species in Ireland, on which the ruminant sector of agriculture is heavily dependent. While this species of grass is the primary source of fodder for cows, it is also abundant in plant protein, which could form a potential alternative ingredient in monogastric animal feed using a green biorefinery approach. In this study, perennial rye grass was processed using a novel biorefining process to extract value added products including protein as a potential replacement for soybean meal in monogastric feeds. Feed trials were conducted on a commercial farm with 55 weaner pigs for 31 days until slaughter. The diets comprised a control and a trial diet which integrated the green biorefinery protein concentrate. The effects of the new diet were determined by measuring the daily feed intake (DFI), average weight gain (AWG) and feed conversion ratio (FCR). Amino acid profiles of grass protein concentrate and soybean meal were comparable, with the latter having a slightly higher amount of total protein content, lysine and cysteine. The DFI and ADW indicated that the treatment diet was superior to the control. DFI for the treatment diet (1.512 kg/d) was 8% higher than the control diet (1.400 kg/d) by the end of the trial. Additionally, the ADW for the treatment diet was 6.44% higher than that achieved in the control sample. Meanwhile, FCR calculations indicated that the treatment diet is just as efficient as the conventional diet. Overall, the results of the study indicate positive potential for perennial ryegrass-derived green biorefinery protein concentrate as an alternative protein source for pig feed formulations in Ireland.

AB  - Being a novel target of luteinizing hormone (LH), the effect of CREB-binding protein/P300-interacting trans-activator with ED-rich tail member 4 (CITED4) gene on the proliferation, apoptosis, and steroidogenesis of ovarian granulosa cells (GCs) in Hu sheep was investigated. The presence of CITED4, CREB-binding protein (CBP), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBP alpha) and -beta (C/EBP beta) proteins was demonstrated in GCs and luteal cells. CITED4 protein in GCs was induced by LH, and CITED4 overexpression moderately increased GC responses to LH. In contrast, CITED4 knockdown in GCs decreased prostaglandin (PGE2)-induced LH target gene levels. Moreover, PGE2-stimulated CITED4 mRNA expression was blocked by ERK1/2 inhibition (U0126), suggesting that CITED4 is a downstream target of the ERK1/2 pathway in sheep GCs. In contrast to CITED4 knockdown, CITED4 overexpression promoted GC proliferation, inhibited apoptosis, upregulated cell cycle-related genes, and downregulated apoptosis-related genes. Additionally, CITED4 overexpression induced cell cycle transition from S to G2/M phase. No effect was observed with CITED4 knockdown. CITED4 overexpression increased progesterone (P-4) production levels and STAR mRNA expression, whereas CITED4 knockdown decreased P-4 production and STAR and 3 beta-HSD mRNA expression levels. Thus, our results suggest that CITED4 is involved in regulating the expression of LH-induced genes and the ERK1/2 pathway and the proliferation, apoptosis, and steroidogenesis in Hu sheep GCs by modulating the expression of related genes. These findings will help understand the role of CITED4 in follicular development and ovulation of pre-ovulatory follicles.

AB  - Macraucheniidae is one of the most diverse families of South American native ungulates. In the last decade, Macraucheniidae systematics has been the focus of several studies with the aim of enhancing understanding of the diversity and phylogenetic relationships of the group. This study proposes a new phylogenetic hypothesis for the Macraucheniidae based on new characters and new outgroups. We included eight non-macraucheniid taxa as outgroups (three Didolodontidae, one Protolipternidae, two Proterotheriidae, and two Adianthidae); additionally, we included the 16 genera that are currently accepted as belonging to Macraucheniidae based on other cladistic studies. The matrix used in the cladistic analysis comprised 24 taxa and 71 characters. The genus Polymorphis was recovered as the sister taxon of a clade composed of Proterotheriidae + Adianthidae + Macraucheniidae, not as a macraucheniid. Disregarding Polymorphis, all other genera attributed to the Macraucheniidae were recovered in a monophyletic group. We found support for two macraucheniid clades, one formed by Cramaucheniinae (including Theosodon) and the other by all Macraucheniinae with the inclusion of Llullataruca. The late Pliocene Windhausenia was recovered as the sister group of 'Quaternary macraucheniids', with Xenorhinotherium as the sister group of Macraucheniopsis + Macrauchenia. Based on this topology, Polymorphis must be considered as family incertae sedis. Our findings have significant implications for understanding the origin and diversification of Macraucheniidae, altering the temporal range of the family to the late Oligocene-Late Pleistocene/Holocene. Additionally, Llullataruca becomes the oldest recorded member of the Macraucheniinae. The evolution of the nasal retraction in the iconic species Macrauchenia patachonica has consistently been interpreted through the lens of the phyletic gradualism model, with Theosodon as the intermediate form between species with totally reduced or absent nasals, and those basal forms with well-developed nasals and terminal nostrils. However, the monophyly of Cramaucheniinae suggests a rapid morphological shift among Macraucheniinae, which fits with a punctuated equilibrium evolutionary model.

AB  - Subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA) is a common metabolic disease due to feeding high-concentrate (HC) diets to ruminants, especially dairy cows, in intensive farming system. Long term feeding HC diets commonly induce damages to hindgut barrier, leading to the translocation of harmful substances such as endotoxins (LPS) from lumen to blood, which results in a low-grade inflammation and stress response. Secondary bile acids (SBAs) play an important role in maintaining intestinal homeostasis. However, the function of SBAs on the intestinal epithelial barrier in SARA remains unclear. In this study, 15 growing goats were randomly divided into 3 groups, control group (30 % concentrate of dry matter, CON), SARA group (70 % concentrate of dry matter, SARA), and SARA+BAs group (70 % concentrate of dry matte, supplemented with 3 g/d/goat of BAs, SARA+BAs). The changes of mucosal permeability, gut microbiota and bile acids (BAs) profile was measured in the colon. The results showed that compared to CON group, the level of plasma D-lactate and diamine oxidase activity (DAO) (P <0.05) was elevated in SARA group, while BAs supplementation significantly decreased plasma DAO (P < 0.05). The thickness of colonic mucosa, goblet cells (GCs) number (P < 0.01) and the abundance of MUC2 and occludin expression (P < 0.05) were significantly decreased in SARA group, while BAs supplementation markedly increased GCs number and improved mucosal barrier. BAs effectively reduced the content of LPS and volatile fatty acids (VFAs) in the colonic digesta (P < 0.05). Furthermore, BAs ameliorated SARA-induced reduction of total BAs (P < 0.001), primary BAs (P < 0.05), and conjugated BAs (P < 0.05) including taurocholic acid (TCA), taurochenodeoxycholic acid (TCDCA) and taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA), as well as significantly increased hyodeoxycholic acid (HDCA) and lithocholic acid (LCA) contents in colonic digesta. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that BAs decreased the abundance of Prevotella and Treponema, but increased the abundance of Akkermansia which was positively correlated with GCs number and MUC2 abundance. BAs supplementation improved the changes in the abundance of Roseburia, Negativibacillus, Lactobacillus, and unclassified_f_prevotellaceae, which were correlated with TCA, TCDCA, and TDCA levels. RNA-Seq results showed that, compared to SARA group, BAs activated the PPAR signaling pathway which was positively correlated with the number of GCs. In summary, BAs supplementation remodels the profiles of gut microbiota and metabolites, activates the PPAR signaling pathway, and eventually ameliorates intestinal mucosal barrier damage.

AB  - Aerobic composting is an efficient method to treat animal manure, but comparative study in terms of composting between human feces with herbivore manure was very limited. The objective of this study was to explore the differences of composting performance, microbial communities as well as its metabolic functions between human feces (HF) and cattle manure (CM) composting using physicochemical analysis, 16S rRNA sequencing and PICRUSt function prediction. The results showed that HF treatment did not meet the compost maturity standard. Compared with CM treatment, the HF compost had the lower humus content and humic acid/fulvic acid ratio at the end of composting, indicating the lower humification degree under the same composting conditions. This was because the relative abundance of Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria treated with HF was lower than CM treatment during the composting process. In addition, PICRUSt analysis revealed that HF treatment was less abundant than CM treatment in genes related to metabolism, especially in Valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis and C5-Branched dibasic acid metabolism, which were the dominant metabolic pathways belonging to amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism, respectively. Therefore, consider-ing the excellent composting performance of cattle manure, it was recommended to add some cattle manure into raw materials during human manure composting.

AB  - Simple Summary Oxidative stress and inflammation are common problems in livestock and poultry production, and have a serious impact on animal welfare and profitability. Finding an effective way to deal with oxidative stress and inflammation is an urgent problem for the modern pig industry. Cysteamine has been shown to play a crucial role in the growth performance, digestive metabolism, immune function, and fecundity of animals. In this study, we found that dietary supplementation of coated cysteamine could enhance the level of immunoglobulin and the expression of intestinal immune factors in the weaned pigs induced by diquat. It is proved that dietary supplementation with coated cysteamine can improve the intestine barrier function and immune function. This study aimed to explore the effects of dietary coated cysteamine on oxidative stress and inflammation in diquat-induced weaning pigs. Twenty-four pigs were randomly assigned to three dietary groups with eight replicates: the control (fed base diet), diquat (fed base diet), and coated cysteamine + diquat groups (fed 80 mg/kg cysteamine). The experiment was conducted for 21 d, and consisted of a pre-starter period (14 d) and a starter period (7 d). Coated cysteamine treatment significantly increased (p < 0.05) the final weight and average daily gain (ADG) in pigs. The contents of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), immunoglobulin G (IgG), serine (Ser), and isoleucine (Ile) were elevated (p < 0.05) while the contents of albumin (ALB) and aspartic acid (Asp) were reduced (p < 0.05) in the serum after coated cysteamine supplementation. Coated cysteamine supplementation resulted in greater (p < 0.05) serum superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, the expression of interleukin-10 (IL-10) mRNA in the colon, and the CuSOD mRNA expression in the jejunum (p < 0.05) and colon (p = 0.073). Coated cysteamine supplementation showed an increasing trend in villus height (p = 0.060), villus height/crypt depth (V/C) (p = 0.056), the expression levels of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) mRNA (p = 0.061), and Occludin mRNA (p = 0.074) in the jejunum. In summary, dietary supplementation with coated cysteamine improves the intestinal barrier function of the jejunum by increasing the immunoglobulin content and the relative expression of intestinal immune factor mRNA in pigs while alleviating oxidative stress and inflammatory reactions caused by diquat.

AB  - To study the effect and mechanism of selenium sources on the selenium content and quality of fresh tea leaves, tea seedlings (Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze) were the research object. A solution of 100 mg/L sodium selenate (Na2SeO4), sodium selenite (Na2SeO3), and selenium yeast (selenium yeast) were applied on the leaves surface of 5-week-old tea plants, and the selenium levels in the leaves, roots, and stems were determined at 20 weeks of age. The effects of different selenium sources on the mineral nutrient content, antioxidant enzyme activity, and quality parameters content in leaves were analyzed. The mechanism was analyzed by detecting the expression levels of related genes. The results showed that the three selenium sources can increase the growth of tea seedlings and the selenium content in leaves and stems, and the selenium yeast treatment had the most significant effect. Selenium spraying promoted the absorption of mineral nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, but had no significant impact on the absorption of calcium and magnesium. Spraying the three selenium sources dramatically increased the activities of APX, POD, and SOD antioxidant enzymes, among which the selenium yeast treatment had the most significant effect. However, there was no significant impact on the MDA level in this study. Selenium sources markedly increased leaves total amino acid levels, accompanied by up-regulation the genes of amino acid synthetic enzymes (CsGS, CsGOGAT, and CsGDH). Leaves glucose, tea polyphenol, total soluble protein, catechin, flavonoid contents, and sucrose were higher in selenium sources treatments than in control treatment seedlings. Moreover, selenium sources upregulated expression of CsHMGR, CsAPX, and CsTCS1 genes. selenium yeast had the best comprehensive effect of the three selenium sources. These results confirmed that selenium sources play a positive role on the selenium content and quality of tea by increasing the antioxidant capacity of leaves, the absorption rate of mineral nutrients, and regulating expression of related genes in Camellia sinensis.

AB  - Objective: To assess the effects of omega-3 (n3) supplementation on intestinal microbiota, fatty acids profile, neuroinflammation, and social memory of cafeteria diet (CAF)-fed rats.Methods: Male Wistar rats were fed with CAF for 20 weeks. Omega-3 (500 mg/kg/day) was supplemented be-tween the 16th and 20th week. Colon morphology, intestinal microbiota composition, short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the plasma, fatty acids profile, TLR-4 and claudin-5 expressions in the brain, and social memory were investigated.Results: CAF reduced colon length, crypts' depth, and microbiota diversity, while n3 increased the Firmicutes/ Bacteroidetes ratio. CAF increased SCFA plasma levels, but n3 reduced butyrate and isobutyrate in obese rats. LPS was increased in CAF-fed rats, and n3 decreased its levels. In the cerebral cortex, n3 increased caprylic, palmitic, stearic, tricosanoic, lignoceric, myristoleic, and linoleic acids. CAF increased palmitic acid and TLR-4 expression in the cerebral cortex while decreasing claudin-5 in the hippocampus. In the social memory test, CAF-fed animals showed greater social interaction with no effect of n3.Conclusions: The lack of n3 effect in some of the evaluated parameters may be due to the severity of the obesity caused by CAF. However, n3 reduced LPS levels, suggesting its ability to reverse endotoxemia.

AB  - Sleeping sickness is still prevalent in Campo, southern Cameroon, despite the efforts of World Health Organization and the National Control Programme in screening and treating cases. Reducing disease incidence still further may need the control of tsetse vectors. We update entomological and parasitological parameters necessary to guide tsetse control in Campo. Tsetse flies were trapped, their apparent densities were evaluated as the number of flies captured per trap per day and mapped using GIS tools. Polymerase chain reaction based methods were used to identify their trypanosome infection rates. Glossina palpalis palpalis was the dominant vector species representing 93.42% and 92.85% of flies captured respectively during the heavy and light dry seasons. This species presented high densities, that is, 3.87, 95% CI [3.84-3.91], and 2.51, 95% CI [2.49-2.53] flies/trap/day in the two seasons. Moreover, 16.79% (of 1054) and 20.23% (of 1132 flies) were found infected with at least 1 trypanosome species for the 2 seasons respectively, Trypanosoma congolense being the most prevalent species, and Trypanosoma. brucei gambiense identified in 4 samples. Tsetse flies are abundant in Campo and present high trypanosome infection rates. The detection of tsetse infected with human trypanosomes near the newly created palm grove show workers' exposition. Tsetse densities maps built will guide vector control with 'Tiny Targets'.

AB  - Silage has become a key component of year-long animal feed in Canada and parts of northern Europe. It provides several advantages to farmers over traditional feed components, such as increased digestibility, higher nutrient content and preservation of the forages to meet seasonal feeding demands. Some ensiled materials can contain toxic fungal metabolites resulting from `in field' contamination. In addition, when improperly stored or exposed to air during the feedout stage, silage is highly susceptible to aerobic spoilage by yeasts and filamentous fungi resulting in lower nutrient value and further mycotoxin contamination. In this study, silage samples were collected from 25 Canadian dairy goat and cattle farms where animals experienced feed-related health issues. Twenty-six unique fungal species were isolated from these samples, with the majority being Penicillium. High resolution liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (HRLC-MS/MS) was used to identify a total of 125 known mycotoxins and fungal secondary metabolites from these silage samples, many of which were not produced by the 26 isolated filamentous fungi grown in agar cultures. Various mycotoxins resulting from preharvest contamination were detected, including ergot alkaloids, fumonisins and trichothecenes, some in high concentrations. Toxins produced after harvest included roquefortine C, citrinin and penitrem A. This study reinforces the need for farmers to implement best management practices to minimise fungal contamination and the resulting mycotoxin deposition in their crop and stored feed to maintain animal health.

AB  - In acidic soil conditions, aluminium (Al) limits crop growth and yields but benefits the growth of tea plants. Flavonols are suggested to form complexes with Al, enhancing Al accumulation in tea plants. The role of flavonols in promoting lateral root formation under Al stress remains unclear. Here, we identified a 7-rhamnosylated type of flavonol glycosides (F2-type) crucial for this process in tea roots. Al treatment significantly stimulated lateral root initiation and bud germination in tea plants, enhancing flavonol glycoside accumulation, particularly the F2-type. Most genes in the flavonol biosynthetic pathway were upregulated post-Al treatment, including CsUGT89AC2/3 genes, which catalyze F2-type flavonol glycosides synthesis in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of CsUGT89AC2/3 increased lateral root occurrence, flavonol glycoside accumulation and expression of biosynthetic pathway genes in tea roots. Kaempferol treatment activated flavonol pathway genes and stimulated lateral root growth. Al treatment, kaempferol treatment and CsUGT89AC3 overexpression accelerated auxin accumulation and expression of auxin-related genes. Therefore, Al stimulates flavonol biosynthetic pathway gene expression, regulates F2-type flavonol biosynthesis, and influences auxin homoeostasis, promoting lateral root formation in tea plants. These findings lay the foundation for further investigation into the mechanisms underlying the Al-mediated promotion of lateral root initiation in tea plants.

AB  - Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is a perfluorinated compound, a synthesized chemical, and has been used in several industrial products for more than 70 years. Although PFOA is known to exert toxic effects in normal cells, there is no detailed information on its reproductive toxicity and its effects on sperm functions related to protein kinase B (AKT). Therefore, this study was conducted to explore the effects of PFOA on sperm functions via AKT. Boar spermatozoa were incubated with different concentrations of PFOA (0, 0.1, 1, 10, and 100 mu M) to induce capacitation. Sperm functions (sperm motility, motion kinematic parameters, capacitation status, cell viability, and intracellular ATP levels) were evaluated. In addition, the expression levels of AKT, phospho-AKT, phosphoPKA, and tyrosine phosphorylated proteins were evaluated by western blotting. Results showed significant decreases in sperm motility and motion kinematic parameters. PFOA treatment significant suppressed spermatozoa capacitation and intracellular ATP levels. Furthermore, it significantly decreased the levels of phospho-PKA and tyrosine phosphorylated proteins. The levels of AKT phosphorylation at Thr308 and Ser473 also significantly decreased. These findings suggest that PFOA diminishes sperm functions during capacitation and induces unnatural phosphorylation in AKT, leading to reproductive toxicity. Therefore, people should be aware of reproductive toxicity when using PFOA.

AB  - BackgroundSugarcane (Saccharum spp.) is a preeminent sugar and bioenergy crop and has great economic importance in tropical countries. A major disease affecting this crop is yellow leaf disease, caused by sugarcane yellow leaf virus (SCYLV, Polerovirus SCYLV, Solemoviridae). The sugarcane aphid Melanaphis sacchari is considered the main vector of SCYLV, and the closely related sorghum aphid Melanaphis sorghi, which has recently emerged as a pest of great relevance in sorghum, has also been suspected to be a vector. Genetic resistance is an important resource for preventing yield losses caused by SCYLV and its vectors, but knowledge on the underlying molecular mechanisms is lacking. Therefore, the present work aimed to investigate the transcriptomic responses of sugarcane to SCYLV and M. sorghi, which was reported to transmit this virus for the first time herein.ResultsTwo sugarcane cultivars, one susceptible and one tolerant to SCYLV, were fed upon by aviruliferous and viruliferous aphids. The transcriptome of the plants was assessed via RNA-Seq via differential gene expression analyses and a gene coexpression network. The susceptible cultivar showed an incipient reaction to both M. sorghi and SCYLV, with very few differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified in comparison with aphid-free plants. The response of the tolerant cultivar to aviruliferous M. sorghi involved pathways typically associated with defense against herbivory, which were also enriched in coexpression network modules in which DEGs were overrepresented. Some of these genes were hubs in their respective modules, indicating that they are potential key regulators of defense responses. However, these responses were diminished when viruliferous aphids were used, and other processes linked to infection with SCYLV were altered.ConclusionsThese results indicated that SCYLV could affect sugarcane defense responses to its vector, similar to other viruses of the same genus. Possible implications for the epidemiology and impact of SCYLV and M. sorghi are discussed.

AB  - The aim of the study was to assess the effect of long-term administration of natural prebiotics: Jerusalem artichoke (topinambur, TPB) and inulin (INU) as well as one of the most popular antidepressants, fluoxetine (FLU), on the proliferation of neural stem cells, learning and memory functions, and the composition of the intestinal microbiota in mice. Cognitive functions were assessed using the Morris Water Maze (MWM)Test. Cells were counted using a confocal microscope and ImageJ software. We performed 16S rRNA sequencing to assess changes in the gut microbiome of the mice. The obtained results showed that the 10-week supplementation with TPB (250 mg/kg) and INU (66 mg/kg) stimulates the growth of probiotic bacteria, does not affect the learning and memory process, and does not disturb the proliferation of neural stem cells in the tested animals. Based on this data, we can assume that both TPB and INU seem to be safe for the proper course of neurogenesis. However, 2-week administration of FLU confirmed an inhibitory impact on Lactobacillus growth and negatively affected behavioral function and neurogenesis in healthy animals. The above studies suggest that the natural prebiotics TPB and INU, as natural supplements, may have the potential to enrich the diversity of intestinal microbiota, which may be beneficial for the BGM axis, cognitive functions, and neurogenesis.

AB  - The rice stink bug, Oebalus pugnax (F.; Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) has been a pest of rice in the United States since the 1880s. Besides this species, there now are two invasive Oebalus species, O. ypsilongriseus (De Geer) and O. insularis St & aring;l, which are found in Florida. Genetic variation of these economically important species is unknown, limiting our understanding of Oebalus evolution and demography. Here we provide the first population-level investigation of genetic diversity in these species. Ninety two adult stink bugs were collected from the southeastern United States (Arkansas, Mississippi, Florida), and Cuba. A region of the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome oxidase I gene was sequenced from all sampled individuals. From the 68 O. pugnax samples, 14 haplotypes were observed, with one haplotype, G, occurring in 29 % of the samples. Many haplotypes were shared among populations, but several were unique to individual populations. There is genetic support for the movement of O. pugnax within the southeastern USA, with the majority of O. pugnax haplotypes being shared among the three sampled states. Also, with several haplotypes of O. pugnax being found only in single populations, there may be locally adapted regional populations of O. pugnax. Unlike O. pugnax, no genetic variation was observed among the Florida and Cuba O. ypsilongriseus and O. insularis. This research provides evidence that Cuba is the most likely source of these two invasive species to Florida. These data on O. pugnax genetic diversity may provide insight into the movement of this species among different geographical areas, different host plants, and potential spread of insecticide resistant populations.
   La chinche apestosa del arroz, Oebalus pugnax (F.), ha sido una plaga del arroz en Estados Unidos desde la d & eacute;cada de 1880. Adem & aacute;s de esta especie, ahora hay dos especies invasoras de Oebalus, O. ypsilongriseus (De Geer) y O. insularis St & aring;l, que se encuentran en Florida. La variaci & oacute;n gen & eacute;tica de estas especies econ & oacute;micamente importantes es poco desconocida, lo que limita nuestra comprensi & oacute;n de la evoluci & oacute;n y la demograf & iacute;a de Oebalus. Aqu & iacute; proporcionamos la primera investigaci & oacute;n a nivel de poblaci & oacute;n de la diversidad gen & eacute;tica en estas especies. Se recolectaron noventa y dos chinches apestosas adultas del sureste de Estados Unidos (Arkansas, Mississippi, Florida) y Cuba. A, y una regi & oacute;n del gen COI del mtDNA se secuenciaron de todos los individuos muestreados. De las 68 muestras de O. pugnax, se observaron 14 haplotipos, con un haplotipo, G, presente en el 29 % de las muestras. Muchos haplotipos se compartieron entre poblaciones, pero varios fueron exclusivos de poblaciones individuales. Existe evidencia gen & eacute;tica que respalda la migraci & oacute;n de O. pugnax en el sureste de EE. UU., ya que la mayor & iacute;a de sus haplotipos se comparten entre las poblaciones de Misisipi, Florida y Arkansas (los tres estados muestreados). Adem & aacute;s, dado que varios haplotipos de O. pugnax se encuentran solo en poblaciones individuales en los tres estados estudiados, es posible que existan poblaciones regionales de O. pugnax adaptadas localmente. A diferencia de O. pugnax, no se observ & oacute; variaci & oacute;n gen & eacute;tica entre O. ypsilongriseus y O. insularis de Florida y Cuba. Esta investigaci & oacute;n proporciona evidencia de que Cuba podr & iacute;a ser la fuente m & aacute;s probable de estas dos especies invasoras en Florida. Esta diversidad gen & eacute;tica de O. pugnax puede brindar informaci & oacute;n sobre la migraci & oacute;n de esta especie entre diferentes & aacute;reas geogr & aacute;ficas, diferentes plantas hospedantes y la posible propagaci & oacute;n de poblaciones resistentes a los insecticidas.

AB  - In plants, Trihelix transcription factors are responsible for regulating growth, development, and reaction to various abiotic stresses. However, their functions in tea plants are not yet fully understood. This study identified a total of 40 complete Trihelix genes in the tea plant genome, which are classified into five clades: GT-1 (5 genes), GT-2 (8 genes), GT gamma (2 genes), SH4 (7 genes), and SIP1 (18 genes). The same subfamily exhibits similar gene structures and functional domains. Chromosomal mapping analysis revealed that chromosome 2 has the most significant number of trihelix family members. Promoter analysis identified cis-acting elements in C. sinensis trihelix (CsTH), indicating their potential to respond to various phytohormones and stresses. The expression analysis of eight representative CsTH genes from four subfamilies showed that all CsTHs were expressed in more tissues, and three CsTHs were significantly induced under ABA, NaCl, and drought stress. This suggests that CsTHs plays an essential role in tea plant growth, development, and response to osmotic stress. Furthermore, yeast strains have preliminarily proven that CsTH28, CsTH36, and CsTH39 can confer salt and drought tolerance. Our study provides insights into the phylogenetic relationships and functions of the trihelix transcription factors in tea plants. It also presents new candidate genes for stress-tolerance breeding.

AB  - Depression, a prevalent and debilitating mental health disorder, affects approximately 280 million people worldwide, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). It is estimated that 5% of adults, including 4% of men and 6% of women, experience depression, with the prevalence increasing to 5.7% in individuals over 60 years old. Despite the availability of pharmacological treatments, many individuals experience insufficient relief or adverse side effects, highlighting the need for alternative therapies. This review comprehensively examines the current scientific evidence on the mechanisms by which saffron (Crocus sativus L.) and its bioactive compounds-crocin, crocetin, and safranal-exert antidepressant effects. Key mechanisms include the modulation of neurotransmitter systems, anti-inflammatory properties, antioxidant activities, and the regulation of neurotrophic factors. Additionally, saffron's impact on epigenetic modulation and gut-brain axis interactions are explored. Clinical studies supporting the efficacy of saffron in alleviating depressive symptoms are discussed, along with considerations for dosage, safety, and future research directions. This review aims to provide a thorough understanding of saffron's potential as a natural antidepressant and its mechanisms of action, contributing to the growing body of literature on alternative treatments for depression.

AB  - Glycoprotein (GP) VI is the major platelet collagen receptor and a promising anti-thrombotic target. This was first demonstrated in mice using the rat monoclonal antibody JAQ1, which completely blocks the Collagen-Related Peptide (CRP)-binding site on mouse GPVI and efficiently inhibits mouse platelet adhesion, activation and aggregation on collagen. Here, we show for the first time that JAQ1 cross-reacts with human GPVI (huGPVI), but not with GPVI in other tested species, including rat, rabbit, guinea pig, swine, and dog. We further demonstrate that JAQ1 differently modulates mouse and human GPVI function. Similar to its effects on mouse GPVI (mGPVI), JAQ1 inhibits CRP-induced activation in human platelets, whereas, in stark contrast to mouse GPVI, it does not inhibit the adhesion, activation or aggregate formation of human platelets on collagen, but causes instead an increased response. This effect was also seen with platelets from newly generated human GPVI knockin mice (hGP6(tg/tg)). These results indicate that the binding of JAQ1 to a structurally conserved epitope in GPVI differently affects its function in human and mouse platelets.

AB  - Background: Pig organ xenotransplantation is a potential solution for the severe organ shortage in clinic, while immunogenic genes need to be eliminated to improve the immune compatibility between humans and pigs. Current knockout strategies are mainly aimed at the genes causing hyperacute immune rejection (HAR) that occurs in the first few hours while adaptive immune reactions orchestrated by CD4 T cell thereafter also cause graft failure, in which process the MHC II molecule plays critical roles. Methods: Thus, we generate a 4-gene (GGTA1, CMAH, beta 4GalNT2, and CIITA) knockout pig by CRISPR/Cas9 and somatic cell nuclear transfer to compromise HAR and CD4 T cell reactions simultaneously. Results: We successfully obtained 4KO piglets with deficiency in all alleles of genes, and at cellular and tissue levels. Additionally, the safety of our animals after gene editing was verified by using whole-genome sequencing and karyotyping. Piglets have survived for more than one year in the barrier, and also survived for more than 3 months in the conventional environment, suggesting that the piglets without MHC II can be raised in the barrier and then gradually mated in the conventional environment. Conclusions: 4KO piglets have lower immunogenicity, are safe in genomic level, and are easier to breed than the model with both MHC I and II deletion.

AB  - Aromatic herbal drugs have been widely used in the treatment of many respiratory and gastrointestinal dis-eases as part of traditional medicine. Many recent studies have shown that plant species of the Lamiaceae family and their products express relaxant effects on the contractions of the isolated ileal and tracheal smooth muscle of experimental animals. There is no study reporting the spasmolytic effects of the Salvia sclarea L. (clary sage, family Lamiaceae) extracts, therefore, the aim of the study was to examine their effects on spontaneous, KCl-, acethylcholine-, histamine-, BaCl2- and CaCl2- induced rats ileal contractions, and car- bachol-and KCl-induced tracheal smooth muscle contractions. Two extracts were prepared from the aerial parts of the herb using concentrate (96%) or 80% ethanol in an ultrasonic bath. In addition to determining the spasmolytic effect of the extracts, the chemical composition and antimicrobial effects against six Gram (+) and six Gram (-) bacteria and one yeast (microdilution assay) were also investigated. The extracts were rich in polyphenolics wherein rosmarinic acid was the predominant compound. Higher concentrations of pheno-lic acids and flavonoid heterosides were found in the extract prepared with 80% ethanol while flavonoid agly-cones were more represented in the extract prepared with concentrated ethanol. The S. sclarea extracts significantly inhibited the rats ileum and tracheal contractions in a concentration dependent regime. The extract prepared with concentrated ethanol was a better relaxant agent of ileum smooth muscles in sponta-neous, KCl-and CaCl2- induced contractions, and the extract prepared with 80% ethanol was superior in other series of experiments. Gram (+) bacteria, especially Staphylococcus aureus, were more sensitive to the action of the S. sclarea extracts in comparison to Gram (-). The extracts were not effective in the anticandidal part of the microdilution assay. Based on these results, S. sclarea could find an appropriate place in modern phyto-therapy as a potential treatment agent of gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases associated with spasms.

AB  - Plant species, interacting with both pollinators and herbivores, form a 3-guild ecological network that encompasses mutualistic and antagonistic subnetworks. These plant-animal interactions typically evolve through adaptive interaction switching, which tends to promote species abundance. In this study, we constructed an adaptive plant-animal network and explored how interaction rewiring among species from different guilds influences the structure and stability of this 3-guild network. Our findings reveal that interaction rewiring dynamically reshapes network architecture, with plant degree centrality correlations between mutualistic and antagonistic subnetworks emerging as a critical determinant of community stability. Notably, extreme centrality correlations, driven by interaction switching, can undermine network stability. In contrast, moderate correlations enhance resilience, rendering optimized networks more robust than their randomly assigned counterparts. These results underscore the importance of interaction switching in shaping the structure and stability of 3-guild ecological networks. Moreover, these findings provide mechanistic evidence that plant generalism fundamentally influences resilience in optimized networks, mediated through the evolutionary trade-off between herbivore defense and pollinator attraction.

AB  - Drought and herbivory challenge chickpea growth and yield. Consequently, we designed two glasshouse experiments to investigate the effects of drought and herbivory on chickpea growth and defence and explored the trade-offs between exudation of organic acids and growth. Experiment 1 combined factorially twelve varieties and three water regimes. Experiment 2 combined factorially six cultivars, two water regimes, and two herbivory treatments - plants challenged with Helicoverpa armigera larvae and untreated controls. Drought decreased the amount of leaf exudates by 71% and growth traits by 15 to 48%. Herbivory increased the amount of leaf exudates by 60% and reduced shoot biomass by 32% in well-watered plants, and increased exudates by 49% and reduced shoot biomass by 38% under severe water stress. Leaf damage, and survival and size of Helicoverpa armigera larvae were larger in water-stressed plants, and correlated negatively with the leaf exudates in both water regimes. Our study did not support a trade-off between growth and defence: in experiment 1, there was no trade-off between exudates and growth traits in 25 out of 27 cases resulting from the combination of nine traits and three water regimes; weak trade-offs in 2 out of 27 cases were apparent under water stress; in experiment 2, growth and exudates were unrelated. The complex relationship between drought, herbivory, and plant defence underscores the need for a nuanced understanding of crop management.

AB  - Optical remote sensing ship target detection has become an essential means of ocean supervision, coastal defense, and frontier defense. Accurate, effective, fast, and real-time remote sensing data processing is the critical technology in this field. This paper proposes a real-time detection algorithm for moving targets in low-resolution wide-area remote sensing images, which includes four steps: pre-screening, simplified HOG feature identification, sequence correlation identification, and facilitated Yolo identification. It can effectively detect and track targets in low-resolution sequence data. Firstly, iterative morphological processing was used to improve the contrast of low-resolution ship target profile edge features compared with the sea surface background. Next, the target area after adaptive segmentation was used to eliminate false alarms. As a result, the invalid background information of extensive comprehensive data was quickly eliminated. Then, support vector machine classification of S-HOG feature was carried out for suspected targets, and interference such as islands and reefs, broken clouds, and waves were eliminated according to the shape characteristics of ship targets. The method of multi-frame data association and searching for adjacent target information between frames was adopted to eliminate the interference of static targets and broken clouds with similar contours. Finally, the sequential marks were further trained and learned, and further false alarm elimination was completed based on the clipped Yolo network. Compared with the traditional Yolo Tiny V2/V3 series network, this method had higher computational speed and better detection performance. The F1 number of detection results was increased by 3%, and the calculation time was reduced by 66%.

AB  - Camellia oil is valuable as an edible oil and serves as a base material for a range of high-value products. Camellia plants of significant economic importance, such as Camellia sinensis and Camellia oleifera, have been classified into sect. Thea and sect. Oleifera, respectively. Fatty acid desaturases play a crucial role in catalyzing the formation of double bonds at specific positions of fatty acid chains, leading to the production of unsaturated fatty acids and contributing to lipid synthesis. Comparative genomics results have revealed that expanded gene families in oil tea are enriched in functions related to lipid, fatty acid, and seed processes. To explore the function of the FAD gene family, a total of 82 FAD genes were identified in tea and oil tea. Transcriptome data showed the differential expression of the FAD gene family in mature seeds of tea tree and oil tea tree. Furthermore, the structural analysis and clustering of FAD proteins provided insights for the further exploration of the function of the FAD gene family and its role in lipid synthesis. Overall, these findings shed light on the role of the FAD gene family in Camellia plants and their involvement in lipid metabolism, as well as provide a reference for understanding their function in oil synthesis.

AB  - Light chain amyloidosis (AL) is a systemic disease where fibrillar deposition of misfolded immunoglobulin light chains (LCs) severely affects organ function and results in poor prognosis for patients, especially when heart involvement is severe. Particularly relevant in this context is the cardiotoxicity exerted by still uncharacterized soluble LC species. Here, with the final goal of identifying alternative therapeutic strate-gies to tackle AL amyloidosis, we produced five llama-derived nanobodies (Nbs) specific against H3, a well-characterized amyloidogenic and cardiotoxic LC from an AL patient with severe cardiac involvement. We found that Nbs are specific and potent agents capable of abolishing H3 soluble toxicity in C. elegans in vivo model. Structural characterization of H3-Nb complexes revealed that the protective effect of Nbs is related to their ability to bind to the H3 VL domain and stabilise an unexpected partially open LC dimer in which the two VL domains no longer interact with each other. Thus, while identifying potent inhibitors of LC soluble toxicity, we also describe the first non-native structure of an amyloidogenic LC that may represent a crucial step in toxicity and aggregation mechanisms.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Experimental objective: Diarrhea is a major cause of piglet mortality, often reported associated with maternal gut bacterial communities (microbiota). Maternal supplementation with probiotic Clostridium butyricum during late gestation showed to reduce piglet diarrhea during the suckling period. This study thereby investigated the effects of probiotic supplementation on sow gut (feces) microbiota and their potential microbial metabolisms. Methods: Sow and litter performances, including milk compositions and incidences of piglet diarrhea, were recorded from farrowing to weaning of control- supplemented vs. probiotic-supplemented sows. Fecal samples from sows classified as before (Cb=17) and after (Ca=17) probiotic supplementation were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and 16S rRNA qPCR, following bioinformatic analyses for alpha-beta diversity, quantitative microbiota, LEfSe (Linear discriminant analysis Effect Size) taxon biomarker analysis, potential microbial metabolism profiles, and statistical correlations with microbial species and clinical data performances. Results: Probiotic-supplemented sows demonstrated the greater average piglets born alive and lower mummified fetuses (P > 0.05), and the statistical higher protein and casein contents in their colostrum (P < 0.05). Following microbiota analyses, no significant difference was observed in operational taxonomic units (OTUs), Chao1, and Shannon alpha-diversity indices between Cb and Ca samples. Nevertheless, Ca sows exhibited higher relative abundances of Clostridium, SMB53, g_Turicibacter, Treponema, Bacillus, Enterococcus and Lactobacillus, while the lower abundances of Oscillospira, Prevotella, Phascolarctobacterium and Ruminococcus, compared with Cb sows. This highlighted that after the probiotic supplementation showed the sow gut microbiota more abundances of potentially beneficial bacteria, including the supplemented probiotic C. butyricum, g_Bacillus, g_Enterococcus and g_Lactobacillus, for instances. The finding was consistent with the LEfSe (Linear discriminant analysis Effect Size) taxon biomarker analysis for the Ca group. Several microbial related metabolic pathways in sow feces were altered after probiotic supplement, particularly relevant to amino acid and short-chain fatty acid metabolisms (i.e., propanoate and butanoate), xenobiotics biodegradation and lipid metabolism. Supportively, the gut microbiota changes of Ca sows might associate with improved sow performance and milk metabolomic profile. Conclusions: The maternal probiotic C. butyricum supplementation during late gestation and lactation showed the improved sows' intestine, milk components, and the reduced piglet diarrhea cases. This helps to understand and support the probiotic supplementation in sows.

AB  - Natural or artificial selection could shape genetic architecture, e.g., the relationship between minor allele frequency (MAF) and the effect sizes of causal variants (CVs). This study aimed to investigate the impact of the MAF-effect size relationship (as a selection signature, S) on genomic prediction and heritability estimation in livestock, using both simulated data (Holstein) and real datasets (Holstein and pigs). We evaluated the performance of two models: (1) selection-adjusted genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP-S), and (2) MAF-stratified selection-adjusted genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP-SMS). Simulation results demonstrated that for traits under strong negative selection (S < -1), both GBLUP-S and GBLUP-SMS outperformed classic GBLUP. The prediction accuracy of GBLUP-S improved by 0.011-0.031, while GBLUP-SMS achieved a gain of 0.005-0.025. Furthermore, GBLUP-SMS exhibited lower sensitivity to variations in S-values, whereas GBLUP-S heavily relied on accurate S specification. When the true S was matched, GBLUP-SMS generated more unbiased (or comparable) heritability estimates and higher prediction accuracy relative to GBLUP-S. Critically, mismatched S in GBLUP-S led to increased bias in heritability estimates and reduced prediction accuracy. Cross-validation with real phenotypic data from Holsteins and pigs demonstrated that implementing selection-adjust methods improved prediction accuracy by 0.015 for FP in Holsteins and 0.01 for T1 in pigs, while enhancing the unbiasedness of heritability estimates across all traits. Negative selection signatures were identified for cattle (S = -0.5) and pig T1, T2, and T3 (S = -1.5, -1, and -2, respectively). These findings advance the theoretical framework of GBLUP-based genomic prediction and heritability estimation.

AB  - Simple Summary For at least the last four decades, the focus of animal welfare research, quality assurance, and policy initiatives has been on measuring behavioural and physiological stress responses in animals. In the last decade, however, this focus of animal welfare research has shifted to the consequences of these behavioural and physiological stress responses rather than only the responses per se. Modern-day farming, even with the intensification and automation requires regular monitoring and interactions by stockpeople. Research conducted in both experimental and commercial settings has shown widespread effects of the human-animal interactions on behaviour, physiology, and reproductive performance in farm animals. In this paper, we review the implications of human-animal interactions on reproduction in farm animals. A negative human-animal relationship (HAR) from the perspective of the animal is a limiting factor affecting farm animal welfare, as well as farm animal productivity. Research in farm animals has elucidated sequential relationships between stockperson attitudes, stockperson behaviour, farm animal fear behaviour, farm animal stress physiology, and farm animal productivity. In situations where stockperson attitudes to and interactions with farm animals are sub-optimal, through animal fear and stress, both animal welfare and productivity, including reproductive performance, can be compromised. There is a growing body of evidence that farm animals often seek and enjoy interacting with humans, but our understanding of the effects of a positive HAR on stress resilience and productivity in farm animals is limited. In this review, we explore the pathways by which stress induced by human-animal interactions can negatively affect farm animal reproduction, in particular, via inhibitory effects on the secretion of gonadotrophins. We also review the current knowledge of the stockperson characteristics and the nature of stockperson interactions that affect fear and physiological stress in farm animals. The contents of this review provide an insight into the importance of the HAR on farm animal welfare and reproduction while highlighting the gap in knowledge regarding the effects of a positive HAR on farm animals.

AB  - The effects of radiation in space on human cognition are a growing concern for NASA scientists and astronauts as the possibility for long-duration missions to Mars becomes more tangible. Oxygen (O-16) radiation is of utmost interest considering that astronauts will interact with this radiation frequently. O-16 radiation is a class of galactic cosmic ray (GCR) radiation and also present within spacecrafts. Whole-body exposure to high linear energy transfer (LET) radiation has been shown to affect hippocampal-dependent cognition. To assess the effects of highLET radiation, we gave 6-month-old female C57BL/6 mice whole-body exposure to O-16 at 0.25 or 0.1 Gy at NASA?s Space Radiation Laboratory. Three months following irradiation, animals were tested for cognitive performance using the Y-maze and Novel Object Recognition paradigms. Our behavioral data shows that O-16 radiation significantly impairs object memory but not spatial memory. Also, dendritic morphology characterized by the Sholl analysis showed that O-16 radiation significantly decreased dendritic branch points, ends, length, and complexity in 0.1 Gy and 0.25 Gy dosages. Finally, we found no significant effect of radiation on single nucleotide polymorphisms in hippocampal genes related to oxidative stress, inflammation, and immediate early genes. Our data suggest exposure to heavy ion O-16 radiation modulates hippocampal neurons and induces behavioral deficits at a time point of three months after exposure in female mice.

AB  - Emerging bacterial pathogens threaten global health and food security, and so it is important to ask whether these transitions to pathogenicity have any common features. We present a systematic study of the claim that pathogenicity is associated with genome reduction and gene loss. We compare broad-scale patterns across all bacteria, with detailed analyses of Streptococcus suis, an emerging zoonotic pathogen of pigs, which has undergone multiple transitions between disease and carriage forms. We find that pathogenicity is consistently associated with reduced genome size across three scales of divergence (between species within genera, and between and within genetic clusters of S. suis). Although genome reduction is also found in mutualist and commensal bacterial endosymbionts, genome reduction in pathogens cannot be solely attributed to the features of their ecology that they share with these species, that is, host restriction or intracellularity. Moreover, other typical correlates of genome reduction in endosymbionts (reduced metabolic capacity, reduced GC content, and the transient expansion of nonfunctional elements) are not consistently observed in pathogens. Together, our results indicate that genome reduction is a consistent correlate of pathogenicity in bacteria.

AB  - Simple Summary 1. Oral inoculation with recombinant yeast co-expressing pig IL-2 and fused bovine cathelicidin (FBC) significantly enhanced systemic immunity in mice. 2. The inoculated mice displayed stronger resistance against E. coli or S. aureus infection. 3. Recombinant yeast co-expressing PIL-2 and FBC could facilitate the development of new immunopotentiator to prevent the infection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. In order to develop an effective and safe immunomodulator to enhance the antimicrobial bioactivity and immunity of animals against infectious bacterial diseases, a recombinant plasmid pGAPZ alpha A-IL2-B co-expressing pig interleukin-2 (PIL-2) and fused bovine cathelicidin (FBC) genes were constructed using the 2A self-cleavage technique. After being expressed in Pichia pastoris strain SMD1168, the recombinant yeast was administered orally to 5-week-old female ICR mice. The control mice were similarly dosed with P. pastoris with a blank plasmid or FBC recombinant plasmid alone. At 28 days post-treatment, the mice were challenged intraperitoneally with virulent strains of either E. coli or S. aureus. Compared with the control groups, the mice that received recombinant yeast co-expressing PIL-2/FBC manifested significant increases in the number of leukocytes, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, IgG, and the gene expressions of TLRs(TLR1,4,6,9), antimicrobial peptides(CRP4 and CRAMP) and cytokines (IL-2, 4, 6, 7, 12, 15, 23, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha) in the blood. Furthermore, the treated mice displayed significantly higher survival than the other two control groups after the challenge. These results suggest that the antimicrobial activity and immunity of animals can be effectively enhanced by the in vivo co-expression of IL-2 and the FBS gene, which can facilitate the development of new immunopotentiation molecules to overcome the infection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

AB  - Silicon (Si) accumulation in plant tissues helps alleviate abiotic and biotic stresses, including infestation by insect pests. Here, we tested the hypothesis that Si concentration in maize leaves negatively impacts Spodoptera exigua Hubner (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) with respect to: (i) feeding preferences; (ii) leaf digestion; and (iii) life history traits. We produced three groups of maize plants cultivated in a hydroponic system that had contrasting Si concentrations in their tissues (i.e., 0.21 +/- 0.03, 4.45 +/- 0.50 and 8.46 +/- 0.61 g Si Kg(-1) DW). In choice assays, fifth instars preferentially consumed leaves containing lower Si concentrations. In no choice-assays, we found that the approximate digestibility (AD) of larvae feeding on Si-enriched leaves was not affected. However, these larvae exhibited a 32% reduction in relative growth rates. Higher Si concentration in maize leaves extended larval development by three days; from 18.07 +/- 0.29 when feeding on Si- diet to 21.39 +/- 0.21 days on the Si++ enriched diet. Si also reduced larval survival by 18% and pupal weight by 20%. Our results confirm that Si supplementation in soil enhances the ability of plants to resist infestation with chewing insects, and should be considered as a viable option in the existing range of sustainable management practices.

AB  - Plagiodera versicolora Laicharting is a highly damaging leaf beetle foraging on willow leaves. In willow germplasm collections, observation has shown that Salix suchowensis Cheng was severely foraged by this leaf beetle while Salix triandra L. was damage free or only slightly damaged. Results of olfactometer bioassays show that the headspace volatiles from leaves of S. triandra significantly repelled adult beetles, suggesting that this species produces volatile repellents against P. versicolora. S. suchowensis had no effect on the beetles. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was carried out to profile the headspace volatile organic compounds and 23 compounds from leaves of the alternate species in significantly different concentrations were detected. The effects of 20 chemical analogs on host discrimination were examined. Olfactory response to these chemicals showed that o-cymene, a S. suchowensis specific constituent, significantly attracted adult P. versicolora. In contrast, cis-3-hexenyl acetate, a constituent concentrated more in S. triandra than in S. suchowensis, significantly repelled beetles. Mixing o-cymene and cis-3-hexenyl acetate in comparable concentrations as in the volatiles of S. suchowensis demonstrated that the latter could mask the attracting effect of the former, causing a neutral response by adult beetles to leaves of S. suchowensis against clean air. In addition, chemical analogs have the same effect as plants when resembling volatile organic compounds in real samples. Two volatile metabolites were detected triggering host discrimination by one of the most damaging insect pests to host and non-host willows. The two metabolites are of considerable potential for use as olfactory signs in managing the beetles.

AB  - In this study, the factors influencing the carbon intensity (tCO(2)/t crude steel) transition in the Japanese iron and steel industry from FY2000 to FY2019 were empirically evaluated. The results revealed that the upper processes (i.e., the hot-metal ratio, waste plastic, and waste tires), steel product mix, capacity factor, and linear time trend variable explain the actual carbon intensity trajectory reported for the years from FY2000 to FY2019. The upper process and capacity factor were found to be major contributors to the inter-annual fluctuations of carbon intensity. The coefficient of the capacity factor index (FY2005 = 100) was estimated to be-0.23% per 1 percentage point of the capacity factor, indicating that a 1% decrease in the capacity factor resulted in a 0.23% deterioration in the carbon intensity. The coefficient of the time trend variable was estimated to be-0.0034 tCO2/t crude steel/y, which is equivalent to a 0.2%/y average improvement in carbon intensity over the period from FY2000 to FY2019. Because the observed improvement rate of carbon intensity was relatively small, a large-scale diffusion of innovative steelmaking processes such as hydrogen direct reduction will be required to achieve the goal of net zero emissions by 2050.

AB  - Anastrepha fraterculus (Wiedemann) and A. obliqua (Macquart) are important pests of fruit crops. In Brazil, these species cause damage to fruit growing in the South (annual average temperature of 20.9 degrees C) and Northeast (average yearly temperature of 24 degrees C). We evaluated the effect of temperature on the viability and development time of A. fraterculus and A. obliqua immature stages in their respective preferred hosts, guava (Psidium guajava L., Myrtaceae) and mango (Mangifera indica L., Anacardiaceae). The duration of egg and pupal stages, egg to pre-pupa, and viability of egg and pupal stages under different temperatures (15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 degrees C) were assessed. For both species, development time decreased with increasing temperature. Viability in the evaluated stages was only observed between 15 and 30 degrees C. However, the species responded differently to the exposure temperatures (15 and 30 degrees C), especially in the pupal stage and from egg to pre-pupa. Anastrepha fraterculus showed a lower tolerance to high temperatures, especially in the pupal stage and from egg to pre-pupa, which may explain its lower importance and economic impact in warmer Brazilian regions. Anastrepha obliqua had a lower tolerance at 15 degrees C, indicating greater adequacy for temperatures above 20 degrees C, characteristic of Northeast Brazil, suggesting the capacity to spread to cooler areas with rising temperatures.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the effect of early weaning (EW) on the growth performance, gastrointestinal development, serum parameters, and metabolomics of Hu sheep lambs. Twenty-four male Hu lambs were initially ewe-reared. A total of 12 lambs were weaned at 30 d of age (D30) as the EW group, and the remaining 12 lambs were weaned at 45 d of age (D45) as the control (CON) group. Serum samples were collected from six lambs per treatment on D30, D33, D36, and D45, and the lambs were slaughtered on D45 to collect the rumen and small intestine. The results showed that, compared with the CON group, the average daily gain (ADG), final body weight (p < 0.001), as well as average daily feed intake (ADFI) of lambs in the EW group significantly decreased in the first (p = 0.004) and second (p = 0.013) 5 days of treatment. Additionally, EW increased the ruminal weight and papillae length but reduced the duodenal villus height on D45 (p < 0.05). As for the serum parameters, the concentrations of glucose on D33, D36, and D45 (p < 0.001), and the IL-6 content on D45 (p = 0.018) were observed to be lower, while the levels of immunoglobulin A (IgA) (p = 0.027), IgG (p = 0.035), and IgM (p = 0.002) on the four ages were all higher in the EW group than those in CON group. Additionally, both treatment and age interactively affected the levels of GLU (p = 0.001), TP (p = 0.041), and IL-6 (p = 0.016). Additionally, the serum metabolomics analysis on D45 showed that the contents of 5-HT and arachidonic acid were increased, while L-phenylalanine, L-tyrosine, and L-glutamic acid were reduced in the EW group (p < 0.05). These differential metabolites were enriched in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways, including inflammatory mediator regulation, protein digestion and absorption, and phenylalanine and tyrosine biosynthesis. The current results identify that EW at D30 decreased the growth performance (ADG and ADFI) of Hu lambs within two weeks post-weaning, which might be associated with impaired duodenal morphology and glucose metabolism. The serum metabolomics analysis revealed that EW altered the concentrations of 5-HT, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and arachidonic acid, which could serve as potential regulatory targets for modulating the health of EW Hu lambs.

AB  - Whether prey species avoid predators and predator species track prey is a poorly understood aspect of predator-prey interactions, given measuring prey tracking by predators and predator avoidance by prey is challenging. A common approach to study these interactions among mammals in field situations is to monitor the spatial proximity of animals at fixed times, using GPS tags fitted to individuals. However, this method is invasive and only allows tracking of a subset of individuals. Here, we use an alternative, noninvasive camera-trapping approach to monitor temporal proximity of predator and prey animals. We deployed camera traps at fixed locations on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, where the ocelot (Leopardus pardalis) is the principal mammalian predator, and tested two hypotheses: (1) prey animals avoid ocelots; and (2) ocelots track prey. We quantified temporal proximity of predators and prey by fitting parametric survival models to the time intervals between subsequent prey and predator captures by camera traps, and then compared the observed intervals to random permutations that retained the spatiotemporal distribution of animal activity. We found that time until a prey animal appeared at a location was significantly longer than expected by chance if an ocelot had passed, and that the time until an ocelot appeared at a location was significantly shorter than expected by chance after prey passage. These findings are indirect evidence for both predator avoidance and prey tracking in this system. Our results show that predator avoidance and prey tracking influence predator and prey distribution over time in a field setting. Moreover, this study demonstrates that camera trapping is a viable and noninvasive alternative to GPS tracking for studying certain predator-prey interactions.

AB  - In the UK, Ireland and Europe generally, much attention has been devoted to understanding how the agri-food sector has leveraged disproportionate focus and support through its influence in the policymaking area. What has received less focus is how power is distributed within the agriculture sector, i.e., why/how some agricultural industries are more 'successful' or receive more focus than others, and what this means for policy. Researchers typically treat 'farmers' as a monolith, for example, focusing on the power of the 'farming lobby' versus that of other interest groups such as environmentalists. This tells us only part of the picture; power distributions within the agriculture industry itself also have implications for policy. Using empirical qualitative research (interviews, focus groups) conducted on the island of Ireland, this paper shows how some agri-food sectors (e.g., dairy) hold more power than others meaning they can resist important regulation such as water pollution initiatives. This renders such regulation ineffective. Meanwhile, other sectors (e.g., beef and sheep) are left out of the conversation, which compromises potential policy solutions. It argues that for future policies to adequately address the challenge of agriculture-related environmental degradation and support the resilience of the ecosystems upon which food production depends, agri-food system governance must become more equitable and nuanced, allowing for tangible consideration of the challenges that different agriculture sectors face.

AB  - Maternal diabetes during pregnancy affects the development of hippocampus in the offspring. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has received increasing attention for its role in regulating the survival and differentiation of neuronal cells in developing and adult brain. In the current study, we evaluated the effects of maternal diabetes and insulin treatment on expression and distribution pattern of BDNF in the hippocampus of neonatal rats at the first two postnatal weeks. We found no differences in hippocampal expression of BDNF between diabetics with normal control or insulin treated neonatal rats at postnatal day (P0) (P 0.05 each). Nevertheless, there was a marked BDNF downregulation in both sides' hippocampi of male/female diabetic group in two-week-old offspring (P < 0.05 each). Furthermore, the numerical density of BDNF+ cells was significantly reduced in the right/left dentate gyrus (DG) of male and female newborns born to diabetic animals at all studied postnatal days (P < 0.05 each). In addition, a lower number of reactive cells have shown in the all hippocampal subareas in the diabetic pups at P14 (P < 0.05 each). Our results have demonstrated that the insulin-treatment improves some of the negative impacts of diabetes on the expression of hippocampal BDNF in the newborns. We conclude that diabetes in pregnancy bilaterally disrupts the expression of BDNF in the hippocampus of the both male and female newborns at early postnatal days. In addition, good glycemic control by insulin in the most cases is sufficient to prevent the alterations in expression of BDNF protein in developing hippocampus.

AB  - Overhead enclosure monitoring provides objective quantitative mobility measurements for animals undergoing open-field testing. Notably, protocols for testing optimization have been minimally established for the guinea pig. It is unknown whether (a) repeated exposure, (b) time-of-day, or (c) length of testing duration influence outcome parameters. We hypothesized that guinea pigs would display decreased activity following repeated exposure to the open field; heightened activity during the earliest testing period; and that 10 min would be adequate for data collection. The study was conducted in two separate phases to distinguish between enclosure habituation and time-of-day effects, respectively. Two cohorts of male Dunkin Hartley guinea pigs were allowed voluntary movement in an open-field enclosure for 14 min to quantify mobility outcomes, including total distance traveled, total time mobile, average speed while mobile, and total time spent in the shelter. For both phases, testing occurred at four different times of day, and overhead monitoring software was programmed to divide the total testing duration into 2-min bins. Habituation phase results showed time mobile and distance traveled were influenced significantly by repeat exposure, as animals were most active during the first testing event. Time-of-day phase animals spent significantly more time mobile during the earliest testing period. Interestingly, significant differences were observed across 2-min bins for the time-of-day phase but not during the habituation phase. Specifically, progressively decreased ambulatory activity was observed as testing duration increased. Thus, habituation and time-of-day should be accounted for when possible. Finally, a trial period greater than 10 min may not yield additional data.

AB  - Commercial camera traps are widely used in global wildlife monitoring, but their effectiveness is often compromised by oversights in specifications and technical considerations. This study evaluates the performance of three camera trap models, including the Solar Powered 4K-trail, HC-801A-Pro and HC-801A, by analysing their resolution limits and lens distortion correction capabilities. To determine the resolution limits, A4- sized templates with red circles of varying diameters were placed within the cameras' field of view at various distances, with measurements taken using a measuring tape and verified with GPS. Using the cv2.TM_CCOEFF_NORMED template matching algorithm with templates scaled from 0.01 to 2.0 and a confidence threshold of 0.6, the resolution threshold was defined as the distance at which the observed circle size deviated from the expected size. Among the models, the Solar Powered 4K Trail camera had the highest resolution threshold at 17.29 m, while the HC 801A had the lowest at 15.3 m. Lens distortion coefficients were derived by analysing checkerboard pattern images taken at different distances and angles. All three camera models exhibited lens distortion. The Solar Powered 4K-trail and HC-801A-Pro exhibited barrel distortion, while the HC-801A exhibited pincushion distortion. The calculated coefficients successfully corrected these distortions, improving image accuracy. The derived coefficients effectively corrected these distortions, improving image accuracy. This practical and reproducible calibration method, which does not require expensive optical equipment, offers significant improvements in camera trap optimisation, enabling conservationists and researchers to obtain more reliable ecological data.

AB  - Background Perfluoroalkyl and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are pervasive environmental pollutants and potential threats to reproductive health. Epidemiological studies have established an association between PFAS and male infertility, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Objectives Investigate the effect of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), the most prevalent and representative PFAS, on bull sperm protein phosphorylation and function. Methods We exposed bull sperm to PFOS at 10 (average population exposure) and 100 mu M (high-exposure scenario), and analyzed global proteomic and phosphoproteomic analysis by TMT labeling and Nano LC-MS/MS. We also measured sperm fertility functions by flow cytometry. Results PFOS at 10-mu M altered sperm proteins linked to spermatogenesis and chromatin condensation, while at 100 mu M, PFOS affected proteins associated with motility and fertility. We detected 299 phosphopeptides from 116 proteins, with 45 exhibiting differential expression between control and PFOS groups. PFOS dysregulated phosphorylation of key proteins (ACRBP, PRKAR2A, RAB2B, SPAG8, TUBB4B, ZPBP, and C2CD6) involved in sperm capacitation, acrosome reaction, sperm-egg interaction, and fertilization. PFOS also affected phosphorylation of other proteins (AQP7, HSBP9, IL4I1, PRKAR1A, and CCT8L2) related to sperm stress resistance and cryotolerance. Notably, four proteins (PRM1, ACRBP, TSSK1B, and CFAP45) exhibited differential regulation at both proteomic and phosphoproteomic levels. Flow cytometric analysis confirmed that PFOS increased protein phosphorylation in sperm and also decreased sperm motility, viability, calcium, and mitochondrial membrane potential and increased mitochondrial ROS in a dose-dependent manner. Conclusions This study demonstrates that PFOS exposure negatively affects phosphorylation of proteins vital for bull sperm function and fertilization.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adaptation of specialist insects to their host plants and defense responses of plants to phytophagous insects have been extensively recognized while the dynamic interaction between these two events has been largely underestimated. Here, we provide evidence for characterization of an unrevealed dynamic interaction mode of digestive enzymes of specialist insect silkworm and inhibitor of its host plant mulberry tree. RESULTS: MnKTI-1, a mulberry Kunitz-type protease inhibitor, whose messenger RNA (mRNA) transcription and protein expression in mulberry leaf were severely triggered and up-regulated by tens of times in a matter of hours in response to silkworm, Bombyx mori, and other mulberry pest insects, suggesting a quick response and broad spectrum to insect herbivory. MnKTI-1 proteins were detected in gut content and frass of specialist B. mori, and exhibited significant post-ingestive stability. Recombinant refolded MnKTI-1 (rMnKTI-1) displayed binding affinity to digestive enzymes and a dual inhibitory activity to alpha-amylase BmAmy and serine protease BmSP2956 in digestive juice of silkworm. Moreover, data from in vitro assays proved that the inhibition of recombinant rMnKTI-1 to BmAmy can be reverted by pre-incubation with BmSP15920, an inactivated silkworm digestive protease that lack of complete catalytic triad. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that mulberry MnKTI-1 has the potential to inhibit the digestive enzyme activities of its specialist insect herbivore silkworm, whereas this insect may employ inactivated proteases to block protease inhibitors to accomplish food digestion. The current work provides an insight to better understand the interacting mode between host plant Kunitz protease inhibitors and herbivorous insect digestive enzymes.

AB  - Cognitive deficits, such as disrupted learning, are a major symptom of nicotine withdrawal. These deficits are heritable, yet their genetic basis is largely unknown. Our lab has developed a mouse model of nicotine withdrawal deficits in learning, using chronic nicotine exposure via osmotic minipumps and fear conditioning. Here, we utilized the BXD genetic reference panel to identify genetic variants underlying nicotine withdrawal deficits in learning. Male and female mice (n = 6-11 per sex per strain, 31 strains) received either chronic saline or nicotine (6.3 mg/kg per day for 12 days), and were then tested for hippocampus-dependent learning deficits using contextual fear conditioning. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping analyses using GeneNetwork identified a significant QTL on Chromosome 4 (82.13 Mb, LRS = 20.03, p < 0.05). Publicly available hippocampal gene expression data were used to identify eight positional candidates (Snacpc3, Mysm1, Rps6, Plaa, Lurap1l, Slc24a2, Hacd4, Ptprd) that overlapped with our behavioral QTL and correlated with our behavioral data. Overall, this study demonstrates that genetic factors impact cognitive deficits during nicotine withdrawal in the BXD recombinant inbred panel and identifies candidate genes for future research.

AB  - Simple Summary The increase in litter sizes in pigs obtained through selection has introduced challenges to breeders such as birth weight variability, piglet nursing, and piglet survival. Differences in birth weights can affect the later growth of piglets. We analysed the most important effects on the growth of piglets born in hyperprolific herds using a random regression coefficient model, which provides a smoother estimation of parameters compared to traditional fixed effects models and accounts for heterogeneous variances between measurements. Birth weight was the most influential factor on the final weight at 85 days of age. Litter size and parity also showed significant effect on the final weight. The results obtained using a random regression coefficient model could be encouraging for further application in pig growth analysis due to the ability of the model to describe individual growth patterns of piglets of variable birth weights and estimate the future growth of such piglets. In addition, the practical contribution of the paper is deeper insight into growth patterns of piglets from highly prolific sows under farm conditions, focusing on the need to control the variability of birth weight of large litters.Abstract Management of hyperprolific sows is challenging when it comes to controlling birth weight variability and piglet survival in large litters. The growth of low birth weight piglets can be compromised and have a negative impact on production efficiency. The objective of the study was to apply a random regression coefficient model to estimate the main effects of the growth of piglets of highly prolific sows. The dataset contained growth data for 360 piglets from 25 Pen Ar Lan Naima sows. In addition to routine procedures after farrowing, piglets were weighed five times: on day 1 after farrowing, on day 14 of life, at weaning on day 28, on day 30 of nursery period, and at the end of the nursery period when piglets were 83 days old. Data were treated as longitudinal, with body weight as the dependent variable. Fitting age as a quadratic regression within piglets in the random part of the model helped to determine the significant effect of birth weight, litter size, and parity on the growth of the piglets. Since the piglets from large litters often have non-uniform birth weights and this can affect further growth, the use of a random regression coefficient model is practical for analysing the growth of such piglets due to the ability to describe the individual growth pattern of every individual.

AB  - Early-life adversity (ELA) can induce persistent neurological changes and increase the risk for developing affective or substance use disorders. Disruptions to the reward circuitry of the brain and pathways serving motivation and emotion have been implicated in the link between ELA and altered adult behavior. The molecular mechanisms that mediate the long-term effects of ELA, however, are not fully understood. We examined whether ELA in the form of neonatal maternal separation (MatSep) modifies behavior and synaptic protein expression in adults. We hypothesized that MatSep would affect dopaminergic and glutamatergic signaling and enhance sensitivity to methamphetamine (Meth) reward or increase anxiety. Male Wistar rats were subjected to MatSep for 180 min/d on postnatal days (PND) 2-14 and allowed to grow to adulthood (PND 60) with no further manipulation. The hippocampus (Hipp), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), nucleus accumbens (NAc), and caudate putamen (CPu) were isolated from one subgroup of animals and subjected to Western blot and protein quantitation for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), alpha-synuclein (ALPHA), NMDA receptor (NMDAR), dopamine receptor-1 (D1) and -2 (D2), dopamine transporter (DAT), and postsynaptic density 95 (PSD95). Separate group of animals were tested for anxiety-like behavior and conditioned place preference (CPP) to Meth at 0.0, 0.1, and 1.0 mg/kg doses. MatSep rats displayed an increase in basal levels of anxiety-like behavior compared to control animals. MatSep rats also demonstrated CPP to Meth, but their responses did not differ significantly from controls at any drug dose. Increased NMDAR, D2, and ALPHA expression was observed in the NAc and CPu following MatSep; D2 and ALPHA levels were also elevated in the mPFC, along with DAT. MatSep rats had reduced D1 expression in the mPFC and Hipp, with the Hipp also showing a reduction in D2. Only the CPu showed elevated TH and decreased DAT expression levels. No significant changes were found in PSD95 expression in MatSep rats. In conclusion, ELA is associated with long-lasting and region-specific changes in synaptic protein expression that diminish dopamine neurotransmission and increase anxiety-like behavior in adults. These findings illustrate potential mechanisms through which ELA may increase vulnerability to stress-related illness.

AB  - Guinea pigs are often used in translational research, but providing them with safe and effective anesthesia is a challenge. Common methods like inhalant anesthesia and injectable ketamine/xylazine induce surgical anesthesia but can negatively affect cardiovascular, respiratory, and thermoregulatory systems and complicate the interpretation of research outcomes. Several alternative anesthetic regimens have been investigated, but none have consistently achieved a surgical plane of anesthesia. Therefore, identifying an anesthetic regimen that achieves a stable state of the surgical plane of anesthesia while preserving cardiorespiratory function would be a valuable contribution. To address this issue, we compared the efficacy of 3 anesthetic combinations in female Dunkin-Hartley guinea pigs: 1) alfaxalone, dexmedetomidine, and fentanyl (ADF); 2) alfaxalone, midazolam, and fentanyl (AMF); and 3) alfaxalone, midazolam, fentanyl, and isoflurane (AMFIso). We monitored anesthetic depth, heart rate, oxygenation, respiratory rate, respiratory effort, blood pressure, and body temperature every 15 min from injection to recovery. We also recorded the time to loss of righting reflex, duration of anesthesia, and time to achieve a surgical plane. The results showed no statistically significant differences in induction and recovery times among the groups. In the AMFIso group, 100% of the animals achieved a surgical plane of anesthesia, whereas only 10% of the animals in the AMF group reached that level. None of the animals in ADF group reached a surgical plane of anesthesia. Respiratory rate was significantly lower in the AMFIso as compared with the ADF group (P < 0.001) but was not different between the AMF and ADF groups. Temperature was significantly lower in the AMFIso group as compared with both the ADF and AMF groups (P < 0.001). In conclusion, both combinations of solely injectable anesthetics assessed in this study can be used for short, nonpainful procedures without significant cardiorespiratory depression. However, for mildly to moderately painful surgical procedures, the addition of an inhalant anesthetic like isoflurane is necessary for female guinea pigs.

AB  - Simple Summary Providing better living conditions for laying hens by promoting free-range systems has sparked curiosity about potential alterations in their dietary habits. Understanding these changes can lead to new feeding strategies to meet their nutritional needs. However, this task is challenging due to the inherent complexities of the outdoor environments and variations in plant material breakdown. Our research marks a pioneering step in exploring both qualitative and quantitative methods for assessing plant intake in laying hens using n-alkanes as markers, and demonstrates their viability even at levels of plant material in the diet as low as 1%. It also highlights the need for further research on different sources of n-alkanes, especially in real case studies with different plant and insect species under outdoor conditions. Such studies are essential to provide a deeper understanding of the dietary factors affecting the performance of laying hens in free-range systems.Abstract The shift in animal welfare standards towards free-range housing for laying hens in the EU has raised questions about changes in dietary composition. Accurate assessment of outdoor plant material intake is crucial for effective feeding strategies. This study introduces an approach using n-alkanes as markers to determine plant intake in laying hens, involving n-alkane recovery rate assessment, discriminant analysis and linear equation-solving for both qualitative and quantitative assessment, respectively, considering systematic n-alkane combinations. Two diets: a standard commercial diet and a diet incorporating 1% alfalfa were tested. Chemical analyses showed an altered n-alkane profile due to alfalfa inclusion, resulting a recovery rates ranging from 30-44% depending on the n-alkane type and diet. Statistical analysis revealed significant differences in recovery rates among the different alkanes for the same diets and between the diets for the same alkane, together with an interaction between n-alkane carbon chain length and initial concentration in the diet. The method accurately predicted plant inclusion, with a slight overestimation (2.80%) using the combination C25-C29-C33. Accurate qualitative classification of the animals based on fecal n-alkanes profiles was observed. The study successfully demonstrated the utility of n-alkanes for estimating dietary composition, providing a non-invasive approach for future free-range studies.

AB  - Rice (Oryza sativa L.) serves as a substitute for bread and is a staple food for half of the world's population, but it is heavily affected by insect pests. The fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) is a highly destructive pest, threatening rice and other crops in tropical regions. Despite its significance, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying rice's response to fall armyworm infestation. In this study, we used transcriptome analysis to explore the global changes in gene expression in rice leaves during a 1 h and 12 h fall armyworm feeding. The results reveal 2695 and 6264 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at 1 and 12 h post-infestation, respectively. Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG enrichment analyses provide insights into biological processes and pathways affected by fall armyworm feeding. Key genes associated with hormone regulation, defense metabolic pathways, and antioxidant and detoxification processes were upregulated, suggesting the involvement of jasmonic acid (JA) signaling, salicylic acid biosynthesis pathways, auxin response, and heat shock proteins in defense during 1 h and 12 h after fall armyworm infestation. Similarly, key genes involved in transcriptional regulation and defense mechanisms reveal the activation of calmodulins, transcription factors (TFs), and genes related to secondary metabolite biosynthesis. Additionally, MYB, WRKY, and ethylene-responsive factors (ERFs) are identified as crucial TF families in rice's defense response. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the molecular dynamics in rice responding to fall armyworm infestation, offering valuable insights for developing pest-resistant rice varieties and enhancing global food security. The identified genes and pathways provide an extensive array of genomic resources that can be used for further genetic investigation into rice herbivore resistance. This also suggests that rice plants may have evolved strategies against herbivorous insects. It also lays the groundwork for novel pest-resistance techniques for rice.

AB  - Akkermansia muciniphila is present in the mucus layer of its host gut, and its outer membrane protein Amuc_1100 has a significant ameliorative effect on metabolic disorders and emotional memory aspects of enteritis, obesity, depression, and anxiety in the host. Antibiotics affect gut microbial composition, leading to imbalance and behavioral changes in the gut-brain axis, while probiotics have a protective effect against behavioral changes caused by gut flora disorders. In the present study, a depressed mouse model using a broad-spectrum cocktail mixture resulted in increased anxiety and depression-like behavior, decreased serum and hippocampal levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), and increased serum corticosterone (cort) levels. After application of A. muciniphila and Amuc_1100, anxiety and depression-like behavior in antibiotic-treated mice were significantly alleviated. In addition, the brain derived neurotrophic factor / Tropomyosin receptor kinase B (BDNF/TrkB) signaling pathway was altered, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression increased, and c-Fos protein expression decreased in the hippocampus of antibiotic-treated mice. After treatment with A. muciniphila and Amuc_1100, BDNF and TrkB levels were restored in the hippocampus and cortex. These results suggest that A. muciniphila and Amuc_1100 may alleviate antibiotic-induced anxiety and depression by affecting the BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway.

KW  - EXPRESSION
AB  - Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most frequent genetic myopathy in childhood and leads to progressive muscle atrophy, weakness, and premature death. So far, there is no curative treatment available. Therapeutic development from bench to bedside takes time, and promising therapies need to be tested in suitable preclinical animal models prior to clinical trials in DMD patients. Existing mouse and dog models are limited with regard to the comparability of the clinical phenotype and the underlying mutation. Therefore, our group established a tailored large animal model of DMD, the DMD pig, mirroring the human size, anatomy, and physiology. For testing novel approaches, we developed a corresponding in vitro model, facilitating preclinical testing for toxicity, dosing, and efficacy, which we describe here. We first extracted primary muscle cells from wild-type and DMD pigs of different age groups and characterized those cells, then improved their differentiation process for identification of dystrophin and utrophin in myotubes. Our porcine in vitro model represents an important step for the development of novel therapeutic approaches, which should be validated further to minimize the need for living animals for bioassays, and thereby support the '3R' (replace, reduce, refine) principle, as fewer animals have to be raised and treated for preclinical trials.

AB  - Simple Summary Lumpy skin disease (LSD) presents a formidable challenge to livestock production worldwide, spreading rapidly among ruminant animals and causing significant economic losses. Despite vaccination efforts, the limitations of existing sheep and goat pox vaccine necessitate alternative therapeutic solutions. Using computational analysis, this study focuses on identifying inhibitors that target LSDV039, a critical protein associated with LSDV. Virtual screening identifies four potent inhibitors from a library of repurposed drugs and phytocompounds, while molecular dynamics simulations validate the stability and efficacy of those selected inhibitors. Past vaccine development attempts underscore the urgency of finding more successful treatments, while the potential of repurposing drugs and phytocompounds offers hope for combating LSD. Notably, this study highlights the versatility of computational methods in drug discovery and emphasizes the need for experimental validation in order to pave the way for novel therapeutic strategies against LSD. This research offers insight into the broader potential of computational approaches in combating infectious diseases.Abstract Lumpy skin disease (LSD), caused by a virus within the Poxviridae family and Capripoxvirus genus, induces nodular skin lesions in cattle. This spreads through direct contact and insect vectors, significantly affecting global cattle farming. Despite the availability of vaccines, their efficacy is limited by poor prophylaxis and adverse effects. Our study aimed to identify the potential inhibitors targeting the LSDV-encoded DNA polymerase protein (gene LSDV039) for further investigation through comprehensive analysis and computational methods. Virtual screening revealed rhein and taxifolin as being potent binders among 380 phytocompounds, with respective affinities of -8.97 and -7.20 kcal/mol. Canagliflozin and tepotinib exhibited strong affinities (-9.86 and -8.86 kcal/mol) among 718 FDA-approved antiviral drugs. Simulating the molecular dynamics of canagliflozin, tepotinib, rhein, and taxifolin highlighted taxifolin's superior stability and binding energy. Rhein displayed compactness in RMSD and RMSF, but fluctuated in Rg and SASA, while canagliflozin demonstrated stability compared to tepotinib. This study highlights the promising potential of using repurposed drugs and phytocompounds as potential LSD therapeutics. However, extensive validation through in vitro and in vivo testing and clinical trials is crucial for their practical application.

AB  - Elephants face diverse threats from human activities and use temporal and social strategies to reduce human-induced mortality risk. We used data from camera trap surveys in 2018-2019 (n = 1625 independent detection events from 11,751 sampling days) to investigate elephant responses to anthropogenic risk in the Ruaha-Rungwa ecosystem, Tanzania. The study was conducted in one low-risk and three high-risk sites using 26-40 paired camera trap stations per site. Risk influenced the active periods, use of roads and water sources, social associations and behaviour of elephants. Elephants demonstrated significantly more night-time and reduced daytime activity in the high-risk sites relative to the low-risk site. This higher night-time activity in the high-risk sites was observed for both males and females, though it was more pronounced for cow-calf groups than lone males. Foraging events and use of water sources were more frequent at night in the high-risk sites. Elephants used roads as movement routes in the low-risk site but avoided roads in the high-risk sites. Males were significantly more likely to associate with other males and cow-calf groups in the high-risk sites. Fewer occurrences of relaxed behaviours were observed in the high-risk sites compared to the low-risk site. We discuss the potential implications of our findings for elephant survival and reproduction.

AB  - Neurosteroids are synthesized locally in the brain, where they can modify neuronal functionality depending on the physiological state. A high correlation was demonstrated between the increasing activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and allopregnanolone (AL) concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid in sheep during pregnancy. Therefore, the present study tested the hypothesis that blocking neurosteroid synthesis in the brain of a pregnant sheep would affect HPA axis activity under both basal and stressful conditions. Two groups of sheep in the fourth month of gestation (n = 7 each) were subjected to the following treatments: 1) intracerebroventricular (icv) infusion of vehicle for three days (C) and then icv infusion of finasteride (a total of 100 mu g/240 mu L/day) for three days (F), one week apart, and 2) icy infusion of vehicle for three days and application of stressful stimuli (isolation and partial movement restriction) on the third day (S), and subsequently icv infusion of finasteride for three days and application of stressful stimuli on the third day (SF), one week apart. On the third days of the experiment, a 4-h push-pull perfusion of the infundibular nucleus/median eminence and blood sampling were performed. Mean perfusate corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), plasma adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) and cortisol concentrations were significantly higher in sheep treated with finasteride, stress and finasteride in combination with stress compared to controls. The highest hormone concentrations in Groups F, S and SF, were recorded during the first 60 min; however, significant increases in CRH and ACTH levels were observed in Group SF towards the end of the experiment. It can be concluded that neurosteroids may be an essential component of the mechanism controlling HPA axis activity in pregnant sheep, not only under stress-free conditions, but more importantly, also by inhibiting the neuroendocrine response to stressors.

AB  - Oocyte quality is crucial for determining the subsequent embryo developmental capacity and reproductive outcomes. However, aging is detrimental to oocyte quality. Previous studies have demonstrated that soy isoflavones have positive effects on the reproductive performance of female pigs. Equol, the primary metabolite of soy isoflavones, is renowned for its antioxidant properties and its ability to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, the potential role of equol in reversing aging-mediated oocyte decline has not yet been elucidated. In this study, we treated the porcine oocytes with different concentrations of equol (2.5, 5 and 10 mu M) during prolonged in vitro culture. Our findings showed that aging led to decreased embryonic developmental capacity, indicating the decline of oocyte quality. We further found that aging disrupted spindle assembly and chromosome arrangement, impaired actin polymerisation and reduced mitochondrial activity and function. Moreover, aging increased ROS levels; thereafter, DNA damage and apoptosis was induced in the porcine oocytes. Interestingly, treatment with 2.5 mu M equol during the aging process significantly mitigated the above-mentioned defective parameters in porcine oocytes and finally improved embryo development rates. Collectively, these results imply that equol has potential benefits in attenuating the aging-mediated defects on porcine oocytes.

AB  - This study documents the recolonization of the wolf using opportunistic and systematic data, including camera trapping and scat surveys in south-eastern Italy. Wolf distribution was mapped using a 10 x 10 km grid, and Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) were applied to identify environmental and anthropogenic drivers of stable presence. Camera trapping and scat analyses were used to provide the first insights into the activity patterns and feeding habits of the species. The results showed a significant expansion in wolf range, with occurrence increasing by 120%, especially in areas with high forest cover. During 1402 camera-trap nights, wolves and wild prey species displayed primarily nocturnal activity, reducing overlap with human presence, though prey activity peaks were offset from those of wolves. Diet analysis of 75 scats revealed a high occurrence of livestock and pets, along with all wild species living in the area (i.e., ungulates, medium-sized and micromammals). These findings underscore the wolf's ecological adaptability and ability to thrive in heavily altered landscapes. Indeed, this study shows how wolves were able to occupy even suboptimal areas, taking advantage of both anthropogenic and wild trophic resources, still displaying nocturnal activity to lower the probability of encounters with humans.

AB  - Simple Summary PRRSV is one of the important pathogens that seriously affects the pig industry. Sichuan is a major pig breeding province in China and lacks long-term continuous surveillance of PRRSV infection in pigs. In this study, the prevalence of PRRSV in Sichuan was investigated based on a total of 539 samples of tissues, blood and aborted fetuses from 13 pig breeding areas in Sichuan. The genetic diversity of the virus currently circulating in Sichuan during 2012-2020 was studied by analyzing the genetic variation of Nsp2 and ORF5 genes. The detection results indicated that PRRSV was ubiquitous in the swine production in Sichuan, with 52.32% positive rate. Phylogenetic analysis of ORF5s showed that the PRRSV strains sequenced in this study belonged to PRRSV-1 and PRRSV-2 (lineage 1.5, 1.8, 3.5, 5.1 and 8.7). The data available in this study suggested that the genomes of prevalent PRRSV strains were complex and diverse. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is an important pathogen that poses a serious threat to the global pig industry. Sichuan Province is one of the largest pig breeding provinces in China. There is a lack of reports on the continuous surveillance and systematic analysis of prevalent strains of PRRSV in Sichuan Province in recent years. To fill this gap, a total of 539 samples were collected from 13 breeding regions in Sichuan during 2012-2020. The detection result showed that the positive rate of PRRSV was 52.32% (282/539). The ORF5s and Nsp2 were obtained and further analyzed, with Chinese reference strains downloaded from the GenBank. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the PRRSV strains sequenced in this study belonged to PRRSV-1 and PRRSV-2 (lineage 1, 3, 5 and 8). In total, 168 PRRSV-2 strains were selected for ORF5 analyses, and these strains were classified into sub-lineage 8.7 (HP-PRRSV), sub-lineage 5.1 (classical PRRSV), sub-lineage 1.8 (NADC30-like), sub-lineage 1.5 (NADC34-like) and sub-lineage 3.5 (QYYZ-like), accounting for 60.71% (102/168), 11.31% (19/168), 18.45% (31/168), 2.97% (5/168) and 6.55% (11/168) of the total analyzed strains, respectively. The Nsp2 of identified PRRSV strains exhibited a nucleotide identity of 44.5-100%, and an amino acid identity of 46.82-100%. The ORF5 of the identified PRRSV strains exhibited a nucleotide identity of 81.3-100%, and an amino acid identity of 78.5-100%. A sequence analysis of ORF5 revealed that the mutation sites of GP5 were mainly concentrated in HVR1 and HVR2 and the virulence sites. In summary, the HP-PRRSV, NADC30-like PRRSV, Classic-PRRSV, QYYZ-like PRRSV, NADC34-like PRRSV and PRRSV-1 strains exist simultaneously in pigs in Sichuan. NADC30-like PRRSV was gradually becoming the most prevalent genotype currently in Sichuan province. This study suggested that PRRSV strains in Sichuan were undergoing genomic divergence.

AB  - African swine fever (ASF) is an acute, severe and hemorrhagic infectious disease caused by African swine fever virus (ASFV) infecting domestic pigs and wild boars. Since the outbreak of the disease in China in 2018, it has brought a great impact on China's pig industry. Classical swine fever (CSF) is an acute contact infectious disease of pigs caused by classical swine fever virus (CSFV) infection. Clinically, acute CSF usually shows persistent high fever, anorexia, extensive congestion and bleeding of the skin and mucosa, which are similar to ASF. It is of great significance to prevent, control and accurately detect ASF and CSF in pig farms. In this study, Recombinase aided amplification (RAA) technology combined with a nucleic acid test strip (RAA-strip) was established for simple and specific detection of ASFV/CSFV. The sensitivity and preliminary clinical application results showed that the RAA test strip established in this study could detect recombinant plasmids containing ASFV/CSFV gene fragments as low as 10(3) copies/mu L. The minimum detection limits of virus DNA/cDNA were 10 and 12 pg respectively, and there was no cross-reaction with other porcine viruses. The specificity of the method was good. We used 37-42 clinical samples to evaluate the performance of our established method, and the positive concordance rates with conventional PCR were 94.1 and 57.1%, respectively. In addition, ASFV and CSFV double RAA agarose gel electrophoresis detection methods were established. The results showed that the method had good specificity. The detection limit of this method is 10(6) copies for ASFV p72 gene recombinant plasmid and 10(5) copies for CSFV NS5B Gene recombinant plasmid. The use of this method for clinical material detection was consistent with the PCR method. In summary, the developed method of RAA-strip assay for ASFV and CSFV realized the visual detection of pathogens, and the developed method of dual RAA agarose gel electrophoresis assay for ASFV and CSFV realized the simultaneous detection of two pathogens in one reaction, with good specificity, high sensitivity and rapid reaction rate, which was expected to be clinically feasible for the differential diagnosis of ASF and CSF provided technical support.

AB  - The objective of the present study was to investigate the association among the largest follicle (LF), preovulatory estradiol (E2), and predominant vaginal epithelial cell at the completion of hormonal ovarian stimulation for fixed-time artificial insemination (FTAI) in goats. Thirty-seven crossbred Boer does received gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and intravaginal progesterone (P4)-releasing devices (day 0). On day 5, P4 devices were removed and does received prostaglandin F-2 alpha and equine chorionic gonadotrophin. On day 7, does received GnRH, and FTAI was undertaken. On day 7, does were divided into three groups, i.e. small-sized (3-3.9 mm; n = 5), medium-sized (4-4.9 mm; n = 8), and large-sized (>= 5 mm; n = 24) according to the diameter of the ovarian LF; follicular characteristics (number and diameter) were identified, and blood samples and vaginal smears were collected. The average diameters of total antral follicles and LF and the percentage of superficial cell were greatest in large-sized LF does (p < .01). The average diameters of total antral follicle (r = .68) and LF (r = .71), number of preovulatory follicle (r = .58), and plasma E2 concentrations (r = .61) were positively correlated with the percentage of superficial cells (p < .01). The likelihood of a pregnancy outcome after the FTAI increased by 13.71 times in does with a greater average diameter of antral follicle, 14.18 times with emergence of a large preovulatory follicle, and 36.83 times with a higher percentage of vaginal superficial cells (p < .01). It was concluded that there is a relationship between the cell types of the vaginal epithelium, the diameters of the largest ovarian follicles, and the concentration of E2 in goats subjected to FTAI protocols.<br />

AB  - Using two-dimensional electrophoresis along with mass spectroscopy, we have investigated how the cryopreservation process affected the protein profile of goat ejaculated sperm. In this study, five bucks were used for semen collection. After removal of seminal plasma, the Tris-based extender containing glycerol and egg yolk was used to freeze semen. The results indicated that the post-thaw sperm quality showed a significant reduction compared with fresh sperm. The numbers of protein spots acquired in fresh and post-thaw sperm were 2926 +/- 57 and 3061 +/- 81, respectively. Twenty-two different abundant proteins (DAPs) were identified between fresh sperm and frozen-thawed sperm (>= 3.0-folds, p < 0.05). The abundances of 19 proteins were significantly higher in the fresh sperm than the post-thaw sperm. The results of the gene ontology annotation showed the primary location of the DAPs on sperm cytoskeleton, protein complex, cytoplasm, and mitochondria. In addition, these proteins were mainly involved in ion binding, small molecular metabolic processes, structure molecule activity, guanosine triphosphatase activity, oxidoreductase activity, and protein complex assembly. The interaction networks among these DAPs demonstrated that they may play roles in oxidoreductase activity, structure, acrosomal function, and motility of sperm. Collectively, the proteome of goat sperm was altered during the cryopreservation process, demonstrating that protein modification induced by cryopreservation may be associated with the reduced quality of goat sperm after thawing.

AB  - Rhizoctonia solani anastomosis group (AG) 3-PT is a devastating pathogenic fungus that causes several diseases in potatoes both in South Africa and globally. The removal of various fungicides from the market and strict regulations on the use of synthetic chemicals make disease management difficult. Therefore, alternative, environmentally safe control measures are being considered, such as the use of biological control agents (BCAs). BCAs are an attractive alternative for improving plant and soil health of economically important crops. To identify key microbial indicators of disease suppression against R. solani AG 3-PT, a greenhouse pot trial experiment was conducted using soil from a potato-growing region in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. High-throughput sequencing of fungal internal transcribed spacer and bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA was used to characterize the respective fungal and bacterial community composition in the soil with and without artificial inoculation with R. solani AG 3-PT. Results indicated that the pathogen caused dysbiosis in the potato soil microbiome, leading to a shift in fungal and bacterial community composition. Differentially abundant microbial taxa in R. solani AG 3-PT inoculated soils suggest a promising potential for disease-suppressive activity. Network analysis also confirmed the presence of key taxa involved in the microbial community shifts, which could support their role in the suppression of R. solani AG 3-PT. The identification of key microbial indicators against Rhizoctonia diseases can contribute to the development of environmentally sustainable potato production systems, which are particularly important considering the implementation of the European Green Deal.

AB  - Ticks carry a range of pathogens, the best known of which causes Lyme disease, prevalent in the northeastern United States. Emerging diseases do not yet consist of a wide range of Lyme diseases, raising the question of how long it takes for a newly introduced tick-borne disease to establish itself. The aim of this study was to address this question, with the agent of Lyme disease used as the test case. A prior process-based model of the Ixodes scapularis (Say 1821) life cycle and the transmission of Borrelia burgdorferi (Burgdorfer 1982) between this tick and its various hosts was used to predict the dynamics of disease introduction into a new area. The importance of temperature, infection probabilities, and tick host populations, relative to that of other factors, was established by a global sensitivity analysis using Latin hypercube sampling. The results of those samples were analyzed to determine the time to near-equilibrium. Eight locations in New Hampshire were chosen for high/low temperature, high/low mouse, and high/low deer values. Mammal abundance was estimated by relating the known mammal density from previous studies to a MaxEnt analysis output. The time required to reach Borrelia endemicity in the ticks of New Hampshire ranged from 8 to 20 years in regions where the tick population is viable, with a strong dependency on susceptible tick host populations.

AB  - Overfishing, capture mortality, and consequences following the release of surviving animals represent severe threats to chondrichthyans. Although holocephalans are common bycaught and discarded species, other than postrelease mortality, little is known of fishing capture stress impacts. The stress response elicited after capture, essential to increase survival chances, is energetically demanding and affects the amount of energy available for other biological activities, with potential long-term impairments. We measured the effect of 30-min simulated gillnet capture on oxygen uptake rate ((M) over dotO(2)), a proxy for metabolic rate and energy use, on recovery pattern, and on swimming activity of elephant fish (Callorhinchus milii). Immediately after simulated capture, Active and Inactive (M) over dotO(2), measured during swimming and resting periods, respectively, were 27.5% and 43.1% lower than precapture values. This metabolic decline is likely an adaptation for reducing the energy allocated to non-essential activities, thus preserving it to sustain the stress response and processes essential for immediate survival. Supporting this, after gillnet capture, animals decreased their swimming time by 26.6%, probably due to a reduction in the energy allocated to movement. After 7 days, swimming activity and both Inactive (M) over dotO(2) and Active (M) over dotO(2) returned to precapture values. Although metabolic decline may enhance survival chances, the associated decreased swimming activity might increase predation risk and slow the physiological recovery after a fishing event. Moreover, some of the activities involved in Inactive (M) over dotO(2) are fundamental for life maintenance and therefore its depression after a capture event might have long-term repercussions for life sustenance and health.

AB  - Simple Summary Non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) can reduce performance in pigs due to their deleterious effects on the gastrointestinal tracts of these animals. Corn and soybean meal are the most common ingredients in pig diets, and they contain 6-17% NSP. Soy also contains an amount of beta-mannans, which can cause unnecessary and chronic immune stimulation in pigs. This study evaluated whether adding beta-mannanase alone (BM) or in combination with a multi-carbohydrase complex (BM + MCC) improves diet digestibility, nutrient and energy metabolism, and gut health in growing pigs. The results showed that the addition of BM and BM + MCC significantly improved dry matter, protein, and energy digestibility, as well as protein and energy metabolizability, compared to the control. Higher nitrogen retention and lower fecal energy were observed in the BM and BM + MCC groups. There was a significant reduction in manure production and fecal moisture with the addition of the enzymes. BM supplementation increased the villus area and villus height-to-crypt depth ratio. Both the BM and BM + MCC diets reduced the fecal calprotectin levels. In conclusion, the use of beta-mannanase alone or in combination with a multi-carbohydrase complex improved the nutritional digestibility, nutrient and energy metabolism, and gut health in growing pigs, and they also contributed to reducing manure production in the test animals. Abstract (1) Background: This study was performed to evaluate whether the addition of beta-mannanase alone or combined with a multi-carbohydrase complex can improve diet digestibility, nutrient and energy metabolism, and the gut health of growing pigs. (2) Methods: Twenty-four pigs (35.56 +/- 3.81 kg) were fed a control corn-soybean meal-based diet (no addition) or a control diet with beta-mannanase (BM; 300 g/ton) or control diet beta-mannanase plus a multi-carbohydrase complex including xylanase, beta-glucanase, and arabinofuranosidases (BM + MCC; 300 + 50 g/ton) for 13 days. Total fecal and urine samples were collected from days 6 to 12. The feces samples were collected from all the pigs to determine fecal biomarkers using commercial ELISA tests. Blood samples were collected from all the pigs on day 13 to assess the serum concentrations of acute-phase proteins. All the pigs were euthanized on day 13 for intestinal tissue collection for morphometric analysis. Data were submitted to variance analysis and differences were considered significant at p <= 0.05 and a trend for 0.05 < p <= 0.10. (3) Results: The addition of BM and BM + MCC resulted in greater dry matter, protein, and energy digestibility coefficients, and protein (2.87% and 2.60%) and energy (2.61% and 1.44%) metabolizability coefficients compared to control (p < 0.05). A greater retention of nitrogen ratio and lower fecal energy were observed in BM and BM + MCC than in the control (p < 0.01). Furthermore, the addition of BM and BM + MCC resulted in lower manure production (29.78 and 49.77%, respectively) and fecal moisture (p < 0.001) compared to the control. The BM addition resulted in a greater villus area and villi height to crypt depth ratio compared to the control (p < 0.05). The addition of BM and BM + MCC diets also reduced the fecal calprotectin levels by 52 and 56% in relation to the control pigs. (4) Conclusions: The use of beta-mannanase alone or associated with multi-carbohydrase complex improved nutritional digestibility, nutrient and energy metabolism, and gut health, and reduced the manure production of growing pigs.

AB  - Carnivorous reptiles exhibit an intense metabolic increment during digestion, which is accompanied by several cardiovascular adjustments responsible for meeting the physiological demands of the gastrointestinal system. Postprandial tachycardia, a well-documented phenomenon in these animals, is mediated by the withdrawal of vagal tone associated with the chronotropic effects of non-adrenergic and non-cholinergic (NANC) factors. However, herbivorous reptiles exhibit a modest metabolic increment during digestion and there is no information about postprandial cardiovascular adjustments. Considering the significant impact of feeding characteristics on physiological responses, we investigated cardiovascular and metabolic responses, as well as the neurohumoral mechanisms of cardiac control, in the herbivorous lizard Iguana iguana during digestion. We measured oxygen consumption rate ( _VO2), heart rate (fH), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), myocardial activity, cardiac autonomic tone, fH/MAP variability and baroreflex efficiency in both fasting and digesting animals before and after parasympathetic blockade with atropine followed by double autonomic blockade with atropine and propranolol. Our results revealed that the peak of _VO2 in iguanas was reached 24 h after feeding, accompanied by an increase in myocardial activity and a subtle tachycardia mediated exclusively by a reduction in cardiac parasympathetic activity. This represents the first reported case of postprandial tachycardia in digesting reptiles without the involvement of NANC factors. Furthermore, this withdrawal of vagal stimulation during digestion may reduce the regulatory range for shortterm fH adjustments, subsequently intensifying the blood pressure variability as a consequence of limiting baroreflex efficiency.

AB  - Deer tendon, a deer processing byproduct, is an excellent protein source for the preparation of peptides for improving osteoporosis by its high protein content and high nutritional value. The optimal process of collagen acid extraction was implemented and the results showed that the acid concentration was 7%, the material-liquid ratio was 1:25, and the soaking time was 48 h. DTCHs could promote MC3T3-E1 cell proliferation and increase alkaline phosphatase activities in vitro. In addition, compared with the model group, the DTCHs treatment groups with an oral dosage of 350, 750, and 1500 mg/kg rat/day could significantly improve the shape, weight, bone mechanics, and alkaline phosphatase activities of tail-suspended mice. Bone microstructure and mineralization also recovered significantly in vivo. This result is expected to provide the structural and biological information for DTCHs-based functional foods.

AB  - Simple Summary Neuregulin is a growth factor that has been shown to prevent adverse remodeling in the heart and may represent a therapeutic for patients with systolic heart failure. A common symptom in heart failure is shortness of breath, which has been related in part to impaired skeletal muscle function. Since neuregulin directly activates skeletal muscle, in addition to heart tissue, we hypothesized that neuregulin might directly affect intercostal muscle gene expression changes in heart disease. We tested this hypothesis by performing global gene expression analysis of intercostal muscle tissue collected from pigs treated with recombinant neuregulin after the induction of myocardial infarction, an experimental model clinically similar to a human heart attack. We found that neuregulin-treated pigs had massive changes in global gene expression consistent with new muscle cell formation, as compared to untreated pigs. These data suggest that neuregulin is an important mediator of muscle function that can potentially be used to study heart disease-associated muscle dysfunction and the development of new therapeutics aimed at muscle repair in heart failure, as well as other diseases associated with muscle dysfunction and weakness. Neuregulin-1 beta (NRG-1 beta) is a growth and differentiation factor with pleiotropic systemic effects. Because NRG-1 beta has therapeutic potential for heart failure and has known growth effects in skeletal muscle, we hypothesized that it might affect heart failure-associated cachexia, a severe co-morbidity characterized by a loss of muscle mass. We therefore assessed NRG-1 beta's effect on intercostal skeletal muscle gene expression in a swine model of heart failure using recombinant glial growth factor 2 (USAN-cimaglermin alfa), a version of NRG-1 beta that has been tested in humans with systolic heart failure. Animals received one of two intravenous doses (0.67 or 2 mg/kg) of NRG-1 beta bi-weekly for 4 weeks, beginning one week after infarct. Based on paired-end RNA sequencing, NRG-1 beta treatment altered the intercostal muscle gene expression of 581 transcripts, including genes required for myofiber growth, maintenance and survival, such as MYH3, MYHC, MYL6B, KY and HES1. Importantly, NRG-1 beta altered the directionality of at least 85 genes associated with cachexia, including myostatin, which negatively regulates myoblast differentiation by down-regulating MyoD expression. Consistent with this, MyoD was increased in NRG-1 beta-treated animals. In vitro experiments with myoblast cell lines confirmed that NRG-1 beta induces ERBB-dependent differentiation. These findings suggest a NRG-1 beta-mediated anti-atrophic, anti-cachexia effect that may provide additional benefits to this potential therapy in heart failure.

AB  - Background Humans impose a significant pressure on large herbivore populations, such as hippopotami, through hunting, poaching, and habitat destruction. Anthropogenic pressures can also occur indirectly, such as artificial lake creation and the subsequent introduction of invasive species that alter the ecosystem. These events can lead to drastic changes in parasite diversity and transmission, but generally receive little scientific attention. Results In order to document and identify trematode parasites of the common hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius) in artificial water systems of Zimbabwe, we applied an integrative taxonomic approach, combining molecular diagnostics and morphometrics on archived and new samples. In doing so, we provide DNA reference sequences of the hippopotamus liver fluke Fasciola nyanzae, enabling us to construct the first complete Fasciola phylogeny. We describe parasite spillback of F. nyanzae by the invasive freshwater snail Pseudosuccinea columella, as a consequence of a cascade of biological invasions in Lake Kariba, one of the biggest artificial lakes in the world. Additionally, we report an unknown stomach fluke of the hippopotamus transmitted by the non-endemic snail Radix aff. plicatula, an Asian snail species that has not been found in Africa before, and the stomach fluke Carmyerius cruciformis transmitted by the native snail Bulinus truncatus. Finally, Biomphalaria pfeifferi and two Bulinus species were found as new snail hosts for the poorly documented hippopotamus blood fluke Schistosoma edwardiense. Conclusions Our findings indicate that artificial lakes are breeding grounds for endemic and non-endemic snails that transmit trematode parasites of the common hippopotamus. This has important implications, as existing research links trematode parasite infections combined with other stressors to declining wild herbivore populations. Therefore, we argue that monitoring the anthropogenic impact on parasite transmission should become an integral part of wildlife conservation efforts.

AB  - In regulating cellular plasticity, epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), and tumor progression across a broad range of cancer types, the Hippo signaling pathway depends on YAP (Yes-associated protein) and TAZ (transcriptional coactivator with PDZ binding motif) as core effectors. This pathway can become dysregulated, disrupting tissue homeostasis and promoting oncogenic processes such as metastasis, immune evasion, and therapy resistance. This review explores the multifaceted roles of YAP/TAZ in lung, breast, ovarian, liver, and renal cancers, detailing their interactions with key signaling pathways such as TGF-beta, Wnt, and PI3K/AKT and their modulation by mechanical cues like extracellular matrix stiffness and fluid shear stress. Potential YAP/TAZ mediated therapy resistance in EGFR TKI-resistant lung cancer and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer and the impact this has on tumor metabolism as a result of YAP/TAZ controlling tumor mesenchymal stem cells in the hypoxic environment of hepatocellular carcinoma is highlighted. Additionally, we discuss their role in maintaining cancer stem cell traits, creating an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, and driving chemoresistance in breast and renal cancers. Small molecule inhibitors, natural compounds (luteolin, apigenin, honokiol), and novel agents (nanoparticles of zinc oxide) are discussed as promising routes for disrupting YAP/TAZ. The review underscores the complexity of YAP/TAZ signaling and the need for patient stratification based on their expression levels to optimize targeted therapies.

AB  - HT-2 toxin is a mycotoxin commonly found in food and water that can have adverse effects on male reproductive systems, including testosterone secretion. Ferroptosis and apoptosis are two types of programmed cell death that have been implicated in the regulation of cellular functions. Melatonin, a powerful antioxidant with various physiological functions, has been shown to regulate testosterone secretion. However, the mechanisms underlying the protective effects of melatonin against HT-2 toxin-induced damage in testosterone secretion are not fully understood. In this study, we investigated the effects of HT-2 toxin on sheep Leydig cells and the potential protective role of melatonin. We found that HT-2 toxin inhibited cell proliferation and testosterone secretion of Leydig cells in a dose-dependent manner and induced ferroptosis and apoptosis through intracellular reactive oxygen species accumulation, leading to lipid peroxidation. Exposure of Leydig cells to melatonin in vitro reversed the defective phenotypes caused by HT-2 toxin via a glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase/glutathionedependent mechanism. Interference of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase disrupted the beneficial effect of melatonin on ferroptosis and apoptosis in HT-2 toxin-treated Leydig cells. Furthermore, similar results were observed in vivo in the testes of male mice injected with HT-2 toxin with or without melatonin treatment for 30 days. Our findings suggest that melatonin inhibits ferroptosis and apoptosis by elevating the expression of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase to eliminate reactive oxygen species accumulation in HT-2 toxin-treated Leydig cells. These results provide fundamental evidence for eliminating the adverse effects of HT-2 toxin on male reproduction.

AB  - This study evaluated the effects of dietary probiotic-fermented corn wet distillers grains (FCWDGs) on finishing pigs. Three Bacillus subtilis strains (CGMCC21218, CCTCC2022073, and CICC10275) were used to ferment corn wet distillers grains, yielding FCWDGs-1, FCWDGs-2, and FCWDGs-3. A total of 128 130-day-old Anqing six white pigs were randomly assigned to four groups: a control group and groups supplemented with 6% FCWDGs-1 (T1), FCWDGs-2 (T2), and FCWDGs-3 (T3). Over a 60-day trial, FCWDGs significantly enhanced growth performance, with T1 and T3 groups showing higher final weight and average daily gain (ADG) compared to the control (p < 0.05), and feed-to-gain ratios were reduced in all treatments (p < 0.05). Loin muscle depth (LMD) was significantly greater in all treatments (p < 0.05), and the lean meat percentage (LMP) was significantly higher in the T1 group (p < 0.05). Antioxidant activity (T-AOC, SOD, and GSH-Px) was enhanced in all treatments, with the highest values observed in the T1 group (p < 0.05). Notably, FCWDGs reduced heavy-metal residues (As, Pb, Cu) in muscle, liver, and kidney tissues, particularly in the T1 group. The results highlight the potential of Bacillus subtilis-fermented FCWDGs to enhance growth performance and carcass traits, and reduce heavy metal accumulation in pig tissues.

AB  - Lipids from milk are important nutritional components, although their health effects, especially for animal milks, are still questioned. Four types of commercial milks, two semi-skimmed animal milks (bovine and goat) and two vegetable ones (soy and rice), along with their total and free lipid fractions recovered by sequential centrifugation or by ethyl acetate extraction, respectively, have been analyzed. A higher antioxidant ability, reported as Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity, was found for all raw milks compared to that of rice. This trend was confirmed, except for soy milk, as ROS reduction in Caco-2 cells. The free lipid fraction was shown to have the highest antioxidant potential in both chemical and biological tests. Moreover, goat and soy raw milks positively regulated Caco-2 cell viability after an inflammatory stimulus. This effect was lost when their total lipid fraction was tested. Finally, only the free lipid fraction from rice milk preserved the Caco-2 viability after LPS stimulation. Our data demonstrated that the lipid profile of each milk, characterized by GC-MS analysis, could contribute to dictate its biological effects, and, although additional in vitro and in vivo studies are needed, they could support the literature re-evaluating the health effects of animal-based versus plant-based milks in the intestinal cellular model.

AB  - This study investigated the ameliorating effects of a natural antioxidant formula (NAF) consisting of Ginkgo biloba leaf extract, docosahexaenoic acid/eicosapentaenoic acid, ferulic acid, flaxseed oil, vitamin E, and vitamin B12 on a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cognitive dysfunction model in rats. Six-week-old rats received a diet containing 0.5% (w/w) NAF for 38 days from Day 1, and LPS (1 mg/kg body weight) was administered intraperitoneally once daily on Days 8 and 10. On Day 11, LPS alone increased interleukin-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex and the numbers of M1-type microglia/macrophages and GFAP+ reactive astrocytes in the hilus of the hippocampal dentate gyrus. NAF treatment decreased brain proinflammatory cytokine levels and increased the number of M2-type microglia/macrophages. During Days 34-38, LPS alone impaired fear memory acquisition and the extinction learning process, and NAF facilitated fear extinction learning. On Day 38, LPS alone decreased the number of type-3 neural progenitor cells in the hippocampal neurogenic niche, and NAF restored the number of type-3 neural progenitor cells and increased the numbers of both immature granule cells in the neurogenic niche and reelin+ hilar interneurons. Thus, NAF exhibited antiinflammatory effects and ameliorated LPS-induced adverse effects on hippocampal neurogenesis and fear memory learning, possibly through amplification of reelin signaling by hilar interneurons. These results suggest that neuroinflammation is a key factor in the development of LPS-induced impairment of fear memory learning, and supplementation with NAF in the present study helped to prevent hippocampal neurogenesis and disruptive neurobehaviors caused by neuroinflammation.

AB  - This study was aimed to assessing haematological parameters in pigs of different age categories from six farms differing in the presence or absence of selected pathogens. The following categories were included: 5 age groups of growers, fatteners and breeding sows. Individual blood samples for determining complete blood count and white blood cell differential count were taken. Group samples of oral fluid and faeces were collected from each farm and tested for detection of Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Virus (PRRSV), Porcine Circovirus Type 2 (PCV2), and Hepatitis E Virus (HEV) using PCR, RT-PCR, and qRT-PCR protocols. On farms free of PRRSV, PCV2 and HEV, the age of pigs had significant effect on: white blood cell count (WBC), haemoglobin concentration (Hb), mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration, platelet count (PLT), percentage of neutrophils, lymphocytes and eosinophils and absolute numbers of neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, basophils and 'large unstained cells' (LUCs). On positive farms all observed blood parameters except the percentage of LUCs were significantly affected by the age. The percentages of lymphocytes, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and haematocrit were significantly lowered by PRRSV, while WBC, PLT, percentage and absolute numbers of neutrophils, basophils and LUCs were increased. Nine-week-old pigs with PCV2 had significantly lower red blood cell count, PLT, percentage and absolute numbers of monocytes and LUCs, and significantly higher MCV, MCH, percentage of neutrophils and percentage and absolute number of eosinophils than 9-week-old pigs with PCV2 and HEV. Age-related changes in haematological parameters occurred in PCR negative and positive farms.

AB  - Interoceptive fear, which is shaped by associative threat learning and memory processes, plays a central role in abnormal interoception and psychiatric comorbidity in conditions of the gut-brain axis. Although animal and human studies support that acute inflammation induces brain alterations in the central fear network, mechanistic knowledge in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions remains sparse. We implemented a translational fear conditioning paradigm to elucidate central fear network reactivity in patients with quiescent inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), compared to patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and healthy controls (HC). Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, conditioned differential neural responses within regions of the fear network were analyzed during acquisition and extinction learning. In contrast to HC and IBS, IBD patients demonstrated distinctly altered engagement of key regions of the central fear network, including amygdala and hippocampus, during differential interoceptive fear learning, with more pronounced responses to conditioned safety relative to pain-predictive cues. Aberrant hippocampal responses correlated with chronic stress exclusively in IBD. During extinction, differential engagement was observed in IBD compared to IBS patients within amygdala, ventral anterior insula, and thalamus. No group differences were found in changes of cue valence as a behavioral measure of fear acquisition and extinction. Together, the disease-specific alterations in neural responses during interoceptive fear conditioning in quiescent IBD suggest persisting effects of recurring intestinal inflammation on central fear network reactivity. Given the crucial role of interoceptive fear in abnormal interoception, these findings point towards inflammation-related brain alterations as one trajectory to bodily symptom chronicity and psychiatric comorbidity. Patients with inflammatory conditions of the gut-brain axis may benefit from tailored treatment approaches targeting maladaptive interoceptive fear.

AB  - The objective of this research was to investigate the efficacy of lotus leaf in the prevention and treatment of inflammatory diarrhea in pigs, utilizing network pharmacology and in vitro methodologies. Initially, LC-MS was employed to analyze the constituents of lotus leaf extract (LLE); then, the TCMSP database was utilized to identify the active components and their corresponding targets. The GeneCards database was consulted to identify disease-related targets pertinent to inflammatory diarrhea in pigs. A drug ingredient-disease target network was constructed using Cytoscape software. Subsequently, the STRING database facilitated protein interaction analysis, which was also visualized through Cytoscape. Gene Ontology (GO) functional annotation and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis were conducted based on the genes shared between disease and LLE targets. Molecular docking of the active ingredients with key targets was performed using Autodock Vina. Subsequently, an in vitro LPS-induced inflammation model was established using IPEC-J2 cells to validate the predictions made through network pharmacology. Verification was conducted via flow cytometry and Western blot analysis. The LC-MS assay and TCMSP retrieval results revealed that Quercetin, Nuciferine, Kaempferol, Leucodelphinidin, and Catechin were identified as the main compounds of LLE, associated with 181 potential targets. A total of 5995 targets were linked to inflammatory diarrhea in pigs, with 159 overlapping targets identified between the bioactive compounds and the disease. Notable key targets included TNF-alpha, IL-6, caspase-3, TP53, and AKT, which are integral to inflammation and apoptosis processes. GO functional annotation indicated significant enrichment in biological processes such as gene expression regulation and transcription from RNA polymerase II promoters. KEGG pathway analysis highlighted critical pathways, including TNF signaling and apoptosis. Furthermore, molecular docking analyses demonstrated that the bioactive components of lotus leaf exhibited a strong binding affinity for essential targets, including AKT1, BAX, caspase-3, CCL2, IL-6, IL-10, MPK14, NOS3, PTGS1, and TNF-alpha. In vitro experiments confirmed that LLE significantly inhibited LPS-induced apoptosis in IPEC-J2 cells and suppressed the activation of the TNF-alpha-mediated apoptosis pathway. This study offers novel insights into the therapeutic potential of Chinese medicine and its constituents in addressing inflammatory diarrhea in pigs.

AB  - Acne vulgaris is an inflammatory skin condition of the pilosebaceous unit associated with the colonization of Cutibacterium acnes. One of the problems when using antibiotic creams is antibiotic molecules cannot penetrate the stratum corneum layer of the skin, which acts as a barrier for the molecules. To overcome this problem, a transdermal patch with micron-size needles was developed. This research aimed to fabricate a sodium alginate (S)-gelatin (G) microneedles patch containing clindamycin for acne treatment. The S-G microneedles containing different amounts (i.e., 6, 8, and 10 mu mol/L) of the clindamycin hydrochloride were prepared. Their mechanical properties, densities, and release patterns were investigated. The composition of gelatin increased the average force and density of the S-G microneedles. While, the addition of clindamycin hydrochloride did not affect their mechanical properties. The released amount of clindamycin increased with increasing the loading quantity within S-G microneedles. The S-G microneedles successfully penetrated the pig cadaver skin. Lastly, these clindamycin-loaded S-G microneedles could inhibit the growth of C. acnes and were non-toxic to normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF) cells. Thus, the S-G microneedles patch had the potential for use in acne treatment.

AB  - Camellia yuhsienensis was used to cross with Camellia oleifera to improve the resistance of oil camellia anthracnose. However, unilateral cross-incompatibility (UCI) between C. oleifera and C. yuhsienensis was found during the breeding process. Five C.oleifera cultivars and four C. uhsienensis materials were tested to confirm the UCI between C. oleifera and C. yuhsienensis. 'Huashuo' (HS) and 'Youza 2' (YZ2) were used to represent these two species to characterize the UCI, including pollen tube growth, fertilization and fruit development. The results demonstrated that UCI was prevalent between C. oleifera and C. yuhsienensis. The asynchronous flowering period was a pre-pollination barrier that limited mating between these two species under natural conditions. Interspecific pollen tubes were observed through the styles of these two plants, though the growth rates differed considerably. At 96 hours after pollination, the pollen tube of YZ2 barely entered the ovule, but remained at the base of the style and became swollen. However, the HS pollen tube entered the ovule 48 hours after pollination, double fertilization was observed, and the fruit and seeds developed commonly. Relative to compatible combinations, most unfertilized ovules in incompatible combinations failed to grow, turned brown 150 days after pollination, and the fruits were smaller than expected with uneven enlargement. Investigations on both semi-in vivo and in vitro pollen tubes gave us new idea for thought: the HS style has a stronger inhibitory effect on the interspecific pollen tubes, while calcium alleviates the inhibitory of styles but failed to prevent the appearance of abnormal pollen tube morphology. This study provides useful information on interspecific hybridization between C. oleifera and C. yuhsienensis for understanding reproductive isolation mechanisms and breeding programs in genus Camellia.

AB  - Clostridium perfringens is a Gram positive anaerobe which makes spores that help it to persist under different environmental conditions. Spores of C. perfringens have the potential to remain in the fecal matter and soil for many years due to which control of transmission of pathogen becomes difficult. The pathogen is responsible for various diseases in both humans and animals. We determined the prevalence of C. perfringens in the soil of selected districts of Punjab province of Pakistan along with potential association of different categorical variables. A total of 970 samples were processed for real time PCR based screening of genome corresponding to cpa gene (alpha toxin gene) of C. perfringens. Only n=96 samples were found positive [9.89% with CI: 95% (8.018-11.78), p-value< 0.05]. Highest prevalence was found in district "Chakwal" followed by district "Attock" and "Lahore". The villages found positive for C. perfringens were evaluated for different risk factors including distance from the main road, animal market and water source; animal density, number of houses in the village and animal and human interaction at the sampling site. Analysis of the data revealed that animal and human interaction was the associated risk factor in most of the districts followed by distance from the water source, animal density and human population of the village. The study concludes that C. perfringens is prevalent in the soil of Punjab province and the prevalence varies with several risk factors in different districts. Further studies are required to find out most prevalent type of C. perfringens as well as effect of different categorical variables on prevalence of C. perfringens in other parts of the country.

AB  - Reducing the production of odor during swine breeding has attracted attention. Ammonia (NH3) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) contributed to the odor emissions from swine breeding because NH3 emissions are high and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has a low odor threshold. Sodium butyrate reduces the odor emissions caused by NH3 and H2S, but the corresponding mechanism is unclear. After mixing the feces of six fattening pigs, the mixture was used to process in vitro fermentation experiment. The purpose was researching the effect of sodium butyrate reduced NH3 and H2S emissions in swine cecal contents. The control group was denoted CK, and the treatment groups with different sodium butyrate concentrations (0.015%, 0.030% and 0.150%) were denoted L, M and H. The NH3, H2S, total gas production and physicochemical indexes were measured, and the bacterial communities in the fermented product were analyzed by 16 S rDNA sequencing. The results showed that group M reduced NH3, H2S and total gas production by 17.96%, 12.26% and 30.30%, respectively. Sodium butyrate promoted SO42- accumulation and lowered the pH. Importantly, sodium butyrate decreased the relative abundance of bacteria positively correlated with NH3 and H2S production, but increased the negatively correlated ones. Proteobacteria made a greater contribution to reducing emissions than did other bacterial phyla. Our results showed that adding 0.030% sodium butyrate can significantly reduce NH3 and H2S production, which occurred via alterations in the physicochemical indicators to adjust the abundance of the bacteria related to odor production, including Proteobacteria.

AB  - Coughing is an obvious respiratory disease symptom, which affects the airways and lungs of pigs. In pig houses, continuous online monitoring of cough sounds can be used to build an intelligent alarm system for disease early detection. Owing to complicated interferences in piggery, recognition of pig cough sound becomes difficult. Although a lot of algorithms have been proposed to recognize the pig cough sounds, the recognition accuracy in field situations still needs enhancement. The purpose of this research is to provide a highly accurate pig cough recognition method for the respiratory disease alarm system. We propose a classification algorithm based on the fine-tuned AlexNet model and feature of the spectrogram. With the advantages of the convolutional neural network in image recognition, the sound signals are converted into spectrogram images for recognition, to enhance the accuracy. We compare the proposed algorithm's performance with the probabilistic neural network classifier and some existing algorithms. The results reveal that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the other algorithms-cough and overall recognition accuracies reach to 96.8% and 95.4%, respectively, with 96.2% F1-score achieved.(c) 2020 China Agricultural University.

AB  - Amomum koenigii (Meistera koenigii) is an aromatic plant valued for culinary and medicinal purposes. It is a close relative of cardamom and other species. Accurate identification and distinction of species and supply of genetically uniform plants are critically important in the phytochemical industry. This work established a unique DNA signature of Amomum koenigii and an effective in vitro mass propagation protocol that ensures genetic uniformity. DNA sequences of rubisco large subunit (rbcL), internal transcribed spacer region 2 (ITS2), and maturase K (matK) gene were determined from PCR amplicon. Bioinformatics analysis suggests that the combined use of rbcL and matK accurately delimits Amomum koenigii from the closely relative species, while other combinations are unnecessary. In vitro, plants were established by culturing rhizomes containing axillary buds on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium. The highest number of shoots was obtained in the medium supplemented with 5.0 mg L-1 of 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) with 0.2 mg L-1 alpha-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) and 30.0 g L-1 sucrose. After multiplying several cycles, shoots were rooted well in 1.0 mg L-1 of indole-3-butyric acid (IBA). Plantlets were successfully acclimatized in soil. Their genetic uniformity was confirmed by 12 random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and 8 inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) primers, which produced 8 and 18 PCR amplicons, respectively. When micropropagated and conventionally produced seedlings were grown in the field, no significant differences were observed in several morphological traits, including plant height and leaf number. However, micropropagated plants produced significantly more shoots, producing larger strands. From this study, molecular identification combined with tissue culture offers a solution to adulteration and the demand for sustainable production of planting materials.

AB  - The increased ultraviolet radiation (UV) due to the altered stratospheric ozone leads to multiple plant physiological and biochemical adaptations, likely affecting their interaction with other organisms, such as pests and pathogens. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and UV-B treatment can be used as eco-friendly techniques to protect crops from pests by activating plant mechanisms of resistance. In this study, we investigated plant (Lactuca sativa) response to UV-B exposure and Funneliformis mosseae (IMA1) inoculation as well as the role of a major insect pest, Spodoptera littoralis. Lettuce plants exposed to UV-B were heavier and taller than non-irradiated ones. A considerable enrichment in phenolic, flavonoid, anthocyanin, and carotenoid contents and antioxidant capacity, along with redder and more homogenous leaf color, were also observed in UV-B-treated but not in AMF-inoculated plants. Biometric and biochemical data did not differ between AMF and non-AMF plants. AMF-inoculated plants showed hyphae, arbuscules, vesicles, and spores in their roots. AMF colonization levels were not affected by UV-B irradiation. No changes in S. littoralis-feeding behavior towards treated and untreated plants were observed, suggesting the ability of this generalist herbivore to overcome the plant chemical defenses boosted by UV-B exposure. The results of this multi-factorial study shed light on how polyphagous insect pests can cope with multiple plant physiological and biochemical adaptations following biotic and abiotic preconditioning.

AB  - Ginsenoside Rb1 (Rb1) is one of the most active components found in ginseng and provides important benefits to the central nervous system, especially for the improvement of learning and memory. Previous studies demonstrated that Rb1 protected against scopolamine-induced amnesia and exhibited memory-enhancing effects in the SAMP8 mouse model. However, the effects of Rb1 against chronic restraint stress (CRS)-induced cognitive impairments, especially the role of Rg1 on the performance of reward directed instrumental conditioning have not been investigated. In this study, rats were subjected to CRS (6 h/day) for 28 days. Thereafter, behavioural tests including reward-directed instrumental conditioning task (RICT) and the Morris water maze (MWM) task were conducted. Administered of Rb1 (6.75 and 13.5 mg/kg, i.p.) remarkably ameliorated the memory impairments caused by CRS as evident from the results of RICT and MWM task, and this effect was accompanied by noticeable alterations in the levels of oxidative markers (superoxide dismutase, catalase, and lipid peroxidation) in the hippocampus. Additionally, Rb1 reduced the ratio of Bax:Bcl-2 and the expression of cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved caspase-9, increased the levels of synaptophysin (SYP) and postsynaptic density 95 (PSD95) and activated the BDNF/TrkB pathway in the hippocampus. In summary, the present study demonstrated that Rb1 rescues cognitive deficits induced by CRS is partially mediated by antagonizing oxidative stress and apoptosis, improving synaptic plasticity and restoring the BDNF/TrkB signalling pathway. This newly discovered effect of Rb1 sheds light on its applications in the development of therapeutic interventions to alleviate the deleterious effects of chronic stress.

AB  - Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways control cell differentiation and the response to stress. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the MAPK pathway that controls filamentous growth (fMAPK) shares components with the pathway that regulates the response to osmotic stress (HOG). Here, we show that the two pathways exhibit different patterns of activity throughout the cell cycle. The different patterns resulted from different expression profiles of genes encoding mucin sensors that regulate the pathways. Cross-pathway regulation from the fMAPK pathway stimulated the HOG pathway, presumably to modulate fMAPK pathway activity. We also show that the shared tetraspan protein Sho1p, which has a dynamic localization pattern throughout the cell cycle, induced the fMAPK pathway at the mother-bud neck. A Sho1p-interacting protein, Hof1p, which also localizes to the mother-bud neck and regulates cytokinesis, also regulated the fMAPK pathway. Therefore, spatial and temporal regulation of pathway sensors, and cross-pathway regulation, control a MAPK pathway that regulates cell differentiation in yeast.

AB  - Livestock activities, in particular swine farms, are sources of odorant compounds that cause conflicts with the neighboring population. Beside the effects on the neighborhood, excessive odor emission can cause discomfort to farm workers. In this context the APPROAch project, aims to test the application of two different air cleaning technologies (a wet acid scrubber and a dry filter) to reduce dust, ammonia and odors, in naturally ventilated pig facilities. The aim of the present study is to evaluate, in a pig farm, the odor removal efficiency of the two tested abatement technologies, based on air samples analyzed by dynamic olfactometry. Odor sampling was carried out at a pig facility involved in the project and brought to the lab within 30 h from sampling, as established by the European Standard EN 13725:2004. Odor concentration was evaluated by dynamic olfactometry using an Olfaktomat-n 6 (PRA-Odournet B.V.-Amsterdam, The Netherlands). The results show that the wet acid scrubber prototype presents an average odor removal efficiency of 16%, whereas dry filter has from limited to no effect. This efficiency could be considered as a good result for a prototype even if further analysis, with longer sampling periods are needed.

AB  - The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in regulating energy metabolism, facilitating nutrient absorption, and supporting immune function, thereby assisting the host in adapting to seasonal dietary changes. Here, we compare the gut microbiome composition of wild gray snub-nosed monkeys during winter (from October to December) and spring (from January to March) to understand differences in seasonal nutrient intake patterns. Snub-nosed monkeys are foregut fermenters and consume difficult-to-digest carbohydrates and lichen. To examine the digestive adaptations of gray snub-nosed monkeys, we collected 14 fresh fecal samples for DNA analysis during the winter and spring. Based on 16S rRNA sequencing, metagenomic sequencing, and functional metagenomic analyses, we identified that Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and Bacteroidetes constitute a keystone bacterial group in the gut microbiota during winter and spring and are responsible for degrading cellulose. Moreover, the transition in dietary composition from winter to spring was accompanied by changes in gut microbiota composition, demonstrating adaptive responses to varying food sources and availability. In winter, the bacterial species of the genera Streptococcus were found in higher abundance. At the functional level, these bacteria are involved in fructose and mannose metabolism and galactose metabolism c-related pathways, which facilitate the breakdown of glycogen, starch, and fiber found in fruits, seeds, and mature leaves. During spring, there was an increased abundance of bacteria species from the Prevotella and Lactobacillus genera, which aid the digestion of protein-rich buds. Combined, these findings reveal how the gut microbiota adjusts to fluctuations in energy balance and nutrient intake across different seasons in this critically endangered species. Moreover, we also identified Pseudomonas in two samples; the presence of potential pathogens within the gut could pose a risk to other troop members. Our findings highlight the necessity of a conservation plan that focuses on protecting vegetation and implementing measures to prevent disease transmission for this critically endangered species.

AB  - Approximately 60-70 million people suffer from traumatic brain injury (TBI) each year. Animal models continue to be paramount in understanding mechanisms of cellular dysfunction and testing new treatments for TBI. Enhancing the translational potential of novel interventions therefore necessitates testing pre-clinical intervention strategies with clinically relevant cognitive assays. This study used a unilateral parietal lobe controlled cortical impact (CCI) model of TBI and tested rats on a touchscreen-based Paired Associates Learning (PAL) task, which is part of the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery. In humans, the PAL task has been used to assess cognitive deficits in the ability to form stimulus-location associations in a multitude of disease states, including TBI. Although the use of PAL in animal models could be important for understanding the clinical severity of cognitive impairment post-injury and throughout intervention, to date, the extent to which a rat model of TBI produces deficits in PAL task performance has not yet been reported. This study details the behavioral consequences of the CCI injury model with a Trial-by-Trial analysis of PAL performance that enables behavioral strategy use to be inferred. Following behavior, the extent of the injury was quantified with histology and staining for the presence of glial fibrillary acid protein and ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1. Rats that received unilateral CCI were impaired on the PAL task and showed more aberrant response-driven behavior. The magnitude of PAL impairment was also correlated with Iba1 staining in the thalamus. These observations suggest that PAL could be useful for pre-clinical assessments of novel interventions for treating TBI.

AB  - Sex hormones are known to affect brain structure. Given that menopause is marked by a significant decline in female sex hormones, there might be structural brain alterations around menopause. The aim of this article is to provide a narrative review on what we know today with respect to links between brain anatomy and menopause, while also considering potential effects of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT). The review is focused on neuroimaging studies analyzing the macro-anatomy or micro-anatomy of the human brain as based on structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Out of the 32 studies reviewed here, 22 studies revealed at least some findings that suggest beneficial effects of estrogen. However, overall, findings are rather mixed pointing to both beneficial and adverse effects (or to no effects at all). The nature of the effects seemed to be unrelated to the spatial scales applied, the morphometric measures obtained, and the brain tissues targeted. Nevertheless, there were some intriguing effects in terms of the study design: Cross-sectionally, there seemed to be a trend for beneficial effects in small-scale studies and for adverse effects in large-scale studies. Longitudinally, there seemed to be a trend for beneficial effects in purely observational studies and for beneficial as well as adverse effects in controlled clinical trials. With particular respect to MHT, early treatment (short after the onset of menopause) might be more beneficial than later treatment. However, overall, data are insufficient to draw final conclusions and further research is required.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects on some physicochemical properties and starter cultures of yogurts enriched with vitamins at different concentrations during storage. For this purpose, yogurt was produced by adding the vitamins folic acid (B-9), biotin (B-7), and vitamin D-3 in different concentrations to sheep and cow milk and stored at 4 C-degrees. Physicochemical analyses and microbiological analyses were performed for each group of yogurt on days 0, 7, 14, and 21.RESULTS: There was no significant difference (P > 0.05) between the groups in pH and titration acidity (%) during storage. It was determined that in the yogurts produced from sheep milk, the groups enriched with vitamins had a higher number of L. bulgaricus than the control group on the 7th day of storage. Moreover, the groups containing vitamin D-3 exhibited a higher Lactobacillus bulgaricus count on the 21st day of storage. The highest L. bulgaricus counts on the 7th day in yogurts produced from cow's milk were observed in groups containing 0.5 mL of vitamin B9 and B7. No mold or yeast growth was observed during storage in any of the yogurt groups made from cow and sheep milk.CONCLUSION: In conclusion, it was determined that the enrichment of yogurt with vitamins B-7, B-9, and D-3 did not adversely affect the quality of the yogurt; rather, it improved. We recommend that yogurt enriched with micronutrients be studied economically, and mass production should be initiated by yogurt companies as soon as possible.(c) 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - BackgroundPlant-produced specialised metabolites are a powerful part of a plant's first line of defence against herbivorous insects, bacteria and fungi. Wild ancestors of present-day cultivated tomato produce a plethora of acylsugars in their type-I/IV trichomes and volatiles in their type-VI trichomes that have a potential role in plant resistance against insects. However, metabolic profiles are often complex mixtures making identification of the functionally interesting metabolites challenging. Here, we aimed to identify specialised metabolites from a wide range of wild tomato genotypes that could explain resistance to vector insects whitefly (Bemisia tabaci) and Western flower thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis). We evaluated plant resistance, determined trichome density and obtained metabolite profiles of the glandular trichomes by LC-MS (acylsugars) and GC-MS (volatiles). Using a customised Random Forest learning algorithm, we determined the contribution of specific specialised metabolites to the resistance phenotypes observed.ResultsThe selected wild tomato accessions showed different levels of resistance to both whiteflies and thrips. Accessions resistant to one insect can be susceptible to another. Glandular trichome density is not necessarily a good predictor for plant resistance although the density of type-I/IV trichomes, related to the production of acylsugars, appears to correlate with whitefly resistance. For type VI-trichomes, however, it seems resistance is determined by the specific content of the glands. There is a strong qualitative and quantitative variation in the metabolite profiles between different accessions, even when they are from the same species. Out of 76 acylsugars found, the random forest algorithm linked two acylsugars (S3:15 and S3:21) to whitefly resistance, but none to thrips resistance. Out of 86 volatiles detected, the sesquiterpene alpha -humulene was linked to whitefly susceptible accessions instead. The algorithm did not link any specific metabolite to resistance against thrips, but monoterpenes alpha -phellandrene, alpha -terpinene and beta -phellandrene/D-limonene were significantly associated with susceptible tomato accessions.ConclusionsWhiteflies and thrips are distinctly targeted by certain specialised metabolites found in wild tomatoes. The machine learning approach presented helped to identify features with efficacy toward the insect species studied. These acylsugar metabolites can be targets for breeding efforts towards the selection of insect-resistant cultivars.

AB  - Many studies have found that future predicted CO2 levels can increase plant mass but dilute N content in leaves, impacting antiherbivore compounds. Nitrogen-fixing plants may balance their leaf C:N ratio under elevated CO2, counteracting this dilution effect. However, we know little of how plants respond to herbivores at the higher CO2 levels that occurred when nitrogen-fixing plants first evolved. We grew Alnus incana ssp. rugosa was grown at 400, 800, or 1600 ppm CO2 in soil collected from the field, inoculated with Frankia and exposed to herbivores (Orgyia leucostigma). Elevated CO2 increased nodulated plant biomass and stimulated the nitrogen fixation rate in the early growth stage. However, nitrogen-fixing plants were not able to balance their C:N ratio under elevated CO2 after growing for 19 weeks. When plants were grown at 400 and 1600 ppm CO2, herbivores preferred to feed on leaves of nodulated plants. At 800 ppm CO2, nodulated plants accumulated more total phenolic compounds in response to herbivore damage than plants in the non-Frankia and non-herbivore treatments. Our results suggest that plant leaf defence, not leaf nutritional content, is the dominant driver of herbivory and nitrogen-fixing plants have limited ability to balance C:N ratios at elevated CO2 in natural soil.

AB  - Understanding the performance and behavior of garment leathers provides valuable inputs for the design and production of leather garments. The drape is one of the important properties associated with garment fitness quality and appeal. This study aims to show how the independent variables flexural rigidity and thickness affect the dependent variable drapability. Nowadays, studies on the drape of garment leathers are scarce. In this work, the drape coefficient (DC) was measured for sheep garment leather, which influences the garment drapability, such as flexural rigidity in the range of 9.2 to 22 and thickness in the range of 0.64 to 0.96. The average DC was calculated in the range of 47.35 to 69.9% for the selected sheep leathers from four samples. The drapability of the garment leather was determined using the DC. Flexural rigidity and thickness have been shown to have a considerable influence on the DC, while they do bear a significant relationship to the DC. The results of this study can be used as an elementary tool for leather selection of appropriate materials for garments.

AB  - Simple Summary Hybrid rice is grown by millions of Asian farmers and has normally higher yields compared to inbred varieties. However, hybrid rice has been associated with high damage from herbivores. This susceptibility could be due to the physiology of the hybrid plant type or due to a limited availability of male sterile parents that are necessary for hybrid seed production. We examined how plant type and breeding affect the relative susceptibilities of hybrid and inbred rice by exposing 32 rice genotypes to the brown planthopper, whitebacked planthopper, and yellow stemborer in controlled environments and field plots. We compared insect fitness on the plants and related this to the type and genetic similarity of genotypes. Despite their diverse origins (China, Colombia, India, and the Philippines), the hybrids and inbreds formed two distinct genetic groups, thereby confounding plant type and phylogeny. Hybrids were generally more susceptible to stemborers but not to planthoppers. Relative herbivore fitness was strongly influenced by plant origin (i.e., breeding program) with one group of related genotypes being relatively susceptible to all three herbivores. Our results indicate that hybrids are not inherently more susceptible than inbreds to insect herbivores and that careful screening with the elimination of the most susceptible genotypes is necessary to reduce herbivore damage to hybrid and inbred rice in Asia.Abstract Several studies have reported higher damage from insect herbivores to hybrid compared to inbred (pure line) rice. We used a collection of 20 hybrid and 12 inbred genotypes from diverse origins to test the hypotheses that hybrid rice susceptibility is due to (a) the hybrid plant type and/or (b) rice phylogeny. We challenged the genotypes with Nilaparvata lugans (BPH), Sogatella furcifera (WBPH) and Scirpophaga incertulas (YSB) in greenhouse and screenhouse bioassays and monitored herbivores in field plots. We used single nucleotide polymorphic (SNP) markers to assess genetic similarities between the genotypes and found that the hybrids and inbreds formed two distinct clusters regardless of origin. In the screenhouse, hybrids were more susceptible than inbreds to YSB; however, resistant hybrids and susceptible inbreds were also apparent from both the screenhouse and field plots. Plant biomass was the best predictor of susceptibility to YSB. Plant origin had a greater effect than plant type on susceptibility to BPH and WBPH. WBPH was the most abundant planthopper in the field plots where numbers were highly correlated with planthopper fitness in the greenhouse bioassays. Our results provide evidence that high-yielding hybrids that are relatively resistant to herbivores can be achieved through careful breeding. The avoidance of susceptible genotypes during breeding should remain a key element of integrated rice pest management.

AB  - The diversification of lineages is facilitated or constrained by the simultaneous evolution of multiple components of the phenotype that interact with each other during the course of speciation. When evolutionary radiations are adaptive, lineages proliferate via the emergence of multiple phenotypic optima that underlie diversification of species across multiple ecological niches. When radiations are non-adaptive, lineage proliferation unfolds constrained by similar (or nearly identical) correlations among traits that keep phenotypic and ecological diversity across newly emerging species within a single optimum. Nature offers very few opportunities where both types of diversification occur between closely related and highly diverse lineages. The Liolaemidae family of South American lizards offers unique such opportunities given two speciose lineages that have rapidly proliferated via adaptive (Liolaemus) and non-adaptive (Phymaturus) radiations. We analyze body shape in lizards in association with type of diet (herbivory, omnivory or carnivory). In these lizards, diet types have been suggested to be linked to body size. Our results confirm this hypothesis, with three body size optima tightly linked to all three diet types when radiation is both adaptive and non-adaptive. Diet reconstruction along their evolutionary history showed that the common ancestor of Liolaemidae was likely omnivorous, which is matched by ancestral reconstruction of body size. Phylogenetic PCA revealed that herbivorous species generally have more differentiated body shape than insectivores and omnivores. Herbivorous species have evolved larger heads, shorter hindlimbs and a small difference between forelimb and hindlimb length. In contrast, omnivores and insectivores have smaller heads and longer hindlimbs. Collectively, trophic niche plays an important role in defining body shape and size across species within lineages, and the patterns of trait-ecology correlations remain consistent when lineages have diversified via adaptive and non-adaptive radiation.

AB  - The lepidopteran fauna on goldenrod, Solidago altissima, in central New York is extraordinarily diverse (63 species in 43 genera and 13 families, representing 61% of the total insect fauna on S. altissima), as determined through over four years of sampling at 43 sites. To best illustrate the functional structure of the community, caterpillars are divided into both feeding and sheltering guilds. We studied patterns in caterpillar size, feeding guild, sheltering guild, host range, phenology, abundance, and taxonomic relationships to gain insights about community assembly on this group of native caterpillars on a prominent native host species. Size distribution among caterpillar species is highly skewed toward the small end and does not differ between caterpillars with broad and narrow host ranges. There are relatively few species that feed on stems and rhizomes, suggesting challenges in adapting to those plant parts. Host range is a highly conserved trait in several lineages of goldenrod feeders (relatives of polyphagous species are polyphagous, and relatives of specialists are specialists). Polyphagous species and exposed-feeding species are usually rare; some specialist species are also chronically rare. There is a dearth of species in mid-summer, between the time that many leaf-folding and leaf-tying species complete development and the time that flower-feeding species appear. Species with high intimacy of association (gallmakers, stem borers, and leaf miners) tend to be specialists, as compared with exposed feeders, and they are necessarily small in size. Among exophages, size relations are constrained by phylogeny. Lineages have characteristic behaviors and means of association with the host; as a result, the structure of the fauna is determined by an interaction of ecological factors and evolved constraints in the lineages that have adapted to feed on Solidago.

AB  - Specific protocols of rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep deprivation (SD) may lead to behavioral phenotypes considered as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)-like behavior and hyperactivity (mania-like behavior). The present study aimed to assess the effects of REM SD on both sexes of control and fear conditioning (FC) rats. REM SD was induced for 1 or 2 or 3 weeks (6 h/d). Freezing, locomotor activity, anxiety-like behavior, grooming and burying marbles (OCD-like behaviors), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus were evaluated. The results showed 1w REM SD decreased freezing in females, while 2w and 3w REM SD decreased freezing in both sexes. Locomotor activity in 2w REM SD males was increased, while was decreased in 3w group. In females, both 2w and 3w REM SD increased locomotion. REM SD in both sexes increased locomotion in FC rats. All REM SD protocols decreased anxiety in both sexes of FC rats. REM SD in control and FC rats led to OCDlike behaviors. All REM SD protocols decreased BDNF in both sexes, while 3w slightly increased it, suggesting a compensatory mechanism over time. 2w and 3w REM SD increased BDNF in FC rats in both sexes. Pearson correlation test also showed that changes in BDNF levels may be related to some behavioral changes only in females. In conclusion, for the first time, the present study showed sex differences in the effects of REM SD on behavioral functions in control and FC rats, and in the relationship between BDNF levels and behavioral changes.

AB  - Methoxychlor (MXC) is a widely used organochlorine pesticide primarily targeting pests. However, MXC has been found to negatively impact the reproductive system of both humans and animals, triggering oxidative stress and apoptosis. Melatonin (MLT), an endogenous hormone, possesses various benefits, including circadian rhythm regulation and anti-inflammatory and antioxidative stress effects. Moreover, MLT plays a crucial role in the development of animal germ cells and embryos. This study aimed to investigate the impact of MLT on porcine oocytes exposed to MXC. The experimental findings revealed that 200 mu M MXC had detrimental effects on the maturation of porcine oocytes. However, the addition of 10-8 M MLT mitigated the toxic effects of MXC. MXC induced oxidative stress in porcine oocytes, leading to an increase in reactive oxygen species and impairing mitochondrial function. Consequently, oocyte quality was affected, resulting in elevated levels of early apoptosis and DNA damage, ultimately negatively impacting subsequent embryonic development. However, the addition of MLT showed the potential to ameliorate the damage caused by MXC. In conclusion, our results suggest that MLT exhibits a protective effect against MXC-induced damage to porcine oocyte maturation.

AB  - The adverse impacts of underwater radiated noise (URN) from marine vessels on marine life are increasingly recognized. URN estimation and subsequent monitoring could be used to track URN and take measures to reduce it in sensitive environments (e.g., a marine life protected area). Two common radiated noise power approximations and two empirical methods are assessed for URN estimation. The assessments were carried out by testing the methods on data from acoustic range measurements of the ORCA-class Patrol Craft Training Moose from the Royal Canadian Navy and a DAMEN Combi freighter. The common approximations are called equivalent radiated power and a method based on the volume velocity; both estimate URN directly from onboard accelerometer measurements. The empirical methods are based on the correlations of onboard vibrations with measured URN, from which transfer functions are derived. Acoustic range measurements are divided into training and testing runs. The correlations are applied to the training runs to conceive the transfer functions. The transfer functions are then used to estimate SL from onboard vibrations for the testing runs for validation purposes.

AB  - Nitrogen and phosphorus are essential elements of plants, which play important roles in representing plant growth, physiological function regulation, fruit harvest, etc. Hyperspectral technology provides a nondestructive, rapid, highly accurate, and cost-efficient method for plant leaf nutrient content estimation. There are very limited studies on nutrient diagnosis of Camellia oleifera leaves using hyperspectral technology. In this work, 160 Camellia oleifera samples were used. Hyperspectral data were obtained using a full-band spectrometer. On the basis of preprocessing, the spectral response characteristics of leaf nitrogen content (LNC) and leaf phosphorus content (LPC) were revealed by comparing different combinations of spectral indices, and the spectral variables were further selected. The optimal LNC and LPC estimation models based on three machine learning algorithms [i.e., support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and back propagation neural network (BPNN)] were constructed. The results showed that the spectral sensitive regions of leaf nitrogen and phosphorus content were mainly reflected in green band, followed by red band and the long-wave direction of short-wave infrared band. Savitzky-Golay first derivative (SGFD) pretreatment method was generally better than multiplicative scatter correction. The maximum correlation coefficients of the absolute values of LNC, LPC, and spectral transformation features were 0.56 and 0.49. The optimal LNC and LPC models were both SGFD-TBNDSI-BPNN, with R-2 of 0.81 and 0.79, and RMSEP of 0.55 and 0.06 g/kg, respectively. The research results can provide a reliable theoretical basis for large-scale optical remote sensing monitoring of nutrient content for Camellia oleifera. (c) The Authors.

AB  - Simple Summary:& nbsp;Nowadays, researchers need to find a solution to the growing demand for sustainable animal productions. Livestock animal's nutrition is the component with major impacts on environment and economy. The biggest challenge is to find alternative feed ingredients to minimize and valorize the food leftovers. Food industry leftovers, also called former food products, could be a valid alternative to grains in young pigs' nutrition. From a nutritional point of view, these ingredients are very similar to standard cereals, like corn. The results from this study suggest that a partial substitution of standard ingredients with two different sources of former food products in the diets of post-weaned pigs is possible, without any negative effects on growth performance and health of animals.<br>Former food products (FFPs) have a great potential to replace conventional feed ingredients. This study aimed to investigate the possibility to partially replace standard ingredients with two different types of FFPs: bakery (FFPs-B) or confectionary (FFPs-C) FFPs and their effects on growth performances, feed digestibility and metabolic status in post-weaning piglets. Thirty-six post-weaning piglets were randomly assigned to three experimental diets (n = 12 per diet) for 42 days: a standard diet (CTR), a diet where 30% of standard ingredients were replaced by confectionary FFPs (FFPs-C) and a diet where 30% of standard ingredients were replaced by bakery FFPs (FFPs-B). Individual body weight and fecal dry matter were measured weekly. Feed intake (FI) was determined daily. Average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were calculated. Fecal samples were collected daily for three days/week to determine apparent total tract digestibility of dry matter (ATTD). At day 0, 21 and 42, blood samples were collected from all the piglets. No significant differences (p > 0.05) between groups were found in growth performances and metabolic profile. However, ATTD in FFPs-B group was lower (p < 0.05) compared to the CTR group at the end of the experiment. This study confirmed the possibility to formulate homogeneous diets integrated with 30% of both categories of FFPs. Further investigations are needed to clarify the effects of bakery former food products on the digestibility of the diet.

AB  - Context. Several polymorphisms in the melatonin receptor 1A gene (MTNR1A) have been related to reproductive performance in ovine. Aims. To investigate the effect of the RsaI and MnlI polymorphisms on ram seminal quality. Methods. Eighteen Rasa Aragonesa rams were genotyped for the RsaI (C/C, C/T, T/T) and MnlI (G/G, G/A, A/A) allelic variants of the MTNR1A gene. Individual ejaculates were analysed once a month throughout the whole year. Sperm motility, morphology, membrane integrity, levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), phosphatidylserine (PS) inversion, DNA fragmentation and capacitation status were assessed. The effect of the season and polymorphisms on seminal quality was evaluated by mixed ANOVA. Key results. Both polymorphisms had an effect on membrane integrity and viable spermatozoa with low levels of ROS and without PS translocation, and RsaI also on motile and DNA-intact spermatozoa. An interaction between both polymorphisms was found, pointing to a negative effect on seminal quality of carrying the T or A allele in homozygosity. Differences were higher in the reproductive than in the non-reproductive season. Conclusions. Mutations substituting C by T and G by A at RsaI and MnlI polymorphic sites, respectively, in the MTNR1A gene in rams could decrease the seminal quality.

AB  - With global warming and rapid urbanization, the microclimate in the Lingnan region is prone to health problems, such as pyrexia and infectious diseases, and the average annual number of heatwave-related deaths is rising rapidly. The large-scale regeneration of traditional neighborhoods in Lingnan under high-quality development is underway, which has implications for the thermal comfort of microclimatic environments. This study focused on the impact of different building unit types and spatial patterns on thermal comfort in the Donghuali traditional neighborhood of Foshan City as an example. We extracted eight basic morphological units and designed a prototype block of 400 m x 400 m. In the Rhinoceros & Grasshopper parametric software 6.7, a variety of plug-ins were integrated to establish a platform with parametric modeling, microclimate simulation and evaluation, and optimal design for thermal comfort. Through experiments, the effects of new single-type and new composite building units on thermal comfort were investigated, and the correlation equations between spatial morphology and microclimate comfort in Lingnan traditional neighborhoods were established. Finally, the multi-objective genetic optimization of thermal comfort was carried out as an example of real block renewal, which provides a practical reference for the planning and design of traditional blocks.

AB  - One of the methods to reduce long-term excessive plastic waste is the development and use of composite materials based on biodegradable polymers and natural fibres. Composites with natural fibres can exhibit very good mechanical properties, and the presence of natural fibres can significantly accelerate the degradation of the material. This study aimed to manufacture and analyse the biodegradation process of composites based on biodegradable polylactide (PLA) filled with flax and sheep wool fibres. The effect of flax and wool fibres and their content on the degradation rate compared to that of pure PLA was investigated. The degradation progress and properties of the composites were studied using an optical microscope, SEM, measurement of surface roughness, and contact angle. Additionally, flexural strength tests, a dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), and a thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were conducted. The effect of natural fibres on the phase transition and degree of crystallinity was analysed using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The results showed that PLA degrades only under UV light, but not in the composter simulating the natural environment. However, the incorporation of both types of fibres accelerated degradation of PLA/fibres composites in soil. Flax fibre composites exhibited better mechanical properties than pure PLA. For composites with wool fibres, although they showed a significant acceleration of the degradation process in the soil, their large content in the composite caused a reduction of mechanical properties. This research showed the positive effect of the addition of natural fibres on the biodegradation of PLA.

AB  - Extensive sheep grazing carries both benefits and risks. Whereas the benefits include reduced labor input and optimal (close to natural) welfare conditions for sheep, the risks involve a danger of lambs getting lost on the pasture. The objective of this study was to compare the behavior of lambs and their mothers belonging to two breeds (Polish Merino and Wrzoso ' wka) in three experiment systems simulating the conditions in which lambs tend to get lost on the pasture during extensive grazing: 1) with visual and auditory contact, 2) with auditory contact, and 3) without visual-auditory contact with the flock. Two main questions were analyzed about the first three months of the lambs' life: 1) the time of finding the flock by the lambs and 2) the behavior patterns of the lambs and ewes, such as the lambs' movements, the lambs' and mothers' vocalization, the reaction to the curtain, the reaction to the observer, and the lambs' behavior in the field. The study found that the flock finding time in the first and third month of the lambs' life (experiments 1 and 2, respectively) was shorter in the Wrzoso ' wka breed than in the Merino breed (p = 0.05). Regardless of the scenario, the most frequently observed reactions in the lamb flock were flock calling and navigating to the flock by the shortest route. In the absence of visual and auditory contact, the most frequent response of the Polish Merino and Wrzoso ' wka lambs was to run to the top of the hill and search for the flock. In the third month of life, the lambs of both breeds began to show a higher degree of independence, and the observed patterns of their behavior were similar. The results of the study show that in the first two months of life, the Wrzoso ' wka lambs found the flock faster and were better oriented in the field than the Merino lambs. In the third month of life, the differences in the behavior patterns of the two breeds became very small. This finding could indicate that during extensive grazing, lambs of some breeds, especially those subjected to intensive artificial selection such as the Merino breed, may require more care of the breeder in the first two months of their life.

AB  - Climate change has severely impacted many species, causing rapid declines or extinctions within their essential ecological niches. This deterioration is expected to worsen, particularly in remote high-altitude regions like the Himalayas, which are home to diverse flora and fauna, including many mountainous ungulates. Unfortunately, many of these species lack adaptive strategies to cope with novel climatic conditions. The Red Goral (Naemorhedus baileyi) is a cliff-dwelling species classified as "Vulnerable" by the IUCN due to its small population and restricted range extent. This species has the most restricted range of all goral species, residing in the temperate mountains of northeastern India, northern Myanmar, and China. Given its restricted range and small population, this species is highly threatened by climate change and habitat disruptions, making habitat mapping and modeling crucial for effective conservation. This study employs an ensemble approach (BRT, GLM, MARS, and MaxEnt) in species distribution modeling to assess the distribution, habitat suitability, and connectivity of this species, addressing critical gaps in its understanding. The findings reveal deeply concerning trends, as the model identified only 21,363 km(2) (13.01%) of the total IUCN extent as suitable habitat under current conditions. This limited extent is alarming, as it leaves the species with very little refuge to thrive. Furthermore, this situation is compounded by the fact that only around 22.29% of this identified suitable habitat falls within protected areas (PAs), further constraining the species' ability to survive in a protected landscape. The future projections paint even degraded scenarios, with a predicted decline of over 34% and excessive fragmentation in suitable habitat extent. In addition, the present study identifies precipitation seasonality and elevation as the primary contributing predictors to the distribution of this species. Furthermore, the study identifies nine designated transboundary PAs within the IUCN extent of the Red Goral and the connectivity among them to highlight the crucial role in supporting the species' survival over time. Moreover, the Dibang Wildlife Sanctuary (DWLS) and Hkakaborazi National Park are revealed as the PAs with the largest extent of suitable habitat in the present scenario. Furthermore, the highest mean connectivity was found between DWLS and Mehao Wildlife Sanctuary (0.0583), while the lowest connectivity was observed between Kamlang Wildlife Sanctuary and Namdapha National Park (0.0172). The study also suggests strategic management planning that is a vital foundation for future research and conservation initiatives, aiming to ensure the long-term survival of the species in its natural habitat.

AB  - Context. The removal or supplementation of ejaculates with seminal plasma (SP) can affect cryotolerance and post-thaw survival of spermatozoa in many species. In the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus), elucidation of the SP proteome and investigation of how it affects spermatozoa may enable improvement of cryopreservation protocols. Aims. Herein, we characterise the Asian elephant SP proteome and investigate the impacts of SP on sperm cryotolerance in the presence of conspecific or heterospecific SP. Methods. Proteomic analysis of Asian elephant SP was performed using mass spectrometry on nine samples from three individuals. In a separate study, SP was removed from six ejaculates and spermatozoa were resuspended in Tris extender supplemented with: no seminal plasma (NOSP), conspecific SP from ejaculates exhibiting 'good' (GSP, >60%) or mixed sperm total motility (MSP), or horse SP (HSP). Samples underwent cryopreservation, and sperm parameters were compared prior to cryopreservation and after thawing (0 and 2 h). Key results. Mass spectrometry identified 155 proteins from an array of families. Significant differences were observed in post-thaw sperm quality between SP treatments: high concentrations of MSP (25%, v/v) displayed greater average path and straight-line velocity immediately after thawing (P < 0.05) and greater sperm motility index and beat cross frequency than NOSP after 2 h post-thaw incubation (P < 0.05). The addition of HSP improved sperm kinematic parameters compared to NOSP and GSP treatments (P < 0.05). Conclusions and implications. These preliminary findings suggest the potential of SP to enhance the cryosurvival of Asian elephant spermatozoa, with HSP showing particularly promising results compared to conspecific SP (GSP). Further research into the specific effects of Asian elephant SP proteins is warranted.

AB  - The enhancement of mechanisms to protect the rights of migrants and refugees within the European Union represents a critical area for human-centered artificial intelligence (HCAI). Traditionally, the focus on algorithms alone has shifted toward a more comprehensive understanding of AI's potential to shape technology in ways which better serve human needs, particularly for disadvantaged groups. Large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offer significant potential to bridging gaps for vulnerable populations, including immigrants, refugees, and individuals with disabilities. Implementing solutions based on these technologies involves critical factors which influence the pursuit of approaches aligning with humanitarian interests. This study presents a proof of concept utilizing the open LLM model LLAMA 3 and a linguistic corpus comprising legislative, regulatory, and assistance information from various European Union agencies concerning migrants. We evaluate generative metrics, energy efficiency metrics, and metrics for assessing contextually appropriate and non-discriminatory responses. Our proposal involves the optimal tuning of key hyperparameters for LLMs and RAG through multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods to ensure the solutions are fair, equitable, and non-discriminatory. The optimal configurations resulted in a 20.1% reduction in carbon emissions, along with an 11.3% decrease in the metrics associated with bias. The findings suggest that by employing the appropriate methodologies and techniques, it is feasible to implement HCAI systems based on LLMs and RAG without undermining the social integration of vulnerable populations.

AB  - The white light-emitting diodes (LEDs), a kind of representative multiband light emitters, which are gen-erally manufactured by coating phosphor with InGaN-based blue LED chips, are widely used in illumination and display. However, the degradation and wavelength-conversion loss of phosphor are still issues which shorten the life of these LEDs. Herein, we demonstrate a convenient way to fabricate phosphor-free multiband-emitting LEDs without any external process or additional dielectric interlayers, utilizing only graphene as substrate for direct van deer Waals epitaxy (vdWE) of multiple-facet InGaN-based LEDs. Taking advantage of the low nucleation density of GaN on graphene, the surface morphology of the films was controlled as complete voids without flat. The morphology of InGaN/GaN multi quantum wells followed with the multiple-facet GaN, which caused the variation of indium concentration in different lattice plane of multi quantum well and led to multiband emission.

AB  - Anaerobic digestion of organic residues has the potential to significantly contribute to a shift from fossil to renewable energy, while the remaining biogas digestate need to be treated or used for a second time. In this study, the pig manure biogas digestate (PMBD) was evaluated as a potential part of seedling sub-strates and composting was considered a pretreating method to improve its characters. Composting was carried out firstly in a forced aeration composting system (100 L), in which perlite and sawdust were used as additives in different proportions separately or together. Based on the comparison of the physicochem-ical characters of different seedling substrates formulas mixed with PMBD or pig manure biogas digestate pretreated by composting (CPMBD), selected seedling substrates were analyzed by bioassay experiment. The results showed that pretreatment by composting and the additives (perlite and sawdust) used in composting decreased the pH value of PMBD and make it suitable for seedling substrates, especially com-posted with perlite and sawdust. Both PMBD and CPMBD with low proportion in the substrates improved plant growth of lettuce and tomato, while CPMBD was better than PMBD. However, when the proportions of PMBD was increased more than 20% and CPMBD was increased more than 40%, plant growth inhibition was observed. Tomato was more sensitive than lettuce to the physicochemical characters of the sub-strate. In summary, PMBD pretreated by composting not only increases the uses of digestate, but also enhances plant growth and hence yield. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Physical exercise is known to augment brain functioning, improving memory and cognition. However, while some of the physiological effects of physical activity on the brain are known, little is known about its effects on the neural code. Using calcium imaging in freely behaving mice, we study how voluntary exercise affects the quality and long-term stability of hippocampal place codes. We find that running accelerates the emer-gence of a more informative spatial code in novel environments and increases code stability over days and weeks. Paradoxically, although runners demonstrated an overall more stable place code than their sedentary peers, their place code changed faster when controlling for code quality level. A model-based simulation shows that the combination of improved code quality and faster representational drift in runners, but neither of these effects alone, could account for our results. Thus, exercise may enhance hippocampal function via a more informative and dynamic place code.

AB  - This work evaluates the characteristics of calcium aluminate slag and pig iron samples obtained from the smelting of calcined and reduced diasporic bauxite ore. The study is conducted in the Pedersen process framework, which is a method to produce alumina from low-grade resources. Parameters such as the effect of crucible type, lime addition, and atmospheric conditions are studied considering the characteristics of the product pig irons and calcium aluminate slags for further uses. The behavior of the bauxite and distribution of the species between slag and metal was assessed based on the applied analytical techniques and thermodynamic calculations. Iron was reduced and separated from the slags in the presence of carbon (graphite crucible) for both the reduced and calcined bauxite. Si and Ti were mainly concentrated in the slags. Iron was separated from the slag in the absence of carbon (alumina crucible) for the H-2-reduced bauxite. The results show that slags with increased lime additions are composed mainly of 5CaO.Al2O3 and CaO.Al2O3, that are considered highly leachable compounds. An optimum CaO/Al2O3 mass ratio of 1.12 was suggested. The presence of O-2 and/or OH- in the furnace atmosphere will result in the formation of 12CaO.7Al(2)O(3).

AB  - Rice fields are characterized by high algal production and dense mats of filamentous green algae, and they function as habitats for various aquatic organisms. However, how algal production supports the secondary production of aquatic consumers in rice fields has not been assessed. Herein, aquatic food web structures in two adjacent rice fields in northeastern Japan were examined using carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analyses. Filamentous algae often showed higher delta C-13 values (mean, -23.1 parts per thousand to -21.4 parts per thousand ) than other organic matter sources, including particulate organic matter, benthic microalgae, and soil organic matter (-30.1 parts per thousand to -25.4 parts per thousand). A delta C-13-based isotopic mixing model estimated that among 19 taxa of herbivores and omnivores, most taxa depended on filamentous algae-derived carbon (ca. >30%). Particularly, Peltodytes intermedius larvae, a specialist feeder for filamentous algae, showed the highest reliance (mean, 66.7%-80.0%). The microcrustacean, Ostracoda sp. also utilized a diet consisting of a substantial proportion of filamentous algae-derived carbon (57.6%). Seven out of 10 carnivorous taxa showed reliance on filamentous algae-derived carbon by >30%. Particularly, larvae of beetles (Berosus sp., Enochrus sp., and Hydrochara affinis) showed the highest reliance (40.2%-44.3%). They could assimilate filamentous algae-based carbon by consuming herbivores, such as P. intermedius. Because fresh filamentous green algae were eaten less by aquatic consumers, the herbivores could consume decomposed filamentous algae rather than fresh ones. Our results suggest that filamentous algae are one of the major organic matter sources supporting secondary production in rice field food webs.

AB  - Facial nerve injury in rats have been widely used to study functional and structural changes that occur in the injured motoneurons and other central nervous system structures related with sensorimotor processing. A decrease in long-term potentiation of hippocampal CA3-to-CA1 commissural synapse has recently been reported related to this peripheral injury. Additionally, it has been found increased corticosterone plasmatic levels, impairment in spatial memory consolidation, and hippocampal microglial activation in animals with facial nerve axotomy. In this work, we analyzed the neuronal morphology of hippocampal CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons in animals with either reversible or irreversible facial nerve injury. For this purpose, brain tissues of injured animals sacrificed at different postlesion times, were stained with the Golgi-Cox method and compared with control brains. It was found that both reversible and irreversible facial nerve injury-induced significant decreases in dendritic tree complexity, dendritic length, branch points, and spine density of hippocampal neurons. However, such changes' timing varied according to hippocampal area (CA1 vs. CA3), dendritic area (apical vs. basal), and lesion type (reversible vs. irreversible). In general, the observed changes were transient when animals had the possibility of motor recovery (reversible injury), but perdurable if the recovery from the lesion was impeded (irreversible injury). CA1 apical and CA3 basal dendritic tree morphology were more sensible to irreversible injury. It is concluded that facial nerve injury induced significant changes in hippocampal CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons morphology, which could be related to LTP impairments and microglial activation in the hippocampal formation, previously described.

AB  - Simple Summary Eriophyoid mites are microscopic herbivores associated with higher plants. Some of them are serious pests due to their ability to vector viruses and cause other damage to host plants. Mites of the genus Trisetacus are widespread parasites of conifers. They usually live in buds, cones, and rarely within needles of Pinaceae (pine family) and Cupressaceae (cypress family). We discovered a new species, Trisetacus indelis n. sp., severely damaging seeds of three North American junipers in the western USA. This species possesses two morphologically different forms of females and has two deletion mutations in the gene cytochrome oxidase subunit I (Cox1). Such mutations are rare in eriophyoids and were previously detected only in two pestiferous species from palms and hazelnut. Our molecular-phylogenetic analyses determine the closest known relatives of the new species and suggest that Old and New World Trisetacus independently transitioned to living in seeds of junipers. Additionally we show that reconstruction of the phylogeny of Eriophyoidea based on one gene, Cox1, produces a poorly-resolved but biologically consistent tree topology to hypothesize the evolution of Eriophyoidea. Overall, our study improves our understanding of the diversity of conifer-inhabiting mites and indicates further needs in investigating the phylogeny of Eriophyoidea. Eriophyoid mites of the genus Trisetacus Keifer are widespread parasites of conifers. A new oligophagous species, T. indelis n. sp., was discovered severely damaging seeds of North American junipers (Juniperus osteosperma, J. occidentalis, and J. californica) in the western USA. It has two codon deletions in the mitochondrial gene Cox1 rarely detected in Eriophyoidea and includes distinct morphological dimorphism of females. A phylogenetic analysis based on amino acid alignment of translated Cox1 sequences using a large set of out-groups (a) determined that two North American congeners, T. batonrougei and T. neoquadrisetus, were the closest known relatives of T. indelis n. sp., and (b) indicated that Old and New World seed-inhabiting Trisetacus from junipers do not form a distinct clade, suggesting a possible independent transition to living in seeds of junipers in America and Eurasia by Trisetacus spp. Our analysis produced a new topology consistent with a scenario assuming gradual reduction of prodorsal shield setation in Eriophyoidea and an ancient switch from gymnosperms to other hosts. Additionally, our analysis did not support monophyly of Trisetacus; recovered a new host-specific, moderately supported clade comprising Trisetacus and Nalepellinae (Nalepella + Setoptus) associated with Pinaceae; and questioned the monophyly of Trisetacus associated with Cupressaceae.

AB  - Simple Summary The presence of substructures within isolated subpopulations can increase the risk of inbreeding. This ultimately leads to a reduction in overall genetic diversity and increased susceptibility to disease or other environmental stressors. Small subpopulations are more susceptible to genetic drift, where random events can lead to significant changes in genetic composition. This can be problematic for conservation measures aimed at preserving certain genetic traits. The Hungarian Mangalica with three different colour variants (Blonde, Red, Swallow-Bellied), representing three different breeds, have maintained their genetic and phenotypic appearance unchanged since 1976. As all breeds have been kept in multiple herds over a long period of time, the assessment of population subdivision based on these herds could help in investigating the dynamic change in population structure associated with conservation. In our study, the population substructure of each breed was evaluated using the concept of Wright-F statistics, and the results were presented using graphical methods (heat maps). The results showed that none of the breeds analysed had a composition of substructure. This favourable phenomenon is the result of an adequate migration among the herds, which proves the appropriateness of the applied breeding programme.Abstract In conserving the genetic diversity of domestic animal breeds, strategies that emphasise between-breed diversity may not be optimal, as they neglect within-breed variation. The aim of the present study was to assess the extent of population subdivision in three Mangalica pig breeds and the contribution of migration to their substructure. Wright's FST coefficient was calculated based on genealogical data with breeding animals born between 1981 and 2023, with three colour variants (Blonde, Swallow-Belly and Red). These Wright's FST coefficients were analysed using multidimensional scaling to reveal the population substructure. The average FST coefficient was 0.04 for the Blonde breed and 0.047 for the Swallow-Belly and Red Mangalica breeds, while these parameters were lower in the active herds at 0.03 and 0.04, respectively. The migration of individuals between herds was 61.63% for the Blonde breed and 75.53% and 63.64% for the Swallow-Belly and Red Magalica breeds, respectively. No population substructure was observed in any of the Mangalica breeds, which can be explained by the extensive migration between herds.

AB  - Dopamine (DA) signalling in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) motivates behavior in part by adjusting the exerted effort according to the anticipated value of the outcome. Here we examined the effects of optogenetic activation or inhibition of the glutamatergic ventral subiculum (vSub) to NAc pathway on motivation to work for food rewards and locomotor behavior. Using a novel probe that combines optical stimulation with microdialysis, we show that channelrhodopsin2 (ChR2)-mediated activation of these glutamatergic afferents increased DA efflux in the NAc. This protocol also selectively influenced motivation to seek food in a progressive-ratio (PR) task by re-invigorating lever-pressing, but only during a period of reduced motivation following failure to achieve food reward (i.e., after the breakpoint, BP). Importantly, identical ChR2-mediated photostimulation parameters failed to affect the rate of operant responding in the PR segment prior to reaching the BP. In contrast, during the segment of vigorous lever-pressing prior to the BP, halorhodopsin-mediated optogenetic inhibition of gluta-matergic vSub-NAc activity caused an immediate and sustained suppression of food-seeking behavior. Based on these results, we conclude that glutamatergic vSub-NAc afferents can modulate food-seeking behavior, including 'response vigor', as a function of present motivational state. In a 'low-motivational state' following failure to achieve an anticipated reward, optogenetic stimulation of this pathway can reinvigorate lever-pressing behavior. In turn, inhibition of this glutamatergic pathway appears to decrease motivated responding. These data may be relevant to dysregulated motivational states common to psychiatric conditions, including depression, schizo-phrenia, and substance use disorders.

AB  - Antimicrobial resistances are emerging as one main threat to worldwide human health and are expected to kill 10 million people by 2050. Intensive livestock husbandry, along with biogas digestate, are considered as one of the biggest ARG reservoirs. Despite major concerns, little information is available on the diversity and abundance of various ARGs in small to large scale pig farms and biogas digestate slurry in Germany, followed by their consequent removal using microfiltration (MF)-nanofiltration (NF) process. Here, we report the identification and quantification of 189 ARGs in raw manure and digestate samples, out of which 66 ARGs were shared among manures and 53 ARGs were shared among both manure and digestate samples. The highest reported total ARG copy numbers in a single manure sampling site was 1.15 x 10(8) copies/100 mu L. In addition, we found the absolute concentrations of 37 ARGs were above 10(5) copies/100 mu L. Filtration results showed that the highly concentrated ARGs (except aminoglycoside resistance ARGs) in feed presented high log retention value (LRV) from 3 to as high as 5 after the MF-NF process. Additionally, LRV below 2 was noticed where the initial absolute ARG concentrations were <= 10(3) copies/100 mu L. Therefore, ARG removal was found to be directly proportional to its initial concentration in the raw manure and in digestate samples. Consequently, some ARGs (tetH, strB) can still be found within the permeate of NF with up to 10(4) copies/100 mu L.

AB  - Pasteurella multocida can cause goat hemorrhagic sepsis and endemic pneumonia. Respiratory epithelial cells are the first line of defense in the lungs during P. multocida infection. These cells act as a mechanical barrier and activate immune response to protect against invading pathogenic microorganisms. Upon infection, P. multocida adheres to the cells and causes changes in cell morphology and transcriptome. ATAC-seq was conducted to determine the changes in the chromatin open region of P. multocida-infected goat bronchial epithelial cells based on transcriptional regulation. A total of 13,079 and 28,722 peaks were identified in the control (CK) and treatment (T) groups (P. multocida infection group), respectively. The peaks significantly increased after P. multocida infection. The specific peaks for the CK and T groups were annotated to 545 and 6632 genes, respectively. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed that the specific peak-related genes in the T group were enriched in immune reaction-related pathways, such as Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis, MAPK signaling pathway, bacterial invasion of epithelial cells, endocytosis, and autophagy pathways. Other cellular component pathways were also enriched, including the regulation of actin cytoskeleton, adherent junction, tight junction, and focal adhesion. The differential peaks between the two groups were subsequently analyzed. Compared to those in the CK group, 863 and 11 peaks were upregulated and downregulated, respectively, after the P. multocida infection. Fifty-six known transcription factor motifs were revealed in upregulated peaks in the P. multocida-infected group. By integrating ATAC-seq and RNA-seq, some candidate genes (SETBP1, RASGEF1B, CREB5, IRF5, TNF, CD70) that might be involved in the goat bronchial epithelial cell immune reaction to P. multocida infection were identified. Overall, P. multocida infection changed the structure of the cell and caused chromatin open regions to be upregulated. In addition, P. multocida infection actively mobilized the host immune response with the inflammatory phenotype. The findings provide valuable information for understanding the regulatory mechanisms of P. multocida-infected goat bronchial epithelial cells.

AB  - A trade-off between growth and defence against biotic stresses is common in plants. Fungal endophytes of the genus Epichloe may relieve this trade-off in their host grasses since they can simultaneously induce plant growth and produce antiherbivore alkaloids that circumvent the need for host defence. The Epichloe ability to decouple the growth-defence trade-off was evaluated by subjecting ryegrass with and without Epichloe endophytes to an exogenous treatment with gibberellin (GA) followed by a challenge with Rhopalosiphum padi aphids. In agreement with the endophyte-mediated trade-off decoupling hypothesis, the GA-derived promotion of plant growth increased the susceptibility to aphids in endophyte-free plants but did not affect the insect resistance in endophyte-symbiotic plants. In line with the unaltered insect resistance, the GA treatment did not reduce the concentration of Epichloe-derived alkaloids. The Epichloe mycelial biomass was transiently increased by the GA treatment but at the expense of hyphal integrity. The response of the phyllosphere bacterial microbiota to both GA treatment and Epichloe was also evaluated. Only Epichloe, and not the GA treatment, altered the composition of the phyllosphere microbiota and the abundance of certain bacterial taxa. Our findings clearly demonstrate that Epichloe does indeed relieve the plant growth-defence trade-off.
   A debate has been raised if fungal endophytes can relieve the plant growth-defence trade-off. Epichloe endophytes decoupled the trade-off: the growth-mediated penalisation of plant defences was observed in E- but not in E+ plants. The Epichloe production of alkaloids was likely the decoupling mechanism.

AB  - Agricultural losses brought about by insect herbivores can be reduced by understanding the strategies that plants use against insect herbivores. The two main strategies that plants use against herbivory are resistance and tolerance. They are, however, predicted to be mutually exclusive, yet numerous populations have them both (hence a mixed defense strategy). This has been explained, among other alternatives, by the non-linear behavior of the costs and benefits of resistance and tolerance and their interaction with plants' mating system. Here, we studied how non-linearity and mating system affect the evolutionary stability of mixed defense strategies by means of agent-based model simulations. The simulations work on a novel model that was built upon previous ones. It incorporates resistance and tolerance costs and benefits, inbreeding depression, and a continuously scalable non-linearity. The factors that promoted the evolutionary stability of mixed defense strategies include a multiplicative allocation of costs and benefits of resistance and tolerance, a concave non-linearity, non-heritable selfing, and high tolerance costs. We also found new mechanisms, enabled by the mating system, that are worth considering for empirical studies. One was a double trade-off between resistance and tolerance, predicted as a consequence of costs duplication and the inducibility of tolerance, and the other was named the resistance-cost-of-selfing, a term coined by us, and was derived from the duplication of costs that homozygous individuals conveyed when a single resistance allele provided full protection.

AB  - Simple Summary Virtual fencing is useful for restricting animal movement in a controlled environment with cost and maintenance benefits over physical fencing. Physical fencing is also rigid, which does not allow for flexible use of grazing resources by farmers. The proposed study describes the use of a welfare-friendly virtual fence system over a typically used electric shock fence as an additional stimulus to restrict animal access to designated areas. The virtual fence was operated by an acoustic device, carried on the individual sheep. Sounds in the range of 125 Hz to 17 kHz and white noise were used to discourage seven Hebridean ewes from approaching a restricted area and feeding at a feed bowl. Two trials, performed a year apart, revealed that sounds in the range 125 to 440 Hz; 10 to 17 KHz could prevent sheep from approaching a feeding station (success rate 90%). In 78.5% of the trials, the animal behavior was observed to be the undisturbed movement away from the feed bowl when the acoustic stimulus was employed. Fencing in livestock management is essential for location and movement control yet with conventional methods to require close labour supervision, leading to increased costs and reduced flexibility. Consequently, virtual fencing systems (VF) have recently gained noticeable attention as an effective method for the maintenance and control of restricted areas for animals. Existing systems to control animal movement use audio followed by controversial electric shocks which are prohibited in various countries. Accordingly, the present work has investigated the sole application of audio signals in training and managing animal behaviour. Audio cues in the range of 125-17 kHz were used to prohibit the entrance of seven Hebridean ewes from a restricted area with a feed bowl. Two trials were performed over the period of a year which were video recorded. Sound signals were activated when the animal approached a feed bowl and a restricted area with no feed bowl present. Results from both trials demonstrated that white noise and sounds in the frequency ranges of 125-440 Hz to 10-17 kHz successfully discouraged animals from entering a specific area with an overall success rate of 89.88% (white noise: 92.28%, 10-14 kHz: 89.13%, 15-17 kHz: 88.48%, 125-440 Hz: 88.44%). The study demonstrated that unaided audio stimuli were effective at managing virtual fencing for sheep.

AB  - Simple Summary Among other limitations, the currently available vaccines against paratuberculosis do not offer complete protection against infection, and further vaccine development is limited by a lack of understanding of the mechanisms behind vaccine-induced protection. In this regard, the most recent studies have demonstrated that neutrophil function can be modulated through vaccination against several pathogens, including Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (Map). However, this modulation has not been described in ruminants, which are the natural hosts of Map. In the present work, the effect of vaccination on the neutrophil response against Map was assessed in goats using the only available vaccine against small ruminant paratuberculosis, Gudair (R). No differences were found in the ex vivo response of neutrophils isolated from non-vaccinated and vaccinated animals, which suggests that the protection conferred by this heat-inactivated vaccine is based on mechanisms other than neutrophil modulation. It is possible that neutrophil modulation depends largely on the intensity of the immune response elicited by the vaccine employed or the antigen dose, as the previous reports which observed this modulation used live attenuated vaccines or were performed in laboratory animals using experimental vaccines.Abstract Neutrophils are believed to play a role in the initial stages of paratuberculosis, and it has recently been demonstrated that vaccination can modulate their function via priming or through epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming (training). Modulation of the neutrophil response against Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (Map) through vaccination has been demonstrated in a rabbit model but not in ruminants. Therefore, in the present work, the effect of vaccination on the response of caprine neutrophils against Map was studied. Neutrophils were isolated from non-vaccinated (n = 7) and Gudair (R)-vaccinated goat kids (n = 7), before vaccination and 30 days post-vaccination. Then, several neutrophil functions were quantified ex vivo: cell-free and anchored neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) release, phagocytosis, and the differential expression of several cytokines and TLR2. The induction of cell-free NETosis and TLR2 expression by Map is reported for the first time. However, vaccination showed no significant effect on any of the functions studied. This suggests that the protection conferred by Gudair (R) vaccination is based on mechanisms that are independent of the neutrophil function modulation. Further research into the impact of alternative vaccination strategies or the paratuberculosis infection stage on ruminant neutrophil function could provide valuable insights into its role in paratuberculosis.

AB  - Stable isotope analysis is increasingly being used to assess diet and trophic positions of animals. Such assessments require estimates of trophic discrimination factors (TDFs)-offset between the isotopic composition of diet and animal tissues-with imprecise applications of TDFs leading to biased conclusions in resource use. Because TDFs are unavailable for most species, ecologists often apply values from taxonomically similar species or use trophic step increases of approximately 1 parts per thousand for carbon (TDF-delta C-13) and 3 parts per thousand for nitrogen (TDF-delta N-15). Such practices may yield inaccuracies since TDFs vary greatly, even within a species. To better understand the factors that influence TDFs, we conducted a meta-analysis of TDF-delta C-13 and TDF-delta N-15 for mammals and quantified variation in relation to consumer type (herbivore, omnivore, carnivore) and diet source (C-3-based, C-4-based, marine-based, mixture). Additionally, to guide TDF choice, we used an isotopic data set of small mammal tissues and diet items to assess how predicted dietary contributions vary with TDFs estimated using (1) taxonomic relatedness, (2) consumer type and diet source, or (3) values derived from wild animals eating natural diets. Our meta-analysis revealed that metabolic routing and interactions between consumer class, dietary source, and the protein versus energy content of diets best explained variation in TDF-delta C-13 values (-1.5 parts per thousand to 7.3 parts per thousand), whereas consumer class best explained variation in TDF-delta N-15 values (-0.5 parts per thousand to 7.1 parts per thousand). Our test of methods to estimate TDFs indicated that ecologists should avoid relying on taxonomic relatedness when selecting TDF-delta C-13 because mixed-diet lab studies may produce misleading results for herbivores and omnivores. Additionally, field-derived estimates could help fill TDF gaps where diets within a consumer class are absent. Overall, we suggest that using standard TDF trophic step values should be abandoned, because feeding studies are often poor proxies for natural diets, particularly for herbivores and omnivores. Instead, we make recommendations on how to select TDFs, along with a range of TDF-delta C-13 and TDF-delta N-15 values depending on diet source, consumer class, and tissue type. Use of these more refined recommendations and TDF values in isotopic assessments will improve estimates of diets and trophic interactions in natural systems, leading to a better understanding of ecological interactions and communities.

AB  - The Neuron-specific gene family (NSG1-3) consists of small endolysosomal proteins that are critical for trafficking multiple receptors and signaling molecules in neurons. NSG1 has been shown to play a critical role in AMPAR recycling from endosomes to plasma membrane during synaptic plasticity. However, to date nothing is known about whether NSG1 is required for normal behavior at an organismal level. Here we performed a battery of behavioral tests to determine whether loss of NSG1 would affect motor, cognitive, and/or affective behaviors, as well as circadian-related activity. Consistent with unique cerebellar expression of NSG1 among family members, we found that NSG1 was obligatory for motor coordination but not for gross motor function or learning. NSG1 knockout (KO) also altered performance across other behavioral modalities including anxiety-related and diurnal activity paradigms. Surprisingly, NSG1 KO did not cause significant impairments across all tasks within a given modality, but had specific effects within each modality. For instance, we found increases in anxiety-related behaviors in tasks with multiple stressors (e.g., elevation and exposure), but not those with a single main stressor (e.g., exposure). Interestingly, NSG1 KO animals displayed a significant increase in locomotor activity during subjective daytime, suggesting a possible impact on diurnal activity rhythms or vigilance. Surprisingly, loss of NSG1 had no effect on hippocampal-dependent learning despite previous studies showing deficits in CA1 long-term potentiation. Together, these findings do not support a role of NSG1 in hippocampal-dependent learning, but support a role in mediating proper neuronal function across amygdalar and cerebellar circuits.

AB  - Plants invest a substantial fraction of their resources into defence against herbivores, with the highest levels of defence often allocated only to the most valuable tissues. Plants in the genus Erysimum (Brassicaceae) have evolved the ability to produce novel cardenolides, in addition to ancestrally conserved glucosinolates. While these plants co-express both defences, differences in tissue-specific expression might represent an effective cost-saving strategy. Larvae of the glucosinolate-resistant diamondback moth Plutella xylostella occasionally feed on Erysimum cheiranthoides but tend to avoid younger leaves. Here, we predict that caterpillar feeding preference is shaped by variations in cardenolide levels. Thus, we quantified within-plant variations in defence and nutritional traits of vegetative or early reproductive plants and performed feeding assays to evaluate the relative importance of cardenolides. In accordance with optimal defence theory (ODT), the youngest leaves contained the most nutrients and had highest levels of cardenolides, glucosinolates and trichomes, with more extreme within-plant differences found in reproductive plants. Caterpillars consistently avoided the well-defended youngest leaves, both on whole plants and detached leaf discs. Surprisingly, neither experimental addition (external application) nor removal (CRISPR-Cas9 knockout) of cardenolides significantly affected caterpillar feeding preference. Physical and chemical defences, including cardenolides, co-vary within E. cheiranthoides to maximize defence of youngest leaves. While P. xylostella clearly responds to some of these traits, the prominent cardenolide defence appears to lack potency against this specialist herbivore. Nonetheless, the careful regulation and re-mobilization of cardenolides to younger leaves during plant development suggests an important role in plant functioning.

AB  - Often referred to as the "Third Pole", the Tibetan Plateau combines high elevation, extreme cold temperatures, hyper-aridity, and low oxygen levels. The strategy that early populations adopted to adapt to the harsh environment of the Tibetan Plateau has always attracted much attention. However, relevant studies have predominantly focused on the relatively lower elevation northeastern part of the Tibetan Plateau (<3000 m a.s.l.), with limited study in areas of ultrahigh elevation (>3500 m a.s.l.). This paper employed the flotation method and charcoal analysis of survey profiles from thirteen archaeological sites in the ultrahigh-elevation region of the middle Yarlung Zangbo River basin on the southern Tibetan Plateau, and finds that ancient people have been active in this region since the last deglaciation. The primary fuel sources used by ancient populations were small trees such as sea buckthorn (Hippophae gyantsensis) and shrubs such as juniper (Juniperus). The widespread use of undesirable wood (dwarf thorny shrub) like Sophora moorcroftiana and Caragana, along with the phenomenon of many sites relying on a single taxon, reflects the prevalent issue of fuel scarcity in this ultrahigh-elevation region. This might have been a driving factor for the early adoption of animal dung as a primary fuel source by ancient populations on the southern Tibetan Plateau.

AB  - Severe kinds of uterine inflammation in animals cause reproductive and economic problems. Although there are changes in prostaglandin (PG) production and noradrenergic uterine innervation during endometritis, the role of noradrenaline (NA) and adrenoreceptors (ARs) in PGF2 alpha formation is not yet fully understood. To recognize noradrenergic control of the PGF2 alpha generation on the cellular level during endometritis, the action of NA as well as alpha 1-, alpha 2- and beta-ARs on protein abundances of PGF synthase (PGFS) and PG 9-ketoreductase/carbonyl reductase (CBR1) in the Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-influenced pig endometrial epithelial cells and PGF2 alpha release from these cells were studied. The epithelial cells were exposed to LPS and NA alone; LPS with NA; LPS with agonists of alpha 1-, alpha 2- and beta-Ars; LPS with antagonists of beta 1-, beta 2- and beta 3-ARs with NA; and LPS with antagonists of beta 1-, beta 2- and beta 3-ARs in combinations with agonists of beta 1-, beta 2-, and beta 3-ARs for 24 h. PGFS and CBR1 protein abundances in cells were determined by Western blotting and PGF2 alpha medium content by ELISA. LPS alone increased CBR1 protein abundance and PGF2 alpha release by epithelial cells in reference to the control value. NA alone exerted a stimulatory effect on PGFS and CBR1 protein abundances and PGF2 alpha secretion. After the exposure of cells to LPS with NA together, CBR1 protein abundance, as well as PGF2 alpha release, was higher than in response to LPS and NA alone. PGFS protein abundance was increased by LPS with NA together compared to LPS action alone. In LPS-exposed endometrial epithelial cells, NA acting by beta 2- and beta 3-ARs leads to a rise in CBR1 protein abundance and PGF2 alpha secretion. beta 2-ARs also participate in the NA excitatory effect on PGFS protein abundance. The NA effect on all the parameters tested is not mediated by alpha 1- and alpha 2-ARs. beta 2- and beta 3-ARs mediate the stimulatory effect of NA on PGF2 alpha generation and secretion by the LPS-exposed pig endometrial epithelial cells. The results suggest that these cells may be a significant source of PGF2 alpha under noradrenergic stimulation in the inflamed endometrium, and NA affects processes controlled by PGF2 alpha during endometritis in an indirect manner.

AB  - Introduction: Grazing dairy ewes are often heavily challenged by parasitic infections, which represent one of the most important concerns in sheep farming due to their impacts on dairy sheep production. Objectives: The objectives of the present study were (i) to compare the short (i.e., albendazole) and long (i.e., eprinomectin) persistent effect of these anthelmintics in reducing infections by gastrointestinal nematodes (GIN) in ewes and (ii) to determine these effects on milk yield and quality in naturally infected with GIN dairy ewes. Methods: On each farm, 40 selected ewes were divided into four similar groups on Day 0 based on their fecal egg counts (eggs per gram of feces; epg) as follows: Group 1-control group; Group 2-albendazole-treated group; Group 3-pour-on eprinomectin-treated group; Group 4-injectable eprinomectin-treated group. Fecal egg counts and coprocultures were performed on Days 0, 15, 30, 45, 60 and 75. The milk yield and milk quality (i.e., fat and protein concentration and somatic cell counts) were estimated on the aforementioned occasions. Results: Eprinomectin outperformed albendazole in treating gastrointestinal nematode infections in dairy ewes. Both pour-on and injectable eprinomectin formulations provided long-lasting protection by reducing fecal egg counts (i.e., from 92.1% to 99.9%). Furthermore, eprinomectin-treated ewes exhibited increased daily milk yield and improved milk composition in terms of fat and protein concentrations and somatic cell counts. Conclusions: These findings highlight the benefits of long-persistent efficacy of eprinomectin as a preferred anthelmintic treatment for lactating dairy ewes, offering enhanced productivity and milk quality, while addressing parasite resistance concerns.

AB  - The present study evaluated the effect of supplementation of retinol in the vitrification solution on the viability, apoptosis and development-related gene expression in vitrified buffalo preantral follicles. Preantral follicles isolated from cortical slices of ovaries were randomly assigned into three groups: Group1-Control fresh preantral follicles; Group 2-Vitrification treatment (Vitrification solution 1 (VS1) -TCM-199 + 25 mM HEPES + Foetal bovine serum (FBS) 10%, Ethylene glycol (EG): 10%, Dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO): 10%, Sucrose-0.3 M for 4 min; VS2- TCM-199 + 25 mM HEPES + FBS10%, EG:25%, DMSO: 25%, Sucrose:0.3 M for 45 s); Group3-vitrification treatment +5 mu M of Retinol. Preantral follicles were placed in corresponding vitrification medium and plunged into liquid nitrogen (-196 degrees C). After a week, the follicles were thawed and analysed for follicular viability and gene expression. There was no significant difference in the viability rates among the Group 1(Fresh preantral follicles) (91.46 +/- 2.39%), Group 2 (89.59 +/- 2.46%) and Group 3 (87.19 +/- 4.05%). There was a significantly (p < .05) higher mRNA expression of BCL2L1, GDF-9 and BMP-15 in the vitrification + retinol group compared with the control group. There was a significantly (p < .05) higher expression of Caspase-3 and Annexin-5 in the vitrification group and Vitrification + retinol group compared with control group of follicles. It is concluded that the supplementation of 5 mu M of Retinol in Vitrification solution was an efficient vitrification procedure for the vitrification of buffalo preantral follicles.

AB  - Tropical milkweed (Asclepias curassavica) serves as a host plant for monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) and other insect herbivores that can tolerate the abundant cardiac glycosides that are characteristic of this species. Cardiac glycosides, along with additional specialized metabolites, also contribute to the ethnobotanical uses of A. curassavica. To facilitate further research on milkweed metabolism, we assembled the 197-Mbp genome of a fifth-generation inbred line of A. curassavica into 619 contigs, with an N50 of 10 Mbp. Scaffolding resulted in 98% of the assembly being anchored to 11 chromosomes, which are mostly colinear with the previously assembled common milkweed (A. syriaca) genome. Assembly completeness evaluations showed that 98% of the BUSCO gene set is present in the A. curassavica genome assembly. The transcriptomes of six tissue types (young leaves, mature leaves, stems, flowers, buds, and roots), with and without defense elicitation by methyl jasmonate treatment, showed both tissue-specific gene expression and induced expression of genes that may be involved in cardiac glycoside biosynthesis. Expression of a CYP87A gene, the predicted first gene in the cardiac glycoside biosynthesis pathway, was observed only in the stems and roots and was induced by methyl jasmonate. Together, this genome sequence and transcriptome analysis provide important resources for further investigation of the ecological and medicinal uses of A. curassavica.

AB  - Simple Summary: In the context of large-scale production, it is necessary to improve ewes health status and reproductive performance to promote newborns survival rate and later fattening performance. Previous studies have indicated that phenolic acids could change the host rumen microflora and inhibit pathogenic bacteria to ensure rumen health and host body health. However, there are few studies on isochlorogenic acid (ICGA) in ruminants. Therefore, based on regulating the rumen environment of breeding ewes during the whole physiological period, the experiment was conducted to study the effects of ICGA on rumen fermentation, microbial diversity and immunity of ewes at estrus, pregnancy and lactation stages. The experimental data obtained showed that adding ICGA could regulate ewes rumen fermentation mode, optimize microbial flora of different physiological stages by increasing Bacteroidota relative abundance while reducing Firmicutes relative abundance, maintain rumen microbial homeostasis at the pregnancy stage, and increase ewes blood immuneglobulin content, thereby improving ewes health. The effects of isochlorogenic acid (ICGA) on ewes rumen environment, microbial diversity, and immunity at different physiological stages (estrus, pregnancy and lactation) were studied in this experiment. Twenty healthy female Hu lambs of 1.5 months with similar body weight (17.82 +/- 0.98 kg) and body condition were selected and randomly divided into two groups: the control group (CON) and the ICGA group (ICGA). The lambs of CON were fed a basal diet, while the lambs of ICGA were supplemented with 0.1% ICGA based on the basal diet. Lambs rumen fermentation characteristics, microbial diversity and immunity at estrus, pregnancy, and lactation stages were determined and analyzed, respectively. The results showed that the rumen pH in CON increased first and then decreased as lambs grew (p < 0.05). However, it showed the opposite change in ICGA. The content of ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) showed the highest at estrus stage in both groups, but it was significantly higher in ICGA than that in CON (p < 0.05). The Acetic acid/propionic acid (A/P) ratio at estrus stage and the volatile fatty acids (VFAs) at pregnancy stage in ICGA were significantly higher than those of the CON (p < 0.05). The 16S rDNA sequencing analysis showed that the Shannon, Chao 1 and ACE indexes of the ICGA were significantly higher than those of the CON both at estrus and lactation stages (p < 0.05), while they showed higher at the pregnancy stage in CON (p > 0.05). Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that there were significant differences in rumen microorganism structure between CON and ICGA at all physiological stages (p < 0.01). At the phylum level, compared with the CON, Firmicutes relative abundance of three physiological stages decreased (p > 0.05) while Bacteroidota increased (p > 0.05). The relative abundance of Synergistota at estrus stage and Patescibacteria at the lactation stage increased significantly too (p < 0.05). At the genus level, compared with the CON, the relative abundance of Prevotella at three stages showed the highest (p > 0.05), while the relative abundance of Succiniclasticum, unclassified_Selenomonadaceae and Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group showed different abundances at different physiological stages in ICGA. Compared with the CON, the lambs of the ICGA showed higher blood IgG, IgM, and TNF- alpha contents at three physiological stages and higher IL-6 contents at pregnancy stage (p < 0.05).
   Conclusion: Adding ICGA could regulate ewes rumen fermentation mode at different physiological stages by increasing rumen NH3-N at estrus, VFAs at pregnancy, and the ratio of A/P at lactation. It optimizes rumen microbial flora of different physiological stages by increasing Bacteroidota relative abundance while reducing Firmicutes relative abundance, maintaining rumen microbial homeostasis at pregnant stage, increasing the number of beneficial bacteria in later lactating and ewes blood immunoglobulins content at three physiological stages.

AB  - Background Molecular genetics has been extremely useful in determining the relation between animal populations and documenting the degrees of genetic variation found within them. The present study was undertaken to evaluate genetic diversity and the relationships between the three camel populations reared in Egypt: Maghrabi, Sudani, and Baladi using mitochondrial 16S sequences and other breeds of camels in the world. Methods Blood samples were collected from camels belonging to these three populations. Genomic DNA was extracted from the collected blood samples and subjected to PCR using specific primers for mitochondrial 16S region. The amplified products were purified using DNA purification kit to remove residual primers and dNTPs. Sequencing was performed in the Macrogen Incorporation. The amplified products were submitted to GenBank/NCBI under accession numbers OM 278349 and OM 278350 Results Sequencing was done on the partial mitochondrial 16S amplified fragments at 530 bp. This amplified area had two haplotypes. There was one substitution (G/A) at nucleotide 309 of the amplified segment. The nucleotide (pi) and Hd stand for haplotype diversity, respectively, at 0.00008 and 0.042, and the average number of pairwise nucleotide differences, k, is 0.042, according to Fu's Fs statistic and Tajima's D, which is -1.10686. Genetic distance percentages between the three populations under study range from 0.000 to 0.0312. A phylogenetic analysis of Egyptian camel populations and other Camelus dromedarius populations revealed a strong relationship between them. Conclusions This study suggests that the 16S rRNA sequencing in mitochondria plays a critical role in genetic variation studies and analysis of phylogeny between camel populations and breeds.

AB  - Numerous studies have shown that plant shading can promote the quality of green tea. However, the association of shading with metabolic regulation in tea leaves and roots remains unelucidated. Here, the metabolic profiling of two tea cultivars ("Xiangfeicui" and "Jinxuan") in response to shading and relighting periods during the summer season was performed using non-targeted metabolomics methods. The metabolic pathway analyses revealed that long-term shading remarkably inhibit the sugar metabolism such as glycolysis, galactose metabolism, and pentose phosphate pathway in the leaves and roots of "Xiangfeicui," and "Jinxuan" were more sensitive to light recovery changes. The lipid metabolism in the leaves and roots of "Xiangfeicui" was promoted by short-term shading, while it was inhibited by long-term shading. In addition, the intensity of the flavonoid metabolites in the leaves and roots of "Jinxuan" were upregulated with a trend of rising first and then decreasing under shading, and five flavonoid synthesis genes showed the same trend (F3H, F3 ' 5 ' H, DFR, ANS, and ANR). Simultaneously, the amino acids of the nitrogen metabolism in the leaves and roots of the two cultivars were significantly promoted by long-term shading, while the purine and caffeine metabolism was inhibited in the leaves of "Xiangfeicui." Interestingly, CsGS1.1 and CsTSI, amino acid synthase genes was upregulated in the leaves and roots of two cultivars. These results indicated that shading could participate in carbon and nitrogen metabolic regulation of both leaf and root, and root metabolism could have a positive association with leaf metabolism to promote the shaded tea quality.

AB  - Skin infections by keratinophilic fungi are commonly referred to as dermatophytosis and represent a major health burden worldwide. Although patient numbers are on the rise, data on virulence factors, their function and kinetics are scarce. We employed an ex vivo infection model based on guinea pig skin explants (GPSE) for the zoonotic dermatophyte Trichophyton (T.) benhamiae to investigate kinetics of the virulence factors subtilisin (sub) 3, sub 6, metallocarboxypeptidase A (mcpA) and isocitrate lyase (isol) at gene level for ten days. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) were used to detect and quantify the transcripts, respectively. Kingdom-spanning, species-specific and virulence factor-specific probes were successfully applied to isolated fungal elements showing inhomogeneous fluorescence signals along hyphae. Staining results for inoculated GPSE remained inconsistent despite thorough optimization. qPCR revealed a significant increase of sub 3- and mcpA-transcripts toward the end of culture, sub 6 and isol remained at a low level throughout the entire culture period. Sub 3 is tightly connected to the de novo formation of conidia during culture. Since sub 6 is considered an in vivo disease marker. However, the presented findings urgently call for further research on the role of certain virulence factors during infection and disease.

AB  - Driven by a large digital simulation environment, CFD calculation software is used to simulate test results so that they can be effectively applied to engineering practice. This paper explores the suitable outdoor wind environment for residential areas in the hot summer and the cold winter. Taking Xishan Huijing in Changsha as an example, the most unfavorable wind field environment is used as the boundary condition, and the optimal design mode for this residential area is explored based on the Butterfly platform. The research in this paper is mainly divided into five steps: (1) using Rhino 7.0 to establish a 3D model; (2) using the Butterfly 0.0.05 platform to simulate the wind field and export the data at the same time, and to realize the preview through the visualization method; (3) processing the exported simulation data and the calculation of related indices; (4) applying the entropy-based TOPSIS method on the MATLAB 2020 platform to rank the preferred scheme and obtain the corresponding index weights; and (5) using a K-means cluster analysis on SPSS 26 software to optimize the scheme. The results show that (1) the wind environment quality will be overestimated in the summer if the influence of neighboring buildings on the site is not considered, while the opposite is true in the winter, with the error of both reaching two times. (2) The weights of the indicators determined by the TOPSIS entropy weighting method indicate that wind protection in the winter should be prioritized over natural ventilation in the summer in this area. The maximum wind speed in the winter has the most significant weight, reaching 0.287, and the uniformity of the wind field in the summer is the most important, reaching 0.1102. (3) In the layout design of the residential district, the staggered layout of the 60 m high slab houses in the northern, northeastern, and northwestern directions of the site creates a better wind field environment, which attains the highest score by the TOPSIS entropy weighting method, reaching 0.1539, with the second highest score, reaching 0.1511, for the layout method. The research results will provide a scientific basis for the design of residential buildings in the hot-summer and cold-winter regions in China, and also help designers to better grasp the outdoor wind environment of residential buildings in the pre-design stage.

AB  - The selection of oviposition sites by female moths is crucial in shaping their progeny performance and survival, and consequently in determining insect fitness. Selecting suitable plants that promote the performance of the progeny is referred to as the Preference-Performance hypothesis (or 'mother-knows-best'). While root infestation generally reduces the performance of leaf herbivores, little is known about its impact on female oviposition. We investigated whether maize root infestation by the Western corn rootworm (WCR) affects the oviposition preference and larval performance of the European corn borer (ECB). ECB females used leaf volatiles to select healthy plants over WCR-infested plants. Undecane, a compound absent from the volatile bouquet of healthy plants, was the sole compound to be upregulated upon root infestation and acted as a repellent for first oviposition. ECB larvae yet performed better on plants infested below-ground than on healthy plants, suggesting an example of 'bad motherhood'. The increased ECB performance on WCR-infested plants was mirrored by an increased leaf consumption, and no changes in the plant primary or secondary metabolism were detected. Understanding plant-mediated interactions between above- and below-ground herbivores may help to predict oviposition decisions, and ultimately, to manage pest outbreaks in the field.
   The leaf herbivore Ostrinia nubilalis can detect and selectively lay eggs on maize plants infested by the root herbivore Diabrotica virgifera, resulting in a lower performance of its progeny. Undecane was the sole volatile to be induced in leaves of root infested plants and shaped the oviposition behaviour of O. nubilalis females.

AB  - Fusarium head blight (FHB) caused by Fusarium graminearum complex is a worldwide devastating disease of wheat, barley, maize, and other cereals. In the field, application of fungicides is one of the main strategies for management of FHB. With the long-time usage of fungicides, resistant pathogen populations have become a new challenge for disease management. Application of new pesticide is necessary for sustainable control of this disease. The phenylpyrrole fungicide fludioxonil has been registered recently for management of FHB. However, the resistance mechanisms of F. graminearum to this compound are largely unknown. Here we isolated a biocontrol bacterium Burkholderia pyrrocina W1, which produced the antifungal compound pyrrolnitrin and showed greatly antagonistic activity towards FHB. Spontaneous mutants of pyrrolnitrin-resistant F. graminearum were induced and re-sequenced. Single base mutations were identified in the genes encoding the osmoregulation MAP kinase Hog1 and the AMP dependent kinase Snf1 in pyrrolnitrin-resistant mutants. Snf1 was further confirmed to interact with Hog1 and involved in the response of this fungus to pyrrolnitrin and its derivate, the fungicide fludioxonil. This study reveals that the Snf1 interacts with Hog1 to regulate fludioxonil resistance in a pathogenic fungus.

AB  - The hypothesis of this study was that multiparous ewes are more attractive to rams than nulliparous ewes, leading to more intense courtship and mating displays by rams in competitive environments. Thus, this study aimed to compare the sexual interactions of multiparous or nulliparous estrous ewes tested together or individually with sexually active males. Seven sexually experienced Corriedale rams, 21 multiparous, and 21 nulliparous Corriedale ewes were used. Competitive and individual sexual behavior tests were performed for 3 consecutive days immediately after estrous detection. Seven rams were tested with seven different dyads of one multiparous and one nulliparous female daily, totaling 14 ewes per day. The competitive sexual behavioral test evaluated a ram together in a pen with one multiparous ewe and one nulliparous ewe for 10 min. In the individual sexual behavioral test, each ram was tested twice for 10 min, with the same multiparous and nulliparous females used in the competitive sexual tests. The sexual behaviors of rams were recorded in both tests, and ewes' behaviors were registered in the competitive sexual tests. During the competitive sexual tests, rams approached, mated, and tended to sniff the multiparous ewes before the nulliparous ewes (p=0.03; p=0.01; p=0.056, respectively). In those tests, rams mated the multiparous ewes more efficiently than nulliparous ones (p=0.002), meaning that rams mounted multiparous fewer times to ejaculate. The number of flehmens and their length were greater in nulliparous than in multiparous (0.01 and 0.002, respectively). The nulliparous ewes urinated more times and tended to do it in greater duration and tended to walk more than the multiparous (p=0.01; p=0.06; p=0.08, respectively). During the individual sexual behavioral tests, rams showed no differences in the sexual behaviors displayed toward multiparous and nulliparous females. In conclusion, multiparous ewes were preferred as sexual partners over nulliparous ewes, with rams showing greater efficiency in ejaculating with multiparous ewes. This increased sexual attractiveness was primarily due to the ewes' attractive signals rather than their proceptive behaviors. However, multiparous and nulliparous ewes were courted and mated similarly when rams had no choice, increasing the likelihood of reproduction in both groups. While nulliparous ewes signaled their reproductive status more frequently through urination, this signal did not compensate for the other signals provided by multiparous ewes, which contributed to their higher sexual attractiveness. These findings offer practical insights, emphasizing the importance of separating multiparous and nulliparous ewes to optimize reproductive outcomes in collective breedings.

AB  - Diet conversion is a key stage of seahorse aquaculture. Herein, we set up five groups to evaluate the probiotic effects of Enterococcus faecium supplementation on the growth, development, intestinal health, and immunity of big-belly seahorses (Hippocampus abdominalis) during this stage, including control (C) (no E. faecium), H2 (1 x107 CFU mL-1, every 2 d), H4 (1 x107 CFU mL-1, every 4 d), L2 (1 x105 CFU mL-1, every 2 d), and L4 (1 x 105 CFU mL-1, every 4 d) groups. After 48 d culture, concentration and frequency of E. faecium supplementation, as well as their interaction, were confirmed to have significant effects on growth performance of seahorses (P < 0.05). Body weight, specific growth rate, body weight increase, standard length and standard length increase of H4 and L4 groups were significantly higher (P < 0.05); Ovary weight but not testis weight and brood pouch length significantly increased in H4 group (P < 0.05); Feed intake increased (P < 0.05), while feed conversion ratio significantly reduced in H4 group (P < 0.05); Together with the increase of intestinal absorption area (P < 0.05) and digestive enzymes in H4 group, it suggests that the increased growth performance of big-belly seahorses may be attributed to the integrated improvements in food intake, digestion, and absorption capacity. Additionally, significant increase of expression of intestinal immune-related genes, and remodeling of both intestinal micro-biota and their functions endowed seahorses with healthier intestinal environment, which resulted in the in-crease of survival rate by 50% against pathogenic Edwardsiella tarda challenge. Constructing comprehensive evaluation systems of both growth performance and probiotic effects for the first time could help us determine the best application strategy of E. faecium during the diet conversion period of big-belly seahorse aquaculture. This finding may provide a novel reference for the application of E. faecium in seahorse aquaculture.

AB  - We evaluated the effectiveness of using a blend of volatiles that attract Cotesia vestalis, a specialist parasitoid wasp of diamondback moth (DBM) larvae, to control DBM larvae on cabbage plants under open field conditions. We set three dispensers of the synthetic C. vestalis attractant together with one sugary-food feeder in a cabbage plot (10 m x 1 m; the treated plot) on one side of a pesticide-free open agricultural field (approximately 20 m x 20 m) from June to September in 2010 and July to August in 2011. On the other side of the field, we created a control cabbage plot of the same size in which neither dispensers nor a feeder was set. The incidences of DBM larvae and C. vestalis cocoons in the control and treated plots were compared. In 2010, the incidence of DBM larvae in the treated plot was significantly lower than that in the control plot. Poisson regression analyses in 2010 showed that the rate of increase in the number of C. vestalis cocoons along with an increase in the number of DBM larvae in the treated plot was significantly higher than that in the control plot. In 2011, the incidence in both the treated and control plots remained low (five larvae per plant or less) with no significant difference between the plots. Poisson regression analyses in 2011 showed that the number of C. vestalis cocoons in the treated plot was significantly higher than that in the control plot, irrespective of the number of DBM larvae. This 2-year field study suggested that the dispensers recruited native C. vestalis from the surrounding environment to the treated plot, and the dispensers controlled the number of DBM larvae in 2010 when the density of DBM larvae exceeded the economic injury levels for the cabbage crop. We also compared the incidences of other arthropods in the control and treated plots. The incidences of Pieris rapae larvae and Plusiinae spp. were not affected by the treatments. The number of aphids in the treated and control plots was inconsistent between the 2 years. Based on these 2-year results, the possible use of C. vestalis attractants in open agricultural fields is discussed.

AB  - Foliar water uptake (FWU) is considered to be a common phenomenon in most terrestrial plants. As a supplementary water source, it plays an important role in the growth and survival of plants in arid areas. However, there is no research to explain the water absorption of plant leaves from the perspective of gender specificity. To this end, we carried out a leaf water absorption capacity experiment and in situ wetting field experiment, respectively, in the early (Initial), middle (Mid) and end (End) of the growth season of male and female Populus euphratica. The results of the leaf water absorption capacity experiment showed that the FWU capacity of male and female P. euphratica showed an increasing trend with the growth period and reached the maximum at the End period. The FWU capacity of female P. euphratica was significantly greater than that of male P. euphratica after the Initial stage. The water absorption speed (k) of male and female leaves also increased with the growth period, but the increase was not significant. The increase in leaf water content per mg of water absorbed per unit of leaf area (LWCA) of male P. euphratica was always greater than that of female P. euphratica. Specific leaf area (SLA), leaf water saturated deficit (WSD) and water absorption parameters (FWU capacity, k) were significantly correlated. The results of the in situ wetting field experiment show that humidification significantly increased the predawn water potential (Mid period) of female and male P. euphratica leaves and the net photosynthetic rate (Mid period) of male P. euphratica leaves, but had no significant effect on chlorophyll fluorescence parameters and anatomical structure. The MFA results show that the water status of male and female P. euphratica leaves was significantly correlated with photosynthetic parameters, fluorescence parameters and anatomical parameters. Our results show that the foliar water uptake capacity of female P. euphratica leaves was stronger than that of male P. euphratica and shows significant dynamic changes during the growing season. This was because female P. euphratica has a developed water storage structure. Foliar water uptake can effectively improve the water status and photosynthetic capacity of male and female P. euphratica, and this improvement was more significant during the most intense period of soil water stress. These findings will deepen our understanding of the ecological adaptation of dioecious plants to foliar water uptake.

AB  - Emerging studies show that melatonin promotes cashmere development through hypodermic implantation. However, the impact and underlying mechanisms are currently unknown. In vitro study has previously demonstrated that melatonin induces cashmere growth by regulating the proliferation of goat secondary hair follicle stem cells (gsHFSCs), but there is limited information concerning the effects of melatonin on cell pluripotency. It is also known that Wnt signaling may actively participate in regulating cell proliferation and stem cell pluripotency. Therefore, in the current investigation, goat hair follicle stem cells were exposed to multiple concentrations of melatonin and different culture times to reveal the relationship between melatonin and the activation of Wnt signaling. A proportionally high Catenin beta-1 (CTNNB1) response was induced by 500 ng/L of melatonin, but it was then suppressed with the dosages over 1,000 ng/L. Greater amounts of CTNNB1 entered the cell nuclei by extending the exposure time to 72 h, which activated transcription factor 4/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 and promoted the expression of the proliferation-related genes C-MYC, C-JUN, and CYCLIND1. Moreover, nuclear receptor ROR-alpha (ROR alpha) and bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) were employed to analyze the underlying mechanism. ROR alpha presented a sluggish concentration/time-dependent rise, but BMP4 was increased dramatically by melatonin exposure, which revealed that melatonin might participate in regulating the pluripotency of hair follicle stem cells. Interestingly, NOGGIN, which is a BMP antagonist and highly relevant to cell stemness, was also stimulated by melatonin. These findings demonstrated that melatonin exposure and/or NOGGIN overexpression in hair follicle stem cells might promote the expression of pluripotency markers Homeobox protein NANOG, Organic cation/carnitine transporter 4, and Hematopoietic progenitor cell antigen CD34. Our findings here provided a comprehensive view of Wnt signaling in melatonin stimulated cells and melatonin mediated stemness of gsHFSCs by regulating NOGGIN, which demonstrates a regulatory mechanism of melatonin enhancement on the growth of cashmere.

This system encompasses both the diets of nematodes and how the food is obtained. The types of evidence used to evaluate trophic relationships and the inferences that can be drawn from each are evaluated. The general morphological and ecological characteristics of each trophic type are detailed, and a morphological key is presented. This information will enable the trophic relationships of any valid genus of nematodes to be assessed, along with currently undescribed genera, provided their affinities to existing genera can be ascertained. The system and list can add value to ecological, environmental and biodiversity studies where there is no morphological information, for example in environmental sequencing or metabarcoding studies.

KW  - piglet performance
AB  - Simple Summary
   This study identified positive effects on piglet welfare and growth rates when housed in free lactation pens compared with conventional farrowing crates. Free lactation pens allow piglets unrestricted interaction with the sow and increased space allowance; this improved behavioural development of piglets thus resulted in fewer instances of damaging behaviour toward littermates in this study. Piglets also benefit from better access to the udder for feeding in free lactation pens, with those piglets reared in such pens having better growth rates than those in conventional farrowing crates.
   Piglet mortality, especially due to crushing, is a concern in pig production. While current systems use farrowing crates to reduce mortality, they present major animal welfare problems for the sow. This study investigated the effects of free lactation farrowing accommodation on the welfare of piglets born and reared in such accommodation when compared with conventional farrowing crates. Piglets were born to sows in one of two farrowing accommodation treatments and followed from birth to slaughter. Treatments were conventional farrowing crates (control, n = 24 litters) and free lactation pens, which were larger and allowed the sow freedom of movement both pre and post farrowing, (free, n = 22 litters) (675 total piglets). Individual weights were recorded from birth to slaughter. Hoof score was recorded at weaning. Behaviour was recorded during lactation and during the weaner stage. Pre-weaning percentage mortality was equal in treatments (free = 15.95 +/- 2.31, control = 14.42 +/- 2.15, p = 0.61). Final weight was influenced by treatment (p < 0.05) with pigs from free lactation pens significantly heavier at 114.73 kg compared to 110.82 kg for control pigs. Free pigs took fewer days than control pigs to reach the target weight of 105 kg (147.6 vs. 149.23 days). Throughout lactation, fewer instances of damaging behaviour (ear and tail biting) were observed in free pigs (p = 0.07). Improved growth rates and a decrease in damaging behaviours provide evidence to suggest that pigs from free lactation pens experience improved welfare when compared with control pigs.

AB  - The food habits and behavior of medium and large-sized mammals that visited natural salt-licks in a tropical rainforest of Belum-Temengor Forest Complex, Peninsular Malaysia, were analyzed to understand the purpose of their salt-lick visits. The study was conducted at the wet-type salt-licks, where the animals drink clear water, thus the ingestion of clay particles needed for detoxification of plant secondary compounds, one of the possible purposes of salt-lick visits, seemed very low. Ten herbivorous, seven omnivorous, and four carnivorous species were recorded at the salt-licks. 95.3% of all video capture records of animals at the salt-licks were of herbivores, while the records of omnivores and carnivores were only 3.5% and 1.2%, respectively. These results indicated that herbivores visited studied salt-licks much more frequently than other food-habit species. The herbivores also tended to stay longer at the salt-licks than omnivores and carnivores. In addition, water-drinking behaviors were recorded significantly more frequently in herbivores (73% of video captures) than in omnivores (28%) and carnivores (0%). The carnivores showed only resting, passing, and hunting behaviors. The results suggest that the studied salt-licks were mainly used by herbivores and some omnivores, possibly to supplement minerals and/or alleviate gastrointestinal problems by drinking salt-lick water.

AB  - Thyroid hormones (THs) require iodine for biosynthesis and play critical roles in brain development. Perchlorate is an environmental contaminant that reduces serum THs by blocking the uptake of iodine from the blood to the thyroid gland. Using a pregnant rodent model, we examined the impact of maternal exposure to perchlorate under conditions of dietary iodine deficiency (ID) on the brain and behavior of offspring. We observed modest reductions in thyroxine (T4) in the serum of dams and no effect on T4 in pup serum in response to maternal exposure to 300 ppm of perchlorate in the drinking water. Likewise, serum T4 was reduced in ID dams, but, as with perchlorate, no effects were evident in the pup. However, when ID was coupled with perchlorate, reductions in pup serum THs and transcriptional alterations in the thyroid gland and pup brain were detected. These observations were accompanied by reductions in the number of cortical inhibitory interneurons containing the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin (Pvalb). Alterations in Pvalb expression in the neonatal brain were associated with deficits in the prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle in adult male offspring and enhanced fear conditioning in females. These findings support and extend structural defects in the brain previously reported in this model. Further, they underscore the critical need to consider additional non-chemical stressors in the determination of hazards and risks posed by environmental contaminants that affect the thyroid system.

AB  - Resistant host crop genotypes often, express dissimilar susceptibility reactions against geographically distinct populations of herbivorous insects. Such response variability complicates the identification of potential stable sources of plant resistance against pest insects. Here, we collected populations of the spotted stem borer Chilo partellus from eight different geographical regions in India, reared them on six different maize genotypes (i.e., CPM 2, CPM 8, CPM 18, CPM 19, CML 345: resistant check and Basi Local: susceptible check) and mapped variations in their biological performance and amino acid profiles. A laboratory-maintained C. partellus culture was used as comparison population. The feeding of dif-ferent geographical C. partellus populations on diverse maize genotypes resulted in significant differences in total develop-mental period, larval weight and survival, and the amounts of 17 amino acids. The amounts of certain amino acids were higher in larvae feeding on CML 345 and CPM 2, lower in CPM 8, CPM 18 and Basi Local genotypes, and placed the C. partellus populations in five distinguished groups. The Jhansi and Delhi populations had higher and Raichur lower amount of all the test amino acids when fed across maize genotypes, except Aspartic acid which was higher in Hisar and lower in Coimbatore and Hyderabad geographical populations. Maximum changes were found in aliphatic and hydroxyl group of amino acids across ecological C. partellus populations. Furthermore, the amino acid profile of the C. partellus populations fed across maize genotypes placed them in seven distinguished groups. These findings suggest that the differential uptake and assimilation capacity for various amino acids from the host plants result in diversity in the ecological populations, thus indicate presence of different ecotypes of C. partellus in India, which have implications for management of this pest using plant resistance.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Footrot is a highly contagious foot disease in sheep and a common cause of lameness. It is a major challenge for sheep industries worldwide and has great economic impact on production. Due to the pain associated with the disease, it is considered an animal welfare issue. Footrot is caused by the bacterium Dichelobacter nodosus (D. nodosus), which encompasses benign and virulent strains. Benign D. nodosus commonly causes an inflammation of the interdigital skin whereas virulent strains can lead to severe footrot with a separation of hoof horn from the underlying soft tissue as the disease progresses. The objectives of this field study were to determine the prevalence of D. nodosus in a wide range of sheep flocks across Germany using swab samples from the interdigital skin of the feet. Due to the high prevalence of 42.93% of D. nodosus in the German sheep population, further work is required to determine measures on how to decrease the prevalence.
   The bacterium Dichelobacter nodosus (D. nodosus) is the causative agent of ovine footrot. The aim of this field study was to determine the prevalence of D. nodosus in German sheep flocks. The sheep owners participated voluntarily in the study. More than 9000 sheep from 207 flocks were screened for footrot scores using a Footrot Scoring System from 0 to 5 and sampling each sheep using one interdigital swab for all four feet of the sheep. The detection and discrimination between benign and virulent strains was done employing a real-time PCR. Our results showed a mean prevalence of 42.93% of D. nodosus in German sheep on an animal level. Underrunning of hoof horn on at least one foot (Scores 3-5) was detected in 567 sheep (6.13%). Sheep with four clinically healthy feet were found through visual inspection in 47.85% of all animals included in this study. In total, 1117 swabs from sheep with four clinically healthy feet tested positive for D. nodosus. In 90.35% of the positive swabs, virulent D. nodosus were detected. Benign D. nodosus were detected in 4.74% of the D. nodosus-positive swabs while 4.91% tested positive for both, benign and virulent D. nodosus. In 59 flocks D. nodosus were not detected and in 115 flocks only virulent D. nodosus were found while seven flocks tested positive for benign strains.

AB  - Background: Depression is a highly prevalent comorbidity arising in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, depression in patients with PD is poorly treated. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a neuromodulator, has the potential to relieve depression. Objective: To investigate whether H2S attenuates depression-like behaviours in a rat model of PD and examine the underlying mechanisms. Methods: We utilised rotenone to develop a PD model with subcutaneous injections in the dorsal cervical region of Sprague-Dawley rats. The depression-like behaviours in the rotenone-induced PD model rats were assessed through forced swimming, tail suspension, open field, novelty-suppressed feeding, and elevated plus-maze tests. The expression of postsynaptic density protein-95 and synapsin-1, related to synaptic plasticity, was detected using Western blot in the hippocampus. The hippocampal ultrastructure, including the synaptic density, length of the synaptic active zone, postsynaptic density thickness, and synaptic gap width, was detected using transmission electron microscopy. Results: We proved that sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS; a donor of H2S) significantly attenuated the depression-like behaviours and disorders of hippocampal synaptic plasticity in rotenone-induced PD rats. Furthermore, inhibition of the hippocampal Warburg effect by 2-deoxyglucose abolished NaHS-enhanced hippocampal synaptic plasticity and reversed NaHS-attenuated depression-like behaviours in the rotenone-induced PD rats. Conclusion: H2S attenuates PD-associated depression by improving the hippocampal synaptic plasticity in a hippocampal Warburg effect-dependent manner.

AB  - Preclinical studies show that inhibiting the actin motor ATPase nonmuscle myosin II (NMII) with blebbistatin (Blebb) in the basolateral amgydala (BLA) depolymerizes actin, resulting in an immediate, retrieval-independent disruption of methamphetamine (METH)-associated memory in male and female adult and adolescent rodents. The effect is highly selective, as NMII inhibition has no effect in other relevant brain regions (e.g., dorsal hippocampus [dPHC], nucleus accumbens [NAc]), nor does it interfere with associations for other aversive or appetitive stimuli, including cocaine (COC). To understand the mechanisms responsible for drug specific selectivity we began by investigating, in male mice, the pharmacokinetic differences in METH and COC brain exposure . Replicating METH's longer half-life with COC did not render the COC association susceptible to disruption by NMII inhibition. Therefore, we next assessed transcriptional differences. Comparative RNA-seq profiling in the BLA, dHPC and NAc following METH or COC conditioning identified crhr2, which encodes the corticotropin releasing factor receptor 2 (CRF2), as uniquely upregulated by METH in the BLA. CRF2 antagonism with Astressin-2B (AS2B) had no effect on METH-associated memory after consolidation, allowing for determination of CRF2 influences on NMII-based susceptibility. Pretreatment with AS2B prevented the ability of Blebb to disrupt an established METH-associated memory. Alternatively, combining CRF2 overexpression and agonist treatment, urocortin 3 (UCN3), in the BLA during conditioning rendered COC-associated memory susceptible to disruption by NMII inhibition, mimicking the Blebb-induced, retrieval-independent memory disruption seen with METH. These results suggest that BLA CRF2 receptor activation during memory formation in male mice can prevent stabilization of the actin-myosin cytoskeleton supporting the memory, rendering it vulnerable to disruption by NMII inhibition. CRF2 represents an interesting target for BLA-dependent memory destabilization via downstream effects on NMII.

AB  - Chronic fungal sinusitis (FS) can cause bone erosion and extend to the sellar region, often misdiagnosed as pituitary tumors or malignancies. We report a 56-year-old immunocompetent female with sphenoid FS presenting as a giant sellar mass compressing the optic chiasm, with normal pituitary function. The surgery successfully resolved her symptoms, and a histological examination confirmed the presence of a fungal hyphal mass. We conducted a literature review of 52 publications on FS cases with bone erosion and inflammatory extension to the sellar region, which included analyses of 67 patients (35 females, mean age 49.6 years, half immunocompetent). The most common symptom was headache (73.1%), followed by visual complaints (71.7%), visual deterioration (40.3%), ophthalmoplegia (38.8%), and visual field defects (13.4%). Symptom duration averaged 4.5 months in 65.7% of cases. Aspergillus was the most frequent (71.6%). Hormonal abnormalities included hypopituitarism (25.4%) and hyperprolactinemia (13.4%). Surgery was performed in 92.5% of patients. Common diagnoses included pituitary abscess (41.8%), fungal granuloma (16.4%), aspergillosis (16.4%) and allergic FS (14.9%). Antifungal therapy was administered in 53.7% of cases. Cure was achieved in 67.2%, while the mortality rate was 10.4%. Early recognition of fungal involvement, supported by a multidisciplinary approach, is essential for the accurate diagnosis and effective treatment. This highlights the need for vigilance to improve the outcomes in similar cases.

AB  - The effects of torrefaction of the biopellets made from hardwood chip residue (HW), camellia oilseed cake (CO), and pruning remnants of the toothache tree (TA) and mulberry tree (MT) were evaluated. Torrefaction of the biopellets reduced the volatile matter content of biopellets by 18-58% and increased their heating value by 18-58% without negatively impacting durability or fines content. Torrefaction also reduced the initial ignition time of biopellets by 50-59% and prolonged their combustion duration by 15-24%. Regardless of the type of feedstock, all biopellets exhibited mass yields in the range of 60-80% and energy yields ranging from 80-95%. The novelty of this study lies in the application of torrefaction to already-formed biopellets, which enhances pellet quality without the need for binders, and the use of unused forest biomass and wood chip residue from pulp mills. The use of unused forest biomass and wood chip residue from pulp mills for biopellet production not only provides a sustainable and efficient method for waste utilization but also contributes to environmental conservation by reducing the reliance on fossil fuels. Overall, the torrefaction of biopellets represents a promising technology for producing high-quality solid biofuel from a variety of woody biomass feedstocks without compromising pelletizing efficiency.

AB  - Tailings pond poses a serious threat to the surrounding environment. This study aimed to explore the current status and mechanism of Hippophae rhamnoides (H. rhamnoides) restoration in the Zhoutaizi magnetite tailings pond in Chengde city by analyzing the physicochemical properties, heavy metal content, and microbial community characteristics of the rhizosphere soil of H. rhamnoides. Rhizosphere soil samples were collected from the planting areas (10 m, 50 m, and 80 m) at distances of 10, 50, and 80 m from the mountain, the dead plants areas (D) at a distance of 80 m from the mountain, and the unplanted areas (U) in the center of the Zhoutaizi magnetite tailings pond. The available manganese (Mn) content in groups 10 m, 50 m, 80 m, and D was higher than in group U (p< 0.05). Mn contributed to the relative abundances of Articulospora, Mortierella, Minimedusa, and Knufia, but negatively correlated with that of Fusarium and Cistella (p< 0.05). These results indicated that H. rhamnoides can improve soil quality and microbial community structure by increasing Mn content. The Chao and Ace indices in groups 10 m, 50 m, 80 m and D were higher than in group U (p< 0.05), implying that H. rhamnoides can increase the total number of soil microbial species. The electrical conductivity (EC) of groups D and U was higher than that of the other groups (p< 0.05). EC was positively correlated with Cistella, while negatively correlated with Minimedusa and Knufia (p< 0.05). Therefore, we speculated that the increase of harmful bacteria and the decrease of beneficial bacteria caused by high EC were one of the reasons for H. rhamnoides death. In short, H. rhamnoides can be used to some extent for restoring magnetite tailings pond, but high EC is the main obstacle to its restoration. This study provides a theoretical basis for the construction of green mines.

AB  - Slurry application is often associated with considerable nitrogen (N) losses: ammonia (NH3), nitrous oxide (N2O) and a mostly unknown contribution of dinitrogen (N2) emission, as well as N leaching. Thus, an outdoor lysimeter experi-ment with growing winter wheat in undisturbed soil cores was set up to follow the transformation of cattle slurry 15NH4+ and soil 15NO3 - using a double labeling approach. Slurry treatments included the following application tech-niques: a trailing hose with/without acidification, and open slot injection with/without nitrification inhibitor. The fer-tilizer application rate was 67 kg N ha-1. In addition to NH3 emissions, N2O and N2 emissions were measured, as well as N contents and 15N enrichment of soil N pools and plant compartments. The major gaseous loss pathway was NH3 with up to 8 kg N ha-1 following trailing hose application, while slot injection significantly reduced NH3-N losses. Re-gardless of the application technique, N2O emissions were low (up to 0.1 kg N2O-N ha-1), while N2 emissions reached up to 3 kg N ha-1. No effect on N leaching from topsoil was found. 15N plant uptake was greater in slot injection than trailing hose treatments. An effect of the nitrification inhibitor was visible in the nitrate contents, but not in gaseous N losses or N leaching from topsoil. Impacts of the application techniques on individual soil N pools were small. The 15N recovery offered a chance to map the short-term effects and was highest in the soil Nt pool (32 % to 48 % of 15N ap-plied) with a greater contribution of microbial N than mineral N at beginning of stem elongation. Indications for high N immobilization was derived from the applied N balance approach. In the present case, slot injection scored as the best application technology based on the highest NH3 reduction, while N2 and N2O emissions were not en-hanced.

AB  - Simple Summary: Most pigs worldwide are in modern, commercial, indoor farms. There is debate on whether or not modern pig production systems meet all the needs of the animals. Pigs are able to perceive and feel and have mental capabilities that warrant attention to their welfare. The degree of on-farm animal welfare oversight varies around the world. Science is used to set animal welfare rules. However, science sometimes conflicts with cultural values (ex., religious slaughter). The focus of many animal welfare rules do not address the most significant problems on modern commercial pig farms. We believe that we should use science to determine the animal welfare needs of farm pigs but with a healthy respect for cultural differences in the ethics of animal care. We should also prevent economic neo-colonialism from forcing Western views on other cultures.
   Pigs are considered sentient beings that have a mental capability that warrants attention to their welfare. Cultural values towards animal welfare differ in world regions. Still, authors have argued for worldwide harmonization of animal welfare rules. At the same time, the focus of many animal welfare rules do not address the most significant problems on modern commercial pig farms. The foci of animal welfare rules are often on space (quantity and quality), acute painful practices, equipment, and caretaker behavior. However, most serious animal welfare issues are related to episodic events such as compromised pigs, lack of appropriately skilled staff, and human behavior (or lack thereof) towards animals. Modern technologies such as image, sound, and building oversight by automated systems can potentially provide better individual pig care. The future should bring us solutions to identify and resolve episodic negative animal welfare events. The other issues of space and painful practices are best improved by using science-based solutions. We propose that science be the key resource to making animal welfare decisions, but with a healthy appreciation and respect for cultural differences in our views of animals and the economic impact of rules. Colonialism is not viewed positively today, and economic neo-colonialism should not be allowed to replace it. Respect for cultural differences should play a role in animal welfare rules within and among countries.

AB  - This study characterized the expression of melatonin receptor type 1 (MT1) protein in sheep ovaries, evaluated melatonin effects on primordial follicle survival and development after in vitro culture of ovarian tissue and verified the possible involvement of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/protein kinase B/forkhead box O3a (PI3K/Akt/FOXO3a) pathway in the melatonin actions. Ovine ovarian fragments were cultured in alpha-modified minimum essential medium alone (alpha-MEM+) or supplemented with 100, 500, or 1000 pg/ml melatonin for 7 days. PI3K inhibition was performed through pretreatment of ovarian fragments with LY294002. Thereafter, immunohistochemistry was performed to evaluate the expression of cleaved caspase-3, Akt, phosphorylated-Akt, and phosphorylated-FOXO3a (p-FOXO3a). The immunohistochemical localization of the MT1 receptor protein was documented in sheep preantral and antral follicles. After in vitro culture, 100 pg/ml melatonin showed higher follicular survival and activation than alpha-MEM+ and other melatonin concentrations. After PI3K inhibition, there was an increase in cleaved caspase-3-positive follicles, and a decrease in the primordial follicle activation, Akt phosphorylation, and nuclear exclusion of p-FOXO3a. In conclusion, MT1 receptor protein is present in the sheep ovary. Furthermore, 100 pg/ml melatonin maintains survival and stimulates activation of primordial follicles through the PI3K/Akt/FOXO3a signaling pathway after in vitro culture of sheep ovarian tissue.

AB  - To evaluate the effects of four extenders on the post-thaw quality and fertility of goat semen, six Yunshang Black bucks' semen was collected, pooled, diluted with Andromed (R) (Andr (R)), Optidyl (R) (Opt (R)), P3644 Sigma l-phosphatidylcholine (l-alpha SL), and skim milk-based (Milk) extenders, and then cryopreserved. The sperm motilities, abnormalities, membrane and acrosome integrity, mitochondrial activity, apoptosis, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production were evaluated after thawing. After exocervical insemination with the thawed semen, the pregnancy, lambing, and twinning rates were recorded and compared. The results showed that sperm motilities, membrane integrity, acrosome integrity, mitochondrial activity, and viable spermatozoa were significantly higher in the Andr (R) and Opt (R) groups than those in the l-alpha SL and Milk groups (p < .05). Furthermore, there was no difference between Andr (R) and Opt (R) (p > .05). The sperm abnormality was lower in semen frozen with the Andr (R) or Opt (R) extenders, as compared to the l-alpha SL or Milk extender (p < .05). Regarding, the viable cells with low ROS production, the optimal results were obtained in the semen frozen with Andr (R) and Opt (R) extenders. Following exocervical insemination, the pregnancy and lambing rates in the Milk group were significantly lower than those in the other groups (p < .05). No difference was found in the pregnancy and lambing rates between Andr (R), Opt (R), and l-alpha SL (p > .05). Furthermore, the twinning rates were similar between these four groups (p > .05). In conclusion, egg yolk or skim milk can be substituted by soybean lecithin during cryopreservation of goat semen.

AB  - Gut microbiota and their metabolic processes depend on the intricate interplay of gut microbiota and their metabolic processes. Bacillus licheniformis, a beneficial food supplement, has shown promising effects on stabilizing gut microbiota and metabolites. However, the precise mechanisms underlying these effects remain elusive. In this study, we investigated the impact of polysaccharide-producing B. licheniformis as a dietary supplement on the gut microbiome and metabolites through a combination of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), histological analysis, high-throughput sequencing (HTS), and metabolomics. Our findings revealed that the B. licheniformistreated group exhibited significantly increased jejunal goblet cells. Moreover, gut microbial diversity was lower in the treatment group as compared to the control, accompanied by noteworthy shifts in the abundance of specific bacterial taxa. Enrichment of Firmicutes, Lachnospiraceae, and Clostridiales_bacterium contrasted with reduced levels of Campylobacterota, Proteobacteria, Parasutterella, and Helicobacter. Notably, the treatment group showed significant weight gain after 33 days, emphasizing the polysaccharide's impact on host metabolism. Delving into gut metabolomics, we discovered significant alterations in metabolites. Nine metabolites, including olprinone, pyruvic acid, and 2-methyl-3-oxopropanoate, were upregulated, while eleven, including defoslimod and voclosporin were down-regulated, shedding light on phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle), and the glucagon signaling pathway. This comprehensive multi-omics analysis offers compelling insights into the potential of B. licheniformis as a dietary polysaccharide supplement for gut health and host metabolism, promising significant implications for gut-related issues.

AB  - Detecting environmental exposures and mitigating their impacts are growing global public health challenges. Antibody tests show great promise and have emerged as fundamental tools for large-scale exposure studies. Here, we apply, demonstrate and validate the utility of a salivary antibody multiplex immunoassay in measuring antibody prevalence and immunoconversions to six pathogens commonly found in the environment. The study aimed to assess waterborne infections in consenting beachgoers recreating at an Iowa riverine beach by measuring immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against select pathogens in serially collected saliva samples. Results showed that nearly 80% of beachgoers had prior exposures to at least one of the targeted pathogens at the beginning of the study. Most of these exposures were to norovirus GI.1 (59.41%), norovirus GII.4 (58.79%) and Toxoplasma gondii (22.80%) and over half (56.28%) of beachgoers had evidence of previous exposure to multiple pathogens. Of individuals who returned samples for each collection period, 6.11% immunoconverted to one or more pathogens, largely to noroviruses (GI.1: 3.82% and GII.4: 2.29%) and T. gondii (1.53%). Outcomes of this effort illustrate that the multiplex immunoassay presented here serves as an effective tool for evaluating health risks by providing valuable information on the occurrence of known and emerging pathogens in population surveillance studies.

The BCL 2 protein family plays a key role in regulating apoptosis, and determines sperm survival. Aims. The objective of this study was to explore the correlation between sperm storage and the BCL 2 protein family in the oviduct of Mauremys reevesii. Methods. Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) techniques were used to investigate three parts of the reproductive tract (isthmus, uterus and vagina) of mated and unmated female M. reevesii. Key results. Hematoxylin-eosin staining revealed many sperm stored in the oviduct. IHC showed positive immunostaining for the BCL 2 and BAX proteins in epithelial ciliated and glandular cells. RT-qPCR indicated that the mRNA expressions of anti-apoptotic genes (BCL 2, MCL 1, BCL-W, BCL-XL) and the androgen receptor (AR) were significantly higher in mated turtles than unmated turtles. However, the expression of pro-apoptotic genes (BAX, BAD, BID and CASPASE 3) showed the opposite relationship. Conclusions. These results suggest that sperm entering the oviduct can promote the synthesis of anti-apoptotic genes to protect themselves from various degradation factors. Implications. These findings will help researchers understand the mechanisms of sperm storage.

AB  - 'MK5601' is an improved tea cultivar with genetic material from Camellia taliensis, a wild relative of the tea plant, Camellia sinensis. 'MK5601' differs from common tea cultivars in being rich in hydrolyzable tannins such as theogallin and G-strictinin, which have presumed health benefits. We identified two quantitative trait locus (QTL) clusters with powerful effects on hydrolyzable tannin contents in a population derived from a cross between 'MK5601' and an elite green tea cultivar 'Saeakari'. The C. taliensis-type alleles at each locus in 'MK5601' increased the hydrolyzable tannin contents. The two QTL clusters were detected in 2 years and were confirmed in another population. These clusters have pleiotropic effects on tannin biosynthesis, as they are associated also with catechin contents. There was a strong negative correlation between the contents of hydrolyzable tannins and non-galloylated catechins. Despite the remarkable compositional changes, the two QTL clusters did not affect tea flavor. These QTLs provide important basic knowledge for developing new tea cultivars and tea products with high contents of hydrolyzable tannins and good health-promoting effects.

AB  - This study investigates the impact of honey concentrations (1%, 3%, and 5%) on the physicochemical, sensory, textural, rheological, and antioxidant properties of probiotic yogurt beverages made from sheep, cow, and blended milk. Honey, used as a natural fortifier, enhanced antioxidant activity, probiotic viability, and sensory attributes, particularly flavor and viscosity. Sheep milk yogurt exhibited superior nutritional and textural properties due to its higher solid and nutrient content. Increasing honey levels improved lactic acid fermentation, gel matrix stability, and water-holding capacity, though excessive concentrations occasionally increased syneresis and reduced bacterial counts. Texture profile analysis indicated that 3% honey optimized hardness, springiness, and cohesiveness, strengthening the yogurt matrix. This study highlights honey's dual role as a sweetener and functional ingredient, enhancing yogurt beverages' health benefits, stability, and consumer appeal.

AB  - Some acoustic parameters of animal vocalisations have been shown to reliably indicate male quality and play a role in mate and rival assessment. Reindeer possess a peculiar vocal tract anatomy involving a laryngeal air sac which probably acts as an additional filter, making it a candidate species for novel investigations in the field of bioacoustics. We investigated whether some acoustic parameters of male rutting vocalisations were good indicators of age and body weight (used as an index for body size). We did this by performing acoustic analyses using recordings collected from a semi-domesticated reindeer population in northern Finland. We found the age of subadult males (aged 2.5-4.5 years) to be negatively correlated with formant F3 and formant spacing, suggesting that their vocalisations convey information on the caller's age. Individual formant frequencies were not affected by male body weight, but formant spacing was lower in heavier males. Despite the presence of the laryngeal air sac, formant spacing seems to be an acoustic parameter influencing mate and rival assessment in reindeer as it gives an honest indication of male body size. We discuss the importance of reliable acoustic cues to quality indices in sexual selection contexts.

AB  - Phytophthora palmivora is the pathogen causing bud rot in oil palm (Elaeis guineensis). This pathogen secretes effector proteins that manipulate host defenses, contributing to disease progression. In this study, we systematically investigated the role of specific effector proteins in suppressing programmed cell death (PCD) in oil palm leaflets. Our approach included using genomic and transcriptomic data from a Colombian P. palmivora isolate alongside the coexpression network of a substantial effector dataset. From this analysis, ten candidate effectors were selected, characterized, and evaluated for their ability to suppress PCD in oil palm leaflets through transient expression via biolistics. Several effectors exhibited significant anti-PCD activity in susceptible and less susceptible oil palm genotypes. Notably, the effectors Avr3F (689), RxLR (1540), and RxLR (1546) demonstrated suppression of PCD in both genotypes, while the other effectors played variable roles in PCD regulation. Phylogenetic analysis further identified distinct clades among the effectors, possibly associated with their functional activities. Additionally, specific motifs, such as RXLR-dEER, K, and Y, appeared to correlate with PCD suppression. This research enhances our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction between P. palmivora effectors and oil palm host responses, highlighting these proteins' genotype-specific regulation of PCD. The findings contribute valuable insights into plant-pathogen interactions and offer potential avenues for targeted disease control strategies in the oil palm industry.

AB  - Resistin (RETN), a recently discovered adipokine, is a cysteine-rich and secretory protein produced by adipocytes. RETN has been detected in several tissues, including human and laboratory animals' pancreas, wherein impairs glucose tolerance and insulin (INS) action and causes INS resistance. This study aims to evaluate the presence and expression of RETN in the pancreas of 15 adult female sheep reared on Apennine pastures, which show a decrease in their nutritional value due to the drought stress linked to the increasing summer aridity. The sheep were divided into 3 groups according to the diet they were subjected to: maximum pasture flowering (MxF) group, maximum pasture dryness (MxD) group, and experimental (Exp) group which received a feed supplementation in addition to the MxD group feeding. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence were performed on formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded sections of the pancreas to detect the RETN presence and to evaluate the co-localization of RETN with both glucagon (GCG)- and INS-producing cells. In addition, the expression of the three molecules was evaluated also in relation to different diets. RETN was observed only in the endocrine pancreas, showing a wide distribution throughout the pancreatic islets with few negative cells and the RETN producing cells colocalized with both alpha cells and ss cells. No differences in distribution and immunostaining intensity of RETN, GCG and INS were observed among the three groups. Quantitative PCR showed the expression of RETN, GCG and INS in all tested samples. No significant differences were observed for RETN and GCG among all three groups of sheep. Instead, a high statistically significant expression of INS was detected in the MxF group with respect to the Exp and MxD groups. These results highlight the localization of RETN in GCG- and INS-secreting cells involved in glucose homeostasis suggesting a modulatory role for RETN. Furthermore, the RETN expression is not influenced by food supplementation and thus is not affected by diet.

AB  - The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis controls the release of glucocorticoids, which regulate immune and inflammatory function by modulating cytokines, white blood cells and oxidative stress via glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling. Although the response to HPA activation is well characterized in many species, little is known about the impacts of HPA activation during extreme physiological conditions. Hence, we challenged 18 simultaneously fasting and developing elephant seal pups with daily intramuscular injections of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), a GR antagonist (RU486), or a combination of the two (ACTH+RU486) for 4 days. We collected blood at baseline, 2 h and 4 days after the beginning of treatment. ACTH and ACTH+RU486 elevated serum aldosterone and cortisol at 2 h, with effects diminishing at 4 days. RU486 alone induced a compensatory increase in aldosterone, but not cortisol, at 4 days. ACTH decreased neutrophils at 2 h, while decreasing lymphocytes and increasing the neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio at 4 days. These effects were abolished by RU486. Despite alterations in white blood cells, there was no effect of ACTH or RU486 on transforming growth factor-beta or interleukin-6 levels; however, both cytokines decreased with the 4 day fasting progression. Similarly, ACTH did not impact protein oxidation, lipid peroxidation or antioxidant enzymes, but plasma isoprostanes and catalase activity decreased while glutathione peroxidase increased with fasting progression. These data demonstrate differential acute (2 h) and chronic (4 days) modulatory effects of HPA activation on white blood cells and that the chronic effect is mediated, at least in part, by GR. These results also underscore elephant seals' extraordinary resistance to oxidative stress derived from repeated HPA activation.

AB  - Background Alzheimer's disease is accompanied by an abnormal high accumulation of cis-P tau. However, the long-term changes in behavior following tau accumulation remains under debate. The present study investigated the long-term effects of tauopathy on learning and memory, synaptic plasticity, and hippocampal cell numbers.Results Cis-P tau was microinjected into the dorsal hippocampus to generate Alzheimer's like-disease model in C57BL/6 mice. Cis-P tau injected animals showed a significant impairment in learning and memory in Y-maze and Barnes maze tests. In another group of animals, the generation of long-term potentiation (LTP) was evaluated in hippocampal slices 7 months after cis-P tau injection. LTP induction was disrupted only in the dorsal but not ventral hippocampal slices. The basal synaptic transmission was also reduced in dorsal hippocampal slices. In addition, hippocampal sampling was done, and the number of cells was assessed by Nissl staining. Obtained results indicated that the number of survived cells was significantly reduced in the dorsal and ventral hippocampus of cis P-tau injected animals compared to the animals in control group. However, the decrement of cell number was higher in the dorsal compared to the ventral hippocampus.Conclusions In conclusion, intra-hippocampal cis-P tau injection produced learning and memory impairment at 7 months after its injection. This impairment might result from LTP disruption and a significant decrease in the number of neurons in the dorsal hippocampus.

AB  - Classical psychedelics with 5-hydroxytryptamine-2A receptor (5-HT2AR) agonism have rapid antidepressant actions in patients with depression. However, there is an ongoing debate over the role of 5-HT2AR in the antidepressant-like actions of psychedelics. In this study, we compared the effects of DOI (2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine: a hallucinogenic psychedelic drug with potent 5-HT2AR agonism), lisuride (non -hallucino-genic psychedelic analog with 5-HT2AR and 5-HT1AR agonisms), and the novel antidepressant (R)-ketamine on depression-like behavior and the decreased dendritic spine density in the brain of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated mice. Saline (10 ml/kg), DOI (2.0 mg/kg), lisuride (1.0 mg/kg), or (R)-ketamine (10 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally to LPS (0.5 mg/kg, 23 h before)-treated mice. Both lisuride and (R)-ketamine significantly ameliorated the increased immobility time of forced swimming test, and the decreased dendritic spine density in the prelimbic region of medial prefrontal cortex, CA3 and dentate gyrus of hippocampus of LPS-treated mice. In contrast, DOI did not improve these changes produced after LPS administration. This study suggests that antidepressant-like effect of lisuride in LPS-treated mice is not associated with 5-HT2AR-related psychedelic effects. It is, therefore, unlikely that 5-HT2AR may play a major role in rapid-acting antidepressant actions of psychedelics although further detailed study is needed.

AB  - This study aimed to develop new prediction models that include sediment properties (pH, organic matter, and silt and clay concentrations) for estimating the potential uptake of heavy metals (HMs) by the invasive grass Vossia cuspidata. Plant and sediment samples were collected from the microsites that represent the natural distribution of the species in two Nile islands in Cairo, Egypt. The results show that the root was the main accumulating organ for the analyzed HMs (Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Ni, and Pb). The mean concentrations of Fe and Mn and the maximum concentrations of Cu, Ni, and Pb were phytotoxic. The values of the bioconcentration factor were > 1, while the translocation factor was > 1 for Zn and Cu in rhizome and stem, Mn in leaf, and Ni and Pb in stem and leaf. There were no significant differences between the measured and the predicted HM concentrations in all organs of the species. This indicates the excellent robustness of the developed regression models. Sixteen equations (out of 24) had high R-2 values. Thus, V. cuspidata could be considered a biomonitor for HM pollution, and the developed equations will benefit the prediction of HM uptake by the species in the River Nile ecosystem.

AB  - Adolescence is a critical period for brain development. In most mammalian species, disturbances experienced during adolescence constitute a risk factor for several neuropsychiatric disorders. In this study, we compared the biochemical and behavioral profile induced by postweaning social isolation (PWSI) in inbred C57BL/6 N mice with that of BTBR mice, a rodent model of autism spectrum disorders. Male C57BL/6 N mice were either housed in groups of four or isolated from weaning (postnatal day 21) for four weeks before experimental analyses. After weaning, male BTBR mice were housed four per cage and analyzed at 48 days of age. PWSI reduced hippocampal levels of type 2 metabotropic glutamate (mGlu2) receptors, and glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors. A similar reduction was seen in group-housed BTBR mice. Plasma corticosterone levels in basal conditions were not influenced by PWSI, but were increased in BTBR mice. Social investigation (total and head sniffing) and the number of ultrasonic vocalizations were reduced in both PWSI mice and age-matched group-housed BTBR mice, indicating a lower social responsiveness in both groups of mice. These results suggest that absence of social stimuli during adolescence induces an endophenotype with social deficit features, which mimics the phenotype of a mouse model of autism spectrum disorders.

   It is vitally important to unravel the evolutionary processes and potential drivers of genetic differentiation among populations in evolutionary biology. However, it remains unexplored how those drivers act on the genetic divergence among bat populations. In this study, we studied the genetic structure and evolutionary history of a bat species, Hipposideros larvatus from mainland China and Hainan Island. Using microsatellites and mtDNA to analyze genetic differentiation, we found an obvious genetic structure between the mainland and the island in H. larvatus. Integrating the genetic data, geography and climatic factors, we uncovered the combined effects including geography, environment and colonization history, on the genetic variation in H. larvatus. Our results are valuable in understanding the complex evolutionary processes among bat populations and provide implications for the conservation of island bat populations.
   Determining the evolutionary history and population drivers, such as past large-scale climatic oscillations, stochastic processes and ecological adaptations, represents one of the aims of evolutionary biology. Hipposideros larvatus is a common bat species in Southern China, including Hainan Island. We examined genetic variation in H. larvatus using mitochondrial DNA and nuclear microsatellites. We found a population structure on both markers with a geographic pattern that corresponds well with the structure on mainland China and Hainan Island. To understand the contributions of geography, the environment and colonization history to the observed population structure, we tested isolation by distance (IBD), isolation by adaptation (IBA) and isolation by colonization (IBC) using serial Mantel tests and RDA analysis. The results showed significant impacts of IBD, IBA and IBC on neutral genetic variation, suggesting that genetic variation in H. larvatus is greatly affected by neutral processes, environmental adaptation and colonization history. This study enriches our understanding of the complex evolutionary forces that shape the distribution of genetic variation in bats.

AB  - A two-year experiment (2018-2020) was arranged as a factorial in a randomized complete block design with three replicates to study the response of camelina (Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz) to irrigation regimes at different sowing dates in Karaj, Iran. The experiment factors were four irrigation regimes including full irrigation and restricted irrigation starting either from silicle formation, or flowering and stage of maximum stem length, as well as three sowing dates including September 27 (27-Sep), October 12 (12-Oct) and 25 (25-Oct). Significant reductions were recorded in agronomic (numbers of silicle per plant and seed per silicle, and 1000-seed weight) and physiologic (RWC, relative water content) and chlorophyll content) traits when plants were subjected to drought stress. In contrast, the stomatal resistance (R-s), canopy temperature (CT), proline and carbohydrate contents increased under drought conditions compared with well-watered treatment. Delay in the sowing date led to reductions in numbers of silicle per plant and seed per silicle, 1000-seed weight, RWC, and chlorophyll content. The R-s, CT, proline and carbohydrate contents of plants sown on 12-Oct and 25-Oct had higher values than in 27-Sep. The highest oil contents were obtained from the full irrigation regime (31.02%), and 27-Sep sowing date (30.04%), and on each sowing date, the maximum seed yield belonged to the full irrigation regime. Overall, a significant reduction in water consumption can happen by delaying the sowing date to 12-Oct and restricting irrigation after silicle formation regarding the slight amount of seed yield depletion compared with the later sowing date and mild- and severe-stress irrigation regimes.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of hidden environmental pollution on some blood parameters of sheep to detect susceptible biomarkers able to reveal slight contamination. Four dairy sheep farms, two with semi-extensive and two with intensive type systems were involved in this study. Two farms in different systems were chosen as properly located in a southern area of Latium (Italy), close to the Sacco River, in which contamination with beta-hexachlorocyclohexane (beta-HCH) occurred in the past due to industrial waste. A recent study established the presence of low but detectable residual contamination in these areas. The other two farms were outside the contaminated area. Erythrocyte glutathione transferase (e-GST) and oxidative stress parameters were monitored as well as some immune response and metabolic profile parameters throughout the investigated period of four months. The present study showed a relevant and significant increase in e-GST (+63%) in the extensive farming system of the contaminated area, whereas some immune response biomarkers, i.e., white blood cells, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and lysozyme resulted within the physiological range. In all farms, oxidative stress and acute phase response parameters were also within the physiological range. Our results suggest that e-GST is a very effective alarm signal to reveal "hidden" persistent contamination by beta-HCH, and reasonably, by many other different dangerous pollutants.

AB  - In seasonal anestrous goats, artificial insemination (AI) is typically preceded by hormonal treatment. This study examined whether high fertility can be achieved after AI with fresh diluted semen in progesterone (P4)-treated goats exposed to sexually active (SA) bucks. In Experiment 1, two groups of goats (n = 30 each) were joined with SA bucks (n = 2 per group) fitted with abdominal aprons. Prior to teasing, the P4-group received an intramuscular injection of 25 mg of progesterone diluted in 2 mL of olive oil, while the control group received olive oil alone. AI was performed 12 h after estrus onset within five days after buck introduction, using semen packed in 0.2 mL straws containing 80 x 10(6) spermatozoa. The kidding rate was higher in the P4-treated group (24/30, 80 %) compared to the control group (8/30, 27 %; P < 0.001). In Experiment 2, two groups (n = 30 each) were exposed to SA bucks (n = 2 per group). The control group was inseminated 12 h after estrus onset detected between six- and nine-days post-introduction, while the P4-group was inseminated within five days. Kidding rates were similar between the P4-group (26/30, 86 %) and the control group (23/30, 77 %; P > 0.05). These results indicate that P4-treated goats achieve high fertility when inseminated during the first estrus induced by males, while control goats achieve high fertility when inseminated during the second estrus.

AB  - Simple Summary Much less attention has been paid to medium and small carnivores than to large ones, leading to a shortfall of knowledge regarding their ecological roles. It is particularly necessary to improve the research on the ecological roles of medium and small carnivores in the context of the massive decline in the number of large carnivores around the world. For this purpose, a study on the ecological roles of medium and small carnivores was conducted in Liancheng Reserve, China. On the basis of constructing a spatial association network of species, we analyzed the status of medium and small carnivores in the network, characterized their association, and assessed their contribution to the maintenance of the community in the absence of large carnivores, such as gray wolf (Canis lupus) and brown bear (Ursus arctos). Furthermore, the development trends of the community were predicted in order to act as a guide for the direction and focus of conservation efforts. It is vitally important to understand the ecological roles of medium and small carnivores in the context of the massive decline in the number of large carnivores around the world. Based on a spatial association network of terrestrial birds and mammals, this study analyzed the ecological roles of medium and small carnivores in the community in Liancheng National Nature Reserve. From October 2019 to June 2020, we obtained 3559 independent detections of 20 terrestrial birds and mammals from 112 camera traps. There are seven species that are medium and small carnivores present in the study area, including red fox (Vulpes vulpes), leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis), Chinese mountain cat (Felis bieti), stone marten (Martes foina), Asian badger (Meles leucurus), Siberian weasel (Mustela sibirica) and mountain weasel (Mustela altaica). By calculating the Phi coefficient of all species pairs, a spatial association network composed of twelve species was constructed. We analyzed the characterization of spatial associations by the Shannon-Wiener index and Lambda statistic. The results showed that: (1) the status of the network reflects the changes of community composition and structure after the decline in large carnivores and other species; (2) with the exception of the Chinese mountain cat and stone marten, the other five medium and small carnivores were located in the network, which played an important role in the complexity of the network and the maintenance of the community; (3) the medium and small carnivores could not take the place of the large carnivores in order to control the population of herbivores, such as Siberian roe deer (Capreolus pygargus) and Himalayan marmot (Marmota himalayana). The results of this study provide guidance for determining the direction and focus of conservation efforts.

AB  - Simple Summary This report characterized complete thoracic ectopia cordis (EC) affecting two newborn lambs from different locations in Brazil, contributing to the knowledge about this rare condition in sheep. Two male newborn lambs presented exteriorized hearts without pericardial coverage, delineated in the thoracic cleft by a fibrous ring of the pericardium and adjacent skin. Clinical findings in the lambs, aside from the EC, were unremarkable. EC is an extremely rare congenital malformation in sheep, with limited cases documented globally. The pathogenesis and etiology remain uncertain, involving potential genetic and environmental factors.Abstract Cardiac congenital defects related to inheritance and teratogenesis have been reported in veterinary species and humans worldwide. Among these, ectopia cordis (EC), characterized by an externalized heart through a cleft, is extremely rare in sheep. This report presents the diagnostic features of two cases of complete thoracic EC in newborn lambs. Clinical findings in the lambs, aside from the EC, were unremarkable. Both animals exhibited exteriorized hearts without pericardial coverage, delineated in the thoracic cleft by a fibrous ring of the pericardium and adjacent skin. Histologically, the epicardium was thickened by fibrous tissue in both lambs, with one animal also showing marked edema, hemorrhage, and neutrophilic inflammatory infiltration. The prognosis of EC in the lambs of this study was poor, with fatal outcomes despite attempts at surgical correction.

AB  - Trichomes, the hairlike protuberances in plants, have been well known to act as the first line of defense against herbivores, and abiotic stresses, along with other structural defenses such as spines, thorns, and waxes. We previously reported the tremendous variation in trichome traits among different wild and cultivated Solanum species and demonstrated that trichomes types and density are traditionally miscalculated and often misnamed. However, intraspecific variation in trichome traits is poorly understood, although this has implications for stress tolerance and resistance breeding programs in economically important crop species and can also mediate ecological interactions at multiple trophic levels in their wild congeners. In this study, using tomato as a model, we characterized the trichomes from 10 commonly grown varieties using a minimal sample prep desktop scanning electron microscopy, and followed up with estimating their dimensions across the varieties and trichome types. We hypothesized that although trichome number may vary, the varieties will have similar trichome types, based on current literature. Our results show that there is significant variation for trichome number as well as dimensions of trichome types among these varieties. Furthermore, when we separately analyzed the number and dimensions of commonly found glandular and non-glandular trichomes, the results were consistent with broad assessment of trichomes, showing consistent variation among varieties, suggesting that trichome studies should not be limited to basic classification into glandular and non-glandular, and should accommodate the sub-types and their dimensions.

AB  - In laboratory conditions, ants can combat a pathogen infection by means of the medicinal use of reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, it is still unknown where they obtain medicinal compounds in the wild and how they use them. Due to an upregulation of ROS in response to herbivory, aphid-infested plants have been suggested to be a potential source of ROS for ants in the wild. We investigated whether infection would cause Lasius platythorax ants to change their foraging on extrafloral nectar on aphid-infested plants. We found no clear evidence for the ants significantly changing their foraging behaviour in response to the pathogen, nor for the extrafloral nectar to contain ROS. The aphids in our experiment had a relatively high concentration of ROS and future research should determine whether predation on aphids could be a potential source of both protein and ROS needed to combat a disease.

AB  - Supplementation of a mother's diet with antioxidants such as hydroxytyrosol (HTX) has been proposed to ameliorate the adverse phenotypes of foetuses affected by intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Our previous studies showed, in a porcine model of IUGR, an effect of maternal HTX supplementation on the neurotransmitter profile of several brain areas and the morphology of the hippocampus in 100 days old foetuses. The present study analyzed the impact of maternal HTX supplementation on the hippocampus proteome at this foetal age by TMT10plex labelling. Eleven differentially abundant proteins were identified by comparing both conditions, and eight of them downregulated and three upregulated in the HTX-treated group. The downregulated proteins were mainly involved in protein synthesis and RNA metabolism and may explain the differences in neuron differentiation in the HTX-treated group. The upregulated proteins were related to cell detoxification and could represent a potential mechanism to explain the neuroprotective effect of HTX.

AB  - Advanced maternal age (AMA) denotes an age of >= 35 years during the time of delivery. Maternal metabolism affects the offspring's physical and neurological development as well as their cognitive function. This study aimed to elucidate the effects of exercise training among old female animals on the cognitive function, hippocampal neuroplasticity, mitochondrial function, and apoptosis in the offspring. We found that the offspring of mothers with AMA without exercise training had decreased spatial learning and memory, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) protein levels, neurogenesis, and mitochondrial function, as well as hippocampal cell death. Contrastingly, offspring of mothers with AMA with exercise training showed improved spatial learning, memory, hippocampal neuroplasticity, and mitochondrial function. These findings indicate that despite the AMA, increasing fitness through exercise significantly contributes to a positive prenatal environment for fetuses. The maternal exercises augmented the hippocampal levels of BDNF, which prevents decreased cognitive function in the offspring of mothers with AMA.

AB  - Background: Pseudorabies virus (PRV), a member of the family Herpesviridae, is responsible for significant economic losses in the pig industry and has recently been associated with human viral encephalitis, leading to severe neurological symptoms post-recovery. Despite the widespread impact of PRV, there are currently no approved effective drugs for treating PRV-related diseases in humans or pigs. Therefore, the exploration and discovery of safe and effective drugs for the prevention and treatment of PRV infection is of paramount importance. Purpose: The objective of this study is to screen and identify natural compounds with antiviral activity against PRV. Methods: First, we used a strain of PRV with green fluorescent protein (PRV-GFP) to screen a natural product chemical library to identify potential antiviral drugs. Next, we assessed the antiviral abilities of salvianolic acid A (SAA) in vitro using virus titer assay, qPCR, and IFA. We investigated the mechanisms of SAA's antiviral activity through viral attachment, internalization, inactivation, and nuclease digestion assay. Finally, we evaluated the efficacy of SAA in inactivating PRV using mice as the experimental subjects. Results: This study screened 206 natural compounds for anti-PRV activity in vitro, resulting in the identification of seven potential antiviral agents. Notably, SAA emerged as a promising candidate with significant anti-PRV activity. The mechanism of action may be that SAA can directly inactivate the virus by disrupting viral envelope. In vivo experiments have shown that pre-incubation of SAA and PRV can effectively inhibit the infectivity and pathogenicity of PRV in mice. Conclusion: This study offers valuable insights into the antiviral properties of SAA, potentially informing strategies for controlling PRV epidemics and treating related diseases in both humans and animals.

AB  - Recent studies have demonstrated the crop uptake of antibiotics (ABs) from soils treated with AB-carrying fertilisers. However, there is a lack of plot-scale studies linking their effects at the agronomic and metabolomic/ transcriptomic level to their impact on human health. This paper assesses the plant uptake of 23 ABs following two productive cycles of lettuce and radish cropped with sewage sludge, pig slurry, the organic fraction of municipal solid waste, or chemical fertilisation under plot-scale conditions (32 plots spanning 3-10 m(2) each). AB uptake by plants depended on both the vegetable and the AB class and was higher in radish than in lettuce edible parts. Levels ranged from undetectable to up to 76 ng/g (fresh weight). Repetitive organic fertilisation resulted in an increase in the concentration of ABs in lettuce leaves, but not in radish roots. Significant metabolomic and transcriptomic changes were observed following soil fertilisation. Nevertheless, a human health risk assessment indicates that the occurrence of ABs in lettuce or radish edible parts does not pose any risk. To our knowledge, this is the first holistic plot-scale study demonstrating that the use of organic fertilisers containing ABs is safe for crop security and human health.

AB  - Simple Summary: Leptospirosis is one of the most neglected zoonotic diseases in the world and humans can easily acquire the pathogen after exposure to water, soil, or mud contaminated with urine from infected animals. In September 2018, a leptospirosis outbreak caused by a pathogenic Leptospira genospecies interrogans was identified in one farm in North Sardinia, Italy. In addition, culture and isolation of a saprophytic Leptospira genospecies montravelensis from two urine samples (from one pig and one donkey) was reported for the first time, indicating that co-infection with more than one strain of Leptospira in the same reservoir host is possible. These results provide new information on the epidemiology of leptospirosis and on the genotypes circulating in Sardinia, emphasizing the conducting of active surveillance of leptospirosis in humans and animals.
   Abstract: Saprophytic leptospires are spirochetes enclosed within the non-pathogenic clade of the genus Leptospira, which in turn is subdivided into two subclades S1 and S2. To date, the microorganisms included in these subclades have been isolated from the environment in various parts of the world, and are believed to have no known animal reservoirs. After a case of Leptospira interrogans serovar Pomona was notified to the owner of a farm in Sardinia, all of the farm animals (11 pigs and 3 donkeys) were examined for the presence of Leptospira. Sera of all tested animals resulted positive for antibodies to Leptospira using a microscopic agglutination test (MAT). Moreover, nine (82%) kidney samples from pigs and three urine samples collected from donkeys (100%) tested positive for Leptospira DNA after qPCR. Results obtained after MLST analysis and sequencing of rrs, rpoB, and secY genes, performed on six Leptospira strains isolated in culture, revealed the presence of the genomo-species L. interrogans serovar Pomona in the kidney samples. Conversely, whole-genome sequencing combined with mean nucleotide identity revealed the presence of the saprophytic L. montravelensis in the urine samples. Our results report, for the first time, the isolation of a saprophytic species from mammalian urine, suggesting a new ecological specialization for these bacteria, with a possible transition from free-living to a symbiotic lifestyle. Further studies will have to be conducted to understand the evolution of virulence of these bacteria, potential infectivity, and possible public health implications.

AB  - Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) intrusion onto the continental shelf significantly affects basal melting of ice shelves, oceanographic and ecological processes in the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP). Understanding the changes in CDW upwelling and its impacts on marine ecology during historical periods is urgent. Here, we presented a new reconstruction for the variability in CDW intrusion onto the WAP over the past 1500 years by using the cadmium (Cd) concentrations in southern elephant seal hairs collected from King George Island. In addition, multi-proxies including the abundance of seal hairs and TOC, TN, LOI, and bio-elements in the sediments were integrated to infer historical seal populations by using the Generalized Additive Models (GAMs). The overall trend of Cd concentrations was well consistent with those of primary productivity and sea ice, reflecting the contribution of CDW on regional oceanic environment and ecology. Notably, during a period of similar to 900-500 yr BP, enhanced CDW intrusion allowed for increased regional marine productivity and decreased sea ice, and ultimately promoting an increase in seal populations. Enhanced CDW intrusion was possibly driven by southward shift and intensification of the Southern Hemisphere westerly wind. These results indicated that large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns were coupled with regional oceanic circulation and ecological processes of the Southern Ocean.

AB  - Investigating the well-established relationships between insects and novel host plants will shed light on numerous aspects of evolution and ecology of phytophagous insects. However, in these systems, it is not always clear which plants were originally used as insect hosts, and how the focal insects adapted to the original host(s), before establishing the novel insect-host relationships. Henosepilachna vigintioctomaculata (Motschulsky) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) is a well-known pest of the potato Solanum tuberosum (Solanaceae), however its original host in Honshu, the main island of Japan, before the potato introduction is uncertain. A wild solanaceous weed, So. megacarpum, is the most likely candidate for the original host, although the use of this plant by H. vigintioctomaculata has never been recorded in Honshu. This study reports the occurrence of a H. vigintioctomaculata population depending almost solely on So. megacarpum at Yamagata, northern Honshu. Additionally, the host-use ability of this population was compared to that of a pest population under laboratory conditions. Based on the results obtained, it is discussed how the properties of beetles on So. megacarpum facilitated the use of the potato, assuming that So. megacarpum was the original host of H. vigintioctomaculata in Honshu.

AB  - Sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) is an important transcription factor that controls lipid metabolism and adipogenesis. Two isoforms, SREBP1a and SREBP1c, are generated by alternative splicing of the first exon of the SREBF1 gene. The porcine SREBF1 gene has mainly been studied for its role in lipid metabolism in adipose tissues, but little is known about its involvement, and the role of its two isoforms, in adipogenesis. The aim of the present study was to introduce a deletion in the 5 '-regulatory region of the SREBF1c gene, considered crucial for adipogenesis, using the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) method. This approach allows for the evaluation of how inhibiting SREBF1c transcription affects the expression of other genes essential for adipocyte differentiation, particularly PPARG, CEBPA, CEBPB, CEBPD, GATA2, and FABP4. It was observed that disrupting the SREBF1c isoform had no effect on the GATA2 gene but did result in a decrease in the expression of the CEBPA and CEBPD genes, an increase in the expression of CEBPB, and an inhibition in the expression of the PPARG and FABP4 genes. These changes in gene expression blocked adipogenesis, as could be seen by the failure of lipid droplets to accumulate. Our results provide evidence highlighting the pivotal role of the SREBP1c isoform in the regulation of porcine adipogenesis.

AB  - Growing evidence suggests that adverse intrauterine environments could affect the long-term health of offspring. Recent evidence indicates that gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is associated with neurocognitive changes in offspring. However, the mechanism remains unclear. Using a GDM mouse model, we collected hippocampi, the structure critical to cognitive processes, for electron microscopy, methylome and transcriptome analyses. Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) and RNA-seq in the GDM fetal hippocampi showed altered methylated modification and differentially expressed genes enriched in common pathways involved in neural synapse organization and signal transmission. We further collected fetal mice brains for metabolome analysis and found that in GDM fetal brains, the metabolites displayed significant changes, in addition to directly inducing cognitive dysfunction, some of which are important to methylation status such as betaine, fumaric acid, L-methionine, succinic acid, 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid, and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). These results suggest that GDM affects metabolites in fetal mice brains and further affects hippocampal DNA methylation and gene regulation involved in cognition, which is a potential mechanism for the adverse neurocognitive effects of GDM in offspring.

AB  - Sperm are redox-regulated cells, and deregulation of their redox status is considered to affect male fertility and to reduce their fertilizing ability following biotechnological procedures, such as cryopreservation. Cystine (CysS), after incorporation in sperm via SLC7A11 antiporter, has been demonstrated to increase intracellular GSH content, the most important non enzymatic antioxidant. This study was aimed at investigating the role of SLC7A11 antiporter on frozen-thawed stallion sperm ability to respond to in vitro capacitating environment after post-thaw incubation with CysS and/or Sulfasalazine (SS), a specific inhibitor of SLC7A11 antiporter. Viability, motility, immunolocalization of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins and the ability to bind to heterologous zonae pellucidae were evaluated. Thawed sperm from seven stallions (2 ejaculates/stallion) was washed and resuspended in Tyrodes media; each thawed ejaculate was divided in Control (CTR) and 3 samples supplemented with: 0.5 mM Cystine (CysS), 500 mu M Sulfasalazine (SS) and 0.5 mM CysS thorn 500 mu M SS (CysS thorn SS). After 1 h of incubation at 37 degrees C, samples were washed twice, resuspended in capacitating BWW medium and incubated at 38 degrees C under 5% CO2. After 30 and 60 min, sperm motility, viability and tyrosine phosphorylated protein immunolocalization, used as capacitation status index, were evaluated. After 30 min of capacitation, 4 x 10(5) sperm were co-incubated with denuded pig oocytes in capacitation medium for 30 min for the heterologous binding assay. None of the sperm parameters studied (motility, viability and tyrosine phosphorylation) showed any difference respective to control. The number of sperm bound per oocyte (mean +/- SEM) tended to increase in CysS group (44.0 +/- 12.3) respect CTR (40.8 +/- 10.8) while decreased in SS group (32.4 +/- 7.8) (p < 0.01). Moreover, CysS thorn SS group showed a lower binding rate (32.0 +/- 10.0) compared to CysS (p < 0.001). Our results suggest that CysS supplementation of thawed stallion sperm can influence their ability to bind to heterologous zona pellucidae as the inhibition of CysS incorporation by SLC7A11 reduced the number of sperm bound per oocyte. This effect does not seem to be ascribed to a modification of sperm motility, membrane integrity and tyrosine phosphorylation. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The purpose of this trial was to evaluate serum levels of oxidative stress biomarkers and biochemical analytes in crossbred lambs during the rearing phase in an integrated crop-livestock system (ICLS) to control gastrointestinal parasites. The experiment used 36 crossbred lambs (cross: Ile de France x White Dorper x Texel) divided into two groups. The WCS group was supplemented with whole cottonseed (WCS), and controls had no supplementation. Body weight, blood collection, and fecal analysis of nematode eggs and Eimeria oocysts counting per gram of feces were performed for each animal within 84 days of experiment. The following serum analytes were determined: total protein, albumin, globulin, cholesterol, haptoglobin, and 10 oxidative stress biomarkers: cupric reducing antioxidant capacity, ferric reducing ability of plasma, trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity, thiol, uric acid, paraoxonase-1, total oxidant status, ferric-xylenol orange, advanced oxidation protein products, and reactive oxygen metabolites derived compounds. The inclusion of WCS suggested the benefit in controlling infection as well as inducing an increase in antioxidants and a decrease in oxidants in lambs naturally infected by gastrointestinal parasites. The combination of WCS and ICLS could be a useful tool in controlling gastrointestinal parasite infection without affecting the production performance.

AB  - Simple Summary Inspections of pigs before (antemortem) and after (postmortem) being slaughtered are part of the official controls carried out in European abattoirs. The ability of data obtained from the antemortem inspections to predict lesions eventually found during postmortem inspections has not been thoroughly investigated so far. In this study, data obtained from inspections performed both ante- and postmortem in heavy pigs slaughtered in Italy were analyzed, determining the prevalence of the most common lesions and conditions found during the ante- and postmortem inspections and exploring the correlation between these findings. The most common findings were the presence of manure on more than the 30% of the body and pleurisy for antemortem and postmortem inspections, respectively. Some conditions found during the antemortem inspections were predictive of lesions reported during postmortem inspections. For instance, respiratory and kidney lesions were more likely to occur in pigs presenting manure on more than the 30% of the body, whereas dermatitis and skin wounds were more likely to be present in pigs showing skin lesions during the antemortem inspections. The results of this study show that information obtained from the antemortem inspection of pigs can be useful to characterize farms using a risk-based approach and to address the organization of official controls in slaughterhouses. Pigs slaughtered in European abattoirs must be submitted to antemortem inspection (AMI) and postmortem inspection (PMI), as required by the current European legislation in the matter of official controls. AMI and PMI are equally essential to guarantee food safety and to monitor swine health and welfare. However, little is known about the ability of AMI to predict conditions that are possibly found during PMI. In this study, such a correlation was explored together with the assessment of conditions typically found during AMI and PMI in heavy pigs slaughtered in two Italian slaughterhouses. An assessment scheme containing 13 variables for AMI and 34 lesions for PMI was used for the scope. The herd size was also considered as a variable and included in the study. A total of 24,510 pigs and 30,961 pigs were assessed during AMI and PMI, respectively. The most common conditions found were manure on the body covering more than 30% of the body (dirt >30%) and pluck lesions ('pleurisy', 'pericarditis', and 'pneumonia') for AMI and PMI, respectively. A significant correlation (p < 0.05) between some antemortem (AM) findings and postmortem (PM) conditions was found. In particular, the AM conditions 'dirt >30%'and 'skin lesions' were positively related with PM conditions 'skin wounds' and 'dermatitis', while the complexes of respiratory and kidney lesions were predicted only by the condition 'dirt >30%'. The variable 'standardized herd size' was negatively associated with 'milk spot liver' and positively associated with 'arthritis/bursitis'. The results of this study show that findings reported during AMI can potentially be used to predict certain conditions found in pigs at PMI. These data can be useful for the competent authorities in characterizing swine farms using a risk-based approach and in developing systems and specific plans for official controls.

Drawing upon the predictive processing framework and the Predictive, Interactive Multiple Memory System (PIMMS) model in particular, the paper highlights the hierarchical organization of memory systems and the interaction between top-down predictions and bottom-up sensory input, proposing that PEs promote synaptic change and improve encoding and consolidation processes. We discuss the neuroscientific mechanisms under-lying PE-driven memory enhancement, focusing on the involvement of the hippocampus, the entorhinal cortex-hippocampus pathway, and the noradrenergic sympathetic system. Recognizing the divergent trajectories of episodic and semantic memory across the lifespan is crucial when examining the effects of PEs on memory. This review underscores the heterogeneity of memory processes and neurocognitive mechanisms underlying PE-driven memory enhancement across age. Future research is suggested to directly compare neural networks involved in learning from PEs across different age groups and to contribute to a deeper understanding of PE-driven learning across age.

AB  - Regurgitation behavior is a defense strategy present in several insect orders where herbivorous prey may acquire secondary noxious metabolites from plants and store them to later orally excrete when threatened. Research on regurgitation has focused on its chemical composition, its relationship with diet, and its noxious effect on predators. However, virtually nothing is known about the proximal mechanisms eliciting this behavior. As regurgitation is expected to be closely connected with the structure and control of the gut, we aimed to determine whether pressure applied to different body regions (head, thorax, hind legs and abdomen) of the grasshopper elicited different responses. We found distinctly different regurgitation responses when stimulating different body regions. Stimulation on thorax triggered regurgitation most frequently, possibly due to the anatomical placement of the neural control of the gut. Additionally, we tested regurgitation responses between different instars and found that regurgitation was less likely to occur in adults than in the 4th and 5th nymphal instars. These findings suggest that the developmental differences between nymphs and adults contribute to the regurgitation behavior. Overall, our results provide a baseline for future research on the physiology behind the control of the regurgitation behavior.

AB  - Simple Summary Olive mill waste-water (OMWW) is a liquid waste produced by the olive oil industry that has been recently regarded as a good source of polyphenols. Phenolic molecules are among the most active secondary molecules in the gut for their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects. They may also contribute to positively changing the distribution of gut microbial species, but their effects have not been widely explored in pigs. The intestinal porcine epithelial cell line IPEC-J2 represents a good model for the study of innate immunity and inflammatory response in animal intestinal diseases and has already been used to investigate the effect of phytogenic feed additives on swine intestinal epithelium. This study aimed to evaluate the in vitro effects of an OMWW extract enriched in polyphenols on Salmonella typhimurium (S. typhimurium) infection in IPEC-J2 cells. Polyphenols extracted from OMWW showed the ability to regulate the host-pathogen interaction by decreasing S. typhimurium invasiveness and modulating the expression of many innate immune genes.Abstract The dietary supplementation of olive oil by-products, including olive mill waste-water (OMWW) in animal diets, is a novel application that allows for their re-utilization and recycling and could potentially decrease the use of antibiotics, antimicrobial resistance risk in livestock species, and the occurrence of intestinal diseases. Salmonella serovar typhimurium is one of the most widespread intestinal pathogens in the world, causing enterocolitis in pigs. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of an OMWW extract enriched in polyphenols (hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol) in the immune response of an intestinal porcine epithelial cell line (IPEC-J2) following S. typhimurium infection. Cells were pre-treated with OMWW-extract polyphenols (OMWW-EP, 0.35 and 1.4 mu g) for 24 h and then infected with S. typhimurium for 1 h. We evaluated bacterial invasiveness and assayed IPEC-J2 gene expression with RT-qPCR and cytokine release with an ELISA test. The obtained results showed that OMWW-EP (1.4 mu g) significantly reduced S. typhimurium invasiveness; 0.35 mu g decreased the IPEC-J2 gene expression of IL1B, MYD88, DEFB1 and DEFB4A, while 1.4 mu g down-regulated IL1B and DEFB4A and increased TGFB1. The cytokine content was unchanged in infected cells. This is the first study demonstrating the in vitro immunomodulatory and antimicrobial activity of OMWW extracts enriched in polyphenols, suggesting a protective role of OMWW polyphenols on the pig intestine and their potential application as feed supplements in farm animals such as pigs.

AB  - Retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4), a member of the lipocalin family, is a specific carrier of retinol (vitamin A) in the blood. Numerous studies have shown that RBP4 plays an important role in mammalian embryonic development and that mutations in RBP4 can be used for the marker-assisted selection of animal reproductive traits. However, there are few studies on the regulation of reproduction and high-prolificacy traits by RBP4 in goats. In this study, the 5 ' flanking sequence of RBP4 was amplified, and a G>C polymorphism in the promoter region -211 bp (g.36491960) was detected. An association analysis revealed that the respective first, second and third kidding number and mean kidding number of nanny goats with CC and GC genotypes (2.167 +/- 0.085, 2.341 +/- 0.104, 2.529 +/- 0.107 and 2.189 +/- 0.070 for CC and 2.052 +/- 0.047, 2.206 +/- 0.057, 2.341 +/- 0.056 and 2.160 +/- 0.039 for GC) were significantly higher (p < 0.05) than those with the GG genotype (1.893 +/- 0.051, 2.027 +/- 0.064, 2.107 +/- 0.061 and 1.74 +/- 0.05). The luciferase assay showed that luciferase activity was increased in C allele individuals compared with that in G allele individuals. A competitive electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) showed that individuals with the CC genotype had a stronger promoter region binding capacity than those with the GG genotype. In addition, transcription factor prediction software showed that the RBP4 g.36491960G>C mutation added a novel binding site for transcription factor DP-1 (TFDP1). RT-qPCR results showed that the expression of TFDP1 was significantly higher in the high-prolificacy group than in the low-prolificacy group, and the expression of RBP4 was higher in both the CC and GC genotypes than that in the GG genotype. TFDP1 overexpression significantly increased the expression of RBP4 mRNA (p < 0.05) and the expression of the cell proliferation factors cyclin-D1, cyclin-D2 and CDK4 (p < 0.05). The opposite trend was observed after interference with TFDP1. Both the EdU and CCK-8 results showed that TFDP1 expression could regulate the proliferation of goat ovarian granulosa cells. In summary, our results showed that RBP4 g.36491960G>C was significantly associated with fecundity traits in goats. The g.36491960G>C mutation enhanced the transcriptional activity of RBP4 and increased the expression of RBP4, thus improving the fertility of Yunshang black goats.

TI  - Maternal exposure to polystyrene nanoplastics impacts developmental milestones and brain structure in mouse offspring
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-ADVANCES
LA  - English
AB  - The presence of microplastics and nanoplastics (NPs) has recently been reported in human blood and tissues, raising concerns about their potential impacts on human health and fetal development. In this study, we investigated the effects of maternal exposure to NPs on the timing of developmental milestones and on brain structure using experimental mice. Healthy, pregnant CD-1 dams were given 106 ng L-1 of 50 nm polystyrene NPs in drinking water throughout gestation and lactation and the postnatal behavior and neuroanatomy of the offspring were studied. We found that NPs exposure resulted in earlier time to eye opening in male offspring but not in females (p = 0.01). 3D high-resolution ex vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed that offspring exposed to NPs had focal differences compared to controls in multiple brain structures that are involved in motor function, learning and memory, and physiological functions including the motor cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, medulla, and olfactory bulb. Several of these MRI-detectable neuroanatomical changes were dependent on sex. Our study demonstrates that maternal exposure to NPs results in abnormal postnatal brain development in the mouse. Further investigations are needed to determine the mechanisms whereby NPs exposure during fetal development may adversely affect dimensions of brain function in a sex-dependent manner.
   Maternal exposure to polystyrene nanoplastics impact postnatal brain development in mouse offspring. This work motivates further studies to determine the levels of nanoplastics in the environment.

AB  - Little is understood about how social cetaceans make collective decisions. Consensus processes are often beneficial for fitness at both a group and individual level, but most previous studies of decision making in whales and dolphins show evidence of a leader, frequently an individual with greater ecological knowledge or social connectedness. We used drone footage of long-finned pilot whales, Globicephala melas, off Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, Canada, to examine the characteristics of initial divers (age class/sex, relative position, accompanying calf) and the timing of when individuals dive (i.e. dive lag) within collective group dives (N 1/4 73). Resting groups of pilot whales had three-fold higher mean dive lag and interindividual dive intervals than groups in other behavioural states. Females initiated dives more often than expected by chance and initial divers were most frequently located peripherally on the left or right flank of the group. Dive lags following the initial diver had a heavily right-skewed distribution, suggesting that long-finned pilot whales within groups are often responding to a stimulus (e.g. physical leadership, a vocal signal, an approaching vessel). These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that unequally distributed leadership guides the temporal patterning of the collective deep dives of pilot whales.

AB  - Scatter hoarding black-capped chickadees use memory to relocate hidden food, often after delays of hours or days. The ability of these birds to maintain accurate memories of the location and current status of many food caches while engaging in other distracting daily activities suggests that their memory may be especially resistant to competing cognitive load. We measured resistance to competing cognitive load during spatial memory tests in black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapillus) and a non-caching species, dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis). Birds were presented with two types of task. In the Discrimination task, birds learned by trial-and-error to select a target from among 2 distractors. In the Match-to-Sample task, birds viewed a sample which they had to remember in order to correctly select it from among two distractors at test. On two-thirds of trials, the tasks were presented Stand-Alone: after birds initiated a trial, they completed either a Discrimination or a Match-to-Sample task. The remaining trials were Concurrent causing a competing cognitive load: after birds intiated a trial, they saw the sample for the Match-to-Sample task, then completed a Discrimination during the retention interval, and finally completed a Match-to-Sample test. Competing cognitive load reduced accuracy of juncos significantly more than accuracy of chickadees. The need to encode and retain the locations of multiple food caches may have led to the evolution of enhanced cognitive control of memory in black-capped chickadees.

AB  - Different host plants can affect the performance of herbivores and their natural enemies. The life history of the mind predator, Macrolophus pygmaeus Rambur, was studied after feeding on Tetranychus urticae Koch eggs reared on the solanaceous plants, including tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L. cv Nora) and sweet pepper (Capsicum annuuin L. cv Kadia) under laboratory conditions. According to the age-stage. two-sex life table theory, developmental time, survival rate, and fecundity were analyzed. The results showed that premature developmental time of the predator was shorter when they were fed on tomato-reared spider mites than on sweet-pepper-reared spider mites. Some population parameters [Intrinsic rate of increase (r), Net reproductive rate (R-0) and Mean generation time) of M. pygmaeus were significantly affected by the host plants. Mean number of T. urticae eggs consumed by different stages/sexes of Al. pygmaeus was calculated based on the age-stage two-sex consumption rate model. The results indicated that the consumption rate increased from nymph to adult in both sexes. The net predation rate (C-0) was 547.98 +/- 24.00 and 381.6 +/- 18.04 mites on tomato and sweet pepper, respectively. Transformation rate from prey population to predator offspring (Q(p)) was 7.11 +/- 0.18 and 5.60 +/- 0.24 on tomato and sweet pepper. respectively. The results showed that the survival and reproductive rate of M. pygmaeus was higher when they fed on T. urticae eggs laid by tomato-reared adults compared to sweet pepper-reared individuals. This study provides an opportunity to better understand the interactions of the three trophic levels through considering host plant importance in the success of biological control.

AB  - Simple Summary Carnivores play an important part in maintaining ecosystem health by limiting the population sizes of their prey. However, their feeding habits can also place populations of threatened species at risk of extinction or decline. We examined the diet of Australia's largest terrestrial carnivore, the dingo, to determine whether it threatens at-risk small macropods in two subtropical forests. We found that although dingoes may prey upon some threatened macropods, they do not appear to do so at rates that will affect population persistence. We show that dingoes in some subtropical Australian forests generally target prey according to availability but also according to accessibility. Our study suggests that at present, dingoes do not appear to pose a threat to threatened macropods or some other threatened mammals in either of the forests surveyed. Carnivores fulfil important ecological roles in natural systems yet can also jeopardise the persistence of threatened species. Understanding their diet is, therefore, essential for managing populations of carnivores, as well as those of their prey. This study was designed to better understand the diet of an Australian apex predator, the dingo, and determine whether it poses a threat to at-risk small macropods in two floristically different yet geographically close reserves in subtropical Australia. Based on an analysis of 512 scats, dingo diets comprised 34 different prey taxa, of which 50% were common between reserves. Our findings add support to the paradigm that dingoes are opportunistic and generalist predators that prey primarily on abundant mammalian fauna. Their diets in the Border Ranges were dominated by possum species (frequency of occurrence (FOC) = 92.5%), while their diets in Richmond Range were characterised by a high prevalence of pademelon species (FOC = 46.9%). Medium-sized mammals were the most important dietary items in both reserves and across all seasons. The dietary frequency of medium-sized mammals was generally related to their availability (indexed by camera trapping); however, the avoidance of some species with high availability indicates that prey accessibility may also be important in dictating their dietary choices. Other prey categories were supplementary to diets and varied in importance according to seasonal changes in their availability. The diets included two threatened macropods, the red-legged pademelon and black-striped wallaby. Our availability estimates, together with earlier dietary studies spanning 30 years, suggest that the red-legged pademelon is resilient to the observed predation. The black-striped wallaby occurred in only two dingo scats collected from Richmond Range and was not detected by cameras so the threat to this species could not be determined. Two locally abundant but highly threatened species (the koala and long-nosed potoroo) were not detected in the dingoes' diets, suggesting dingoes do not at present pose a threat to these populations. Our study highlights the importance of site-based assessments, population monitoring and including data on prey availability in dietary investigations.

AB  - Extrafloral nectaried plants and myrmecophytes offer resources to ants that engage in protective mutualisms. The role of different ant species in herbivore deterrence has long been analyzed by using insect baits, and ants are regarded as effective plant guards if they attack the insects. Here, by performing a literature review, we conducted a comparative investigation on which ants display aggression toward experimental prey, which ants are better plant guards, and which plants (extrafloral nectaried plants or myrmecophytes) are better defended by ants. Data revealed that studies evaluating ant aggression toward insect baits have been performed on 37 extrafloral nectaried plant species and 19 myrmecophytes, and have involved over 30 genera of ants. Extrafloral nectaried plants and myrmecophytes rely on specific ant fauna to defend them from herbivores. In extrafloral nectaried plants, Camponotus and Crematogaster were regarded as the best plant protectors, as they attacked insects in nearly all plants. In myrmecophytes, Azteca, Pheidole, and Pseudomyrmex were the most important insect attackers. Myrmecophytes were better protected by ants, as all insects were attacked; in extrafloral nectaried plants, some ants failed to attack the insects. Plants are patrolled by several different ants, but there is a core of ants that excel in protection, and this varies according to plant type (extrafloral nectaried plants and myrmecophytes). With this knowledge, it may be possible to label different ants as effective plant guards, to anticipate their effects on plant performance, and even to understand their potential role as biological control agents.

AB  - Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is a contributor to air pollution. Human evidence has demonstrated an association between SO2 exposure and diminished ovarian reserve. The toxicity of SO2 is mainly attributed to its derivatives, bisulfite and sulfite, which have a variety of adverse effects on both human health and the environment, yet have been widely used as additives in food processing and transportation. However, the reproductive toxicity of SO2 derivatives remained elusive. In this study, we explored the impact of SO2 derivatives (bisulfite and sulfite) on ovarian function and further investigated the underlying mechanism. Exposure to SO2 derivatives in vivo could significantly reduce the ovarian reserve, the number and the quality of oocytes retrieved, induce ovarian granulosa cell apoptosis, and lead to an increased number of atretic follicles, thus affecting the ovarian function of mice. In addition, we isolated and cultured the primary mouse ovarian granulosa cells (mGCs) to explore the impact of SO2 derivatives on the biological functions of mGCs and investigate the mechanism by which SO2 derivatives induced apoptosis of mGCs. We detected that SO2 derivatives could induce cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, a decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential, increased abnormal mitochondria, and impaired function of sex hormone synthesis and secretion. Further, we found that SO2 derivatives could significantly downregulate the Serpine1 gene expression, inhibiting the NF-kappa B signaling pathway and thereby inducing the apoptosis of mGCs.

AB  - Although tea (Camellia sinensis)/soybean (Glycine max) intercropping is widely applied in tea gardens, the underlying mechanisms driving tea quality promotion remain largely unclear. This study explores the effects of intercropping on tea quality, soil nutrient availability, and soybean growth and analyzes their mutual relationship. Field experiments revealed that intercropping increased tea leaf water extracts, polyphenols, and amino acids by 4.36-8.99%, 14.76-15.23%, and 14.73-16.36%, respectively, across two growth stages. Furthermore, intercropping boosted organic matter, available nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) in the tea rhizosphere. Enzyme activities, including acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase, urease, and beta-glucosidase, were also elevated in tea/soybean intercropping. In soybean, shoot and root biomass, weight and number of nodules, and N, P, and K content increased over cultivation time. Correlation analysis showed that tea water extracts and polyphenols were positively linked to soil available P and alkaline phosphatase activities. Soybean root and nodule growth were correlated with soil N and P activation and tea water extracts, indicating that soybean-mediated underground interactions drive mineral nutrient mobilization in rhizosphere, further improving tea quality. This study provides mechanistic insights into tea/soybean intercropping, offering practical implications for sustainable tea cultivation practices.

AB  - Animals vary considerably in the amount of behavioral plasticity they exhibit in daily activity timing and temporal niche switching. It is not well understood how environmental factors drive changes in temporal activity or how interspecific differences in the plasticity of activity timing ultimately manifest in free-living animals. Here, we investigated the temporal structure and organization of activity patterns of two insular mammalian carnivores living in sympatry, the island fox (Urocyon littoralis) and island spotted skunk (Spilogale gracilis amphiala). Using collar-mounted accelerometers, we assessed the plasticity of behavioral activity rhythms in foxes and skunks by investigating how environmental factors drive the distribution of locomotor activity across the day and year, and subsequently examined the dynamics of temporal niche overlap between the two species. We documented that foxes express phenotypic plasticity in daily activity timing across the year, ranging from nocturnal to diurnal to crepuscular rhythms depending on the individual and time of year. Most notably, foxes increased the proportion of daytime activity as seasonal temperatures decreased. Overall, activity patterns of foxes were consistent with the circadian thermoenergetics hypothesis, which posits that animals that switch their patterns of activity do so to coincide with the most energetically favorable time of day. In contrast to foxes, skunks exhibited little behavioral plasticity, appearing strictly nocturnal across the year. While the duration of skunk activity bouts increased with the duration of night, timing of activity onset and offset extended into daytime hours during summer when the duration of darkness was shortest. Analysis of temporal niche overlap between foxes and skunks suggested that niche overlap was highest during summer and lowest during winter and was dictated primarily by temporal niche switching in foxes, rather than skunks. Collectively, our results highlight how interspecific asymmetries in behavioral plasticity drive dynamic patterns of temporal niche overlap within an island carnivore community.

AB  - Stink bug egg parasitoids (Scelionidae) use several host and non-host chemical and physical cues to find suitable hosts. These cues can interact in the field producing multimodal stimuli, which can be manipulated to increase parasitoid attraction and biological control of stink bugs in conservation biological control strategies. We aimed to investigate how multimodal chemical and physical stimuli affect stink bug egg parasitoid recruitment and parasitism in soybean crops. We performed a field experiment where semiochemicals and visual stimuli were presented alone or in combination during three soybean growing seasons. We evaluated the occurrence of stink bug parasitoids and parasitism rates using sentinel eggs, and stink bug species abundance. Long-distance semiochemicals (herbivore-induced plant volatiles and sex pheromone) did not interfere on Scelionidae parasitoid recruitment. Visual stimuli and stimuli combinations negatively interfered on parasitoid recruitment or had no effect. The parasitism of sentinel eggs varied among seasons, and long-distance semiochemicals increased parasitism on one season. In the other seasons there was a significant effect of predation on the sentinel stink bugs eggs. Predation, mostly by ants, was the main egg mortality factor, which could have masked parasitism effects. The stink bug Euschistus heros (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) was always the most abundant species occurring with other seven species. Our results indicate the relevance of different biological control agents on stink bug egg mortality. We discuss the applications and major flaws for conservation biological control of stink bugs and its compatibility with augmentative releases of egg parasitoids, especially for Telenomus podisi.

AB  - Echolocating bats observe their surroundings through continuous vocalization and echoreception. Sounds from nearby conspecifics may have a similar spectrum and high intensity. Bats emitting frequency-modulated (FM) echolocation calls avoid conspecific jamming sounds by altering their call frequency jamming avoidance response (JAR). Bats emitting constant frequency (CF)-FM can use other strategies to avoid jamming due to the different functions of the two acoustic components. In this study, seven Rhinolophus sinicus bats were used to conduct sound detection in both single individuals and pairs. We studied how these bats adjust the terminal FM (tFM) component of their calls when flying with conspecifics, and we tested whether acoustic adjustments are made to avoid jamming. Echolocation calls had shorter durations, reduced pulse intervals and higher tFM peak frequency and terminal frequency in the presence of conspecifics. The frequency differences of the tFM component between two bats did not increase in paired flights compared to their baseline difference, and the magnitude of spectral adjustments was independent of the baseline separations between bats. These results suggest that these bats do not use a JAR strategy to mitigate interference in the tFM component of calls. The call adjustments of CF-FM bats are more likely to be attention behaviours rather than being used for avoiding acoustic interference. Bats differentiate their own echoes and pulses from those of conspecifics through their respective acoustic signatures.

AB  - Poor health and increased susceptibility to infectious diseases are among the main sources of economic losses in the pig industry worldwide, and they also serve as indicators of compromised animal welfare. However, there is limited information on long-lasting biomarkers of poor health and common infections experienced by piglets early in life. Hair cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA(S)), and their ratio have been proposed as components of the mammalian stress response due to the activation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis and were investigated in this study using 30 batches of pigs from 16 farms. The research hypothesis was that batches of piglets experiencing clinical syndromes (as indicated by enteric, neurological, cutaneous, and locomotor scores) during suckling would exhibit a different pattern of resilience and allostatic load later in life compared to healthy ones. Hair from 25 gilts per batch were collected at either 3.5 or 9 months of age, and hormone extraction was subsequently performed. The farm of origin and the age of the animals significantly influenced hormone concentrations. Moreover, batches affected by enteric disease showed lower DHEA(S) levels (p < 0.0001; 15.89 vs. 23.51 pg/mg) and higher cortisol/DHEA(S) ratio (p < 0.0001; 82.83 vs. 55.02) than healthy batches. Similar results were observed in batches with a neurological syndrome (DHEA(S): p < 0.0001; 12.91 vs. 19.43; cortisol/DHEA(S) ratio: p < 0.0001; 97.15 vs. 70.26 pg/mg). These results suggest that pig hair biomarkers carry an intrinsic and temporally stable signal related to early life health status.

AB  - BackgroundBiocontrol strategies are the best possible and eco-friendly solution to develop resistance against O furnacalis and improve the maize yield. However, the knowledge about underlying molecular mechanisms, metabolic shifts, and hormonal signaling is limited. MethodsHere, we used an axenic and a consortium of entomopathogenic Beauveria bassiana OFDH1-5 and a pathogen-antagonistic Trichoderma asperellum GDFS1009 in maize and observed that consortium applications resulted in higher chlorophyll contents and antioxidants activities [superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), proline, protease, and polyphenol oxidase (PPO)] with a decrease in O. furnacalis survival. We performed a comprehensive transcriptome and an untargeted metabolome profiling for the first time at a vegetative stage in fungal inoculated maize leaves at 0-, 12-, 24-, 48-, and 72-h post insect infestation. ResultsThe consortium of B. bassiana and T. asperellum leads to 80-95% of O. furnacalis mortality. A total of 13,156 differentially expressed genes were used for weighted gene coexpression network analysis. We identified the six significant modules containing thirteen candidate genes [protein kinase (GRMZM2G025459), acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (GRMZM5G864319), thioredoxin gene (GRMZM2G091481), glutathione S-transferase (GRMZM2G116273), patatin-like phospholipase gene (GRMZM2G154523), cytochrome P450 (GRMZM2G139874), protease inhibitor (GRMZM2G004466), (AC233926.1_FG002), chitinase (GRMZM2G453805), defensin (GRMZM2G392863), peroxidase (GRMZM2G144153), GDSL- like lipase (AC212068.4_FG005), and Beta-glucosidase (GRMZM2G031660)], which are not previously reported that are highly correlated with Jasmonic acid - Ethylene (JA-ET) signaling pathway and antioxidants. We detected a total of 130 negative and 491 positive metabolomic features using a ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography ion trap time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF-MS). Intramodular significance and real time-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) expressions showed that these genes are the true candidate genes. Consortium treated maize had higher jasmonic acid (JA), salicylic acid (SA), and ethylene (ET) levels. ConclusionOur results provide insights into the genetics, biochemicals, and metabolic diversity and are useful for future biocontrol strategies against ACB attacks.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the microbiological and physicochemical characteristics of the ruminal fluid and histological characteristics of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of sheep on a high-grain diet containing the probiotic fungi Aspergillus terreus and Rhizomucor spp. The study included four treatment groups (without probiotic, with Rhizomucor spp., with Aspergillus terreus, and with a mixture of both fungi), and two types of corn (ground/whole), in a Completely Randomized Design (CRD) arranged in 4 x 2 factorial design. Santa Ines x Dorper lambs were housed in eight pens with five lambs each for 75 days. Rumen fluid was collected to study the rumen microbiological profile, macroscopic characteristics, ammonia nitrogen concentration, and microbiological activity. In addition, GIT samples were taken for histological analysis. Fluid analyses showed that the animals presented a low acidosis index. The samples presented a predominantly aromatic odor and blackish-brown color, indicating a neutral pH and high microbial activity. The rumen pH differed (P < 0.05) according to the level of processed corn consumed, being higher for ground grain corn (GGC). There was no difference for any of the microbiological communities analyzed (P > 0.05) (Lac+ and Lac- bacteria, fungi, yeasts, and protozoa). Six genera of facultative anaerobic fungi were identified in 15 observations. Cladosporium spp. was the most prevalent genus (46.66%), followed by Aspergillus spp. (26,66%). The width of the base of rumen papillae showed significant correlation being greater for GCG (P < 0.05) with Rhizomucor and for the control (P < 0.05). The rumen fluid of sheep on a high-grain diet with added Aspergillus terreus and Rhizomucor spp. showed no microbiological and physicochemical changes.

AB  - Bioassay with an insect herbivore is a common approach to studying plant defense. While measuring insect growth rate as a negative indicator of plant defense levels is simple and straightforward, analysing more detailed feeding behavior parameters of insects, such as feeding rates, leaf area consumed per feeding event, intervals between feeding events, and spatio-temporal patterns of feeding sites on leaves, is more informative. However, such observations are generally time consuming and labor-intensive. Here, we provide a semi-automated system for quantifying feeding behavior parameters of insects feeding on plant leaves. Automated photo scanners record the time-course development of feeding marks on leaves. An image analysis pipeline processes the scanned images and extracts leaf area. By analysing changes in leaf area over time, it detects insect feeding events and calculates the leaf area consumed during each feeding event, providing quantitative parameters of the feeding behavior of insects. In addition, it visualizes spatio-temporal changes in feeding sites, providing a measure of the complex behavior of insects on leaves. Using this analysis pipeline, we demonstrate that Arabidopsis trichomes reduce insect feeding rate, but not feeding duration or intervals between feeding events. Our image acquisition system requires only a photo scanner and a laptop computer and does not require any specialized equipment. The analysis software is provided as an ImageJ macro and R package and is available at no cost. Taken together, our work provides a scalable method for quantitative assessment of the feeding behavior of insects on leaves, facilitating understanding of plant defense mechanisms.
   An automated system was developed for time-course analysis of insect feeding marks on plant leaves, providing an accessible platform for studying plant defense mechanisms with quantitative parameters of insect feeding behavior.

AB  - Mirror-guided self-inspection is seen as a cognitive hallmark purportedly indicating the existence of self-recognition. Only a few species of great apes have been reported to pass a standard mark test for mirror self-recognition in which animals attempt to touch a mark. In addition, evidence for passing the mark test was also reported for Asian elephants, two species of corvids, and a species of cleaner fish. Mirror self-recognition has also been claimed for bottlenose dolphins, using exposure of marked areas to a mirror as evidence. However, what counts as self-directed behaviour to see the mark and what does not has been debated. To avoid this problem, we marked the areas around both eyes of the animals at the same time, one with visible and the other with transparent dye to control for haptic cues. This allowed the animal to see the mark easily and us to investigate what side was exposed to the mirror as an indicator for mark observation. We found that the animals actively chose to inspect their visibly marked side while they did not show an increased interest in a marked conspecific in the pool. These results demonstrate that dolphins use the mirror to inspect their marks and, therefore, likely recognise a distinction between self and others.

AB  - We have previously shown that the rat prelimbic cortex (PL) is necessary for contexts to promote the perfor-mance of instrumental behaviors that have been learned in them, whether the context is physical (operant chamber) or behavioral (recent performance of a behavior that has historically preceded the target in a behavior chain). In the present experiment, we investigated the role of the PL in satiety level as an interoceptive acqui-sition context. Rats were trained to lever-press for sweet/fat pellets while sated (22 hrs continuous food access) followed by the extinction of the response while hungry (22 hrs food deprived). Pharmacological inactivation of the PL (with baclofen/muscimol infusion) attenuated renewal of the response that occurred upon a return to the sated context. In contrast, animals that received a vehicle (saline) infusion showed renewal of the previously extinguished response. These results support the hypothesis that the PL monitors the relevant contextual ele-ments (physical, behavioral, or satiety state) associated with reinforcement of a response and promotes the subsequent performance of that response in their presence.

AB  - Simple Summary The piped water systems within buildings on pig farms provide pigs with continuous access to drinking water, and on many farms are also used for short periods to medicate growing pigs with antibiotics to help keep them healthy and productive. We surveyed managers of 25 medium to large pig farms across eastern and southern Australia to investigate critical elements of the design and management of water systems that impact water provision to pigs. We found wide variation in the configuration, length, and pipe materials and diameters of water systems in buildings across farms. In many buildings, main pipelines were larger in diameter than required. While this helps ensure that drinkers always provide plenty of water to pigs, it means water flows through pipes very slowly. We also found that in many buildings the number of pigs per drinker was above the recommended maximum, cleaning and disinfection of water systems was not done on many farms, and few managers were aware of the risks to water quality and pig health. We have identified important aspects of water provision to pigs for which recommendations could be added to industry guidelines used by pig farm managers. Drinking water distribution systems (WDSs) within buildings on pig farms have critical elements of their design and management that impact water provision to pigs, water quality, the efficacy of in-water antimicrobial dosing, and, thus, pig health and performance. We used a mixed-methods approach to survey managers of 25 medium to large single-site and multi-site pig farming enterprises across eastern and southern Australia. We found wide variation in the configuration (looped or branched) and total length of WDSs within buildings across farms and in pipe materials and diameters. Within many conventional buildings and some eco-shelters, WDSs were 'over-sized', comprising large-diameter main pipelines with high holding volumes, resulting in slow velocity water flows through sections of a WDS's main pipeline. In over half of the weaner buildings and one-third of grower/finisher buildings, the number of pigs per drinker exceeded the recommended maximum. Few farms measured flow rates from drinkers quantitatively. WDS sanitization was not practiced on many farms, and few managers were aware of the risks to water quality and pig health. We identified important aspects of water provision to pigs for which valuable recommendations could be added to industry guidelines available to pig farm managers.

However, previous studies very rarely distinguish between the different co-products of the wool transformation, and often attribute the same impact to fibers produced from worsted processing (longer and more expensive fibers) and woollen processing (shorter and cheaper fibers). This study firstly provides a detailed mapping of processes and products involved in the wool production chain, from sheep grazing to yarn production, with particular attention to the shorter fibers, which have been mostly neglected in previous literature. Secondly, this study uses the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology to analyze the environmental impacts of the different intermediate coproducts. In particular, when multi-output processes occur, impacts are distributed proportionally to their relative economic value, using therefore an economic allocation. This approach enabled the calculation of environmental impacts of fibers used both in the worsted and woollen processing. It results that shorter fibers generally have lower impacts than longer fibers used for the production of fine yarns. Specifically, most short fibers have an impact on climate change ranging from 25 to 30 kg CO2 eq/kg, while, longer fibers have an impact of 78-97 kg CO2 eq/kg. The physiological variation in the ratio between worsted and woolen co-products of multi-output processes appears to have little effect on the final impact results. Finally, since the grazing phase is highly variable, impacts on climate change of the analyzed intermediate products have been re-calculated using, for the greasy wool, the lowest and highest values of impact found in literature. Impacts of the analyzed products vary sensibly according to the value considered for the greasy wool, but the relationship between them is rather stable.
   This paper contributes with detailed information and easily replicable data which could be used as a basis for the environmental assessment of wool garments and for improving the sustainability in the wool sector.

AB  - Assisted reproductive technologies for population and genetic management for threatened herpetofauna have grown substantially in the past decade. Here we describe experiments to optimise sperm cryopreservation in a model squamate, the eastern water skink Eulamprus quoyii. Small, concentrated volumes of highly motile spermatozoa were reliably collected from adult male E. quoyii by non-lethal ventral massage. Samples were used to: (1) test whether proteinrich diluents, namely Beltsville poultry semen extender (BPSE) and TES and Tris (TEST) yolk buffer (TYB), improve post-thaw quality metrics compared with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS); and (2) compare the efficacy of these diluents in combination with either 1.35 M glycerol or 1.35 M dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at two freezing rates, fast (approximately -20 degrees C min(-1)) versus slow (-6 degrees C min(-1)). Glycerol and DMSO performed equally well in preserving spermatozoa under slow freezing rates. Under these conditions, the use of the complex diluents BPSE and TYB significantly improved post-thaw total motility compared with DPBS. Complex interactions occurred between cryodiluent type, cryoprotectant and freezing rate when testing fast versus slow freezing rates among treatment groups. Under slow freezing rates, DMSO was better at preserving membrane integrity and motility, regardless of diluent type, but successful fast freezing required complex diluents to support motility and membrane integrity, which has implications for implementation in a field setting.

AB  - Functionalized biochar has gained extensive interests as a sustainable amendment for an effective remediation of paddy soils contaminated with heavy metals (HMs). We examined the efficiency of pig carcass-derived biochar (P-rich biochar, total P = 8.3%) and pristine (raw biochar, total Fe = 0.76%) and Fe-modified (Fe-rich biochar, total Fe = 5.5%) green waste-derived biochars for the immobilization of cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) in a paddy soil under pre-defined redox conditions (Eh, from -400 to +300 mV). Average concentrations (mu g L-1) of dissolved Cd increased under reducing conditions up to 10.9 in the control soil, and decreased under oxidizing conditions to below the detection limit (LDL = 2.7) in the raw and Fe-rich biochar treated soils. Application of the raw biochar decreased the concentrations of dissolved Cd by 43-59% under Eh < -100 mV, compared to the nontreated control, which was more effective than the Fe-rich biochar (31-59%) and the P-rich biochar (8-19%). The immobilization of Cd under low Eh might be due to its precipitation with sulfide (S2-), whereas its immobilization under high Eh might be due to the associated increase of pH. Concentrations (mu g L-1) of Pb ranged from 29.4 to 198.2 under reducing conditions, and decreased to LDL (12.5) under oxidizing conditions. The P-rich biochar was more effective in immobilizing Pb than the raw and Fe-rich biochars, particularly under Eh < 0 mV (55-82%), which might be due to the retention of Pb by phosphates. The raw and Fe-rich biochars immobilized Pb under low Eh (< -300 mV), but both biochars, particularly the Fe-rich biochar mobilized Pb under Eh higher than -200 mV, especially at +100 mV, due to the decrease of pH at this point (pH = 6.0 to 6.5). These results improved our understanding of using P-rich and Fe-rich functionalized biochars for the immobilization of Cd and Pb in a paddy soil under stepwise redox changes. The amendment of P-rich pig carcass-derived biochar to paddy soils could be a promising approach for mitigating the risk of Pb for human health and the environment. The raw and Fe-rich green waste-derived biochars can be used for immobilizing Cd and mitigating its risk in paddy soils under both reducing and oxidizing conditions.

AB  - Grafting provides a way to improve tolerance to low phosphorus (P) stress for plants, and has been extensively applied in commercial cultivars grafted onto appropriate rootstocks. However, little literature is available concerning the scion-mediated effect on P efficiency in grafted plants. In this study, three different Camellia oleifera Abel. scion cultivars (G8, G83-1, and W2) were grafted onto the same rootstock (W2) under controls (0.5 mM) and low-P (0 mM) availability for eight months. The results showed that the scions significantly affected root-to-shoot weight ratios, the root morphology with a diameter larger than 1 mm, P accumulation, and the P utilization efficiency (PUE) of the root. A higher increase in the root-to-shoot weight ratio under the low-P supply was observed in the G83-1/W2 (26.15%) than in the G8/W2 (0%) and the W2/W2 (5.32%). Root PUE of the scion G8, G83-1, and W2 was improved by up to 113.73%, 45.46%, and 20.97% under the low-P supply. Moreover, G8/W2 exhibited higher shoot P accumulation and the highest root PUE under the low-P supply, indicating a high capability to tolerate P deficiency by maximizing the cost-effectiveness of P remobilization to photosynthetic organs. This suggested the vigorous variety of G8 could be a promising scion to improve grafted C. oleifera tolerance to low-P stress. Our results would have important implications for exploration and identification of a superior scion variety to enhance the ability of resistance concerning P deficiency stress in C. oleifera.

AB  - The miniature single-photon fluorescent microscope (miniscope) enables the visualization of calcium activity in vivo in freely moving laboratory animals, providing the capability to track cellular activity during the investigation of memory formation, learning, sleep, and social interactions. However, the use of calcium sensors for in vivo imaging is limited by their relatively slow (millisecond-scale) kinetics, which complicates the recording of high-frequency spike activity. The integration of methods from single-photon miniature fluorescent microscopy with electrophysiological recording, which possesses microsecond resolution, represents a potential solution to this issue. Such a combination of techniques allows for the simultaneous recording of optical and electrophysiological activity in a single animal in vivo. In this study, a flexible polyimide microelectrode was developed and integrated with the gradient lens of the miniscope. The in vivo tests conducted in this research confirmed that the microelectrode combined with the gradient lens facilitates simultaneous single-photon calcium imaging and local field potential recording in the hippocampus of an adult mouse.

AB  - With the depletion of land mineral resources, people have turned their attention to the sea. As an important part of deep-sea mining systems, the technical research and development of ore collectors has always been a difficult problem in many countries. According to the characteristic that buffalo hoof is suitable for walking on soft soil, a kind of bionic grouser for a deep-sea mining vehicle is designed in this paper. Through the optimization of Rankine's passive earth pressure theory, the formula for calculating the tractive force of the grouser is obtained. The accuracy of the analytical solution is verified by finite element simulation, and the force enhancement mechanism of the bionic grouser is revealed. The results show that the design of the bionic grouser has a significant effect on the improvement of tractive force, and the tractive force of the No. 1 bionic grouser is 17.52% higher than that of the straight grouser. On this basis, the geometric parameters of the bionic grouser profile are optimized. The results show that when L is 0 mm and R is 183 mm, the force enhancement effect reaches the maximum of 27%, which provides a design basis for optimizing the grouser and improving the mining efficiency of the collector.

AB  - Sleeping behavior is one of the most important components of primate socio-ecology, which can provide valuable insight for social relationships and their influencing factors. In this study, we observed the sleeping behavior of wild Francois' langur (Trachypithecus francoisi) from July 2011 to June 2012 in Mayanghe Nature Reserve, China. The results indicated that the langurs spent most of the time sleeping, with an annual average of 670.25 min. The average sleeping time in summer was the shortest with a duration of 580.50 min on average, and sleeping time has the longest duration in winter with an average of 770.53 min. This indicates that there was a significant difference in the sleeping time in different seasons. In addition, temperature and weather condition play a role on the sleeping behavior of T. francoisi. T. francoisi allocated significantly less time for sleeping and leaving sleeping site, and more time for entering the sleeping site and pre-sleeping in sunny days than they did in rainy days.

AB  - Introduction In adolescence, the brain is still maturing, and disorders in maturation may affect the normal development of the brain. Exposure to titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs) has various potential negative effects on the central nervous system. Bergamot essential oil (BEO) has been found to be effective for neuroprotection.
   Methods The rats were injected intraperitoneally with TiO2 NPs (20 mg/kg) and/or BEO (200 mg/kg). The endogenous antioxidant state and inflammatory parameters were estimated using ELISA kits, and then the memory ability and anxiety-like behavior in rats were assessed.
   Results TiO2 NPs exposure during the adolescent period induced anxiety-like behavior, cognitive impairment, neuroinflammation and oxidative damage in hippocampus, and BEO treatment could significantly ameliorate the neurotoxicities induced by TiO2 NPs exposure.
   Conclusion Our results suggest that the negative effects of TiO2 NPs exposure during the adolescent period on anxiety-like behavior and cognitive function may be related to oxidative stress and neuroinflammation induced by TiO2 NPs exposure. In addition, BEO may ameliorate the neurotoxicities induced by TiO2 NPs exposure in adolescent rats through the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity of BEO.

AB  - Simple Summary Post-weaning is the most critical phase in pig farming, characterized by efforts to ensure health, performance and welfare of animals. Despite that EU Directive 2008/120/EC prohibits the practice of tail docking, it is still commonly applied in intensive farming to avoid tail biting. From a nutritional perspective, the dietary supplementation with natural extracts with calming properties could represent a promising approach to overcome common production stressors, reducing abnormal behaviors such as tail biting. This study intended to determine the effects of the dietary inclusion of Passiflora incarnata, known for its tranquillizing activity, on skin lesions, thermal imaging, behavior, salivary cortisol and IgA levels on post-weaning piglets reared with intact tails. Growth performances were also monitored. No differences were recorded between diets regarding growth performance, whereas findings concerning aggressive and abnormal behaviors, such as tail and ear biting, and lower levels of cortisol confirmed the hypothesis of the calming effect of P. incarnata on post-weaning piglets. Tail docking has been used in the pig industry to decrease the occurrence of tail biting behavior. This abnormal behavior has a multifactorial origin since it is a response to simultaneous environmental, nutritional and management changes. Given the calming properties of Passiflora incarnata, we hypothesized that dietary supplementation with the extract in weaned pigs could result in a modification of behavior and physiologic indicators linked to stress. Weaned piglets (n = 120, mean body weight 9.07 +/- 2.30 kg) were randomly allocated to one of two dietary treatments: control diet (CON) and CON supplemented with 1 kg/t of P. incarnata (PAS). The trial was 28 days long. The presence of skin lesions was assessed at d-1, d-10, d-19, and d-28, and saliva samples were collected for IgA and cortisol determinations at the same sampling times. Results showed the PAS group was characterized by equal growth performance as the CON group, fewer ear lesions (p < 0.05), less aggressive behavior (p < 0.001), higher enrichment exploration (p < 0.001) and lower cortisol levels (p < 0.01). Time effect was observed for tail lesions (p < 0.001) and behavioral observations (p < 0.001). Additional research is required to determine the effect of P. incarnata extract using a larger number of animals and longer period of supplementation when risks associated with tail biting are uncontrolled.

AB  - Simple Summary Currently, not enough is known about the effect of histone modification on the epigenetic reprogramming of somatic cells, and the lack of basic study limits the development of somatic cell nuclear transfer technology. The aim of this study was to explore the influence of lysine crotonylation, a newly discovered histone post-translational modification, on the reprogramming of somatic cells from Cashmere goats. The results showed that the crotonylation level was increased in somatic cells with sodium crotonate treatment. At the same time, the treatment of somatic cells improved the cloned embryo cleavage rate. In conclusion, an increasing crotonylation level could promote the reprogramming of somatic cells and cloned embryo development. This finding provides an important reference for future improvements in the efficiency of in vitro Cashmere goat somatic cell nuclear transfer embryo production. Failure in the epigenetic reprogramming of somatic cells is considered the main reason for lower cloned embryo development efficiency. Lysine crotonylation (Kcr) occupies an important position in epigenetic modification, while its effects on somatic cell reprogramming have not been reported. In this study, we detected the influence of sodium crotonate (NaCr) on the Kcr levels in three types of somatic cells (muscle-derived satellite cells, MDSCs; fetal fibroblast cells, FFCs; and ear tip fibroblast cells, EFCs). The three types of somatic cells were treated with NaCr for cloned embryo construction, and the cleavage rates and Kcr, H3K9cr, and H3K18cr levels in the cloned embryos were analyzed. The results showed that the abnormal levels of Kcr, H3K9cr, and H3K18cr were corrected in the treatment groups. Although there was no significant difference in the cloned embryo cleavage rate in the FFC treatment group, the cleavage rates of the cloned embryos in the MDSCs and EFCs treatment groups were increased. These findings demonstrated that the Kcr level was increased with NaCr treatment in somatic cells from Cashmere goat, which contributed to proper reprogramming. The reprogramming of somatic cells can be promoted and cloned embryo development can be improved through the treatment of somatic cells with NaCr.

AB  - Cultivated tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) contains alpha-tomatine, a steroidal glycoalkaloid (SGA), which functions as a defense compound to protect against pathogens and herbivores; interestingly, wild species in the tomato Glade biosynthesize a variety of SGAs. In cultivated tomato, the metabolic detoxification of alpha-tomatine during tomato fruit ripening is an important trait that aided in its domestication, and two distinct 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases (DOXs), a C-23 hydroxylase of alpha-tomatine (S123DOX) and a C-27 hydroxylase of lycoperoside C (5127DOX), are key to this process. There are tandemly duplicated DOX genes on tomato chromosome 1, with high levels of similarity to SI23DOX. While these DOX genes are rarely expressed in cultivated tomato tissues, the recombinant enzymes of Solyc01g006580 and Solyc01g006610 metabolized alpha-tomatine to habrochaitoside A and (20R)-20-hydroxytomatine and were therefore named as habrochaitoside A synthase (HAS) and cx-tomatine 20-hydroxylase (20DOX), respectively. Furthermore, 20DOX and HAS exist in the genome of wild tomato S. habrochaites accession LA1777, which accumulates habrochaitoside A in its fruits, and their expression patterns were in agreement with the SGA profiles in LA1777. These results indicate that the functional divergence of alpha-tomatinemetabolizing DOX enzymes results from gene duplication and the neofunctionalization of catalytic activity and gene expression, and this contributes to the structural diversity of SGAs in the tomato clade.

AB  - Simple Summary Salmonellosis in humans is still a serious disease, which is mainly caused by the consumption of contaminated food. Functional ingredients in feed are expected to reduce susceptibility to the ubiquitous Salmonella and thus prevent food contamination. Rye is becoming increasingly popular in pig feeding. The use of by-products such as rye bran in pig feeding is also of great interest. Rye and its by-product rye bran offer the possibility of introducing high-quality feedstuffs with positive effects on the pig's intestinal health into a feed. These effects are caused by functional ingredients that are metabolized by microorganisms in the large intestine. Previous studies have shown the positive effect of reducing Salmonella prevalence in young pigs. This study investigated in a field study whether rye or rye bran has a positive effect on Salmonella prevalence in gilts, sows, and piglets. The antibody titers of the rye groups in the gilts were significantly lower. This suggests that the use of rye leads to lower incidents of infection, but this effect was not reflected in the environmental samples. The inconsistent presence of Salmonella and the experimental design were not sufficient to show a clear effect in a field study. The nutritional benefits of rye (and therefore rye bran) are mainly due to its high content of fermentable dietary fiber, the non-starch polysaccharides (NSP). Microorganisms in the large intestine are able to convert these into short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), including butyrate. Butyrate strengthens the epithelial barrier function in the colon by nourishing the enterocytes and inhibiting the spread of Salmonella in the intestinal tract. Therefore, the aim of this study was to test under field conditions whether a diet with rye or rye bran as the main ingredient for gilts, sows, and weaned piglets is associated with a lower Salmonella prevalence. Depending on the age groups, between 20-30% rye or between 15-20% rye bran was used in the experimental group. A total of n = 1983 boot swabs, n = 356 fecal samples, and n = 1909 serum samples were examined. The results of this study show that rye or rye bran at the levels used had no apparent effect on the number of positive Salmonella samples. However, the Salmonella OD values in the experimental groups were significantly lower than in the control group. This suggests that the use of rye leads to a lower incidence of infection, but this effect could not be proven from swabs.

TI  - Circ007071 Inhibits Unsaturated Fatty Acid Synthesis by Interacting with miR-103-5p to Enhance PPARγ Expression in the Dairy Goat Mammary Gland

AB  - Understanding more precisely the mechanisms controlling the metabolism of fatty acid in the mammary gland of dairy goats is essential for future improvements in milk quality. Particularly since recent data have underscored a key role for circular RNAs (circRNAs) in the mammary gland function, high-throughput sequencing technology was used to identify expression levels of circRNAs in the mammary tissue of dairy goats during early and peak lactation in the present study. Compared with early lactation, results demonstrated that the expression level of circ007071 during peak lactation was 12.02-fold up-regulated. Subsequent studies in goat mammary epithelial cells (GMECs) revealed that circ007071 stimulated the synthesis of triglycerides (TAG) and cholesterol, as well as increased the content of saturated fatty acids (C16:0 and C18:0). More importantly, using a double luciferase reporting system allowed us to detect the circ007071 sequence at a binding site of miR-103-5p, indicating that it targeted this miRNA. Overexpression of circ007071 significantly decreased the abundance of miR-103-5p and led to inhibition of TAG synthesis. In contrast, the abundance of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma), a target gene of miR-103-5p, was reinforced with the overexpression of circ007071. Thus, we conclude that one key function of circ007071 in the regulation of milk fat synthesis is to attenuate the inhibitory effect of miR-103-5p on PPAR gamma via direct interactions with miRNA. As a result, the process of TAG and saturated fatty acid is able to proceed.

AB  - Sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L.; Elaeagnaceae) is a medicinally and ecologically important deciduous shrub widely distributed in northwest China. Hybrid breeding plays an important role in the sea buckthorn industry. However, limited research has been conducted on its chloroplast genome, and data on interspecific and intraspecific variation is also lacking, which hinders the improvement in hybrid breeding. In this study, we sequenced the chloroplast (cp) genomes of seven Hippophae rhamnoides L. plants using Illumina paired-end sequencing. The cp genome of Hippophae rhamnoides L. is 155, 260-156, 312 bp in length and is composed of a large single-copy (LSC) region (83,026-84,034 bp) and a small single-copy (SSC) region (18,732-19,048 bp), which are separated by a pair of inverted repeats (IR) regions (26,653-26,670 bp). Each cp genome contains 113 genes and has a highly conserved genome structure and gene sequence. We analyzed the nucleotide diversity of the cp genomes of 13 accessions belonging to eight Hippophae species. A total of 2,838 variable sites and two hotspot maps were obtained by intra- and interspecies analyses and used to construct a map of the genome. A phylogenetic analysis was used to analyze the origin and evolution of H.rhamnoides subsp.mongolica and its related species for the first time. This study provides the basis for the identification and hybrid breeding of Hippophae species and lays the foundation for future research.

AB  - Simple Summary Weaning piglets face stressors from changes in feed and environment, which affects their growth. To resolve this problem, we explored the separate effects of multi-strain probiotics and Perilla frutescens seed extract and their combined effect on weaning piglets. We found multi-strain probiotics or Perilla frutescens seed extract both improved the gain to feed ratio and antioxidant capacity. In addition, multi-strain probiotics improved jejunal villus height and the villus height/crypt depth ratio. Perilla frutescens seed extract improved ileal villus height. The interactive effects were observed in jejunal villus height and the villus height/crypt depth ratio, ileal villus height, and the gene expression of IL-1 beta and mucin2 in the intestinal mucosa. This study shows that using either multi-strain probiotics or Perilla frutescens seed extract alone is more effective than their combined use in weaning piglets. This study examined the effects of multi-strain probiotics (BL) and Perilla frutescens seed extract (PSE), alone or in combination, on weaning piglets. In total, 96 weaning piglets were allocated into four treatments: CON group (the basal diet), PSE group (basal diet + 1g/kg PSE), BL group (basal diet + 2 g/kg BL), and BL+PSE group (basal diet +1 g/kg PSE + 2 g/kg BL) according to a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement. The supplementation of BL or PSE improved the gain to feed ratio. Dietary BL reduced diarrhea occurrence and Escherichia coli, but increased Lactobacillus counts in the ileal digesta. Dietary PSE tended to increase Lactobacillus counts in the ileal digesta. Interactive effects were found in terms of ileal villus height, the gene expression of IL-1 beta, and malondialdehyde in the ileal mucosa. Dietary BL lowered malondialdehyde in the spleen, liver, and jejunal mucosa but increased the total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) in the liver and ileum mucosa. The supplementation of PSE improved superoxide dismutase in serum and T-AOC in the liver, and reduced MDA in liver, spleen, and jejunum mucosa. Taken together, BL or PSE showed positive effects, improving growth and intestinal morphology and enhancing antioxidant capacity. However, their interaction showed no beneficial effects on the antioxidant indices and the intestinal morphology of weaned piglets.

AB  - The Murciano-Granadina goat (MUG) is a renowned dairy breed, known for its adaptability and resilience, as well as for its exceptional milk traits characterized by high protein and fat content, along with low somatic cell counts. These traits are governed by complex biological processes, crucial in shaping phenotypic diversity. Thus, it is imperative to explore the factors regulating milk production and lactation for this breed. In this study, we investigated the genetic architecture of seven milk traits in MUGs, employing a two-step computational analysis to examine genotype-phenotype associations. Initially, a random forest algorithm identified the relative importance of each single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in determining the traits of interest. The second step applied an information theory-based approach to exploring the complex genetic architecture of quantitative milk traits, focusing on epistatic interactions that may have been overlooked in the first step. These approaches allowed us to identify an almost distinct set of candidate genes for each trait. In contrast, by analyzing the promoter regions of these genes, we revealed common regulatory networks among the milk traits under study. These findings are crucial for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying gene regulation, and they highlight the pivotal role of transcription factors (TFs) and their preferential interactions in the development of these traits. Notably, TFs such as DBP, HAND1E47, HOXA4, PPARA, and THAP1 were consistently identified for all traits, highlighting their important roles in immunity within the mammary gland and milk production during lactation.

AB  - Social dynamics can play a major role in shaping the population ecology and evolutionary trajectory of a species. This is, for instance, the case in species known to experience infanticide when a dominant male is replaced by another. Infanticide by males has been observed in many taxa, mostly in species that breed year-round and in which a few males monopolize reproduction. In such species, infanticide often occurs after take-overs of breeding groups, and the frequency of take-overs often increases with increasing female group size, therefore raising the risk of infanticide in larger groups. Among ungulates, male infanticide has been reported mostly in harem-forming equids in captive populations, usually following harem-male turnover. In this study, we empirically tested in the wild whether the rate of stallion (i.e. harem-male) turnover increases with the number of reproductive females in harems, and whether these events reduce foal survival. We used a long-term study of wild plains zebra, Equus quagga, in Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe, where, for more than 15 years, stallion turnovers have been recorded and accurate data on pregnancy obtained by hormone assays. We show that stallion turnovers were frequent and, as expected, particularly in harems with many reproductive females. We found that foal survival did not differ significantly between situations when a stallion turnover occurred shortly before or after their birth and when it did not. This result was consistent with the fact that no attacks by stallions on foals of their group or forced matings were observed during the study. Our study offers rare data showing that if male infanticide occurs in wild plains zebra, this should be rare, and has no important consequences for foal survival at the population level.

AB  - The Asian longhorned tick, Haemaphysalis longicornis Neumann, is an invasive species in the United States. Since its earliest recorded presence in West Virginia in 2010, H. longicornis has been reported from 15 states. While its public health significance in the United States is unclear, globally it transmits pathogens that infect livestock and humans, causing economic losses and substantial morbidity. Management and control of H. longicornis requires knowledge of its biology, ecology, and distribution. Here, we address the need for effective collection methods for host-seeking H. longicornis as an important step for accurately assessing tick abundance and potential disease risk. The number of H. longicornis collected were compared across three collection methods (dragging, sweeping, CO2 traps) and three tick check distances (5 m, 10 m, and 20 m) were compared for dragging and sweeping. Field collections were conducted from June through August 2019 in Westchester County, New York, and ticks were grouped by life stage to assess collection method efficiency. Results indicated that implementing shorter (5 m) tick check distance was ideal for adult and nymphal collections. The dragging method proved better than sweeping for adult collections; however, there was no significant difference between the methods for nymphal collections, at any tick check distance evaluated. CO2 traps attracted H. longicornis, but additional research is necessary to devise an effective tick retaining method before the traps can be implemented in the field. The results are presented to inform and support H. longicornis surveillance and control programs across the nation.

   Small populations can suffer from high inbreeding rates and the associated loss of diversity, inbreeding depression, and expression of genetic defects. Two questions are important for population managers in this respect: (1) What is the status of my population regarding inbreeding? and (2) what is the effect of measures to decrease inbreeding rates? The Retriever and Pointer software has been developed to answer these questions. Retriever extracts relevant data and inbreeding levels from studbook data and Pointer simulates populations to indicate what the effect is of different forms of genetic management. This paper describes the software and gives examples of its use.
   The Retriever and Pointer software has been developed for genetic management of (small) captive populations The Retriever program uses as input pedigree data and extracts data on population structure that determine inbreeding rates such as skewness of sire contributions. Levels and rates of inbreeding and kinship and effective population sizes are determined as well. Data on population structure can be used as input for the Pointer program. This program uses stochastic simulation to evaluate a population and provides expected levels and rates of inbreeding and kinship, and optionally allelic diversity. The user can simulate different options for genetic management such as sire restrictions, restrictions on inbreeding levels, mean kinships and breeding circles. Both Retriever and Pointer can analyze populations with subpopulations and different rates of exchange between them. Although originally devised for dogs, the software can be, and has been, used for any captive population including livestock and zoo populations, and a number of examples are provide The pointer software is also suitable in education where students may generate their own populations and evaluate effects of different population structures and genetic management on genetic diversity. Input is provided via a graphical user interface. The software can be downloaded for free.

AB  - Simple Summary Semen traits associated with ejaculate volume, gross motility, concentration, and percent post-thaw motility are crucial determinants of successful reproduction, which, in turn, can influence the profitability of seedstock and commercial sheep enterprises. Previous studies in cattle, where artificial insemination is also widely used, have reported declining trends in ejaculate traits. Such a trend, if observed in sheep, could negatively impact conception outcomes, and contribute to reduced reproductive efficiency. Selective breeding to improve ejaculate traits could provide a means to ensure continued efficiency in ovine reproduction. Therefore, the objective of this study was to estimate heritability and genetic correlations between four routinely assessed ejaculate quality and quantity traits in sheep breeds commonly farmed in Australia. An analysis of ejaculate traits collected over 20 years indicated that all ejaculate quality and quantity traits were lowly heritable (0.081-0.17), with gross motility and volume having relatively higher heritability estimates compared to concentration and percent post-thaw motility. Overall, the results indicate that ejaculate quality and quantity could potentially be improved via selective breeding. Semen characteristics including volume, gross motility, spermatozoal concentration, and percent post-thaw motility are routinely assessed to determine the quality and quantity of an ejaculate prior to use in artificial breeding programs. Currently, artificial breeding programs in sheep place relatively little emphasis on ram-side factors, such as the fertilising potential of an ejaculate, which may contribute to variability in conception outcomes. Estimating genetic parameters for ejaculate quality and quantity traits could provide insights into whether selective breeding can be used to improve such ram-side traits, improving ovine reproductive performance and farm profitability. Therefore, in this study, a total of 11,470 ejaculate records, including data for ejaculate volume, gross motility, spermatozoal concentration, and percent post-thaw motility, collected over a 20-year period was used to estimate genetic parameters in sheep. Univariate and bivariate mixed model analysis was performed including a variety of fixed effects such as breed, age at collection, centre of collection, collection number, season of collection, and method of collection; and the permanent environmental effects associated with each ram, stud and year of collection, and the breeding value of rams included as random effects. The heritability for ejaculate volume, gross motility, concentration, and percent post-thaw motility was estimated to be 0.161, 0.170, 0.089, and 0.081. Repeatability estimates were moderate, ranging between 0.4126 and 0.5265. Overall, results indicate that semen traits are lowly heritable and moderately repeatable, indicating that these traits are significantly influenced by environmental variables.

AB  - Studying pigeons during homing has offered an opportunity to investigate visual-functional brain lateralization in the context of free flying and long distance navigation. In the current study we examine at a high scale of spatial resolution the flight paths of pigeons, which vary with respect to monocular and binocular treatment, as they familiarise themselves with landscape and landmark features during repeated flights home from two locations. The analysis of the flight paths of monocularly occluded pigeons revealed that pigeons using the right eye/left hemisphere visual system were more likely to display more tortuous paths over tracts of 500 m along the flight path home compared to both pigeons using the left eye/right hemisphere visual system and control birds. Accompanying this finding was the observation that pigeons using the right eye/left hemisphere system were more likely to perform flight "loops", suggesting that, without right hemispheric visual processing, pigeons are more motivated to seek out visual input, behaviourally expanding the now monocularly reduced visual field. Taken together, the data are consistent with a more important role of the left eye/right hemisphere system in processing visual features of the landscape, which may contribute to the construction of the familiar landmark-based map used for navigation. More broadly, our data are consistent with the hypothesis that the right cerebral hemisphere of the avian brain plays a more important role in memorising and using the relational properties of visual stimuli to guide performance on spatial tasks.
   Pigeons challenged to learn visual landscape features with only the left or right eye displayed different patterns of flight behaviour.Birds using the right eye/left hemisphere showed a greater high spatial resolution tortuosity than birds using the left eye/right hemisphere.The results are consistent with an important role of the avian right brain hemisphere in memory-based, visuo-spatial tasks.

AB  - Preening behaviours are widespread in extant birds. While most birds appear to autopreen (self-directed preening), allopreening (preening directed at conspecifics) seems to have emerged only in certain species, but across many families. Allopreening has been hypothesised to reinforce mutual relationships and cooperation between individuals, and to underpin various socio-cognitive abilities. Palaeognathae is a bird group exhibiting neurocognitively plesiomorphic traits compared to other birds. They share many features with non-avian paravian dinosaurs and are thus important for the study of cognitive evolution in birds. Despite this, and the important correlation of allopreening with many complicated social behaviours, allopreening has not been systematically studied in Palaeognathae. Therefore, we examined the preening behaviours in four species of palaeognaths: common ostriches (Struthio camelus), greater rheas (Rhea americana), emus (Dromaius novaehollandiae), and elegant crested tinamous (Eudromia elegans). We compared findings with common ravens (Corvus corax), a neognath species known for its allopreening and complex social cognition. We found autopreening, but no allopreening, in the palaeognath species, while both autopreening and allopreening was found in common ravens. The absence of allopreening in Palaeognathae suggests an emergence of this behaviour within Neognathae. We contextualise our results in relation to the socio-cognitive underpinnings of allopreening and its implications for the understanding of the evolution of socio-cognitive abilities in non-avian paravian dinosaurs and early birds.

AB  - Copper (Cu) is an essential trace element for animals, and also an important nutritional component for the normal physiology and metabolism of animal reproductive systems. An excess or lack of Cu will directly or indirectly affect animal reproductive activities. However, the effect of Cu, in particular excessive Cu, on the reproductive performance of sows has not been studied. Here, we report that excessive Cu had negative effects on oocyte maturation and organelle functions. We showed that Cu exposure perturbed porcine oocyte meiotic maturation and impaired spindle/chromosome structure, resulting in a defective spindle assembly, as well as the abnormal distribution of actin dynamics and cortical granules. In addition, single-cell transcriptome analysis identified the target effectors of Cu actions in porcine oocytes, further demonstrating that Cu exposure affects the mitochondrial distribution and function, leading to the high levels of reactive oxygen species, DNA damage, and early apoptosis of porcine oocytes. These findings demonstrate that Cu exposure causes abnormalities in the mitochondrial distribution and function, resulting in the increased oxidative stress and levels of reactive oxygen species, DNA damage, and apoptosis, ultimately leading to a decreased porcine oocyte quality.

AB  - As a renowned tea with a historical significance in China, Gushan semi-rock tea originated from the Gushan Mountain in Fujian, China. This study describes the genetic diversity, population structure, and distribution characteristics of 76 tea samples collected from Gushan Mountain and neighboring regions, using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. The results show that the average information index (I) is 0.490, the average observed heterozygosity (Ho) is 0.384, the average expected heterozygosity (He) is 0.329, and the average fixation index (F) is - 0.132. The genetic variation mainly comes from intraregional variation, which accounts for 82% of the total variation. Furthermore, there is a closer connection between tea plants in Southern, Northern, and Eastern Fujian. The frequency of genetic exchange between tea plants in the Gushan semi-rock tea and those in Southern, Northern, and Eastern Fujian is relatively low, showing obvious uniqueness. The findings of this study help fill the gap in tea genome research in the Gushan semi-rock tea and provide valuable information on the genetic diversity of tea resources in Gushan area. The results can be utilized in future genomics, phylogeny, and breeding programs aimed at developing new tea cultivars.

AB  - A robust assessment of tunnels due to uncertainties present in soil and ground motion properties can affect the dynamic response of these structures. In this paper, a stochastic analysis considering an aleatory variability in shear velocity Vs by performing Monte Carlo simulations and assessing its influence on underground tunnels. To numerically assess the response of the soil-tunnel system to near-fault earthquake ground motion, the required computational domain usually spans multiple kilometers including both earthquake fault and the structure. Thus, these simulations are computationally expensive. An efficient alternative method, that is, the Domain Reduction Method (DRM), in which a modular two-step methodology for reducing the computational costs in the large domain analysis is employed. A 3-D soil-tunnel structure interaction is modeled to simulate the response of tunnel subjected to an inclined earthquake fault. The numerical simulation of the soil-tunnel-fault system is conducted in an open-source FE package called Multi-hazard Analysis for STOchastic time DOmaiN phenomena (MASTODON) based on MOOSE framework. The interactive analyses are carried out for three distinct types of soils based on National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) provision, that is, soft, medium, and hard, by generating 130 realizations. The results provide many insights into the influence of local site effects, that is, frequency shift for the peak response and the importance of input ground motion characteristics that govern the response of underground structures. The dynamic response of the structure is very sensitive to the uncertainty in rock material properties, especially, the stiffness of the rock sample and the shear wave velocity.

AB  - Prohydrojasmon (PDJ), an analog of jasmonic acid (JA), was found to induce direct and indirect defenses against herbivores in non-infested plants. To test whether PDJ can be used for pest control in crop production, we conducted experiments in pesticide-free Japanese radish fields from October 4 to December 12 in 2015. Twenty-four Japanese radish plants in three plots were treated with a 100 times-diluted commercial formulation (5%) of PDJ (treated plants), and 24 plants in three different plots were treated with water (control plants) until November 29 every week. Throughout the observation period, the number of aphids, leaf-mining fly larvae, vegetable weevils, and thrips was significantly lower on the treated plants than on the control plants. In contrast, the number of lepidopteran larvae was not significantly different between the treated and control plants throughout the study period. Parasitized aphids (mummies) were also observed in both plots. Poisson regression analyses showed that a significantly higher number of mummies was recorded on the treated plants as compared to that on the control plants when the number of aphids increased. This suggested that PDJ application to Japanese radish plants attracted more parasitoid wasps on the treated plants than on the control plants. We also identified eight terpenoids and methyl salicylate as the PDJ-induced plant volatiles in the headspace of the treated plants. Some of these volatiles might be responsible for attracting aphid-parasitoid wasps in the field. However, for other insect pests, we did not find any natural enemies. Interestingly, the genes of the JA and salicylic acid signaling pathways were differentially upregulated in the treated plants. We also observed that the PDJ treatments induced the expression of the genes related to glucosinolate biosynthesis and the subsequent isothiocyanate formation. Additionally, the weights of both the aboveground and belowground parts of the treated plants were significantly lower than those of the respective parts of the control plants. These results indicated that the treatment of Japanese radish plants with a 100 times-diluted commercial formulation of PDJ induced their direct and indirect defenses against several insect pest species to reduce their numbers, and negatively affected their biomass.

AB  - Bisphenol A (BPA) has been found to promote hepatotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, and developmental toxicity. However, the neurotoxicity and mechanism of BPA on cognitive function are still unclear. To that end, eightweek-old adult male and female C57BL/6J mice were exposed to 0.05, 0.5, 5, and 50 mg/kg BPA by dietary supplementation for 22 weeks. BPA exposure impaired learning and memory in male mice, associated with increased neuroinflammation and damaged blood-brain barrier. BPA exposure reduced the tight junctions in the colon, resulting in dysfunction of the gut barrier. The levels of neurotransmitters in the serum, hippocampus, and colon of male mice, including tryptophan, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, were all decreased by BPA, together with reduced expression of tryptophan and 5-HT metabolism-related genes. Cecal microbiota analysis revealed that the diversity and composition of the microbiota in male mice were markedly altered by BPA, leading to functional profile changes in the microbial community. These results suggest that the neurotoxicity of BPA in male mice may be partly regulated by the interactions of the microbiota-gut-brain axis. However, BPA has little effect on the cognitive function in female mice, which might be caused by the microbial differences and the role of estrogen receptors.

AB  - Since the beginning of the Cenozoic era, microorganisms have circulated worldwide, many of them cause significant morbidity and mortality in animals and humans. Ecological changes may favor transmission, and modifying of host-environment/pathogen interactions and leptospirosis is a good example of this, as it evolved from pathogens circulating in wildlife. Using data generated from an epidemiological survey and from the lab, the abortion burden of multiple microorganisms in sheep was predicted according to the artificial neural network approach and Generalized Linear Model (GLM) in a geographic area of the Mexican highlands. The results showed that the best GLM is integrated by the serological detection of Leptospira interrogans serovar Hardjo and Brucella ovis in animals on the slopes with elevation between 2600 and 2800 masl in the municipality of Xalatlaco. The sheep pen built with materials of metal grids and untreated wood, dirt and concrete floors, bed of straw, and the well water supply were also remained independently associated with infectious abortion. We suggest that sensitizing stakeholders on good agricultural practices could improve public health surveillance.
   Unidentified abortion, of which leptospirosis, brucellosis, and ovine enzootic abortion are important factors, is the main cause of disease spread between animals and humans in all agricultural systems in most developing countries. Although there are well-defined risk factors for these diseases, these characteristics do not represent the prevalence of the disease in different regions. This study predicts the unidentified abortion burden from multi-microorganisms in ewes based on an artificial neural networks approach and the GLM. Methods: A two-stage cluster survey design was conducted to estimate the seroprevalence of abortifacient microorganisms and to identify putative factors of infectious abortion. Results: The overall seroprevalence of Brucella was 70.7%, while Leptospira spp. was 55.2%, C. abortus was 21.9%, and B. ovis was 7.4%. Serological detection with four abortion-causing microorganisms was determined only in 0.87% of sheep sampled. The best GLM is integrated via serological detection of serovar Hardjo and Brucella ovis in animals of the slopes with elevation between 2600 and 2800 meters above sea level from the municipality of Xalatlaco. Other covariates included in the GLM, such as the sheep pen built with materials of metal grids and untreated wood, dirt and concrete floors, bed of straw, and the well water supply were also remained independently associated with infectious abortion. Approximately 80% of those respondents did not wear gloves or masks to prevent the transmission of the abortifacient zoonotic microorganisms. Conclusions: Sensitizing stakeholders on good agricultural practices could improve public health surveillance. Further studies on the effect of animal-human transmission in such a setting is worthwhile to further support the One Health initiative.

AB  - Azolla filiculoides is a tiny, free-floating aquatic fern and has a potential alternative protein and fibre source for ruminants, was investigated for its cultivation optimisation and feedstuff suitability. Study 1 was conducted to investigate the influence of different fertiliser types (control, broiler manure, sheep manure, cow manure) and concentrations (0.25 g/L-1.25 g/L) on the growth performance (fresh weight, doubling time, relative growth rate) and nutrient composition (dry matter, ash, crude protein, crude fibre, crude fat) of A. filiculoides. The optimised type of fertiliser and concentration in Study 1 were further adopted in Study 2 to evaluate the effect of different fertiliser processing methods on the growth performance, nutritive value and in vitro rumen digestibility of A. filiculoides upon cultivation. The findings in Study 1 showed that cultivation of A. filiculoides using sheep manure at the concentration of 1.00 g/L is the best resulted in the shortest doubling time (3 to 5 days) and produced fresh weight (FW), relative growth rate (RGR), crude protein (CP) and crude fibre (CF) at 132.2 g/m(2), 0.32 g/g/day, 21.2% DM-1 and 14.4% DM-1, respectively. Furthermore, unprocessed sheep manure (T3) exhibited superior (p < 0.05) fresh weight, relative growth rate, nutrient composition and fibre components compared to the burned manure treatment (T2). In vitro digestibility analysis discovered that T3 achieved a 24-hour accumulated gas production of 86.9 mL DM-1, with in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD), in vitro organic matter digestibility (IVOMD) and metabolisable energy (ME) of 82.9%, 43.7% and 5.8 MJ/kg DM, respectively. These findings suggest that Azolla filiculoides cultivation can be economically optimised using 1.00 g/L unprocessed sheep manure (fresh manure), potentially serving as a self-produced, nutritious feedstuff for ruminants.

AB  - Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are a category of high -concerned emerging contaminants which are suspected to correlate with various human adverse health outcomes including tumors. It is also a question whether shortchain PFASs are qualified alternatives under the regulation of long -chain PFASs. In this study, a threedimensional (3D) culture system based on Gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) hydrogel matrix was used to investigate the impacts of 120-h perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) exposure of MDAMB-231 cells. The results showed that PFOA exposure promoted the proliferation, migration, and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells in an environmentally relevant concentration range (0.1 to 10 mu M), exhibiting a clear malignant -promoting risk. In contrast, PFBA only showed a trend to induce non-invasive cell migration. Hippo/ YAP signaling pathway was identified as the contributor to the differences between the two PFASs. PFOA but PFBA reduced YAP phosphorylation and increased the nuclear content of YAP, which further facilitated abundant key factors of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. Our results provided a new idea for the carcinogenicity of PFOA using a 3D -based paradigm. Although the effects by PFBA were much milder than PFOA in the current test duration, the cell model suitable for longer exposure is still necessary to better assess the safety of alternative short -chain PFASs.

AB  - YAP activation in cancer is linked to poor outcomes, making it an attractive therapeutic target. Previous research focused on blocking the interaction of YAP with TEAD transcription factors. Here, we took a different approach by disrupting YAP's binding to the transcription factor B-MYB using MY-COMP, a fragment of B-MYB containing the YAP binding domain fused to a nuclear localization signal. MY-COMP induced cell cycle defects, nuclear abnormalities, and polyploidization. In an AKT and YAP-driven liver cancer model, MY-COMP significantly reduced liver tumorigenesis, highlighting the importance of the YAP-B-MYB interaction in tumor development. MY-COMP also perturbed the cell cycle progression of YAP-dependent uveal melanoma cells but not of YAP-independent cutaneous melanoma cell lines. It counteracted YAP-dependent expression of MMB-regulated cell cycle genes, explaining the observed effects. We also identified NIMA-related kinase (NEK2) as a downstream target of YAP and B-MYB, promoting YAP-driven transformation by facilitating centrosome clustering and inhibiting multipolar mitosis.

AB  - Records of Diptera and their hymenopteran parasitoids are reported from a ten-year study of herbivorous insects of Nantucket Island, Massachusetts, USA, with a focus on searching for galls, leaf mines, and other characteristic feeding evidence on host plants. Our field observations and reared specimens are supplemented with herbarium records and Johnson's (1930) list of the insect fauna of Nantucket. Compared with Johnson's list of nine species of Agromyzidae, we identified 53 along with 15 others determined only to genus or higher taxa (a few of the latter could conceivably be conspecific with the former or with one another). We found 37 named species of Cecidomyiidae (including eight of the nine on Johnson's list), as well as 26 others that are undescribed or are currently unidentifiable for other reasons (a few of which could conceivably be conspecific with one of the identified species, or represent galls not actually caused by midges). A few rearings and collections of Anthomyiidae, Chloropidae, Ephydridae, Phoridae, Sphaeroceridae, and Tephritidae are reported, adding another seven species and two genera to Johnson's list. Cerodontha (Dizygomyza) edithae Eiseman and Lonsdale (Agromyzidae), an as yet undescribed species of Ophiomyia Braschnikov (Agromyzidae), Megaselia nantucketensis Eiseman and Hartop (Phoridae), and the cecidomyiid parasitoids Platygaster tephrosiae Buhl and Eiseman and P. vitisiellae Buhl and Eiseman (Hymenoptera: Platygastridae) are known only from specimens reared as part of this study, which also produced paratypes of Liriomyza pistilla Lonsdale (Agromyzidae). Noteworthy cecidomyiid records include the first known specimens of an undescribed Asphondylia Loew on Solidago sempervirens L. (Asteraceae), galls of an undetermined lasiopterid species on Tephrosia virginiana (L.) Pers. (Fabaceae) that have only been found on Nantucket, and previously unreported galls on Gaylussacia baccata (Wangenh.) K. Koch (Ericaceae), Ionactis linariifolia (L.) Greene (Asteraceae) (Dasineura Rondani sp.), Quercus prinoides Willd. (Fagaceae), Salix purpurea L. (Salicaceae), and Solidago latissimifolia Mill.

AB  - The levels of amylose and amylopectin in foxtail millet are important factors that influence grain quality. The application of organic fertilizers can affect the ratio of amylose and amylopectin components. These components are typically determined using chemical analysis methods, which are difficult to apply on a large scale for nutrient deficiency diagnosis and do not meet the original intention of precise agricultural development. This study set up five different gradient treatments for organic fertilizer (sheep manure) application. Hyperspectral imaging combined with chemometrics was employed to achieve rapid and non-destructive detection of the content of amylose and amylopectin in foxtail millet flour. The aim of this study was to determine the optimal dosage of organic fertilizers for application. Spectral data preprocessing used multiplicative scatter correction (MSC), and the combined algorithm of competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS), random frog (RF), and iterated retaining informative variables (IRIVs) was employed for key band extraction. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) was then used to establish the prediction model and regression equation, which was used to visualize the two components. Results demonstrated that the key band extraction combined algorithm effectively reduced data dimension without compromising the accuracy of the prediction model. The prediction model for amylose using MSC-RF-IRIV-PLSR exhibited good performance, with the correlation coefficient (R) and root mean square error (RMSE) predicted to be 0.73 and 1.23 g/(100 g), respectively. Similarly, the prediction model for amylopectin using MSC-CARS-IRIV-PLSR also demonstrated good performance, with the R and RMSE values predicted to be 0.59 and 7.34 g/(100 g), respectively. The results of visualization and physicochemical determination showed that the amount of amylopectin accumulation was highest, and the amount of amylose was lowest, under the application of 22.5 t/ha of organic fertilizer. The experimental results offer valuable insights for the rapid detection of nutritional components in foxtail millet, serving as a basis for further research.

AB  - Modern tracking technology has facilitated a novel understanding of terrestrial mammal movement while revealing that movements are being truncated and lost. The first step towards conserving mobile animals is identifying movement corridors and key seasonal ranges. Yet, the identification and subsequent mapping of these important areas has remained a challenge due to the analytical skills necessary to conduct such analyses. Migration Mapper (MM) is a user-friendly software that provides tools to analyse global positioning system (GPS) collar data to create season-specific, population-level polygons representing areas where most of a population moves (i.e. movement corridors) and areas where most of a population spends time (e.g. high-use areas, seasonal ranges). MM consists of six standalone modules including data cleaning and review, seasonal movement delineation, movement model application, calculation of population-level outputs and visualization of results. Analysis of GPS data using MM can provide the spatial polygons necessary to facilitate conservation and policy planning. New initiatives at the local and global levels are already beginning to use MM to facilitate conservation of large, terrestrial mammals.

AB  - This study investigates the role of sea buckthorn HD-Zip genes in response to lead stress, identifying 28 genes distributed across 10 chromosomes, which are classified into four subfamilies. Each subfamily exhibits a similar gene structure and conserved protein motifs. The HD-Zip gene family is notably enriched in stress-responsive elements. Transcriptomic analysis revealed differential expression among the 28 members of the HD-Zip gene family in sea buckthorn, varying with different Pb ion concentrations. Upregulated genes were predominantly observed at stress concentrations of 1 g/kg and 5 g/kg, while downregulated genes were more prevalent at the 0.5 g/kg stress concentration. Covariance analysis indicated that large-scale gene duplication was the primary mechanism driving the expansion of the sea buckthorn HD-Zip gene family. Additionally, analysis of three-dimensional protein structures demonstrated high conservation within the HD-Zip gene, suggesting that certain sea buckthorn HD-Zip proteins may play significant regulatory roles in physiological functions. Scanning electron microscopy-energy-dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) analysis revealed that the majority of lead ions accumulated in the roots of the seedlings, with the lead concentration affecting the number, density, and function of leaf slits. These findings enhance our understanding of the complex regulatory mechanisms governing HD-Zip genes and will contribute to the genetic improvement of sea buckthorn for breeding under lead stress conditions.

AB  - High-dose ZnO is widely used to prevent diarrhea and promote growth of weaning piglets, which has led to serious problems of animal toxicity, bacterial resistance and environmental pollution. In this study, a novel alternative ZnO (AZO) was prepared and its physicochemical properties were characterized. Animal experiments were further con-ducted to evaluate the effects of the ZnO forms, the dose of AZO and the combinations with AZO on the growth per-formance, diarrhea, zinc metabolism and gut barrier function of weaning piglets. The results showed that the AZO, compared with ordinary ZnO (OZO), nano ZnO (NZO) and porous ZnO (PZO), had the largest surface area and reduced the release of Zn2+ into the gastric fluid. AZO showed better antibacterial activity on Escherichia coli K88, Staphylococ-cus aureus and Salmonella enteritidis but lower cytotoxicity on porcine intestinal epithelial cells. Animal experiments suggested that low-dose AZO, NZO and PZO (300 mg/kg) improved growth performance and reduced diarrhea in weaning piglets as well as high-dose OZO (3000 mg/kg). Notably, low-dose AZO had the lowest diarrhea incidence. Additionally, low-dose AZO in combination with probiotics improved digestibility and digestive enzyme activities. Low-dose AZO in combination with probiotics also upregulated the expression of the intestinal zinc transporter pro-teins ZIP4 and DMT1, increased zinc bioavailability, reduced faecal zinc emissions, and avoided zinc overload in the liver and oxidative damage caused by high-dose ZnO. Moreover, low-dose AZO in combination with probiotics im-proved the gut barrier function of weaning piglets by promoting the expression of tight junction proteins, mucins and antimicrobial peptides and increasing gut microbiota diversity and beneficial Lactobacillus.

AB  - Myrmecophytes may adjust the investment on ant rewards, depending on tree size and ant defence level. In swollen-thorn acacias (Vachellia collinsii), we tested whether the level of protection provided by the resident ants (defending vs. non-defending) influenced the relation between tree size and ant rewards, or between types of ant rewards (housing and food). We quantified ant rewards in trees occupied by defending and by non-defending ants. We predicted: (1) a positive relation between plant diameter and ant reward investment, with a steeper slope for defending than for non-defending ant species; and (2) that if there is any tradeoff between ant rewards, it should be aggravated (steeper slope) when inhabited by non-defending ants. We found that most structures for ants grew according to plant diameter, but contrary to our first prediction it was independent of the level of ant defence. Most ant rewards did not show a tradeoff between them, besides a weak negative relation between spine length and number of pinnules, which contrary to the prediction occurred when occupied by defending ants. The evidence shows that the interacting ants had a weaker influence on the scaling of defence structures in myrmecophytes than the habitat (location).

AB  - Simple Summary A pig inventory is an important part of realizing accurate and large-scale farming. Distinguishing from the current, mostly overhead scene or static map counting, this study proposes a video-based dynamic counting method through which pigs can be counted automatically and continuously in complex scenes. The improved model effectively reduces the counting error and improves the operation efficiency, which provides data and experimental references for the study of automated pig counting, and it also provides technical support to improve the management efficiency of pig farms, reducing the cost and promoting the intelligent transformation of the animal husbandry industry.Abstract A pig inventory is a crucial component of achieving precise and large-scale farming. In complex pigsty environments, due to pigs' stress reactions and frequent obstructions, it is challenging to count them accurately and automatically. This difficulty contrasts with most current deep learning studies, which rely on overhead views or static images for counting. This research proposes a video-based dynamic counting method, combining YOLOv7 with DeepSORT. By utilizing the YOLOv7 network structure and optimizing the second and third 3 x 3 convolution operations in the head network ELAN-W with PConv, the model reduces the computational demand and improves the inference speed without sacrificing accuracy. To ensure that the network acquires accurate position perception information at oblique angles and extracts rich semantic information, we introduce the coordinate attention (CA) mechanism before the three re-referentialization paths (REPConv) in the head network, enhancing robustness in complex scenarios. Experimental results show that, compared to the original model, the improved model increases the mAP by 3.24, 0.05, and 1.00 percentage points for oblique, overhead, and all pig counting datasets, respectively, while reducing the computational cost by 3.6 GFLOPS. The enhanced YOLOv7 outperforms YOLOv5, YOLOv4, YOLOv3, Faster RCNN, and SSD in target detection with mAP improvements of 2.07, 5.20, 2.16, 7.05, and 19.73 percentage points, respectively. In dynamic counting experiments, the improved YOLOv7 combined with DeepSORT was tested on videos with total pig counts of 144, 201, 285, and 295, yielding errors of -3, -3, -4, and -26, respectively, with an average accuracy of 96.58% and an FPS of 22. This demonstrates the model's capability of performing the real-time counting of pigs in various scenes, providing valuable data and references for automated pig counting research.

AB  - Cognitive dysfunction is the main clinical manifestation of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previous research found that elevated orexin level in the cerebrospinal fluid was closely related to the course of AD, and orexin-A treatment could increase amyloid beta protein (A beta) deposition and aggravate spatial memory impairment in APP/PS1 mice. Furthermore, recent research found that dual orexin receptor (OXR) antagonist might affect A beta level and cognitive dysfunction in AD, but the effects of OX1R or OX2R alone is unreported until now. Considering that OX1R is highly expressed in the hippocampus and plays important roles in learning and memory, the effects of OX1R in AD cognitive dysfunction and its possible mechanism should be investigated. In the present study, selective OX1R antagonist SB-334867 was used to block OX1R. Then, different behavioral tests were performed to observe the effects of OX1R blockade on cognitive function of 3xTg-AD mice exhibited both A beta and tau pathology, in vivo electrophysiological recording and western blot were used to investigate the po-tential mechanism. The results showed that chronic OX1R blockade aggravated the impairments of short-term working memory, long-term spatial memory and synaptic plasticity in 9-month-old female 3xTg-AD mice, increased levels of soluble A beta oligomers and p-tau, and decreased PSD-95 expression in the hippocampus of 3xTg-AD mice. These results indicate that the detrimental effects of SB-334867 on cognitive behaviors in 3xTg-AD mice are closely related to the decrease of PSD-95 and depression of in vivo long-term potentiation (LTP) caused by increased A beta oligomers and p-tau.

AB  - Pnigalio pectinicornis (L.) (Hymenoptera Eulophidae) is a widespread polyphagous ectoparasitoid of leaf -mining or gall -producing insects found in subtropical and temperate regions. In an attempt to evaluate the effectiveness of this parasitoid as a biological control agent, life table parameters and the effect of temperature on its fecundity, longevity, host-instar choice, superparasitism and host feeding were studied on Phyllocnistis citrella Stainton (Lepidoptera Gracillariidae). Tests were conducted at 20, 25 and 30 +/- 0.5 degrees C with 60 +/- 10% RH under a 14L:10D photoperiod. P. pectinicornis oviposition period was significantly longer at 20 degrees C than at 25 degrees C and 30 degrees C. In terms of fecundity, females laid the highest mean number of eggs (110.3) at 20 degrees C followed by 38.6 and 35.6 at 25 degrees C and 30 degrees C, respectively. Female longevity was almost double (71.5 days) at the lowest temperature tested (20 degrees C). The net reproductive rate ( R o ) was highest (18.8, female offspring produced per female) at 20 degrees C, and lowest (2.1) at 30 degrees C. Fol- lowing the above pattern, mean generation time ( T : 51.36-32.2), intrinsic rate of increase ( r m : 0.073-0.027) and finite rate of increase ( lambda : 1.076-1.027) were maximum at 20 degrees C and minimum at 30 degrees C. Population -doubling time (DT) peaked to 25.29 days at 30 degrees C and was reduced to only 9.42 days at 20 degrees C. P. pectinicornis prefers to oviposit on 4 th instar larvae two and three times more than on 3 rd instar larvae or pupae of P. citrella , respectively at all temperatures tested. Temperature significantly affected percent of self- superparasitism which was highest at 20 degrees C (27.3%). Temperature did not significantly affect daily host feeding rates. The above results indicate that P. pectinicornis is much better adapted at lower temperatures typical for the Mediterranean climatic conditions during late spring and autumn. Gaining knowledge about these parameters is essential to understand its population dynamics in the field and its role in regulating the population of this herbivorous insect compared to other parasitoid species.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to investigate the effect of artificial light with different spectral composition and distribution on axial growth in guinea pigs. Three-week-old guinea pigs were randomly assigned to groups exposed to natural light, low color temperature light-emitting diode (LED) light, two full spectrum artificial lights (E light and Julia light) and blue light filtered light with the same intensity. Axial lengths of guinea pigs' eyes were measured by A-scan ultrasonography prior to the experiment and every 2 weeks during the experi-ment. After light exposure for 12 weeks, retinal dopamine (DA), dihydroxy-phenylacetic acid (DOPAC) levels and DOPAC/DA ratio were analyzed by high-pressure liquid chromatography electrochemical detection and retinal histological structure was observed. Retinal melanopsin expression was detected using Western blot and immunohistochemistry. After exposed to different kinds of light with different spectrum for 4 weeks, the axial lengths of guinea pigs' eyes in LED group and Julia light group were significantly longer than those of natural light group. After 6 weeks, the axial lengths in LED light group were significantly longer than those of E light group and blue light filtered group. The difference between axial lengths in E light group and Julia light group showed statistical significance after 8 weeks (p<0.05). After 12 weeks of light exposure, the comparison of reti-nal DOPAC/DA ratio and melanopsin expression in each group was consistent with that of axial length. In guinea pigs, continuous full spectrum artificial light with no peak or valley can inhibit axial elongation via reti-nal dopaminergic and melanopsin system.

AB  - Sulfur (S) is an essential macronutrient required by plants. Plants absorb and transport S through sulfate transporters (SULTRs). In this study, we cloned 8 SULTR genes (CsSULTR1;1/1;2/2;1/3;1/3;2/3;3/3;5/4;1) from tea plant (Camellia sinensis), all of which contain a typical sulfate transporter and antisigma factor antagonist (STAS) conserved domain. Phylogenetic tree analysis further divided the CsSULTRs into four main groups. Many cis-acting elements related to hormones and environmental stresses were found within the promoter sequence of CsSULTRs. Subcellular localization results showed that CsSULTR4;1 localized in the vacuolar membrane and that other CsSULTRs localized to the cellular membrane. The tissue-specific expression of the 8 CsSULTR genes showed different expression patterns during the active growing period and dormancy period. In particular, the expression of CsSULTR1;1 was highest in the roots, but that of CsSULTR1;2 was lowest in the dormancy period. The expression of CsSULTR1;1/1;2/2;1/3;2 was stimulated under different concentrations of selenium (Se) and S; moreover, CsSULTR1;2/2;1/3;3/3;5 was upregulated in response to different valences of Se.

AB  - Toxic metal contamination (such as Cd, Cr and Pb) in processed and raw dairy products is an important environmental and public health concern. The accumulation of these metals in dairy products causes health threats to consumers. Various anthropogenic and natural activities discharge metals into the soil, where they are consumed by plants and become a part of the food chain. In addition, there is a considerable risk of metal contamination in dairy products during various business processes. The present study was carried out to determine the quantities of toxic metals found in dairy product samples. These dairy products have been classified into two groups: raw dairy products, which were self-extracted from cows and buffaloes employing adequate hygiene, and processed dairy products, which were bought from the Abbottabad market. These samples were generated using a double acid digestion approach, and toxic metals were quantified using atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS). For health risk assessment, the Health Risk Index (HRI), Target Hazard Quotient (THQ), and the Target Cancer Risk (TCR) indices were used. The relative levels of toxic metals in processed dairy product samples were as follows: Cd levels were highest in cheese (0.106+0.006 mg/kg), followed by butter and desi ghee (0.089+0.066 and 0.074+0.043 mg/kg, respectively). Cr concentrations were maximum in flavored milk (0.471+ 0.290 mg/kg) and desi ghee (0.371+ 0.01 mg/kg). Pb levels found in cheese were higher (1.753+0.194 mg/kg), then desi ghee and butter (1.025+0.01 and 0.652+0.397 mg/kg, respectively). Toxic metals in raw dairy products were measured in cow samples in the order of Cr >= Pb >= Cd. In a similar manner for buffalo samples, toxic metals followed the same trend as in cow samples. Though the concentrations of targeted metals in both raw and processed dairy product samples exceeded the threshold levels, the estimated levels of THQ and TCR were within the permissible range. However, our findings suggest that these metals in dairy products should be assessed on a continuous basis, as anthropogenic activities are contributing substantially to metal contamination.

AB  - In February 2021, the Wisconsin DNR implemented a wolf season in which > 20% of the population was killed in 63 h. Wisconsin's Ojibwe tribes had a visceral reaction to this killing. This paper provides a perspective for this reaction by reviewing the Ojibwe relationship with Ma'iingan. This relationship maintains that Ma'iingan and Ojibwe are to be considered relatives whose fates are intertwined. Ma'iingan and Ojibwe have lived parallel histories, suffering from the effects of colonization, the decimation of wolf populations and decline of tribal culture. The Ojibwe tribes ceded vast territories in treaties with the United States while retaining common use rights, including the right to hunt and fish. These rights were reaffirmed just as wolves were reestablishing themselves in Wisconsin. The tribes continue to strengthen their culture, while wolf populations continue to recover. By examining these comparative histories, it becomes apparent that "whatever happens to one happens to the other." Unfortunately, Ma'iingan were not adjudicated during the Wisconsin treaty case, creating uncertainty over how the relationship between the Ojibwe and Ma'iingan is to be respected by the state. The tribes believe their treaty right includes protection for wolves, so that wolves can fulfill their cultural and ecological purposes. Tribes maintain that Ma'iingan should determine their own population levels, in order to provide ecological and cultural benefits. A respectful and appreciative relationship with Ma'iingan should be maintained so that the future well-being of both Ma'iingan and the Ojibwe will be assured.

AB  - Pestalotioid fungi were isolated in pure culture from symptomatic plants of Callistemon laevis, C. viminalis, Luma apiculata (marketed as "Myr tus luma"), Myrtus communis subsp. tarentina, and M. communis var. microphylla (M. communis 'Microphylla'), showing twig canker, dieback and defoliation. The isolates were identified to species by ITS, teft and tub2 sequences, which revealed the presence of six species of Neopestalotiopsis (N. camelliae-oleiferae, N. hispanica, N. iberica, N. rosae, N. rosicola, and N. zakeelii) and one species of Pestalotiopsis (P. biciliata). While most species were isolated only once or twice, the majority of isolates belonged to N. rosae (13) and N. hispanica (8). Pathogenicity was investigated by pathogenicity tests on all hosts, which confirmed the pathogenicity of all Neopestalotiopsis species on at least some of the hosts tested, while P. biciliata did not cause any disease symptoms.

AB  - Simple Summary Saliva is a sample with a high potential in pigs since it is usually easy to obtain and its collection from animals causes less stress than blood sampling. However, the possible effects of daily variations in many salivary biomarkers are still unknown in this species. In our report, the possible variations depending on the sampling time in the day in a panel of 26 salivary biomarkers related to stress, immune system, redox status and other physiological functions in the saliva of pigs were evaluated. In our experimental conditions, daily variations were observed in cortisol, alpha-amylase, total esterase, butyrylcholinesterase, lipase, adenosine deaminase isoenzyme 1, uric acid, superoxide dismutase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, triglycerides and lactate. In some analytes, these differences appeared in both sexes, whereas others only showed differences in one sex. These variations should be taken into consideration for an appropriate interpretation of these analytes in the saliva of healthy pigs. This study aims to evaluate the possible variations due to the sampling time in the day in 26 analytes of pigs' saliva, related to stress, the immune system, redox status and other biomarkers related to metabolism and selected tissues and organs, in order to know the possible effects of the hour of the day in their interpretation. These analytes were measured in saliva obtained from a population of 40 clinically healthy pigs from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., every 4 h in the same day. In our experimental conditions, daily variations were observed in cortisol, salivary alpha-amylase, total esterase activity, butyrylcholinesterase, lipase, adenosine deaminase isoenzyme 1, uric acid, superoxide dismutase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, lactate and triglycerides. These changes appeared in both sexes, except for adenosine deaminase isoenzyme 1 and superoxide dismutase which only showed differences in females. In conclusion, this report indicates that, in the experimental conditions of this trial, the time of the day and sex can influence the values obtained in various salivary analytes in pigs. These variations should thus be taken into consideration for an adequate interpretation of these analytes when used for the evaluation of health and welfare in this species.

AB  - Aim of study: To evaluate the physicochemical and sensory quality of meat from Santa Ines x Dorper lambs fed diets with increasing levels of sunflower cake.
   Area of study: Rio Grande do Norte (Brazil).
   Material and methods: Twenty-four castrated lambs (initial weight of 18.9 +/- 2.17 kg) were distributed in a completely randomized design with four treatments (0, 5, 10 and 15% sunflower cake in diet) with six repetitions and kept in confinement until reaching the average body weight of 32.1 +/- 2.6 kg. The Longissimus lumborum muscle was used for proximate composition and physicochemical analyzes, and the Semimembranosus muscle was used for pH (after 24 h of slaughter) and sensory analysis assays.
   Main results: The increasing levels of sunflower cake did not affect the composition or physicochemical properties. Sensory analysis also did not reveal significant differences in meat obtained from animals in different diets. Principal Components Analysis indicated that juiciness, color, odor and flavor were positioned opposite to protein, texture, and ash.
   Research highlights: The use of sunflower cake in diets for crossbred sheep Dorper x Santa Ines as soybean meal and corn replacer, up to 15% inclusion of soybean meal and corn, does not affect the proximate composition, physicochemical or sensory characteristics of the meat.

AB  - Tan sheep outperform Dorper sheep in meat-quality traits, including muscle fiber characteristics and fatty acid composition, while Dorper sheep excel in carcass weight. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these breed-specific traits, especially gut microbiota-bile acid (BA) interactions, remain poorly understood. As host-microbiota co-metabolites, BAs are converted by colonic microbiota via bile salt hydrolase (BSH) and dehydroxylases into secondary BAs, which activate BA receptors to regulate host lipid and glucose metabolism. This study analyzed colonic BA profiles in 8-month-old Tan and Dorper sheep, integrating microbiome and longissimus dorsi muscle transcriptome data to investigate the gut-muscle axis in meat-quality and carcass trait regulation. Results showed that Tan sheep had 1.6-fold higher secondary BA deoxycholic acid (DHCA) levels than Dorper sheep (p < 0.05), whereas Dorper sheep accumulated conjugated primary BAs glycocholic acid (GCA) and tauro-alpha-muricholic acid (p < 0.05). Tan sheep exhibited downregulated hepatic BA synthesis genes, including cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) and 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1), alongside upregulated transport genes such as bile salt export pump (BSEP), sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP), and ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 4 (ABCB4), with elevated gut BSH activity (p < 0.05). DHCA was strongly correlated with g_Ruminococcaceae_UCG-014, ENSOARG00000001393, and ENSOARG00000016726, muscle fiber density, diameter, and linoleic acid (C18:2n6t) (|r| > 0.5, p < 0.05). In contrast, GCA was significantly associated with g_Lachnoclostridium_10, g_Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group, ENSOARG0000001232, carcass weight, and net meat weight (|r| > 0.5, p < 0.05). In conclusion, breed-specific colonic BA profiles were shaped by host-microbiota interactions, with DHCA potentially promoting meat quality in Tan sheep via regulation of muscle fiber development and fatty acid deposition, and GCA influencing carcass traits in Dorper sheep. This study provides novel insights into the gut microbiota-bile acid axis in modulating ruminant phenotypic traits.

AB  - Background: Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) around the time of birth results from loss of oxygen (hypoxia) and blood supply (ischemia). Exogenous infusion of multi-potential cells, including human amnion epithelial cells (hAECs), can reduce hypoxic-ischemic (HI) brain injury. However, there are few data on treatment of severe HI in large animal paradigms at term. The aim of the current study was to determine whether infusion of hAECs early after injury may reduce brain damage after ischemia in near-term fetal sheep. Methods: Chronically instrumented fetal sheep (0.85 gestation) received 30 min of global cerebral ischemia followed by intravenous infusion of hAECs from 2 h after the end of ischemia (ischemia-hAEC, n = 6) or saline (ischemia-vehicle, n = 7). Sham control animals received sham ischemia with vehicle infusion (sham control, n = 8). Results: Ischemia was associated with significant suppression of EEG power and spectral edge frequency until the end of the experiment and a secondary rise in cortical impedance from 24 to 72 h, which were not attenuated by hAEC administration. Ischemia was associated with loss of neurons in the cortex, thalamus, striatum and hippocampus, loss of white matter oligodendrocytes and increased microglial numbers in the white matter, which were not affected by hAEC infusion. Conclusions: A single intravenous administration of hAECs did not reduce electrographic or histological brain damage after 30 min of global cerebral ischemia in near-term fetal sheep.

AB  - Adolescence is a critical period of establishing social relations through social interactions that affect the emotional development associated with stress responses, anxiety, depression, and cognitive development. We investigated the behavioral and neurobiological changes induced by handling and social isolation in adolescent rats to determine social interaction effects. Rats were randomly divided into groups and used as a control, a handling, and a social isolation group. After 12 weeks, the handling group showed a significant increase in mobility in the open field test and in tryptophan hydroxylase expression in the dorsal raphe nucleus, as well as significantly reduced immobility times in the forced swim test, compared to the control group (p < 0.05). The social isolation group, in contrast, showed a significant increase in immobility times in the forced swim test and in glucocorticoid and SIRT1 expression in the hippocampus, as well as a significant reduction in mobility in the open field test and in escape latency times in the passive avoidance test, compared to the control group (p < 0.05). The present results show that while handling did not improve cognitive function, it reduced anxiety and lowered depression levels; social isolation, in contrast, significantly impaired the animals' stress response, anxiety and depression levels, and cognitive function. Our findings indicate that handling and social isolation have a strong effect on adolescents' emotional and cognitive development into healthy adults.

AB  - Variation in leaf venation network architecture may reflect trade-offs among multiple functions including efficiency, resilience, support, cost, and resistance to drought and herbivory. However, our knowledge about architecture-function trade-offs is mostly based on studies examining a small number of functional axes, so we still lack a more integrative picture of multidimensional trade-offs. Here, we measured architecture and functional traits on 122 ferns and angiosperms species to describe how trade-offs vary across phylogenetic groups and vein spatial scales (small, medium, and large vein width) and determine whether architecture traits at each scale have independent or integrated effects on each function. We found that generalized architecture-function trade-offs are weak. Architecture strongly predicts leaf support and damage resistance axes but weakly predicts efficiency and resilience axes. Architecture traits at different spatial scales contribute to different functional axes, allowing plants to independently modulate different functions by varying network properties at each scale. This independence of vein architecture traits within and across spatial scales may enable evolution of multiple alternative leaf network designs with similar functioning.

AB  - Social media content is increasingly being validated and used as a valuable source of data within conservation science. Metadata obtained from social networking sites (SNS) can supplement knowledge and data gaps in traditional ecological monitoring programs by increasing the spatiotemporal extent of sampling. Here we consider SNS in the context of rare and threatened species, which are difficult to monitor due to their often-inaccessible habitat, or elusive and unpredictable occurrences. We focus on a recovering large whale population, as charismatic megafauna often appear on SNS and are ideal for public outreach sightings data. Southern right whales (Eubalaena australis, SRW) were once abundant throughout New Zealand waters. However, following widespread population decline during whaling, no SRW was reported around the mainland for 35 years, with the remnant population persisting only in the remote subantarctic islands. By using sightings data from 2011 to 2021 in the New Zealand Department of Conservation's (DOC) Marine Mammal Database and supplementing with crowd-sourced sightings reports made on SNS (Facebook and iNaturalist), we present evidence that SRWs are continuing to recover slowly around the mainland compared to their subantarctic breeding grounds. All sightings' data were categorised based on confidence of accuracy, for example, accompanying genetic or photographic confirmation of species identity. Sightings remain rare with only 116 sightings from both DOC and SNS sources reported over the 11-year research period (2011-2021), hindering efforts to identify key habitats and implement conservation measures. SNS sightings increased the overall number and quality of sightings. Specifically, as SNS sightings were all accompanied by images permitting confident species ID, they increased the overall quality of the dataset and provided new information on the fine-scale movement and residency times of SRW. Although opportunistic data such as these have limitations, our work suggests that the recolonisation of SRWs around mainland New Zealand has not increased in the past decade. This could reflect historic loss of matrilineal knowledge of the mainland, or it could also be an artifact of very few whales, resulting in less social aggregations frequenting the region. Citizen science and the use of SNS data are important for the continued monitoring of the New Zealand SRW population, with SNS data creating further opportunities to monitor similarly rare and data deficient populations.

AB  - Sheep are important herbivorous domestic animal globally, and the Chinese indigenous sheep breed has a multitude of economically significant variations due to the diverse geographical and ecological conditions. In particular, certain native breeds exhibit a visible high litter size phenotype due to the selection pressure of natural and artificial for thousands of years, offering an ideal animal model for investigating sheep's fecundity. In this study, selective signal analysis was performed on public whole-genome sequencing data from 60 sheep across eight breeds to identify candidate genes related to litter size. Results revealed that a total of 34,065,017 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified from all sheep, and 65 candidate genes (CDGs) were pinpointed from the top 1% of interacted windows and SNPs between the pairwise fixation index (FST, >0.149543) and cross-population extended haplotype homozygosity (XP-EHH, >0.701551). A total of 41 CDGs (e.g. VRTN, EYA2 and MCPH1) were annotated to 576 GO terms, of which seven terms were directly linked to follicular and embryonic development (e.g. TBXT, BMPR1B, and BMP2). In addition, 73 KEGG pathways were enriched by 21 CDGs (e.g. ENTPD5, ABCD4 and RXFP2), mainly related to Hippo (TCF4, BMPR1B and BMP2), TGF-beta (BMPR1B and BMP2), PI3K-Akt (ITGB4, IL4R and PPP2R5A) and Jak-STAT signalling pathways (IL20RA and IL4R). Notably, a series of CDGs was under strong selection in sheep with high litter size traits. These findings result could improve the comprehension of the genetic underpinnings of sheep litter size. Furthermore, it provides valuable CDGS for future molecular breeding.

AB  - Copper (Cu) is an essential trace mineral, but its excessive intake can lead to potentially toxic effects on host physiology. The mammalian intestine harbors various microorganisms that are associated with intestinal barrier function and inflammation. In this study, the influences of Cu on barrier function, microbiota, and its metabolites were examined in the jejunum and colon of pigs. Here, we identified that the physical and chemical barrier functions were impaired both in the jejunum and colon, as evidenced by the decreased expression of tight junction proteins (ZO-1, Occludin, Claudin-1, and JAM-1) and mucous secretion-related genes, positive rate of Muc2, and secretion of SIgA and SIgG. Additionally, inflammatory cytokines were overexpressed in the jejunum and colon. Furthermore, Cu might increase the abundances of Mycoplasma, Actinobacillus and unidentified_Enterobacteriaceae in the jejunum, which significantly affected pentose and glucoronate interconversions, histidine metabolism, folate biosynthesis, porphyrin metabolism, and purine metabolism. Meanwhile, the abundances of Lactobacillus and Methanobrevibacter were remarkably decreased and Streptococcus, unidentified_Enterobacteriaceae, and unidentified_Muribaculaceae were significantly increased in the colon, with an evident impact on glycerophospholipid metabolism, retinol metabolism, and steroid hormone biosynthesis. These findings revealed that excess Cu had significant effects on the microbiota and metabolites in the jejunum and colon, which were involved in intestinal barrier dysfunction and inflammation.

AB  - Plant defence responses to herbivory vary with foliage age, which in angiosperms lasts a few months, but may be several years in conifers. While age-dependent leaf responses of angiosperms to insect herbivory are well studied, much less is known about anti-herbivore responses of conifer needles that differ in age by a year or more. Similarly, insect responses to conifer foliage that differs in age by years have rarely been studied. Here, we used Pinus sylvestris L. (Scots pine) and the herbivorous sawfly Diprion pini to elucidate (i) the responses of this herbivore to pine needles of different age and (ii) needle age-dependent differences in two anti-herbivore plant defence traits, rarely studied in interactions of conifers and phyllophagous insects, i.e., phytohormones and proteinase inhibitor (PI) activity.The sawfly D. pini preferred old (previous year) over young (current year) pine needles for oviposition and feeding by late larval instars. The insect benefited from these preferences through higher egg survival rates on old needles and more larval weight when feeding upon old needles.Scots pine needles showed needle-age dependent differences in their phytohormonal responses to D. pini larval feeding. Feeding-induced concentrations of salicylic acid and abscisic acid were higher in young than old needles. No such age dependency was detected for herbivory-induced changes in levels of jasmonic acid, in contrast to known, age-dependent jasmonic acid responses to damage in angiosperms. Contrary to angiosperms, PI activities of pine were not induced by sawfly feeding upon young or old needles. However, old needles showed constitutively significantly lower PI activities, which are discussed with respect to the benefits that D. pini gains when preferring old needles. Our results highlight the developmental plasticity of defence traits of conifer foliage as well as the adaptation of a pine herbivore specialist to these defences.

AB  - To identify the effect of microzooplankton grazing on phytoplankton abundance and size structure, we quantified phytoplankton growth and herbivorous grazing rates throughout the euphotic zone and across a light gradient on the North Pacific EXport Processes in the Ocean from RemoTe Sensing (EXPORTS) cruise near Ocean Station Papa. During 30 days of continuous, Lagrangian observation in August and September of 2018, depth integrated chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentrations were stable and averaged 20 +/- 2 mgm(-2). Bottle-incubation experiments revealed that phytoplankton growth was balanced by microzooplankton grazing even when phytoplankton growth rates varied from 0 to 0.4 d(-1) in response to light manipulation. Microzooplankton grazing caused a decline in phytoplankton abundance that was balanced by increased phytoplankton cell size resulting in consistent phytoplankton biomass over time. Microzooplankton grazed phytoplankton at an average rate of 0.11 +/- 0.17 d(-1) which lead to an intrinsic phytoplankton growth rate of -0.07 +/- 0.26 d(-1). Predicted stocks from grazing experiments aligned closely (within 16%) with in situ Chl a dynamics and phytoplankton abundance, suggesting that the dominant loss process of phytoplankton was grazing by microzooplankton rather than physical mixing or sinking of phytoplankton. Consequently, microzooplankton played a critical role in regulating primary producer biomass and in transferring particulate organic carbon through the food web where a fraction could then be exported as byproducts of food web processes.

AB  - Melatonin is a pleiotropic molecule with a variety of biological functions, which include its immunoregulatory action in mammals. Brucellosis is a worldwide endemic zoonotic disease caused by the Brucella, which not only causes huge economic losses for the livestock industry but also impacts human health. To target this problem, in current study, two marker-free transgenic sheep overexpressing melatonin synthetic enzyme ASMT (acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase) gene were generated and these melatonin enrich transgenic sheep were challenged by Brucella infection. The results showed that the serum melatonin concentration was significantly higher in transgenic sheep than that of wild type (726.92 +/- 70.6074 vs 263.10 +/- 34.60 pg/mL, P < .05). Brucella challenge test showed that two thirds (4/6) of the wild-type sheep had brucellosis, while none of the transgenic sheep were infected. Whole-blood RNA-seq results showed that differential expression genes (DEGs) were significantly enriched in natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity, phagosome, antigen processing, and presentation signaling pathways in overexpression sheep. The DEGs of toll-like receptors (TLRs) and NOD-like receptors (NLRs) families were verified by qPCR and it showed that TLR1, TLR2, TLR7, CD14, NAIP, and CXCL8 expression levels in overexpression sheep were significantly higher and NLRP1, NLRP3, and TNF expression levels were significantly lower than those of wild type. The rectal feces were subjected to 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing, and the microbial functional analysis showed that the transgenic sheep had significantly lower abundance of microbial genes related to infectious diseases compared to the wild type, indicating overexpression animals are likely more resistant to infectious diseases than wild type. Furthermore, exogenous melatonin treatment relieved brucellosis inflammation by upregulating anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-4 and downregulating pro-inflammatory IL-2, IL-6, and IFN-gamma. Our preliminary results provide an informative reference for the study of the relationship between melatonin and brucellosis.

AB  - Plants have evolved a number of different chemical defenses, covering nearly all classes of (secondary) metabolites, that represent a major barrier to herbivory: some are constitutive; others are induced after attacks from herbivores (HIPVs) and may elicit the attraction of predators and parasitoids. Here, we studied how the female solitary endoparasitoid Aphelinus varipes responds to plant and host aphid volatiles in a series of experiments on five commercially important vegetables that were either healthy or infested with the aphid Myzus persicae: chili pepper, eggplant, crown daisy, Chinese cabbage and cabbage. The results for the olfactory responses of A. varipes showed that the presence of M. persicae increased the attraction of the endoparasitoid to the infested plants. In a second experiment, volatiles from highly attractive and repellent plants were obtained via headspace collection to investigate volatiles from healthy and aphid-damaged plants. The results for the differences in volatile profiles in response to aphid infestation in chili pepper cultivar were dominated by the volatile blends, including alpha-pinene, decanal and phthalic acid, while in cabbage they were dominated by isophorone. Moreover, when HIPVs with different concentrations were compared, alpha-pinene at a dose rate of 100 ng/mu L attracted more parasitoids, and the comparison was useful to understand the mechanisms of plant secondary volatiles during aphid infestation and to provide new resources to control this insect pest. Overall our study shows how HIPVs can bolster tritrophic interactions by enhancing the attractiveness of parasitoids.

AB  - Poststroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) is a common complication of stroke, but effective treatments are currently lacking. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is gradually being applied to treat PSCI, but there is limited evidence of its efficacy. To determine rTMS effects on PSCI, we constructed a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) rat model. Rats were then grouped by random digital table method: the sham group (n = 10), tMCAO group (n = 10) and rTMS group (n = 10). The shuttle box and Morris water maze (MWM) tests were conducted to detect the cognitive functions of the rats. In addition, synaptic density and synaptic ultrastructural parameters, including the active zone length, synaptic cleft width, and postsynaptic density (PSD) thickness, were quantified and analyzed using an electron microscope. What's more, synaptic associated proteins, including PSD95, SYN, and BDNF were detected by western blot. According to the shuttle box and MWM tests, rTMS improved tMCAO rats' cognitive functions, including spatial learning and memory and decisionmaking abilities. Electron microscopy revealed that rTMS significantly increased the synaptic density, synaptic active zone length and PSD thickness and decreased the synaptic cleft width. The western blot results showed that the expression of PSD95, SYN, and BDNF was markedly increased after rTMS stimulation. Based on these results, we propose that 20 Hz rTMS can significantly alleviate cognitive impairment after stroke. The underlying mechanism might be modulating the synaptic plasticity and up-regulating the expression PSD95, SYN, and BDNF in the hippocampus.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the effects of replacing egg yolk extender with sesame oil on the quality of sperm in goats following incubation at 37 degrees C, chilling at 4 degrees C, and freezing. Semen samples were collected from four intact male goats. The individual semen sample was divided into six groups consisting of a control group and five treatment groups with different egg yolk-tosesame oil ratios. Seminal plasma was removed, and the sperm pellet was diluted with experimental semen extenders. The control group contained an extender of 10 % egg yolk (SO0), and the experimental extenders were composed of 8.75 % egg yolk and 1.25 % sesame oil (SO1.25); 7.5 % egg yolk and 2.5 % sesame oil (SO2.5); 5 % egg yolk and 5 % sesame oil (SO5); 2.5 % egg yolk and 7.5 % sesame oil (SO7.5); and 10 % sesame oil (SO10). Each group of semen was divided into three groups, incubated at 37 degrees C for 1 h, chilled at 4 degrees C for 4 h, or frozen for 24 h. Five replicates were performed. Sperm quality was evaluated, including motility, viability, and functional membrane integrity. The SO1.25 group achieved the highest sperm quality rate among the treatment groups, and the extender did not have a negative effect compared to the control. However, the total replacement of egg yolk with sesame oil in an extender resulted in the lowest sperm quality. In conclusion, the ratios of egg yolk and sesame oil that were acceptable for goat semen cryopreservation were 8.75 % and 1.25 %, respectively.

AB  - The underlying mechanisms of early onset memory deficit remain poorly understood. We tested the hypothesis that environmental enrichment (EE) can attenuate early-onset cognitive decline in a novel genetic model, the Wistar Kyoto More Immobile (WMI) inbred rat strain, which manifests the risk factors of enhanced stress reactivity and depression-like behavior compared to its nearly isogenic control, the Wistar Kyoto Less Immobile strain (WLI). Middle-aged (12 months) WMI females exhibited dramatically diminished fear and spatial memory in the contextual fear conditioning and Morris Water Maze paradigms, respectively, compared to young females of both strains and to middle-aged WLI females. Middle-aged WMI males showed a lesser, but significant, age-induced deficit. EE from 6 to 12 months of age completely reversed the memory deficits in middle-aged WMI females and reversed age-induced decreases in plasma levels of estradiol. RNA sequencing from female hippocampi revealed significant strain, age, and enrichment-induced differentially expressed genes. Among these, solute carrier family 35, member A4 (Slc35a4) and potassium inwardly rectifying channel, subfamily J, member 2 (Kcnj2) were confirmed to show hippocampal expression changes parallel to that of memory in the WMI. These genes have critical roles in the integrated stress response, cellular metabolism, and the effects of stress on neurovascular coupling, respectively. Pathway analyses revealed the involvement of oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial dysfunction in the hippocampal processes of aging and EE-induced reversal. These findings underscore the critical involvement of molecular stress responses in early-onset memory decline and suggest potential therapeutic targets for age-related cognitive impairment.

AB  - Disrupting the balance of neuronal excitation and inhibition (E/I) is an important pathogenic mechanism of anxiety and depression. Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) plays a key role in the innate immune response, and activation of IRF3 triggers the expression of type I interferons and downstream interferon-stimulated genes, which are associated with anxiety and depression. However, whether IRF3 participates in the pathogenesis of anxiety/depression by regulating E/I balance remains poorly understood. Here, we reported that global knockout (KO) of IRF3 (IRF3-/-) significantly increased anxiety/depression-like behaviors, but did not affect normal spatial learning and memory. Compared with wild type (WT) control mice, the E/I balance was disrupted, as reflected by enhanced glutamatergic transmission and decreased GABAergic transmission in the neurons of hippocampal CA1 and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in IRF3-KO mice. Importantly, genetic rescue of IRF3 expression by adeno-associated virus (AAV) was sufficient to alleviate anxiety/depression-like behaviors and restore the neuronal E/I balance in IRF3-KO mice. Taken together, our results indicate that IRF3 is critical in maintaining neuronal E/I balance, thereby playing an essential role in ensuring emotional stability. & COPY; 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Women are twice as likely as men to develop depression and antidepressant treatment is more frequent in females. Moreover, neuroinflammatory changes related to affective disorders differ in accordance with sex. Despite this evidence, female populations have been largely omitted from preclinical experiments studying antidepressants. The aim of this work is to analyze the potential restorative effect of venlafaxine on an animal model of depression. Female CD1 mice were subjected to chronic social instability (CSI) stress for 7 weeks, and were administered venlafaxine during the last 3 weeks of the stress period. Behavioral and physiological parameters were then analyzed. Stressed mice showed a decreased sucrose preference and increased whisking behavior, and had a lower body weight, higher plasma corticosterone levels and increased hypothalamic GR expression. They also had lower levels of 5-HT, 5-HIAA and NA and a higher KYN/TRYP ratio in the hippocampus. Moreover, CSI increased striatal IL-6 mRNA expression levels. Venlafaxine treatment reduced the striatal IL-6/IL-10 ratio and increased hippocampal GR expression, although it did not reverse stress-induced behavioral changes. In conclusion, seven weeks of exposure to CSI produced depressive-like alterations in female mice. The venlafaxine treatment regimen was found to have a modest anti-inflammatory effect in the striatum and increased hippocampal GR mRNA, although it failed to redress stress-induced behavioral disturbances.

AB  - Reliable protocols for short-term anesthetics are essential to safeguard animal welfare during medical investigations. The aim of the study was to assess the adequacy and reliability of an anesthetic protocol and to evaluate physiological and clinical responses, in relation to the drug plasma concentrations, for pigs undergoing short-term anesthesia. A second aim was to see whether an intravenous dosage could prolong the anesthesia. The anesthesia was induced by an intramuscular injection of dexmedetomidine, tiletamine zolazepam, and butorphanol in 12 pigs. In six of the pigs, a repeated injection intravenously of one-third of the initial dose was given after one hour. The physiological and clinical effects from induction to recovery were examined. Plasma concentrations of the drugs were analyzed and pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated. Each drug's absorption and time to maximal concentration were rapid. All pigs were able to maintain spontaneous respiration. The route of administration did not alter the half-life of the drug. The results suggest that intramuscular administration of the four-drug combination provides up to two hours of anesthesia with stable physiological parameters and an acceptable level of analgesia while maintaining spontaneous respiration. A repeated intravenous injection may be used to extend the time of anesthesia by 30 min.

AB  - Arabidopsis resistance to herbivory can be primed by insect egg deposition during the vegetative stage of the plant, but this primability is lost in flowering plants at no reproductive cost.
   While traits of plant resistance to herbivory often change during ontogeny, it is unknown whether the primability of this resistance depends on the plant's developmental stage. Resistance in non-flowering Arabidopsis thaliana against Pieris brassicae larvae is known to be primable by prior egg deposition on leaves. We investigated whether this priming effect is maintained in plants at the flowering stage. Larval performance assays revealed that flowering plants' resistance to herbivory was not primable by egg deposition. Accordingly, transcriptomes of flowering plants showed almost no response to eggs. In contrast, egg deposition on non-flowering plants enhanced the expression of genes induced by subsequent larval feeding. Strikingly, flowering plants showed constitutively high expression levels of these genes. Larvae performed generally worse on flowering than on non-flowering plants, indicating that flowering plants constitutively resist herbivory. Furthermore, we determined the seed weight in regrown plants that had been exposed to eggs and larvae during the non-flowering or flowering stage. Non-flowering plants benefitted from egg priming with a smaller loss in seed yield. The seed yield of flowering plants was unaffected by the treatments, indicating tolerance towards the larvae. Our results show that the primability of anti-herbivore defences in Arabidopsis depends on the plant's developmental stage.

AB  - A major predicted constraint on the evolution of anti-herbivore defense in plants is the nonindependent expression of traits mediating resistance. Since herbivore attack can be highly variable across plant tissues, we hypothesized that correlations in toxin expression within and between plant tissues may limit population differentiation and, thus, plant adaptation. Using full-sib families from two nearby (<1 km) common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca) populations, we investigated genetic correlations among 28 distinct cardenolide toxins within and between roots, leaves, and seeds and examined signatures of tissue-specific divergent selection between populations by Q(ST)-F-ST comparisons. The prevalence, direction, and strength of genetic correlations among cardenolides were tissue specific, and concentrations of individual cardenolides were moderately correlated between tissues; nonetheless, the direction and strength of correlations were population specific. Population divergence in the cardenolide chemistry was stronger in roots than in leaves and seeds. Divergent selection on individual cardenolides was tissue and toxin specific, except for a single highly toxic cardenolide (labriformin), that showed divergent selection across all plant tissues. Heterogeneous evolution of cardenolides within and between tissues across populations appears possible due to their highly independent expression. This independence may be common in nature, especially in specialized interactions in which distinct herbivores feed on different plant tissues.

AB  - Groundwater, an invaluable resource crucial for irrigation and drinking purposes, significantly impacts human health and societal advancement. This study aims to evaluate the groundwater quality in the Mnasra region of the Gharb Plain, employing a comprehensive analysis of thirty samples collected from various locations, based on thirty-three physicochemical parameters. Utilizing tools like the Pollution Index of Groundwater (PIG), Nitrate Pollution Index (NPI), Water Quality Index (WQI), Irrigation Water Quality Index (IWQI), as well as Multivariate Statistical Approaches (MSA), and the Geographic Information System (GIS), this research identifies the sources of groundwater pollution. The results revealed Ca2+ dominance among cations and Cl- as the primary anion. The Piper and Gibbs diagrams illustrated the prevalent Ca2+-Cl- water type and the significance of water-rock interactions, respectively. The PIG values indicated that 86.66% of samples exhibited "Insignificant pollution". NPI showed notable nitrate pollution (1.48 to 7.06), with 83.33% of samples rated "Good" for drinking based on the WQI. The IWQI revealed that 80% of samples were classified as "Excellent" and 16.66% as "Good". Spatial analysis identified the eastern and southern sections as highly contaminated due to agricultural activities. These findings provide valuable insights for decision-makers to manage groundwater resources and promote sustainable water management in the Gharb region.

AB  - Nobiletin (NOB) is a bioflavonoid compound isolated from citrus fruit peels. The present study aimed to elucidate whether NOB facilitates the porcine sperm cryosurvival and embryo development after in vitro fertilization (IVF). To this end, spermatozoa were diluted and cryopreserved in a freezing extender supplemented with 0 (control), 50, 100, 150, and 200 mu M Nobiletin. The kinematic patterns of frozen-thawed (FT) sperm were assessed after 30 and 90 min incubation using a Sperm Class Analyzer (SCA). Viability, acrosome integrity, and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were measured by fluorescence microscopy 30 min after thawing using SYBR-14/PI, PSA/FITC, and R123/PI, respectively. Lipid peroxidation was determined using MDA assay after incubation for 90 min. The addition of 100 mu M and 150 mu M NOB to the extender significantly improved sperm progressive motility, and acrosome integrity compared to the control group (P < 0.05). The proportion of viable spermatozoa was significantly higher in the 150 mu M NOB group. MDA levels were less in 50 mu M and 150 mu M NOB treated groups compared to the control. In addition, IVF with FT sperm was used to assess the embryo developmental competence. Treatment with 150 mu M NOB before cryopreservation increased the cleavage and blastocyst formation rates compared to the control group. Furthermore, the relative expression of POU5F1 and AMPK, genes related to pluripotency and cell differentiation were significantly upregulated in embryos resulting from NOB-treated sperm compared to the control group. These results suggest that Nobiletin is a functionally novel phytochemical to mitigate oxidative stress during the freezing-thawing of porcine spermatozoa as reflected by improved FT sperm quality and IVF outcome.

AB  - Sows in an extensive setting maintain small, stable matrilineal social groups comprised of familiar, and often genetically related, conspecifics. Providing conditions in an intensive farm setting which allow similar social groups could reduce aggression by allowing familiar sows to benefit from an established dominance order. Given that aggression levels among breeding sows peak immediately following introduction to a group pen, this study used a 2 x 2 factorial design to evaluate whether the level of familiarity among a small cohort, or method of introduction into a larger dynamic pen influenced the occurrence of aggressive behavior involving newly introduced sows. Treatments included combinations of sows either premixed for seven days prior to pen intro-duction (PMIX) or having no contact prior to pen introduction (UMIX) and entering the pen alone (IND) or entering the pen as a batch (BAT). Sows were monitored by focal video for one hour after entering the pen. Analysis of aggressive events yielded a significant interaction between level of familiarity and method of introduction. Familiarity had no effect when sows entered the pen as individuals whereas UMIX BAT sows participated in the most aggressive events (46.7 +/- 9.1) and PMIX BAT sows the fewest (10.5 +/- 2.1; P < 0.001). Overall, IND sows performed more retreats (3.6 +/- 0.3) than BAT sows (2.8 +/- 0.3; P < 0.01). PMIX sows spent more time lying with other sows (8.3 +/- 1.7 min) compared to UMIX sows (1.9 +/- 0.8 min; P < 0.05). PMIX BAT sows exhibited more nosing of other sows (47.9 +/- 3.0) than their PMIX IND counterparts (37.6 +/- 2.4; P < 0.001). These findings suggest that if small groups of sows are allowed to freely interact with each other prior to mixing into a larger dynamic group, even for as little as seven days, they can transition into the new social group with reduced rates of harmful aggressive behaviors and increased rates of affiliative behaviors. Future work should investigate whether premixed breeding groups maintain social affiliation throughout gestation, and thus, establish long-term subgroups within the larger pen.

   Fasciolosis is a parasitic disease of livestock causing important economic losses worldwide and it is also a zoonosis. Current therapy relies on the use of anthelmintic drugs, which is no longer sustainable due to the increase of anthelmintic resistance and the risk of drug residues in food. A deep understanding of the host-parasite interaction is required to develop protective vaccines for the control of fasciolosis. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the hepatic lesions in sheep vaccinated with a partly protective vaccine for F. hepatica, a non-protective vaccine and an infected control group. The protective vaccine showed less severe hepatic lesions than the infected control group. In addition, in the protective vaccine group dead flukes surrounded by a severe granulomatous inflammation were observed, which taken together with the lower fluke burden, suggests that the host response induced by the partially protective vaccine may have been involved in the death of adult flukes of F. hepatica. This is the first study reporting the presence of degenerated flukes associated to a severe granulomatous inflammation in bile ducts in a vaccine trial, a finding that would be useful for improving vaccine efficacy in future trials.</p>
   Fasciolosis is an important economic disease of livestock. There is a global interest in the development of protective vaccines since current anthelmintic therapy is no longer sustainable. A better knowledge of the host-parasite interaction is needed for the design of effective vaccines. The present study evaluates the microscopical hepatic lesions in sheep immunized with a partially protective vaccine (VAC1), a non-protective vaccine (VAC2), and an infected control group (IC). The nature of granulomatous inflammation associated with degeneration of adult flukes found in the VAC1 group was characterized by immunohistochemistry. Hepatic lesions (fibrous perihepatitis, chronic tracts, bile duct hyperplasia, infiltration of eosinophils and lymphocytes and plasma cells) were significantly less severe in the VAC1 group than in the IC group. Dead adult flukes within bile ducts were observed only in the VAC1 group and were surrounded by a severe granulomatous inflammation composed by macrophages and multinucleate giant cells with a high expression of lysozyme, CD163 and S100 markers, and a low expression of CD68. Numerous CD3+ T lymphocytes and scarce infiltrate of FoxP3+ Treg and CD208+ dendritic cells were present. This is the first report describing degenerated flukes associated to a severe granulomatous inflammation in bile ducts in a F. hepatica vaccine trial.</p>

AB  - Effective monitoring and management of drinking water in swine buildings is a crucial aspect for promoting pigs' health and productivity. Therefore, this study aimed to quantify and model drinking water intake (DWI) in growing-finishing pigs by providing them with three concentrated diets in experimental pig barns. Two inde-pendent experiments were conducted in three experimental barns between 2021 and 2022. One statistical (multiple linear regression) and four machine learning algorithms (elastic net, random forest regression, support vector regression, and multilayer perceptron) were employed, with feed intake (FI), mass of pigs (MP), pigs' body temperature (PBT), room temperature (RT), CO2 concentration (RCO2), and temperature-humidity index (RTHI) as input parameters. The results revealed that pigs with a body mass of 30 to 60 kg consumed approximately 3.58 L of drinking water and 2.10 kg of concentrated diet per day. Additionally, strong positive correlations were observed between MP, FI, and DWI (correlation coefficient (r) > 90) during both experimental periods. The findings indicated that the random forest regression algorithm performed the best, explaining over 90% and 80% of the observed and predicted data during the training and testing phases, respectively. However, during the testing phase, the multiple linear regression methods performed the worst (R2 < 0.79 and RMSE > 0.89 L pig-1 day-1) when compared to the other models. Sensitivity analysis indicated that among all the variables, MP had the greatest impact on predicting DWI, followed by FI, RCO2, RTHI, and RT. The study concluded that random forest regression could predict DWI precisely, which can assist pig farmers in enhancing their water monitoring capabilities and promptly assessing the availability of drinking water.

AB  - Tea, one of the most widely consumed beverages globally, exhibits remarkable genomic diversity in its underlying flavour and health-related compounds. In this study, we present the construction and analysis of a tea pangenome comprising a total of 11 genomes, with a focus on three newly sequenced genomes comprising the purple-leaved assamica cultivar "Zijuan", the temperature-sensitive sinensis cultivar "Anjibaicha" and the wild accession "L618" whose assemblies exhibited excellent quality scores as they profited from latest sequencing technologies. Our analysis incorporates a detailed investigation of transposon complement across the tea pangenome, revealing shared patterns of transposon distribution among the studied genomes and improved transposon resolution with long read technologies, as shown by long terminal repeat (LTR) Assembly Index analysis. Furthermore, our study encompasses a gene-centric exploration of the pangenome, exploring the genomic landscape of the catechin pathway with our study, providing insights on copy number alterations and gene-centric variants, especially for Anthocyanidin synthases. We constructed a gene-centric pangenome by structurally and functionally annotating all available genomes using an identical pipeline, which both increased gene completeness and allowed for a high functional annotation rate. This improved and consistently annotated gene set will allow for a better comparison between tea genomes. We used this improved pangenome to capture the core and dispensable gene repertoire, elucidating the functional diversity present within the tea species. This pangenome resource might serve as a valuable resource for understanding the fundamental genetic basis of traits such as flavour, stress tolerance, and disease resistance, with implications for tea breeding programmes.

AB  - Although long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are reported to regulate follicular development and reproductive disease pathogenesis, the underlying mechanisms have not been elucidated. In this study, lncRNA expression profiling of different-sized healthy follicles from Hu sheep with different prolificacy revealed 50 613 lncRNAs. Numerous lncRNAs were differentially expressed among different comparison groups. This study characterized one novel transcript, lncRNA-412.25 (from healthy follicles with a diameter of >5 mm), which was predominantly expressed in the high prolificacy group and localized to the cytoplasm of granulosa cells (GCs). LncRNA-412.25 knockdown promoted and inhibited Hu sheep GC apoptosis and proliferation, respectively. Interestingly, lncRNA-412.25 could directly bind to miR-346, which can target the gene of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Knockdown of lncRNA-412.25 promoted GC apoptosis by downregulating LIF expression, where this effect was attenuated by miR-346. Moreover, the miR-346 inhibitor mitigated the lncRNA-412.25 knockdown-induced downregulation of phosphorylated protein of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), which was validated using immunofluorescence analysis. Our results demonstrated that lncRNA-412.25 regulates GC proliferation and apoptosis in Hu sheep by binding to miR-346 and then activating the LIF/STAT3 pathway. These findings provide novel insights into the mechanisms underlying prolificacy in sheep.

AB  - This study aimed to produce a construction composite material that is environmentally friendly, easily accessible, inexpensive and renewable and provides thermal and water insulation. Waste papers, hazelnut shells, pinecones and sheep wool were used at the production stage. The filling rates of the materials were optimized using the RSM. A hydrophobic surface-active substance was used to reduce water absorbability, microbial activity and mold formation. It was observed that these specimens' contact angles were 84 degrees to 146 degrees, thermal conductivity were 0.0511 to 0.0861 W/mK and densities were 0.678 to 0.99 g/cm3. As a result of the compressive and flexural strength tests, it was found that the compressive strength of the specimens was very high, the highest compressive strength was found as 32.8093 N/mm2 in the specimen N25, and the highest flexure strength was found as 6.352 N/mm2 in the specimen N20. A completely environment-friendly, biodegradable and low-cost material was produced out of biomass wastes.

AB  - This study aimed to determine the impact of land use and illegal activities on elephant distributions in 2003, 2015, and 2021. Geospatial data inclusion satellite images of different characteristics were used as well as aerial count of animals along linear transects of varying widths. Using ArcMap 10.8, we laid grilles of 100 km(2) covering the entire study area. We performed clipping to display and estimate the area of elephant's occupancy in each grid. As such, we were able to determine the number of elephants and the number of illegal activities in each grid. Correlation analysis were performed to understand relationships between elephants' number and land-use units as well as the illegal activities. The identified different land use units were: rainfed crop, gallery forest, Wooded savanna, shrubby savanna, grass savanna, and water surface. Of the variables studied, only annual crop, gallery forest, shrubby savanna and illegal activities were significantly correlated with elephant numbers. Annual crop and illegal activities were negatively correlated with elephant numbers, while gallery forest and shrubby savanna were positively correlated with elephant abundance. These results confirmed that water, forage and serenity are the main factors that explain the distribution of elephant in protected areas.

AB  - Convivial conservation requires a deep structural shift in research methods and methodology. Although convivial conservation calls for moving beyond the dichotomy of the human and the non-human, this dichotomy is often reproduced in the research methods and methodologies that are used. Most (conservation) researchers have been trained to investigate what non-humans might 'mean' to humans, thereby inevitably silencing the voices of non-humans. This research article identifies a number of threshold concepts and methodologies by turning to multi-species work in nature conservation and challenges the historical anthropocentric framings in this field. It critically challenges the convivial conservation concept by questioning who or what is counted as a research participant from this perspective. Additionally, the article outlines different multi-species research methods and methodology and puts forward the need for threshold and promiscuous methods developed with collaboration between social and natural scientists and non-humans to bring about transformative change in conservation as envisaged by the proponents of convivial conservation. It concludes by offering ways to promote greater conviviality in nature conservation research through a more expansive sense of research participants, recognition of their inter-subjectivities, and multi-sensory communication of their situated knowledges.

AB  - Behavioral and electrophysiological studies on aphid responses to host plant odors, although important, are still not exhaustive for some species. Moreover, most studies have not focused on whether these responses are mediated by odors from plants infested by conspecific and heterospecific individuals. Here, our goal was to identify the chemical cues involved in the attraction of the cabbage aphid (Brevicoryne brassicae L.) to cabbage plants. To achieve this, we collected volatiles emitted from uninfested cabbage plants, cabbage plants infested by either B. brassicae (conspecifics) or by diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella) larvae (heterospecifics), and from aphids alone. Choice tests revealed that B. brassicae were mostly attracted to odors from conspecific-infested cabbage plants; however, they also showed attraction to odors from uninfested plants and plants infested by P. xylostella larvae and were least attracted to odors from aphids alone. Using coupled Gas chromatography-Electroantennographic detection studies (GC-EAD) and Gas chromatography-Mass spectrometry (GC-MS), we revealed some chemically active compounds that elicited B. brassicae olfactory response, with more of these compounds in the cabbage plant infested by conspecific than in the rest of the treatments. It is possible that the knowledge gained from this work could pave the way for synthetic lures as an integrated pest management approach for B. brassicae. Therefore, more studies would need to be conducted to validate and isolate those exact compounds that positively excited the cabbage aphids' olfactory response.

AB  - Actuarial senescence, the increase in adult mortality risk with increasing age, is a widespread phenomenon across the animal kingdom. Although between-species variation in the rate of increase in mortality as organisms age (i.e. ageing rate) is now well documented, the occurrence of variation in ageing rate within a given species remains much more debatable. We evaluated the level of within-species variation in ageing rate in four populations of the southern Darwin's frog (Rhinoderma darwinii) from Chile. Our results revealed strong among-population variation in ageing rates, and these were correlated with the population-specific generation time. A higher ageing rate occurred in populations where individuals exhibited a faster pace of life. Our results, along with recent studies in evolutionarily distant amphibian species, indicate that there can be substantial within-species variation in the rate of ageing, highlighting amphibians as emerging models to study the patterns and mechanisms of intraspecific variation in ageing rate.

AB  - Anti-NMDA receptor autoantibodies (NMDAR-Abs) in patients with NMDAR encephalitis cause severe dis-ease symptoms resembling psychosis and cause cognitive dysfunction. After passive transfer of patients' cerebrospinal fluid or human monoclonal anti-GluN1-autoantibodies in mice, we find a disrupted excit-atory-inhibitory balance resulting from CA1 neuronal hypoexcitability, reduced AMPA receptor (AMPAR) signaling, and faster synaptic inhibition in acute hippocampal slices. Functional alterations are also reflected in widespread remodeling of the hippocampal proteome, including changes in glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission. NMDAR-Abs amplify network g oscillations and disrupt q -g coupling. A data-informed network model reveals that lower AMPAR strength and faster GABAA receptor current kinetics chiefly ac-count for these abnormal oscillations. As predicted in silico and evidenced ex vivo, positive allosteric mod-ulation of AMPARs alleviates aberrant g activity, reinforcing the causative effects of the excitatory-inhibitory imbalance. Collectively, NMDAR-Ab-induced aberrant synaptic, cellular, and network dynamics provide con-ceptual insights into NMDAR-Ab-mediated pathomechanisms and reveal promising therapeutic targets that merit future in vivo validation.

AB  - Helopeltis theivora or the tea mosquito bug (TMB) is reportedly one of the most devastating pests of tea plant (Camellia sinensis) causing threat to the beverage crop. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) constitute a group of endogenous RNAs that play gene regulatory roles in eukaryotes. In the present study, 9502 lncRNAs were identified from healthy and TMB-infested C. sinensis tissues using high-throughput strand-specific RNA sequencing, out of which 80 lncRNAs got differentially expressed in response to TMB infestation. Determination of genes that could act as potential targets of lncRNAs revealed that the identified lncRNAs could possibly target as many as 5804 genes. Differential gene expression (DGE) analysis led to the identification of 3665 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), of which, the expression of 1767 genes got upregulated and 1898 genes got downregulated during tea plant's response to TMB. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis of DEGs and lncRNA-target genes have shown that TMB infestation might have triggered transcriptomic reprogramming leading to altered primary and secondary metabolism in C. sinensis. LncRNAs can act as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) to bind with common microRNA (miRNA) response elements (MREs) involving a competition between mRNAs and lncRNAs. We report 11 lncRNAs competing with 14 mRNAs to bind with 28 miRNAs forming the ceRNA network. The expression of 6 DEGs and 5 differentially expressed lncRNAs (DELs) has been validated by qRT-PCR.

AB  - Direct measurements of greenhouse gas emissions from the increasingly intensified African livestock production are important to assess locally available mitigation strategies. As such, measurements were conducted from March to June using static flux chambers to quantify the emission rates of CH4, N2O, and CO2 from manure in poultry and pig production systems in Cameroon. Emissions were measured from two layer barns, two pig facilities, six broiler farms, and one farm with Brahman birds. Mean emission factors inside two layer barns were 0.06-0.21 and 602-958 mg animal-1 h-1 for CH4 and CO2, respectively, and 21-112 mu g animal-1 h-1 for N2O. Mean emission factors inside four broiler barns with wood shavings as bedding material were 0.31-1.22 and 355-1884 mg animal-1 h-1 for CH4 and CO2, respectively, and 2.33-1052 mu g animal-1 h-1 for N2O. Broiler N2O emissions were 971.38 +/- 250.23 and 26.14 +/- 30.27 mu g animal-1 h-1 from manure underneath a meshed floor barn and a shelter with bare soil, respectively. Emissions from a storage tank with wastewater from a piggery were 8.30 +/- 7.36 and 40.41 +/- 5.54 mg m-2 min-1 for CH4 and CO2, respectively, and 2.80 +/- 1.67 mu g m-2 min-1 for N2O. Mean emissions from two outdoor storages of a mixture of poultry and pig manure were 0.76-0.9 and 69-136 mg m-2 min-1 for CH4 and CO2, respectively, and 10-15 mu g m-2 min-1 for N2O. Emissions depended highly on manure production and management systems. CH4 emissions were lower from poultry compared to pig manure. Younger layers emitted higher CH4 compared to older layer hens. CH4 emissions were higher from slurry compared to solid manure, whereas N2O emissions were higher from solid compared to slurry manure storages. These findings indicate that mitigation strategies for greenhouse gas emissions should depend not only on the type of gases and manure management systems but also on the animal types and their ages.

AB  - 1. Most organisms must regulate their nutritional intake in an environment full of complex food choices. While this process is well-understood for self-sufficient organisms, dependent offspring, such as bee larvae, in practice have limited food choices because food is provided by parents. Nutrient balancing may therefore be achieved by offspring, by parents on offspring's behalf, or by both, whether cooperatively or in conflict.
   2. We used the Geometric Framework to investigate the capacity of dependent larval mason bees Osmia bicornis to regulate their intake of protein and carbohydrate, as well as these nutrients' effects upon growth and survival. Female Osmia seal eggs individually inside cells they have provisioned with pollen, and have no contact with developing offspring, allowing offspring choices to be studied in isolation. Herbivorous insect larvae are typically expected to balance protein and carbohydrate to maximize growth and reproduction.
   3. Contrary to prediction, carbohydrate and not protein mediated both growth and survival to pupation. Accordingly, larvae prioritized maintaining a constant intake of carbohydrate and self-selected a relatively carbohydrate-biased diet compared to other hymenopterans, while tolerating wide excesses and deficiencies of protein, rendering them potentially vulnerable to dietary change or manipulation. Reasons for prioritizing carbohydrate may include (a) the relative abundance of protein in their normal pollen diet, (b) the relative paucity of nectar in parental provisions making carbohydrate a scarce resource or (c) the requirement for diapause for all O. bicornis larvae. Larvae were intolerant of moderate dietary dilution, likely reflecting an evolutionary history of nutrient-dense food.
   4. Our results demonstrate that dependent offspring can remain active participants in balancing their own nutrients even when sedentary, and, moreover, even in mass provisioning systems where parents and offspring have no physical contact. Research should now focus on whether and how evolutionary interests of parent and dependent offspring coincide or conflict with respect to food composition, and the implications for species' resilience to changing environments.

AB  - In order to estimate the effect of lamb's wool shearing in the end of spring and in beginning of summer seasons on the productive and carcass traits of fattening lambs. The study was conducted on 24 Awassi lambs with an average weight of 32.34 +/- 0.05 Kg and aged 6-8 months. Lambs were randomly divided into 3 groups (8 lambs/group). The 1(st) group lambs were not sheared (control), the 2(nd) group lambs were sheared at the end of spring (15/6/2022), the 3(rd) group lambs were sheared at the beginning of summer (15/10/2022), and the study lasted four months. Lambs were reared on a ration consisting of barley, wheat bran, wheat straw, and soybean meal at a rate of 1 kg / lamb / day. Statistical analysis of the data revealed a significant superiority in body weight in 3rd group lambs in all study months, total weight gain, and relative growth mean in the 1st, 2nd, and 3(rd) study months of the study as compared with other treatments at P <= 0.05. Also, results of the third group showed a significant increase in carcass weight, empty dressing percentage, full dressing percentage, wide tail weight. The results related to the physical dissection of three ribs revealed a significant increase in the weight of the three ribs, lean weight, and rib eye area as compared with other treatments. On the other hand, 3(rd) group results revealed a significant decrease in fat thickness and empty digestive cannel weight. In conclusion, shearing lambs may reduce heat stress, which was reflected in improved productive performance and carcass characteristics of Awassi lambs.

AB  - Herbivorous insects and pathogens cause severe damage to rice tissues, affecting yield and grain quality. Damaged cells trigger downstream defense responses through various signals. Extracellular ATP (eATP), a signaling molecule released during mechanical cell damage, is considered a constitutive damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP), which is crucial for initiating plant defense responses. Thus, understanding how rice plants cope with DAMPs such as eATP is essential. Here, we found that exogenous ATP affected rice growth and development, cell wall composition, chloroplast development, and cell death. Subsequent global transcriptome analysis revealed that several pathways were involved in the eATP response, including genes related to cell surface receptors, cell wall organization, chlorophyll biosynthesis, heat and temperature stimulation, epigenetic regulation, and reactive oxygen species metabolism. Cell surface receptors, including members of the lectin receptor-like kinases (LecRKs), were found to participate in the eATP response. We further investigated ATP-induced genes in T-DNA activation mutants of OsLecRKs, demonstrating their involvement in eATP signaling in rice. This study confirms a DAMP-mediated transcriptional response in plants and provides novel candidates for advancing resistant rice breeding against insect herbivores and pathogens.

AB  - The problem of tuberculosis has been relevant for many years due to active spread of the infection pathogen around the globe, in particular in Ukraine. In this article, we determined the epizootic role of the rice weevil (Sitophilus oryzae (Linnaeus, 1763); Coleoptera, Curculionidae) in the spread of Mycobacterium bovis. We identified the effect of the beetle on properties of the pathogen, particularly the changes in morphology, cultural, biochemical, and biological properties after the bacteria had travelled through the body of the rice weevil. To achieve our objectives, we used the museum 100th passage of the virulent strain ofM. bovis. We employed microscopic, cultural, biochemical, biological (infecting the biological model), pathoanatomic, histological methods, and PCR studies. The rice weevil is able to retain mycobacteria and release them into their environment for 30 days after becoming infected, with gradual decrease in the number of microbial cells. According to morphology and cultural properties, the pathogen we isolated in the experiment was identical to the initial culture. Enzymatic activity of the bacteria varied. The bacteria that had passed through the intestines ofM. bovis were observed to have changes in the biochemical parameters which helped them to adapt to the new environment. We measured the effect of the rice weevil on pathogenicity of M. bovis, isolated directly from the beetle and from grain contaminated with the insects during the experiment. The practical importance of the study consists in expansion of our understanding of the ways M. bovis spreads, identification of effect the rice weevil has on mycobacteria. It also might help in the search for ways to interrupt the chain of tuberculosis transmission - prevention of spread of the disease to favourable areas.

AB  - Treatment of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is complicated by the presence of drug use disorder comorbidity. Here, we examine whether conditioned fear (PTSD model) modifies the rewarding effect of mephedrone and if repeated mephedrone injections have impact on trauma-related behaviors (fear sensitization, extinction, and recall of the fear reaction). We also analyzed whether these trauma-induced changes were associated with exacerbation in metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and the GluN2A and GluN2B subunits of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor expression in such brain structures as the hippocampus and basolateral amygdala. Male adolescent rats underwent trauma exposure (1.5 mA footshock), followed 7 days later by a conditioned place preference training with mephedrone. Next, the post-conditioning test was performed. Fear sensitization, conditioned fear, anxiety-like behavior, extinction acquisition and relapse were then assessed to evaluate behavioral changes. MMP-9, GluN2A and GluN2B were subsequently measured. Trauma-exposed rats subjected to mephedrone treatment acquired a strong place preference and exhibited impairment in fear extinction and reinstatement. Mephedrone had no effect on trauma-induced MMP-9 level in the basolateral amygdala, but decreased it in the hippocampus. GluN2B expression was decreased in the hippocampus, but increased in the basolateral amygdala of mephedrone-treated stressed rats. These data suggest that the modification of the hippocampus and basolateral amygdala due to mephedrone use can induce fear memory impairment and drug seeking behavior in adolescent male rats.

AB  - BackgroundPubertal timing is a key life history trait, shaped by ecological pressures to balance reproductive success and survival. Emerging evidence suggests a link between adiposity and early maturation, potentially through hormonal signaling pathways governing puberty timing. The timing of sexual maturation in Atlantic salmon has a strong genetic basis in addition to being linked with environmental shifts and lipid reserves. A gene encoding a co-factor of the Hippo pathway, vgll3, is a major determinant of maturation timing in salmon. The Hippo pathway is known for its evolutionary conserved molecular signal role in both sexual maturation and adipogenesis.ResultsIn this study, we tested the expression of Hippo pathway genes in the brain of immature and mature male Atlantic salmon carrying either the early or the late maturation genotype of vgll3. We found increased brain expression of a major Hippo pathway kinase (lats1b) in individuals with early maturation genotypes of vgll3 before maturation development of testes was evident. Moreover, we found components and regulating partners of the Hippo pathway showing differential expression in brain of individuals with early and late vgll3 genotypes prior to maturation. This may suggest a role for the Hippo pathway in central nervous system processes that regulate the preparation for maturation.ConclusionsThis study characterizes transcriptional changes in components of the Hippo pathway in the brain in relation to vgll3-mediated early maturation in Atlantic salmon, highlighting the potential involvement of this pathway in the central regulation of maturation prior to gonadal development.

AB  - We studied changes in plant growth, nutrient absorption, quality of fresh leaves, and the antioxidant enzyme systems of leaves treated with AMF (Glomus etunicatunt) in tea (tea cultivar "Xinyang 10") seedlings exposed to 0 and 100 mmol/L sodium chloride (NaCl). The AMF colonization in the tea roots decreased observably by 50.1% after a 5-week soil NaCl (100 mmol/L) treatment. The growth, leaf nutrient levels, and leaf quality parameter contents significantly declined by 18-39% in the 100 mmol/L NaCl treatments. In contrast, these variables exhibited observably higher responses in the mycorrhizal seedlings than in the nonmycorrhizal seedlings. Furthermore, AMF improved the leaves' total amino acid concentrations dramatically, accompanied by the upregulation of the genes of the amino acid synthetic enzymes, such as glutamate dehydrogenase (CsGDH), glutamate synthase (CsGOGAT), and glutamine synthetase (CsGS), while 100 mmol/L NaCl seedlings represented a negative performance. In addition, the 100 mmol/L NaCl treatments dramatically downregulated the expression level of the tea caffeine synthase 1 gene (CsTCS1), the ascorbate peroxidase gene (CsAPX), and the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme gene (CsHMGR) in the leaves, while the AMF seedlings represented positive performances. These results suggest that AMF may play an active role in fresh leaf quality via the partial upregulation of the relevant genes' expression. In contrast, salt stress represented the opposite result in tea. The seedlings inoculated with AMF showed significantly increased antioxidant enzyme activities, by 13.3-19.6%, including peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD), over the non-AMF inoculated tea seedlings. Still, they did not affect glutathione reductase (GR), irrespective of the NaCl condition. Further studies indicated that AMF observably upregulated the genes' expressions (i.e., CsCAT and CsSOD) in both the 0 and 100 mmol/L NaCl seedlings. Meanwhile, the 100 mmol/L NaCl seedlings represented markedly lower antioxidant enzyme activities (i.e., SOD, CAT, and POD) and gene expressions (i.e., CsSOD and CsCAT) than the non-NaCl seedlings, irrespective of AMF inoculation. These results imply that AMF has a positive role in strengthening salt tolerance and on the quality of fresh tea leaves.

AB  - Livestock and poultry industries are developing rapidly worldwide, responsible for releasing large volumes of manure and liquid waste. The produced manure containing nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) nutrients which are causing eutrophication and algal blooms if released into water bodies without prior treatment. Utilization of biowaste materials for the production of biogas is one of the most useful technologies providing a pollution free environment and a renewable "green" energy. Physical and chemical methods for removal of N and P from animal waste include the application of biochar with different chemical and physical modifications (adsorption), air-cathode single chamber microbial fuel cells (MFCs), an aerobic digested (AD) technique, using ultrasound/ H2O2 digestion joined with HFO/biochar adsorption technique, wet scrubber and stripping process, and gaspermeable membrane technology, critically discussed in the manuscript. Future research requirements include integrated approaches and directions regarding the recovery of N and P utilizing organic amendments (like biochar) are discussed.

AB  - Simple Summary Fatness-related traits are economically very important in sheep production and are associated with serious diseases in humans. Using a denser set of SNP markers and a variety of statistical approaches, our results were able to refine the regions associated with fat deposition and to suggest new insights into molecular aspects of fat tail selection. These results may provide a strong foundation for studying the regulation of fat deposition in sheep and do offer hope that the causal mutations and the mode of inheritance of this trait will soon be discovered by further investigation. The fat tail is a phenotype that divides indigenous Iranian sheep genetic resources into two major groups. The objective of the present study is to refine the map location of candidate regions associated with fat deposition, obtained via two separate whole genome scans contrasting thin and fat tail breeds, and to determine the nature of the selection occurring in these regions using a hitchhiking approach. Zel (thin tail) and Lori-Bakhtiari (fat tail) breed samples that had previously been run on the Illumina Ovine 50 k BeadChip, were genotyped with a denser set of SNPs in the three candidate regions using a Sequenom Mass ARRAY platform. Statistical tests were then performed using different and complementary methods based on either site frequency (F-ST and Median homozygosity) or haplotype (iHS and XP-EHH). The results from candidate regions on chromosome 5 and X revealed clear evidence of selection with the derived haplotypes that was consistent with selection to near fixation for the haplotypes affecting fat tail size in the fat tail breed. An analysis of the candidate region on chromosome 7 indicated that selection differentiated the beneficial alleles between breeds and homozygosity has increased in the thin tail breed which also had the ancestral haplotype. These results enabled us to confirm the signature of selection in these regions and refine the critical intervals from 113 kb, 201 kb, and 2831 kb to 28 kb, 142 kb, and 1006 kb on chromosome 5, 7, and X respectively. These regions contain several genes associated with fat metabolism or developmental processes consisting of TCF7 and PPP2CA (OAR5), PTGDR and NID2 (OAR7), AR, EBP, CACNA1F, HSD17B10, SLC35A2, BMP15, WDR13, and RBM3 (OAR X), and each of which could potentially be the actual target of selection. The study of core haplotypes alleles in our regions of interest also supported the hypothesis that the first domesticated sheep were thin tailed, and that fat tail animals were developed later. Overall, our results provide a comprehensive assessment of how and where selection has affected the patterns of variation in candidate regions associated with fat deposition in thin and fat tail sheep breeds.

AB  - Increasing the efficiency of phosphorus (P) use through nutrient circularity is essential for securing P sufficiency and reducing pollution. The release of P in recycled materials can be enhanced with organic acids produced from cellulose. In this study, fertilisers based on sewage sludge (SS) and poultry manure (BR) were treated with increasing levels (0 %, 8 %, and 20 %) of hydroxy carboxylic and carboxylic acid mixture to determine the effect of acidification on the availability of P and other selected elements. According to sequential extractions, acidification increased the share of labile P in both products. In SS, which was dominated by refractory metal phosphates, a higher acid dose was required for the effect, and a smaller share of total P was transformed than in the BR, which was already rich in easily accessible P. Besides P, acidification increased the mobility of several elements but induced no harmful element accumulation in ryegrass leaves. The increased P lability recorded by fractionation in SS was reflected in ryegrass P uptake, cumulative yield, apparent P recovery, and mineral-P equivalence. In BR exhibiting superiority to mineral P, the effect of acidification on plant growth and P uptake was negative. Acidification treatment offers an option to enhance the plant availability of circular P, but the treatment needs to be tailored according to product characteristics. Optimising the application rate and acid composition might allow increasing effectiveness while avoiding negative growth effects.

AB  - Humans are exposed to complex per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) mixtures, yet their neurotoxicity and mechanisms remains unclear. This study exposed male mice to 17 PFAS mixtures at low levels (0.2-20 mu g/L) for 49 days via drinking water. Perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA), perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA), 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonic acid (6:2 FTS), and perfluorooctane Sulfonate (PFOS) accumulated in brain tissues, with brain/plasma ratios of 2.03-5.87, 2.94-12.88, 1.90-3.19, and 0.62-0.93, respectively. Electroencephalogram (EEG) results showed significant alterations, including a reduction in beta spectral edge (21.47-13.85 Hz) and an increase in gamma spectral edge (57.64-79.07 Hz). Histopathological analysis revealed necrosis in the hippo- campus, contributing to the observed anxiety-like behaviors and memory impairments in exposed mice. Plasma metabolomics highlighted disrupted osmoprotectants, impaired glutamatergic synapse function, and tryptophan metabolism. Brain metabolomics demonstrated suppression of purine metabolism and activation of arachidonic acid metabolism, suggesting involvement in neurotoxic effects. Transcriptomic profiling further identified dysregulation in neuroactive ligand-receptor interactions, cholinergic and GABAergic synapses, and calcium signaling pathways, with oxytocin signaling highlighted as a critical mechanism. This study, for the first time, links PFAS mixture to neurotoxicity via neurotransmitter-related pathways, underscoring the need for public health policies and preventive strategies to mitigate PFAS exposure risks.

AB  - The production of biogas through anaerobic digestion implies the generation of 90-95% of digested raw material, namely digestate. A nutrient-rich stream is generally applied to cropland to enhance yields, due to its high abundance of nutrients. Nevertheless, the intensive digestate farming brings about nutrient saturation and groundwater contamination. The application of downstream emerging technologies that focus on the recovery of nutrients from digestate have been studied, yet freeze concentration technology (FC) has never been considered for this purpose. This study evaluates the performance of FC technology applied to concentrate nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) from an effluent of a reverse osmosis unit that is treating the digestate of agro-industrial waste effluents. For this aim, two lab-scale methodological approaches were investigated, namely, progressive FC (PFC) and suspension FC (SFC), set through the utilization of different FC configurations. The concentrates obtained in both FC methods agreed with the regulations for fertilizers in terms of nutrients and metals content; meanwhile, the diluted fraction can be delivered as water for irrigation in high-density livestock areas. The application of FC solves the transportation cost side effect of livestock waste on the one hand, and soil contamination with nutrient on the other hand.

AB  - Cultivation of Miscanthus x giganteus L. (Mis) with annual harvest of biomass could provide an additional C source for farmers. To test the potential of Mis-C for immobilizing inorganic N from slurry or manure and as a C source for soil organic matter build-up in comparison to wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) straw (WS), a greenhouse experiment was performed. Pot experiments with ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) were set up to investigate the N dynamics of two organic fertilisers based on Mis at Campus Klein-Altendorf, Germany. The two fertilisers, a mixture of cattle slurry and Mis as well as cattle manure from Mis-bedding material resulted in a slightly higher N immobilisation. Especially at the 1st and 2nd harvest, they were partly significantly different compared with the WS treatments. The fertilisers based on Mis resulted in a slightly higher microbial biomass C and microbial biomass N and thus can be identified as an additional C source to prevent nitrogen losses and for the build-up of soil organic matter (SOM) in the long-term.

AB  - Tetranychus urticae, commonly known as the two-spotted spider mite, is a highly adaptable and polyphagous arthropod in the family Tetranychidae, capable of feeding on over 1200 plant species, including strawberries (Fragaria x ananassa Duch.). The fitness and microbiota of herbivorous arthropods can vary significantly across different plant species and cultivars. In this study, we investigated the fecundity, longevity, growth rate, and microbiota composition of T. urticae reared on seven Chinese strawberry cultivars: Hongyan (HY), Yuexiu (YX), Tianshi (TS), Ningyu (NY), Xuetu (XT), Zhangjj (ZJ), and Xuelixiang (XLX). Our findings revealed significant differences among cultivars: mites reared on the XT cultivar exhibited the highest fecundity (166.56 +/- 7.82 eggs), while those on XLX had the shortest pre-adult period (7.71 +/- 0.13 days). Longevity was significantly extended in mites reared on XLX, XT, and NY cultivars (25.95-26.83 days). Microbiota analysis via 16S rRNA sequencing showed that Proteobacteria dominated (>89.96% abundance) across all mite groups, with Wolbachia as the predominant symbiont (89.58-99.19%). Male mites exhibited higher bacterial diversity (Shannon and Chao1 indices) than females, though Wolbachia abundance did not differ significantly between sexes or cultivars. Functional predictions highlighted roles of microbiota in biosynthesis, detoxification, and energy metabolism. These findings underscore the influence of host plant variety on T. urticae fitness and microbiota composition, suggesting potential strategies for breeding resistant strawberry cultivars and leveraging microbial interactions for pest management.

AB  - In searching for novel targets to design antidepressants, among the characterized imidazoline receptors (IR), I2 receptors are an innovative therapeutical approach since they are dysregulated in major depressive disorder and by classical antidepressant treatments. In fact, several I2 agonists have been characterized for their antidepressant-like potential, but the results in terms of efficacy were mixed and exclusively reported in male rodents. Since there are well-known sex differences in antidepressant-like efficacy, this study characterized the potential effects induced by two I2 drugs, CR4056 (i.e., most promising drug already in phase II clinical trial for its analgesic properties) and B06 (a compound from a new family of bicyclic alpha-iminophosphonates) under the stress of the forced-swim test in male and female rats exposed to early-life stress. Moreover, some hippocampal neuroplasticity markers related to the potential effects observed were also evaluated (i.e., FADD, p-ERK/ERK, mBDNF, cell proliferation: Ki-67 + cells). The main results replicated the only prior study reporting the efficacy of CR4056 in male rats, while providing new data on its efficacy in females, which was clearly dependent on prior early-life stress exposure. Moreover, B06 showed no antidepressant-like effects in male or female rats. Finally, CR4056 increased FADD content and decreased cell proliferation in hippocampus, without affecting pERK/t-ERK ratio and/or mBDNF content. Interestingly, these effects were exclusively observed in female rats, and independently of early-life conditions, suggesting some distinctive molecular underpinnings participating in the therapeutic response of CR4056 for both sexes. In conjunction, these results present CR4056 with an antidepressant-like potential, especially in female rats exposed to stress early in life, together with some neuronal correlates described in the context of these behavioral changes in females.

AB  - A beneficial effect of corn-expressed phytase (CEP) on the growth performance of pigs fed with very low-protein (VLP) diets was previously shown. Little is known whether this improvement is related to alterations in the expression profiles of blood proteins and amino acids (AAs). The objective of this study was to investigate whether supplementation of VLP, low-calcium (Ca), and low-P diets with a CEP would alter the blood AAs and protein expression profiles in pigs. Forty-eight pigs were subjected to one of the following groups (n = 8/group) for 4 weeks: positive control (PC), negative control-reduced protein (NC), NC + low-dose CEP (LD), NC + high-dose CEP (HD), LD with reduced Ca/P (LDR), and HD with reduced Ca/P (HDR). Plasma leucine and phenylalanine concentrations were reduced in NC; however, the LD diet recovered the concentration of these AAs. Serum proteomics analysis revealed that proteins involved with growth regulation, such as selenoprotein P were upregulated while the IGF-binding proteins family proteins were differentially expressed in CEP-supplemented groups. Furthermore, a positive correlation was detected between growth and abundance of proteins involved in bone mineralization and muscle structure development. Taken together, CEP improved the blood profile of some essential AAs and affected the expression of proteins involved in the regulation of growth.

AB  - OVATE genes are a new class of transcriptional repressors with important regulatory roles in plant growth and development. Through genome-wide analysis of the OVATE gene family of tea plants, 26 and 13 family members were identified in cultivated and ancient tea plants, respectively. Syntenic results showed that OVATE gene family in cultivated tea plants may have experienced a special expansion event. Based on phylogenetic tree analysis, all OVATE genes were divided into four groups, and the third group had the largest number, reaching 16. Transcriptome data from different organs and populations indicated that many OVATE family members were highly expressed in young shoots and leaves, and their expression levels gradually decreased as tea leaves developed. Finally, the expression trends of the six key candidate genes were verified by RT-qPCR, which were consistent with the transcriptome results, indicating that the ovate gene family plays an important role in regulating the process of tea leaf development. In addition, we identified a key structural variation with a length of 184 bp, and the population genotyping showed that it was closely related to the area of tea leaves. Our research provides an important clue for further exploring the function of ovate gene family in tea plants and the development mechanism of tea leaves.

AB  - Mammalian oocyte maturation relies on mitochondrial ATP production, but this can lead to damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS). SIRT3, a mitochondrial sirtuin, plays a critical role in regulating mitochondrial redox balance in mouse oocytes under stress; however, its specific roles in porcine oocytes remain unclear. In this study, we utilized the SIRT3 inhibitor 3-TYP to investigate SIRT3's importance in porcine oocyte maturation. Our findings revealed that SIRT3 is expressed in porcine oocytes and its inhibition leads to maturation failure. This was evident through reduced polar body extrusion, arrested cell cycle, as well as disrupted spindle organization and actin distribution. Furthermore, SIRT3 inhibition resulted in a decrease in mitochondrial DNA copy numbers, disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential, and reduced ATP levels, all indicating impaired mitochondrial function in porcine oocytes. Additionally, the primary source of damaged mitochondria was associated with decreased levels of deacetylated superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) after SIRT3 inhibition, which led to ROS accumulation and oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. Taken together, our results suggest that SIRT3 regulates the levels of deacetylated SOD2 to maintain redox balance and preserve mitochondrial function during porcine oocyte maturation, with potential implications for improving pig reproduction.

AB  - Aspergillus sydowii is a moderate halophile fungus extensively studied for its biotechnological potential and halophile responses, which has also been reported as a coral reef pathogen. In a recent publication, the transcriptomic analysis of this fungus, when growing on wheat straw, showed that genes related to cell wall modification and cation transporters were upregulated under hypersaline conditions but not under 0.5 M NaCl, the optimal salinity for growth in this strain. This led us to study osmolyte accumulation as a mechanism to withstand moderate salinity. In this work, we show that A. sydowii accumulates trehalose, arabitol, mannitol, and glycerol with different temporal dynamics, which depend on whether the fungus is exposed to hypo- or hyperosmotic stress. The transcripts coding for enzymes responsible for polyalcohol synthesis were regulated in a stress-dependent manner. Interestingly, A. sydowii contains three homologs (Hog1, Hog2 and MpkC) of the Hog1 MAPK, the master regulator of hyperosmotic stress response in S. cerevisiae and other fungi. We show a differential regulation of these MAPKs under different salinity conditions, including sustained basal Hog1/Hog2 phosphorylation levels in the absence of NaCl or in the presence of 2.0 M NaCl, in contrast to what is observed in S. cerevisiae. These findings indicate that halophilic fungi such as A. sydowii utilize different osmoadaptation mechanisms to hypersaline conditions.

AB  - Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) can activate the extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK)/cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) cascade revealing an important role in antidepressant effects. Here, we studied the neuroprotective effect of baicalin (BA) in mice with chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)induced via a BDNF/ERK/CREB signaling pathway. Depression was induced via six weeks of CUMS in male ICR mice, and drug therapy was given simultaneously for the last three weeks. Cognitive dysfunctions were then evaluated via sucrose preference test (SPT), open field test (OFT), Morris water maze test (MWM), tail suspension test (TST), and novelty suppressed feeding test (NSF). Western blot and real-time PCR were then used to detect the relative expression of ERK, CREB, p-ERK, and p-CREB. Integrated optical density (IOD) tests of p-ERK and pCREB were then evaluated via immunofluorescence. The behavior results showed that the cognitive dysfunctions increased in the CUMS group versus the control (CON) group (p < 0.01). There were decreases in fluoxetine (FLU) and BA groups (p < 0.05, p < 0.01). The protein ratios of p-ERK/ERK, p-CREB/CREB and ERK mRNA, and CREB mRNA expression decreased in the CUMS group (p < 0.01) and markedly increased in the FLU and BA groups (p < 0.05, p < 0.01). The IOD value of the p-ERK and p-CREB in the CUMS group was decreased versus the CON group (p < 0.01), and these changes were improved via BA and FLU treatment (p < 0.05, p < 0.01). This study indicated that BA can improve cognitive functions and has antidepressant effects in mice, which may be associated with activation of the BDNF/ERK/CREB signaling pathway in the hippocampus.

AB  - Microbial volatile organic compounds (mVOCs), produced by microorganisms associated with honeydew, play a crucial role in herbivore-natural enemy interactions. Nevertheless, the function of mVOCs on predatory ladybirds remains largely unknown. We hypothesized that the ladybird Harmonia axyridis (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) could recognize and detect aphid honeydew-associated mVOCs for prey location. Our results showed that H. axyridis exhibited positive responses to the honeydew of Sitobion miscanthi (Hemiptera: Aphididae) and the mVOCs emitted by two honeydew-associated bacterial strains, Erwinia tasmaniensis MH4 and Klebsiella quasipneumoniae subsp. similipneumoniae MH6. A total of 16 mVOCs were detected by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, with 3 mVOCs, namely 6-methylhept-5-en-2-one, 4-methylpentan-2-ol and 3-methylbutan-2-ol to be specific or significantly higher in attractive bacterial strains. Electroantennography and olfactory behavioral assays showed that H. axyridis prefers 6-methylhept-5-en-2-one and 4-methylpentan-2-ol. 3D modeling and molecular docking predicted that the H. axyridis olfactory binding proteins (HaxyOBP) HaxyOBP1 and HaxyOBP15 strongly interact with both compounds. Fluorescence competition assays further demonstrated that HaxyOBP15 exhibits a strong affinity for these attractive compounds. RNAi-mediated knockdown of HaxyOBP15 reduced H. axyridis' behavioral responses to 6-methylhept-5-en-2-one and 4-methylpentan-2-ol, confirming the critical role of HaxyOBP15 in detecting these mVOCs. We provide new insights on behavior of ladybirds in response to honeydew-associated mVOCs, contributing to research toward eco-friendly pest management methods targeting aphids.

AB  - Simple Summary Small mammals hider a wide number of saprophytic fungi associated with dermatophytosis in young or immunocompromised humans. This raises the possibility of potential zoonotic transmission of dermatophytes in animals from pet shops. Therefore, it is recommended that routine fungal diagnostic testing in pet guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus) and rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus domesticus) be carried out, to detect potential zoonotic fungi. The almost complete lack of cutaneous lesions in many cases associated with the presence of such a dermatophyte on healthy mammals may increase the risk of zoonotic transmission. This study identifies the most common fungal species that occur on the skin in guinea pigs and rabbits and determines the rate of asymptomatic carriers in healthy pet animals. Fungal skin diseases are well-recognized diseases with public health implications. The study provides a comprehensive overview and aims to determine the rate of positive fungal cultures to identify the most common fungal species in guinea pigs and rabbits and to determine the rate of asymptomatic carriers in healthy pet animals. This knowledge is essential for understanding disease transmission dynamics and epidemiological situation problems. A total of 167 animals (64 rabbits and 103 guinea pigs) were investigated in this study. The fungi of the genus Penicillium, Rhizopus, Mucor, Cladosporium, and Aspergillus were the most common in the examined animals, and they were isolated from 162 (97%) of the animals enrolled. No fungal growth was observed in 5 animals. In 15 cases (8.98%), we found pathogenic zoonotic dermatophytes (Trichophyton mentagrophytes), which caused several health problems in two humans in contact with affected animals. This study presents the prevalence of fungal flora in pet guinea pigs and rabbits in Slovakia.

AB  - Polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs) are dioxin-like compounds that have been reported to be present in a wide variety of foodstuffs. Milk-based infant and toddler formula sometimes plays an important role in the diet of young children and could potentially cause adverse effects if contaminated with PCNs. This study investigated the concentrations of PCNs in commer-cial milk-based formula produced in different countries and sold on the Chinese market for three age groups: 0-6, 6-12 and 12-36 months. The total concentrations of PCNs in 72 samples from different countries of formula based on cow milk ranged from 7.8 to 30.3 pg/g whole weight (ww). Although the PCN concentrations in formula produced in Asia, Europe and South Pacific varied, all had comparable toxic equivalent (TEQ) values. Tri-CNs were the predominant PCN ho-mologue in all samples. No significant differences in the concentrations of PCNs were found between samples of formula for each of the three age groups. The mean TEQ for PCNs in goat milk formula samples (0.0031 pg TEQ/g ww) was higher than the value for cow milk formula (0.0009 pg TEQ/g ww) produced in China, and the proportion of higher chlorinated PCNs in goat milk formula was also higher. Based on dry weight, the mean concentration of PCNs in the raw cow milk (119 pg/g dry weight (dw)) used to produce infant and toddler formula was higher than that in the actual formula (24.2 pg/g dw), and the PCN profiles also varied between the raw milk and formula. A risk assessment indicated that, in China, consuming for-mula poses a lower risk to infants and toddlers from based on exposure to PCNs compared with consuming breast milk.

AB  - It has been demonstrated that angiopoietin-like protein 4 (ANGPTL4) plays an important regulatory role in lipid metabolism and backfat deposition appears to vary in different pig breeds. However, the correlation between ANGPTL4 and backfat deposition have not been well characterized and the role of ANGPTL4 in regulating adipogenesis remains unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate correlation between ANGPTL4 and backfat deposition and to explore the effects of ANGPTL4 on preadipocyte differentiation and the underlying mechanism. Our results showed that the backfat thickness and the ANGPTL4 gene expression of Laiwu pigs were significantly higher than those in DLY pigs and the ANGPTL4 gene expression was positively correlated with backfat thickness both in DLY pigs and Laiwu pigs. Moreover, an increase in ANGPTL4 expression and activation of autophagy were observed during the differentiation of stromal vascular fraction cells. In addition, knockdown of ANGPTL4 inhibited the differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells with decreased expression of LC3-II and ATG5 and increased expression of SQSTM1, suggesting the involvement of autophagy in ANGPTL4-mediated adipogenesis. In conclusion, these results suggested that ANGPTL4 is positively correlated with backfat deposition in pigs and knockdown of ANGPTL4 inhibits adipogenesis of preadipocyte via autophagy, providing new insights into the regulation of fat deposition and to improve the carcass quality and meat quality of porcine.

AB  - The optimal design of glass bead-filled polyamide 12-based composites for improved performance in 3D printing is addressed in this research. Orientation-dependent brittleness or the strain-dependent tensile strength variations in polyamides have been problematic issues to date. Optimizing formulations based on material models using deep learning and Elk Herd Optimization (EHO) leads to formulating balanced automotive and industrial parts in terms of strength and flexibility. The mechanical properties are predicted using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model, after which the optimized formulations are extruded to form filaments reinforced with continuous carbon fibers with very minimal voids and excellent dimensional accuracy. Tests run on the mechanical tests reveal quite significant improvements: whereas polyamide reaches a peak tensile strength of about 50 MPa at a 10% strain for the polyamide-glass bead composite, this reached its peak at 33 MPa at 4-5% strain. Orientation-dependent testing indicated X-printed composites preserved, to maximum deflection without rupture. Such results indicate the potential of advanced computational techniques applied for optimization of polymer composites toward 3D printing and potential being interesting in industrial applications requiring further high performance and reliability.

AB  - Annual loss of rice caused by insect pests accounts for about 30% of total production, and the use of traditional pesticides has brought about environmental pollution, food safety, and other problems. The use of secondary metabolites of rice to control pests has become a research hotspot, but little is known about the mechanism of rice self-resistance. Rice is a typical silicon accumulating crop. Previous study showed that silicon can significantly enhance the resistance of rice to Chilo suppressalis, but anti-insect active substances in silicon-treated rice were unknown. In current study, metabolomics analysis has been performed on two groups of rice (T1, treated with silicon and insect; T3, treated with only insect). A total of 151 significantly different metabolites were obtained, compared with T3 group, 23 metabolites in T1 were significantly up-regulated and 128 metabolites were significantly down-regulated. Different metabolites were mainly enriched to tryptophan metabolism, lipoic acid metabolism, linoleic acid metabolism, isoflavone biosynthesis, and indole alkaloid biosynthesis. The different metabolites (p < 0.1) enriched to lipoic acid metabolism and fatty acid biosynthesis were all significantly up-regulated. Ten significantly up-regulated different metabolites were selected from T1. These were 3-hydroxy-palmitic acid methyl ester (1), octanoic acid (2), 3-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid (3), 12-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid (4), 2-linoleoylglycerol (5), methyleugenol (6), alpha-asarone (7), 2,4,5-trimethoxybenzaldehyde (8), acitretin (9), and menatetrenone (10), and their anti-insect activity was evaluated. Compounds 1-5 and 7-10 could significantly inhibit the growth of Chilo suppressalis. Compounds 2 and 3 inhibited growth of the insect by 35.5 and 64.5%, respectively. Compound 2 belongs to lipoic acid metabolism and fatty acid biosynthesis. We speculate that silicon positively regulated the metabolic pathway of lipoic acid and fatty acid to enhance the resistance of rice to insects.

AB  - Anthropogenic activities are increasing terrestrial sodium availability through application of both saline irrigation water and road salt. Sodium often limits herbivore abundance, but less is known about the physiological, developmental, and behavioral means by which moderate increases in sodium availability can increase herbivore fitness. Here, we raised a grasshopper species on three no-choice diets of wheatgrass watered with no sodium (control), a 1% (medium) sodium solution, and a 5% (high) sodium solution to examine the effects of sodium intake on grasshopper survival, morphology, and jumping performance. Grasshopper nymphs raised on a high sodium diet had lower weights and reduced survival compared to those raised on control or medium sodium diets. However, nymphs on a high sodium diet developed larger eye size standardized by body size and demonstrated increased jumping distance compared to nymphs on the control or medium sodium diets. As adults, grasshoppers on the medium sodium diet had the highest survival and grasshoppers on the high sodium diet had the least amount of cannibalism of the three treatments. Understanding the response of herbivore fitness to increasing diet sodium content is an important first step toward predicting how anthropogenic inputs of sodium into terrestrial systems will alter food webs.

AB  - Under tropical climate heat stress is a major challenge for livestock production. HSP70.1 is a ubiquitously expressed protein maintaining cellular machinery through proper folding of denatured proteins and prevents cellular apoptosis and protect cell from heat stress. Therefore, present investigation was undertaken to explore genetic variability in HSP70.1 gene in Gangatiri cattle, its comparison with buffalo sequences and differential expression in different season. The allelic variant was identified by sequencing amplified PCR product of HSP70.1 gene by primer walking. Season-wise total RNA samples was prepared for differential expression study. Brilliant SYBR Green QPCR technique was used to study the expression kinetics of this gene. DNA sequencing by primer walking identified four allelic variants in Gangatiri cattle. Sequence alignment study revealed four, six and one substitutions in the 5 ' untranslated region (5 ' UTR), coding and 3 ' untranslated region ((3 ' UTR) of HSP70.1 gene, respectively. Comparative analysis of HSP70.1 gene revealed that Cattle has shorter 5 ' UTR and 3 ' UTR than the buffalo. In Gangatiri cattle, summer season has significantly higher (P <= 0.05) expression of HSP70.1 than the spring and winter. The relative expression of HSP70.1 was increased by more than six folds in summer and nearly 1.5 folds higher in winter in comparison to the spring season. Therefore, HSP70.1 may be considered to have a critical role in the development of thermal tolerance in Gangatiri cattle.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Xingbei antitussive granules (XB) is a classic Chinese Medicine prescription for treating post-infectious cough(PIC), based on the Sanao Decoction from Formularies of the Bureau of People's Welfare Pharmacies in the Song Dynasty and Jiegeng decoction from Essentials of the Golden Chamber in the Han Dynasty. However, the therapeutic effects and pharmacological mechanisms are still ambiguous. In the present study, we endeavored to elucidate these underlying mechanisms. Aims of the study: This study aimed to explore the potential impact and mechanism of XB on PIC, and provide a scientific basis for its clinical application. Materials and methods: Cigarette smoking (CS) combined with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) nasal drops were administered to induce the PIC guinea pig with cough hypersensitivity status. Subsequently, the model guinea pigs were treated with XB and the cough frequency was observed by the capsaicin cough provocation test. The pathological changes of lung tissue were assessed by HE staining, and the levels of inflammatory mediators, mast cell degranulating substances, and neuropeptides were detected. The protein and mRNA expression of transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1(TRPV1), proteinase-activated receptor2(PAR2), and protein kinase C (PKC) were measured by Immunohistochemical staining, Western blot, and RT-qPCR. Changes in the abundance and composition of respiratory bacterial microbiota were determined by 16S rRNA sequencing. Results: After XB treatment, the model guinea pigs showed a dose-dependent decrease in cough frequency, along with a significant alleviation in inflammatory infiltration of lung tissue and a reduction in inflammatory mediators. In addition, XB high-dose treatment significantly decreased the levels of mast cell Tryptase as well as beta-hexosaminidase (beta-Hex) and downregulated the expression of TRPV1, PAR2, and p-PKC. Simultaneously, levels of neuropeptides like substance P (SP), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), neurokinin A (NKA), and nerve growth factor (NGF) were improved. Besides, XB also can modulate the structure of respiratory bacterial microbiota and restore homeostasis. Conclusion: XB treatment alleviates cough hypersensitivity and inflammatory responses, inhibits the degranulation of mast cells, and ameliorates neurogenic inflammation in PIC guinea pigs whose mechanism may be associated with the inhibition of Tryptase/PAR2/PKC/TRPV1 and the recovery of respiratory bacterial microbiota.

AB  - In this research, the municipal solid waste (MSW) was co-composted with H2SO4-activated biochar (H2SO4-AB), NaOH-activated biochar (NaOH-AB), MgSO4-modified zeolite (MgSO4-zeolite), and leonardite. Several maturity and stability parameters were determined over the co-composting period. Results showed that activating biochar with NaOH or H2SO4 resulted in the formation of a mesh structure with irregularly sized cavities and deep pores, thereby modifying the biochar surface. All of the additives used in this study yielded higher microbial respiration and dehydrogenase activity during the thermophilic phase. Both NaOH-AB and H2SO4-AB amended composts exhibited higher respiration rates than that of leonardite and zeolite, averaging 24% greater than the control. However, the 10% leonardite amended compost created a higher degree of humification than the rest of the treatments in co-compost based on humic acid yield and the E-4/E-6 and E-3/E-5 ratios. Furthermore, the 5% NaOH-AB amended compost was identified as the superior treatment due to its longest thermophilic period (7 days) and the highest temperature (71.5 degrees C), germination index (130.9%), and total nitrogen content (1.37%). This treatment also resulted in the greatest decline in NH4+ concentration and the lowest availability of Cu and Cd (p < 0.05). However, the 10% H2SO4-AB amended compost was noted as the superior treatment based on maximum organic matter content (36.8%) and C/N ratio (18.1), along with the lowest nitrate concentration (254.4 mg/kg) and the lowest available Zn, Fe, Mn, and Pb concentrations (p < 0.05). Therefore, acid and base-activated biochars are suggested as the most suitable additives for improving the quality of MSW-derived co-compost.

AB  - Background: The purpose of this study was to identify the species of artiodactyl host related to the fecal matter collected in a forest area in Rio de Janeiro state and carry out a parasitological investigation. Methods: Artiodactyl feces were collected between 2020 and 2021. The fecal samples were examined to identify the host through macroscopic and molecular analysis. The remaining samples were subjected to a fecal parasite analysis using microscopic techniques, and feces containing cysts of the phylum Ciliophora underwent a molecular analysis. Results: Of the 101 samples collected, 71.3% were found in Pavao Valley, the most anthropized area of the park. In the molecular analysis, 79 samples were identified as belonging to Sus scrofa and 2 as Mazama gouazoubira. The most frequently detected forms were cysts of the phylum Ciliophora (39.6%), followed by eggs of Ascaris spp. (11.8%) and Metastrongylus spp. (5.9%). Nucleotide sequences of Balantioides coli were characterized in 26 samples, and in 13 samples variants of type B0 and in 11 type A0 were identified. Conclusions: It should be noted that this is the first study in the Americas that has identified B. coli in free-living S. scrofa feces, citing this bioinvader as one of the reservoirs of this parasite.

AB  - Anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) is produced by ovarian granulosa cells (GCs)and plays a major role in inhibiting the recruitment of primordial follicles and reducing the sensitivity of growing follicles to follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Bone morphogenetic protein 6 (BMP6) has similar spatiotemporal expression to AMH during follicular development, suggesting that BMP6 may regulate AMH expression. However, the specific mechanism by which BMP6 regulates AMH expression remains unclear. The ob-jectives of this study were to examine the molecular pathway by which BMP6 regulates AMH expression. The results showed that BMP6 promoted the secretion and expression of AMH in goat ovarian GCs. Mechanistically, BMP6 upregulated the expression of sex-determining region Y-box 9 (SOX9) and GATA-binding factor 4 (GATA4), which was associated with the transcriptional initiation of AMH. AMH expression was significantly decreased by GATA4 knockdown. Moreover, BMP6 treatment promoted the phosphorylation of SMAD1/5/8, whereas inhibiting the SMAD1/5/8 signaling pathway significantly abolished BMP6-induced upregulation of AMH and GATA4 expression. Interestingly, the activation of SMAD1/5/8 alone did not affect the expression of AMH or GATA4. The results suggested that BMP6 upregulated GATA4 through the SMAD1/5/8 signaling pathway, which in turn promoted AMH expression.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Effective management of nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) in camelina [Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz] production is important to ensure optimum seed yield and oil composition. The objectives of this study were to determine camelina seed yield and oil concentration and to estimate nutrient removal and N use efficiency (NUE) as influenced by N and S application. Field experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of S rates (0 and 20 kg<middle dot>ha-1) and N fertilizer rates (0, 22, 45, and 90 kg<middle dot>ha-1) on camelina productivity and fatty acid composition over two growing seasons (2014 and 2015). Results showed S application had no effect on seed yield and oil concentration. Averaged across N rates, protein concentration increased with S application compared with the control. Seed yield showed quadratic response to N fertilizer application with maximum yield occurring at 54 kg N<middle dot>ha-1; however, economic optimum N rate ranged from 18 to 43 kg N<middle dot>ha-1. Nutrient removal, protein concentration, protein and oil yield, and estimated biodiesel were maximum at 45 kg N<middle dot>ha-1. The maximum amounts of N, phosphorus, potassium, and S removed were 49, 8,10, and 7 kg<middle dot>ha-1, respectively. NUE and N agronomic efficiency decreased when N fertilizer rates were above 22 kg N<middle dot>ha-1. Application of N or S had no effect on proportions of saturated fatty acid, monounsaturated fatty acid, and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Our findings suggest camelina required 18-43 kg N<middle dot>ha-1 when grown in rain-fed systems in water-limited environments.

AB  - The existing treatise targeted to compare the effects of adding different nano-emulsions essential oils (olive, flaxseed, and grapeseed oils) in freezing extender on semen quality and freezability in buffalo. Nano-emulsions were prepared from olive, flaxseed, and grapeseed oils and characterized for their sizes and shapes. Semen extended in four tubes were supplemented with 0 (control) and 3.5% nanoemulsion oils, including olive (NEO), flaxseed (NEFO) and grape seed oils (NEGSO) respectively. NEGSO resulted in the highest (p < 0.05) membrane integrity, vitality, progressive motility (P-motility) of sperm compared to the other groups in post-thawed buffalo bull semen (at 37 C for 30 s). The addition of NEGSO had the best results for membrane integrity, progressive motility, and vitality of sperm after incubation (at 37 C and 5% CO(2 )for 2 h). A superior (p < 0.05) value of total antioxidant capacity in frozen-thawed spermatozoa was monitored in all supplemented groups as relative to the control. The values of malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO) were lower (p < 0.05) in NEGSO group compared with other groups. Both NEO and NEFO exhibited the same results for MDA, and NO levels (p > 0.05). All supplemented groups exhibited lower hydrogen peroxide levels (p < 0.05) as relative to the un-treated group. The lowest (p < 0.05) caspase 3 levels were verified in NEGSO treatment, followed by NEFO and NEO treatments. Post-thawed sperm showed ultrastructural damages in the control group, and theses damages were attenuated or resorted by the NEGSO, NEFO and NEO supplemented to freezing extender. In consequences with in vitro results regarding the sperm attribute, a greater pregnancy rate (92%) was observed in NEGSO group as compared with NEFO (88%), NEO (76%) and CON (68%) groups. Our findings demonstrate that NEGSO (3.5%) could be used as a new strategy in enhancing sperm functionality, potential fertility and reducing the oxidative damage and apoptosis markers. This could be significantly applicable for sperm physiology cryopreservation in the milieu of assisted reproduction systems.

AB  - Background: The current pilot study was designed to examine the association between hippocampal gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) concentration and episodic memory in older individuals, as well as the impact of two major risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD)-female sex and Apolipoprotein epsilon 4 (ApoE epsilon 4) genotype-on this relationship.
   Methods: Twenty healthy, community-dwelling individuals aged 50-71 (11 women) took part in the study. Episodic memory was evaluated using a Directed Forgetting task, and GABA+ was measured in the right hippocampus using a Mescher-Garwood point-resolved magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) sequence. Multiple linear regression models were used to quantify the relationship between episodic memory, GABA+, ApoE epsilon 4, and sex, controlling for age and education.
   Results: While GABA+ did not interact with ApoE epsilon 4 carrier status to influence episodic memory (p = 0.757), the relationship between GABA+ and episodic memory was moderated by sex: lower GABA+ predicted worse memory in women such that, for each standard deviation decrease in GABA+ concentration, memory scores were reduced by 11% (p = 0.001).
   Conclusions: This pilot study suggests that sex, but not ApoE epsilon 4 genotype, moderates the relationship between hippocampal GABA+ and episodic memory, such that women with lower GABA+ concentration show worse memory performance. These findings, which must be interpreted with caution given the small sample size, may serve as a starting point for larger studies using multimodal neuroimaging to understand the contributions of GABA metabolism to age-related memory decline.

AB  - The cost of Eucalyptus seed and adoption of strict phytosanitary regulations in seed trade makes it imperative to monitor the quality and ensure supply of pathogen-free seeds for both forestry regeneration and research. Based on seed health tests, two species in the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides species complex were found to be naturally associated with seeds of Eucalyptus dunnii, E. nitens and E. macarthurii produced in South Africa. Multiloci phylogenetic analyses based on the concatenated sequences of the ITS regions, beta-tubulin, actin, glutamine synthetase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase genes, identified representative isolates PPRI 24,314 as C. fructicola and PPRI 24,315 as C. kahawae subsp. cigarro (C. cigarro). Subsequent biochemical tests showed that isolate PPRI 24,315 was able to utilise either ammonium tartrate or citric acid as a sole carbon source, confirming its identity as C. cigarro. Pathogenicity tests showed that both C. fructicola and C. cigarro caused anthracnose leaf spots on E. camaldulensis, E. dunnii, E. nitens and E. viminalis seedlings. Disease symptoms included irregular dark-brown leaf spots on seedlings six days after inoculation. The two fungi were exclusively re-isolated from disease spots, thereby fulfilling Koch's postulates. Sowing Eucalyptus spp. seed artificially inoculated with either of the two pathogens showed the seed-transmissibility of C. fructicola and C. cigarro in E. camaldulensis, E. dunnii and E. nitens seedlings. To our knowledge, this is the first report of C. fructicola and C. cigarro associated with Eucalyptus.

Owing to its multifactorial origin, complex genetics, and heterogeneity in clinical phenotypes, it is difficult to faithfully model ASD. In essence, ASD is an umbrella term for a group of individually rare disorders, each risk gene accounting for <1% of cases, threaded by a set of overlapping behavioral or molecular phenotypes. Validated behavioral tests are considered a gold standard for ASD diagnosis, and several animal models (rodents, pigs, and non-human primates) have traditionally been used to study its molecular basis. These models recapitulate the human phenotype to a varying degree and have been indispensable to preclinical research, but they cannot be used to study human-specific features such as protracted neuronal maturation and cell-intrinsic attributes, posing serious limitations to translatability. Human stem cell-based models, both as monolayer 2D cultures and 3D organoids and assembloids, can circumvent these limitations. Generated from a patient's own reprogrammed cells, these can be used for testing therapeutic interventions that are more condition and patient relevant, targeting developmental windows where the intervention would be most effective. We discuss some of these advancements by comparing traditional and recent models of ASD.

AB  - Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) saponins (AS), primarily pentacyclic triterpenoids, may reduce methane emissions from goats (Capra hircus L.). This study evaluated the methane-suppressing potential of Aspergillus niger beta-glucosidase-modified AS using in vitro rumen fermentation (0.10 mg/mL inoculum, 24 h incubation, gas chromatography detection). Among the 21 alfalfa cultivars, Pegasis (fall dormancy 9) exhibited the highest antioxidant efficacy (half maximum effective concentration 2.13 mg/mL) and the lowest ferric-reducing activity (0.32 mu M Fe2+/g) (p < 0.05). Fresh/silage AS reduced methane proportions to 4.50-5.21% of total gas, while enzymatic biotransformation further decreased it to 3.34-3.48% (p < 0.05). Methanogen abundance declined by 20.10-44.93%, and general anaerobic fungi declined by 34.22-44.66% compared to untreated AS (p < 0.05). Metabolomics linked methane suppression to six pathways, including zeatin biosynthesis (via nucleotide metabolites accumulation) and prolactin signaling pathway (via bioactive molecules downregulation), suggesting impaired methanogen energy metabolism and hydrogen flux redirection as mechanisms. Enzymatic AS also enhanced volatile fatty acid production, indicating improved fiber digestion. These in vitro findings demonstrate that enzyme-treated AS modulates rumen fermentation through dual methane mitigation and nutrient utilization enhancement, offering a sustainable feed additive strategy for livestock.

AB  - Learning alterations in the child population may be linked to gestational diabetes as a causal factor, though this remains an open and highly controversial question. In that sense, it has been reported that maternal hyperglycemia generates a threatening condition that affects hippocampal development in offspring. The pyramidal cells of the CA3 subfield, a key structure in learning and memory processes, are particularly important in cognitive deficiencies. We evaluate the effect of the hyperglycemic intrauterine environment on hippocampal histomorphometry in offspring, correlating it with spatial learning and memory, as well as the morphology of dendrites and spines in 30-day-old pups (P30). The maternal hyperglycemia affected the body weight, height, and brain size of fetuses at 21 days of gestation (F21), newborn pups (P0) and P30 pups from diabetic rats, which were smaller compared to the control group. Consequently, this resulted in a decrease in hippocampal size, lower neuronal density and cytoarchitectural disorganization in the CA3 region of the hippocampus in the offspring at the three ages studied. The behavioral tests performed showed a direct relationship between morpho-histological alterations and deficiencies in learning and memory, as well as alterations in the morphology of the dendrites and spines. Therefore, knowing the harmful effects caused by gestational diabetes can be of great help to establish therapeutic and educational strategies that can help to improve learning and memory in children.

AB  - In the Australian primary industries, beef cows are recognized as monovular while sheep are less so, and both seem likely to benefit from increased litter sizes. In both species, there have been genetic developments causing increased litter sizes, but these have only had limited commercial application. This report describes the commercial use of the FecB (Booroola) gene in prime lamb ewes to increase lambing percentage from the 111% typical of the local industry to 145% in the flock described. In cattle, the use of the USMARC Twinner selection line genetics raised calf weaning percentage from the 89% typical of the local industry to 115% in the herds described.

AB  - Featured Application The role of fatty acids in the diets of animals, such as dairy buffaloes, is gaining increasing attention, particularly regarding polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) due to their impact on metabolic health, inflammation, and overall production efficiency. Monitoring the fatty acid composition in Total Mixed Rations (TMRs) through NIR spectroscopy is therefore strategic for ensuring the nutritional balance of the diet. The findings of this study not only reaffirm the well-established utility of NIR spectroscopy in assessing the chemical composition of animal rations but also establish a foundation for its application in evaluating fatty acid composition. This advancement enhances the potential for a comprehensive and integrated approach to feed analysis, enabling more effective on-farm verification and nutritional monitoring.Abstract Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is an efficient, non-destructive method for evaluating the chemical composition of various compounds. This study aimed to assess both the proximate composition, fibres, and fatty acid (FA) content of Total Mixed Rations (TMRs) in dairy buffalo nutrition. A total of 240 TMR samples were collected from ten dairy buffalo farms across four seasons to develop predictive models using Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR). Calibration models for dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), ether extract (EE), and starch demonstrated good predictive accuracy, with coefficients of determination in cross-validation (R2cv) around 0.90 and Residual Predictive Deviation (RPDcv) values exceeding 3.0. Fatty acid models showed slightly lower R2cv values, ranging from 0.80 to 0.90. A good predictive performance was observed for linoleic acid (18:2 n-6) and alpha-linolenic acid (18:3 n-3), with RPDp values above 3.0, indicating reliable predictions. The inclusion of omega-3-rich compounds in the diet provides significant benefits for both animal health and product quality, highlighting the importance of ration monitoring. The findings confirm that while NIRS is effective for assessing chemical composition, further refinement is needed to improve FA prediction accuracy. These results support the use of NIRS as a practical tool for nutritional monitoring in lactating buffaloes.

AB  - Convergent evolution is widespread but the extent to which common ancestral conditions are necessary to facilitate the independent acquisition of similar traits remains unclear. In order to better understand how ancestral biosynthetic catalytic capabilities might lead to convergent evolution of similar modern-day biochemical pathways, we resurrected ancient enzymes of the caffeine synthase (CS) methyltransferases that are responsible for theobromine and caffeine production in flowering plants. Ancestral CS enzymes of Theobroma, Paullinia, and Camellia exhibited similar substrate preferences but these resulted in the formation of different sets of products. From these ancestral enzymes, descendants with similar substrate preference and product formation independently evolved after gene duplication events in Theobroma and Paullinia. Thus, it appears that the convergent modern-day pathways likely originated from ancestral pathways with different inferred flux. Subsequently, the modern-day enzymes originated independently via gene duplication and their convergent catalytic characteristics evolved to partition the multiple ancestral activities by different mutations that occurred in homologous regions of the ancestral proteins. These results show that even when modern-day pathways and recruited genes are similar, the antecedent conditions may be distinctive such that different evolutionary steps are required to generate convergence.

AB  - Certain amino and fatty acids play essential role in plant-herbivore interactions and also act as precursors for various plant defense compounds. Therefore, we carried out amino and fatty acid profiles of seedlings of different specialty maize genotypes viz., quality protein maize (high lysine and tryptophan contents in the kernels), sweet corn, white kernel and yellow kernel, and their fed Chilo partellus larvae to understand their contribution in plant defense. The larval and pupal weights, larval survival, adult emergence, and antibiosis indices of C. partellus were significantly lower on white and yellow kernel than that on sweet corn and quality protein maize genotypes. The amino and fatty acid contents varied significantly in the seedlings of test maize genotypes and in their fed C. partellus larvae. Amounts of aspartic acid, glycine, histidine, phenylalanine, proline, serine, and threonine were significantly lower in the seedlings of white kernel as compared to other maize genotypes. However, the amounts of these amino acids were significantly higher in the C. partellus larvae fed on white kernel as compared to those fed on other maize genotypes. Furthermore, amounts of basic, aliphatic, and cyclic amino acids were also lower in the seedlings of white kernel genotypes and higher in their fed C. partellus larvae as compared to other test maize genotypes and their fed insect larvae. The increase or decrease in myristic, cinnamic, linoleic, stearic, methyl-11-eicosanoate, and margaric acid contents in the maize seedlings and their fed C. partellus larvae followed consistent trend. Myristic and stearic acids were significantly higher in the seedlings of white kernel than other maize genotypes. Amino acids viz., aspartic acid, glycine, histidine, lysine, phenylalanine, proline, serine, and threonine; and the fatty acid, stearic acid in the test maize genotypes showed significant association with various growth and development indices, and contributed to 100% variability in antibiosis against C. partellus, which could be used as biomarkers to identify spotted stem borer-resistant maize genotypes.

AB  - Simple Summary We describe results from a panel study in which pigs from a 17-sow African swine fever (ASF) positive herd in Thai Binh province, Vietnam, were followed over time to record the date of onset of ASF signs and the date of death from ASF. Our objectives were to (1) fit a susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed disease model to the data with transmission coefficients estimated using approximate Bayesian computation; (2) provide commentary on how a model of this type might be used to provide decision support for disease control authorities. Detailed datasets of epidemics afflicting smallholder herds are rare. This study provides insight into how ASF progresses in a small-scale semi-intensive pig herd in Vietnam and generated a dataset that facilitated the use of a modeling approach to describe the transmission dynamics in this frequently underreported sector.
   We describe results from a panel study in which pigs from a 17-sow African swine fever (ASF) positive herd in Thai Binh province, Vietnam, were followed over time to record the date of onset of ASF signs and the date of death from ASF. Our objectives were to (1) fit a susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed disease model to the data with transmission coefficients estimated using approximate Bayesian computation; (2) provide commentary on how a model of this type might be used to provide decision support for disease control authorities. For the outbreak in this herd, the median of the average latent period was 10 days (95% HPD (highest posterior density interval): 2 to 19 days), and the median of the average duration of infectiousness was 3 days (95% HPD: 2 to 4 days). The estimated median for the transmission coefficient was 3.3 (95% HPD: 0.4 to 8.9) infectious contacts per ASF-infectious pig per day. The estimated median for the basic reproductive number, R-0, was 10 (95% HPD: 1.1 to 30). Our estimates of the basic reproductive number R-0 were greater than estimates of R-0 for ASF reported previously. The results presented in this study may be used to estimate the number of pigs expected to be showing clinical signs at a given number of days following an estimated incursion date. This will allow sample size calculations, with or without adjustment to account for less than perfect sensitivity of clinical examination, to be used to determine the appropriate number of pigs to examine to detect at least one with the disease. A second use of the results of this study would be to inform the equation-based within-herd spread components of stochastic agent-based and hybrid simulation models of ASF.

AB  - Simple Summary In this study, the genomic variants associated with LMA in Beijing Black pigs revealed a total of 329 differentially expressed genes relating to LMA. Integrating a GWAS with RNA sequencing revealed HDAC9 as a crucial candidate gene for this trait. KEGG analysis using RNA-seq data indicated that the DEGs were mainly enriched in the JAK/STAT and oxytocin signaling pathways. We believe that our study makes a significant contribution to the literature because, although many candidate genes related to LMA have been reported, the molecular markers and candidate genes for LMA in Beijing Black pigs have not been identified. Loin muscle area (LMA) is an important meat production trait and plays a key role in determining carcass leanness. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis were used to identify candidate LMA genes in Beijing Black pigs, a popular breed among consumers in northern China. Ten single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in sus scrofa chromosome (SSC) 9 were significantly associated with LMA. These SNPs were mapped to a 2.90 Mb (84.94-87.84 Mb) region. A total of 11 annotated genes were mapped on this region, namely MEOX2, CRPPA, SOSTDC1, LRRC72, ANKMY2, BZW2, TSPAN13, AGR2, AHR, SNX13, and HDAC9. In addition, RNA-seq analysis was performed between the high- and low-LMA groups, and 329 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. Further, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis based on DEGs revealed that the JAK/STAT signaling pathway and oxytocin signaling pathway may be responsible for LMA. Both GWAS and RNA-seq analysis identified the HDAC9 gene, indicating that it may be an important candidate gene affecting LMA in Beijing Black pigs. The findings provide valuable molecular insights into the mechanisms that influence LMA content in pigs, which can be utilized in targeted approaches to enhance meat quality and commercial profitability.

AB  - Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-degrading enzyme (dsRNase) is one of the negative factors influencing the RNA interference (RNAi) effect in Colorado potato beetle (CPB). We have previously shown that plastid-mediated RNAi (PM-RNAi) can be utilized to control CPB. In this study, we aimed to test whether silencing dsRNase could increase the RNAi effect in CPB via PM-RNAi. We generated transplastomic potato (Solanum tuberosum) plants expressing dsRNA targeting shibire (dsSHI) of CPB. St-dsSHIplants (transplastomic plants expressing dsSHI) showed much less potent RNAi response than transplastomic potato plants expressing dsRNAs targeting CPB Shrub (St-dsSHR) or beta-Actin (St-dsACT), two CPB-resistant transplastomic lines generated previously. The three types of transplastomic lines have weak (St-dsSHI), moderate (St-dsSHR) and strong (St-dsACT) resistant levels to CPB. Treatment with in vitro-synthesized dsdsRNase1/2 (a fusion dsRNA targeting dsRNase1 and dsRNase2 of CPB) led to enhanced suppression of dsRNase1 and dsRNase2 in CPB larvae fed with St-dsSHIplants and dsRNase2 in CPB larvae fed with St-dsSHR plants. St-dsSHR or St-dsSHIplants showed significantly reduced CPB larva weight or damaged area by CPB feeding. These results demonstrate that dsRNase-silencing approach could improve the effect of PM-RNAi when the silencing of target genes has weak or moderate strength of the insecticidal effects. The findings provide a new proof-of-concept to enhance crop resistance to insect herbivores to via an "RNAi-of-RNAi" approach.

AB  - Sandstorms that cause shifting dunes are a huge technical challenge in the development of the railway network in Saudi Arabia, and are known as one of the most concerning atmospheric aspects. In this case, the weather or climate change makes railways more problematic and costly in Saudi Arabia compared to other countries. The purpose of this article is to develop Saudi Arabia's rail system in order to overcome environmental difficulties and obstacles such as wind-sand flow behavior and other impediments (e.g., camels) by constructing obstructions such as protective walls and dykes. Theoretical analysis is used to investigate the major components that influence wind velocity and density. The wind velocity in the majority of the locations in Saudi Arabia was employed as a control value in this study, which was based on the Saudi building standard SBC301. Sandstorm protection is best achieved by combining four different building solutions, including ditches, dykes, trees, and concrete barriers. The site parameters, such as sand particle size, air velocity, and the required downwind strip distance, all influence which of the four recommended approaches is optimal. From this study, it is concluded that the wind speed at the height of interest (barrier height) should be calculated using wind shear exponents ranging from 0.2 to 0.5 depending on the topography and surface roughness aspects. A new equation based on two parameters, Q1 and n, as a function of the wind shear exponent is suggested to predict the percentage of wind velocity increase (Vinc %) over the barriers. This study found that the protected distance between the downwind strip and the receiver might be anywhere between 20 and 40 m.

AB  - The liver is simultaneously impacted by environmental challenges and modulates the response to these insults. Efforts to understand the effects of stressors on the activity of the liver typically consider one type of challenge (e. g., nutrition, toxin, disease), profile targeted molecules, or study the hepatic disruptions in one sex. The present study characterized hepatic changes in the metabolome of females and males exposed to the nutritional challenge of fasting and inflammatory signals elicited by the viral mimetic Poly(I:C). The hepatic metabolome of pigs was profiled using untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis enabling the quantification of metabolites. The analysis of pathways enriched among metabolites showing sex-by-distress interactions revealed molecular processes affected by fasting and immune stresses in a sex-specific manner, including SLC-mediated transmembrane transport, the urea cycle, and G-protein coupled receptor signaling. Metabolites differentially abundant across sex-distress groups in the previous pathways included creatine, taurine, and glycine derivatives. Pathways over-represented among metabolites significantly affected by distress included glucose homeostasis, the Krebs cycle, and the metabolism of water-soluble vitamins, with key metabolites including S-adenosylmethionine, histidine, glycerophosphocholine, and lactic acid. These results indicate that 24-h fasting, and lowgrade systemic inflammation modulate the liver metabolism. The detection of metabolic disruption that varies with sex enforces the need to develop therapies that can restore hepatic homeostasis in females and males.

AB  - Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), composed of FSH alpha and FSH beta subunits, is essential for female follicle development and male spermatogenesis. The recombinant human FSH (rhFSH) products on the market are mainly generated from mammalian cells and are expensive. Large animal mammary gland bioreactors are urgently needed to produce large amounts of rhFSH. However, there are currently no effective methods to prepare rhFSH by large animals mainly due to the fact that excessive accumulation of FSH might cause many adverse effects in animals. We herein report the development and characterization of functional self-assembled rhFSH produced in goat mammary epithelial cells (GMECs). FSH alpha and FSH beta stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines were secreted into culture medium and well glycosylated. Importantly, FSH alpha and FSH beta expressed apart were able to assemble into functional FSH. We next inserted human FSH alpha or FSH beta gene separately into goat beta-Lactoglobulin locus in GMECs by CRISPR/Cas9. Inactive FSH alpha and FSH beta subunits expressed from GMECs assembled into rhFSH as analyzed by His-tag pull down assay. Functional assessment of rhFSH by cAMP induction assay, mouse ovulation induction and rat ovarian weight gain experiments showed that the bioactivity of self-assembled rhFSH expressed by GMECs was comparable to that of Gonal-F both in vitro and in vivo. Our study demonstrated that FSH alpha and FSH beta can be separately expressed and assembled into functional rhFSH, and provided the basis for future preparing FSH by goat mammary gland bioreactor with less health problems on the producing animals.

AB  - Objective This study aimed to examine the effects of microcirculatory dysfunction and 654-1 intervention after cardiopulmonary resuscitation on myocardial injury. Methods Landrace pigs were divided into a sham operation group (S group, n = 6), ventricular fibrillation control group (VF-C group, n = 8) and 654-1 intervention group (VF-I group, n = 8). Hemodynamics was recorded at baseline, at recovery of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), and 1 h, 2 h, 4 h and 6 h thereafter. Sidestream dark field (SDF) technology was used to evaluate and monitor the microcirculation flow index, total vessel density, perfusion vessel ratio, De-Backer score, and perfusion vessel density in animal viscera at various time points. Results After administration of 654-1 at 1.5 h post-ROSC, the hemodynamics in the VF-I group, as compared with the VF-C group, was significantly improved. The visceral microcirculation detected by SDF was also significantly improved in the VF-I group. As observed through electron microscopy, significantly less myocardial tissue injury was present in the VF-I group than the VF-C group. Conclusion Administration of 654-1 inhibited excessive inflammatory by improving the state of visceral microcirculation.

AB  - Household biogas-digesters are a prospective technique that can help minimal-income rural families to meet their basic energy requirements and enhance their living standards. Nevertheless, due to the cold temperature of the digesters, the biogas generation is decreased and the digestion efficiency is generally low. The current work proposes a solar-greenhouse (SGH) heating technique united with a north wall to heat a semi-buried tubular digester, as a solution. Two similar semi-buried digesters were used in this experiment; one (DA) was heated by a SGH attached to a north wall, while the other (DB) was heated by direct sunlight (without a greenhouse), which used as a control, and both digesters were fed with cattle manure. The average slurry temperature for DA and DB was 24.9 degrees C and 23.45 degrees C, respectively, and both digesters were warmer than the outside air temperature of 22 degrees C. Moreover, there were no appreciable differences in the methane concentration (62.2-62.76%) between the mean specific biogas production of DA and DB, which were 173 and 155.3 L/kg VS, individually. The study showed that using combined SGH technique is enhanced the process of biogas output more than control.

AB  - A recent important paper (Ide, Arthropod-Plant Interact 16:567-581, 2022) reported the experimental testing of two (out of several) of the visual red young leaf anti-herbivory hypotheses: (1) Aposematism by red young leaves; (2) Undermining herbivorous insect camouflage. Ide (Arthropod-Plant Interact 16:567-581, 2022) interpreted his solid experimental results as supporting the aposematic red leaf defence hypothesis, but not supporting the undermining herbivorous insect camouflage. I wish to clarify that because the undermining herbivorous insect camouflage hypothesis has two components: (1) Herbivores refrain from occupying colourful surfaces that do not match their colour; (2) If and when not refraining from occupying them, they are exposed to higher predation and parasitism risks. Thus, Ide's (Arthropod-Plant Interact 16:567-581, 2022) results seem to support both hypotheses, and not only aposematism. Accordingly, Ide's (Arthropod-Plant Interact 16:567-581, 2022) results do support the undermining herbivorous insect camouflage hypothesis, especially by exposing the insects that do not refrain from occupying leaves that do not match their colour to higher predation risks.

AB  - The CA1 region of the hippocampus is one of the most studied regions of the rodent brain, thought to play an important role in cognitive functions such as memory and spatial navigation. Despite a wealth of experimental data on its structure and function, it has been challenging to integrate information obtained from diverse experimental approaches. To address this challenge, we present a community-based, full-scale in silico model of the rat CA1 that integrates a broad range of experimental data, from synapse to network, including the reconstruction of its principal afferents, the Schaffer collaterals, and a model of the effects that acetylcholine has on the system. We tested and validated each model component and the final network model, and made input data, assumptions, and strategies explicit and transparent. The unique flexibility of the model allows scientists to potentially address a range of scientific questions. In this article, we describe the methods used to set up simulations to reproduce in vitro and in vivo experiments. Among several applications in the article, we focus on theta rhythm, a prominent hippocampal oscillation associated with various behavioral correlates and use our computer model to reproduce experimental findings. Finally, we make data, code, and model available through the hippocampushub.eu portal, which also provides an extensive set of analyses of the model and a user-friendly interface to facilitate adoption and usage. This community-based model represents a valuable tool for integrating diverse experimental data and provides a foundation for further research into the complex workings of the hippocampal CA1 region.

AB  - Assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) have significantly advanced, yet the definition and assessment of oocyte quality remain pivotal for successful embryo development. Oocyte quality is influenced by various factors, including lifestyle, age, metabolic status, and exposure to pollutants or medications. Non-invasive techniques to evaluate oocyte quality are limited, and invasive methods are commonly used in research. In vitro maturation (IVM) of oocytes from cows and pigs offers valuable models for human ART due to various similarities, though there are species-specific differences. These IVM and in vitro embryo production (IVEP) systems offer valuable insights into oocyte maturation and early embryo development without use of experimental animals. While bovine IVEP is well established, porcine IVEP has great potential for improvement. The models can be crucial for reproductive biology and biomedical research and can contribute to advancements in areas such as human fertility treatments and toxicity testing. Apart from oocyte quality assessment, there are challenges, such as variability in oocyte quality from slaughterhouse ovaries and the difficulty in mimicking the complex in vivo environment. Emerging technologies, like gene-expression analysis tools, and non-invasive -omics approaches hold promise for overcoming some obstacles by improving precision, sensitivity, and reproducibility in IVEP studies. In this review, we discuss the model in simulating various conditions but with main focus on metabolic challenges and in toxicity screening and aim to give an overview of the current and possible future use of IVM in cows and pigs as a model for the same or other mammalian species, as well as the limitations.
   Sentence The usefulness of in vitro maturation and embryo production in cows and pigs as a model for the same or other mammalian species will continue to increase as techniques for oocyte and embryo assessment are further developed.

AB  - Background A molecular approach for the identification of unknown species by the using mitochondrial cox1 gene is an effective and reliable as compared with morphological-based identification. Hirudinaria manillensis referred to as Asian Buffalo Leech, is found in South Asia and traditionally used as medicine owing to its medicinal properties. Methods and results The study aimed to isolate and identify the leech species using cox1 gene sequencing and their phylogenetic relationships. The nucleotide sequences of cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (cox1) mitochondrial genes were analyzed for species identification and the phylogenetic relationship of crucial therapeutic leech Hirudinaria manillensis. The isolated DNA from the leech sample was amplified with cox1 gene-specific primers. BLAST results with the H. manillensis sequence showed 89.24% homology with H. manillensis and phylogenetic tree analysis revealed the genetic relationship with other GenBank submitted sequences. Conclusion The present study concluded that the cox1 gene could be an effective way to identify the leech H. manillensis and provided sufficient phylogenetic information to distinguish H. manillensis indicating a significant mtDNA-based approach to species identification.

AB  - Endotherms are easily challenged by chronic cold stress. In this study, the development and injury of the small intestine in the Min pig model and Yorkshire pig model under chronic cold stress, and the molecular mechanisms by which glucose supplementation reduces small intestinal mucosal damage were investigated. The results showed that morphological structure lesions of the jejunal mucosa and ileal mucosa were visible in Yorkshire pigs under chronic cold stress. Meanwhile, the Occludin mRNA and protein expression in jejunal mucosa of Yorkshire pigs was decreased. Chronic cold stress enhanced the expression of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), the myeloid differentiation main response 88 (MyD88), nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat protein 3 (NLRP3), cleaved caspase-1, mature-IL-1 beta, and high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB 1) mRNA and protein expression in jejunal mucosa of Yorkshire pigs, whereas the mRNA and protein of Bax was triggered in ileal mucosa. In Min pigs, no such deleterious consequences were observed. Dietary glucose supplementation ameliorates small intestinal mucosal injury, declined TLR4 and MyD88 expression in jejunal mucosa. In conclusion, chronic cold stress induced the small intestinal mucosa damage in Yorkshire pigs, whereas glucose supplementation mitigated the deleterious effects of chronic cold stress on the small intestine.

AB  - Accident tolerant fuels (ATFs) such as FeCrAl cladding have been designed to have improved performance in normal operation and provide increased coping time during design basis accidents (DBA) and beyond DBA. A key aspect in the evaluation of ATF designs is to determine potential increases in the coping time with respect to advancements in fuel and cladding materials. The station blackout (SBO) event has been widely recognized as one of the most severe conditions that a nuclear power plant can experience. In this comparative study, the fuel performance code Bison is utilized to determine the coping time of FeCrAl and Zircaloy claddings under a Short-Term SBO (ST-SBO) accident without any mitigation measures. In particular, four fuel rod burst criteria for Zircaloy cladding and two for FeCrAl cladding are used. It is found that none of the cladding burst criteria are fulfilled, and hoop stress is quite low in this BWR SBO design for both claddings, a stark difference from LOCA or PWR SBO events where high stress burst is common and has been demonstrated widely. Specifically, a new cladding failure mechanism for high temperature and low stress is identified in this study. The origin of the low stress at burst is also investigated.

AB  - Plant defenses allow plants to deter or kill their insect herbivores and are considered to be a major driver of host use for herbivorous insects in both ecological and evolutionary time. Many closely related species of insect herbivores differ in their ability to respond to plant defenses and in some cases are specialized to specific plant species. Here we tested whether both mechanical and chemical plant defenses are a major factor in determining the host range of 2 sibling species of Prodoxid bogus yucca moths, Prodoxus decipiens (Riley) and Prodoxus quinquepunctellus (Chambers) that feed within the inflorescence stalk of Yucca species. These 2 moth species have separate suites of host plant species, yet narrowly overlap geographically and share 1 Yucca species, Y. glauca. We surveyed the lignin and cellulose content, the force required to the puncture the stalk tissue, and saponin concentration across 5 Yucca species used as hosts. Lignin, cellulose concentrations, and stalk hardness differed among Yucca species but did not correlate with host use patterns by the moths. Saponin concentrations in the stalk tissue were relatively low for yuccas (<1%) and did not differ among species. The results suggest that these moth species should be able to use each other's hosts for egg deposition. Additional factors such as larval development or competition among larvae for feeding space may serve to keep moth species from expanding onto plants used by its sibling species.

AB  - Female pigs respond sensitive both to DON and ZEN with anorexia and endocrine disruption, respectively, when critical diet concentrations are exceeded. Therefore, the frequent co-contamination of feed by DON and ZEN requires their parallel inactivation. The additive ZenA hydrolyzes ZEN while SBS inactivates DON through sulfonation. Both supplements were simultaneously added (+, 2.5 g SBS and 100 U ZenA/kg) to a control diet (CON-, 0.04 mg DON and < 0.004 mg ZEN/kg; CON+, 0.03 mg DON and < 0.004 mg ZEN/kg) and a Fusarium toxin contaminated diet (FUS-, 2.57 mg DON and 0.24 mg ZEN/kg; FUS+, 2.04 mg DON and 0.24 mg ZEN/kg). The 4 diets were fed to 20 female weaned piglets each (6 kg initial body weight) for 35 days; the piglets were sacrificed thereafter for collecting samples. Supplements improved performance and modified metabolism and hematology independent of dietary DON contamination. The mechanisms behind these changes could not be clarified and require further consideration. SBS reduced DON concentration in feed by approximately 20% and to the same extent in blood plasma and urine suggesting that no further DON sulfonate formation occurred in the digestive tract before absorbing DON in the upper digestive tract or that additionally formed DON sulfonates escaped absorption. DON sulfonates were detected in feces suggesting that unabsorbed DON sulfonates reached feces and/or that unabsorbed DON was sulfonated in the hindgut. The observed reduction rate of 20% was evaluated to be insufficient for feeding practice. Galenic form of SBS added to dry feed needs to be improved to support the DON sulfonation in the proximal digestive tract.ZenA was active in the digestive tract as demonstrated by the presence of its hydrolyzed none-estrogenic reaction products hydrolyzed ZEN (HZEN) and decarboxylated and hydrolyzed ZEN (DHZEN) both in feces, systemic circulation, and urine of group FUS+ compared to group FUS-. The presence of these hydrolysis products was paralleled by a significant decrease in high-estrogenic ZEN concentrations which, in turn, was related to a decrease in relative weights of uteri and ovaries when compared to group FUS-. Thus, ZenA was proven to be effective; both in terms of biomarkers and biological effects.

AB  - Simple Summary:& nbsp;Parasitism with gastrointestinal nematodes represents a significant risk to the health of livestock populations. Besides the local oxidative damage caused by the parasite, the host reacts by increasing the production of oxidants. The study of thiol-disulphide homeostasis can be of help in the evaluation of the oxidative status of sheep during this type of parasitism. In this study, the thiol-disulphide homeostasis, together with other biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation, were assessed in the serum of lambs infected with gastrointestinal nematodes and were evaluated after 70 days of integrated crop-livestock system and anthelmintic treatment. This study showed that the thiol-disulphide balance was impaired in the infected lambs and the changes were correlated with the parasite load, which therefore could indicate their potential use as a tool to evaluate and monitor the disease in sheep.</p>
   <br></p>
   This work aimed to evaluate the thiol-disulphide homeostasis in serum of lambs naturally infected by gastrointestinal nematodes presenting different levels of parasite load indirectly indicated by faecal worm egg counts (EPG). Furthermore, the possible changes in the thiol-disulphide dynamic after different procedures to reduce the parasitic charge, such as the integrated crop-livestock system or anthelmintic treatment, were assessed. The results were compared with a panel of various oxidative stress and inflammatory biomarkers. The lambs were divided into three groups: animals highly infected (EPG higher than 5000) and packed cell volume (PCV) lower than 24% (G1); animals highly infected (EPG higher than 5000) and normal PCV (> 24%) (G2); and animals presenting EPG lower than 5000 and normal PCV (> 24%) (G3). The highly infected lambs (G1 and G2) showed lower total thiol (TT) and native thiol (SH) (p & LE; 0.01) than those from G3. After treatment, TT and SH increased significantly in all groups (p & LE; 0.01), and the disulphide (SS)/TT and SS/SH ratios decreased significantly (p < 0.01) in G1 and G2. These results show that the thiol-disulphide balance was impaired in lambs infected by gastrointestinal nematodes and that it could be potentially used as a biomarker to monitor this disease.</p>

AB  - Memory formation depends on the selective recruitment of neuronal ensembles into circuits known as engrams, which represent the physical substrate of memory. Sparse encoding of these ensembles is essential for memory specificity and efficiency. AMPA receptor (AMPAR) subunits, particularly GluA1, play a central role in synaptic plasticity, which underpins memory encoding. This study investigates how GluA1 expression influences the recruitment of neurons into memory engrams. Using global GluA1 knockout (GluA1KO) mice, localized knockout models, and contextual fear-conditioning paradigms, we evaluated the role of GluA1 in memory formation and engram sparsity. GluA1KO mice exhibited impaired short-term memory retention but preserved 24-hour contextual memory. Despite this, these mice displayed increased expression of the immediate early gene Arc in hippocampal neurons, indicative of a denser engram network. Electrophysiological analyses revealed reduced synaptic strength in GluA1-deficient neurons, irrespective of Arc expression. Localized GluA1 knockout in the hippocampus confirmed that GluA1 deficiency increases neuronal recruitment into engrams, disrupting the sparse encoding typically observed in wild-type mice. These findings demonstrate that GluA1-containing AMPARs constrain engram size, ensuring selective recruitment of neurons for efficient memory encoding. By regulating synaptic plasticity, GluA1 facilitates both the encoding and size of memory circuits. This study highlights the critical role of GluA1 in maintaining sparse engram formation and provides insight into mechanisms underlying memory deficits in conditions where synaptic composition is altered.

AB  - The genus Dendrodoris is ascribed to the family Dendrodorididae, whose members are characterized lacking spicules in the dorsum as well as a radula, one of the most important taxonomic traits to distinguish and define nudibranch species. The absence of this taxonomic character makes difficult to delineate species based on morphologic traits, and consequently, several cryptic species may remain unreported resulting in a potential underestimation of the real diversity of the genus. Species delimitation analyses based on molecular data constitute an important tool to unveil cryptic species, especially when morphology may be misleading. However, for the genus Dendrodoris, only two molecular studies have been performed to date, both based on Indo-pacific species and the molecular marker COI. In the present study, we performed a multilocus approach using the molecular markers COI, 16S and H3 based on 47 Dendrodoris specimens from the North Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea. As a result, we detected monophyly for five of the previously accepted species plus the presence of an unidentified one. Using morphological and anatomical data from 14 additional individuals and a review of the literature, we verified this unidentified species is the previously synonymized species Dendrodoris temarana Pruvot-Fol, 1953, and we redescribe it morphologically (chromatic pattern, gills, rhinophores and anal papilla), anatomically (neural, circulatory, digestive and reproductive systems), and biologically herein. D. temarana is differentiated by its chromatic pattern, previously thought to be intraspecific variation of D. grandiflora (Rapp, 1827), D. limbata (Cuvier, 1804) and D. herytra Valdes & Ortea in Valdes, Ortea, Avila & Ballesteros, 1996, and therefore it is considered a pseudocryptic species. This study increases the number of valid species in the North Atlantic and Mediterranean to nine and confirms the importance of integrative taxonomic approaches to resolve the identification of cryptic species in complex groups.

AB  - Drug resistance refers to the reduction in the effectiveness of a drug in treating a disease or improving the stability of symptoms. It can occur in various types of pathogens, including bacteria, parasites, viruses, fungi, and cancer cells. This experimental study was conducted between 2018 and 2019 in an area with an annual mean rainfall of 130mm. The sowing date was September 10th, and 2-3 seeds were planted per cell. MTT assays 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide) were used to determine the percentage of viability in adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial cells (A549) and Medical Research Council cell strain 5 (MRC5) cell lines incubated with methanolic extract and valerenic acid for 48 hr. The methanol extract was prepared by adding 1000 mg of rhizomes to 100 mL of methanol, followed by sonication for 30 minutes, stirring, and centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 10 minutes. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and agar gel diffusion were used to assess the antimicrobial activity of the methanol extract of valerian against two important pathogenic microorganisms, Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans. However, valerenic acid did not reveal antimicrobial activity at doses of 200, 100, 50, 25, 12.5, and 6.25 mu g/mL. The methanolic extract of V. officinalis contains high quantities of sesquiterpenes, specifically valerenic acid, which did not show cytotoxic effects on A549 and MRC5 cell lines as assessed by the MTT assay. In vivo evaluation of the extract in mice and guinea pigs did not reveal any toxic effects based on histopathological and clinical symptom assessments. Our study confirms that Valeriana officinalis has dose-dependent potential to improve existing treatment approaches for Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans infections.

AB  - Hematopoiesis is a complex physiological process that ensures renewal of blood cells to maintain normal blood circulation and immune function. Wujin pigs exhibit distinct characteristics such as tender meat, high fat storage, strong resistance to roughage, robust disease resistance, and oxidation resistance. Therefore, using Wujin pigs as models may offer valuable insights for hematopoietic-related studies. In this study, twelve healthy 35-day-old piglets, including six Wujin and six Duroc piglets of similar weight, were selected from each of the Wujin and Duroc pig groups and housed in single cages. After 30 days of feeding, blood and bone marrow samples were collected. Routine blood indices and hematopoietic-related serum biochemical indexes of Wujin and Duroc pigs were determined, and bone marrow gene expression levels were analyzed using transcriptomics. (1) Hemoglobin (Hb) and Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC) levels in Wujin pigs were significantly higher than in Duroc pigs (p < 0.05), and platelet counts and serum Hb levels in Wujin pigs were significantly lower than in Duroc pigs (p < 0.05). (2) A total of 312 significantly differentially expressed genes were identified between the pigs. Their functions were mainly related to blood systems, inflammation, and oxidation. Six differentially expressed genes may be related to hematopoietic function. (3) By combining the differential genes screened through sequencing with Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis results, 16 hematopoietic function differential genes were obtained, mainly focusing on immunity, inflammation, and induction of apoptosis functions. Differences were present in the immune and inflammatory responses between Wujin pigs and Duroc pigs, suggesting that differences in hematopoietic function between the two breeds were related to antioxidant capacity and disease resistance.

AB  - Domatia are hollow structures in plants occupied by ant colonies, in turn ants provide protection against herbivores. In plants, competition for resources has driven sex-related changes in the patterns of resource allocation to life-history traits and defence traits. The resource-competition hypothesis (RCH) proposes that female plants due to their higher investment in reproduction will allocate fewer resources to defence production, showing greater herbivore damage than other sexual forms. We hypothesise the existence of sex-related differences in defensive traits of domatia-bearing plants, being female plants less defended due to differences in domatia traits, such as size, number of domatia and their position, exhibiting more herbivore damage than hermaphrodite plants of Myriocarpa longipes, a facultative neotropical myrmecophyte. We found eight species of ants inhabiting domatia; some species co-inhabited the same plant, even the same branch. Our results are consistent with the predictions of RCH, as female plants had ant-inhabited domatia restricted to the middle position of their branches and exhibited greater herbivore damage in leaves than hermaphrodites. However, we did not find differences in domatia size and leaf area between sexual forms. Our study provides evidence for intersexual differences in domatia position and herbivory in a facultative ant-plant mutualism in M. longipes. We highlight the importance of considering the plant sex in ant-plant interactions. Differences in resource allocation related to sexual reproduction could influence the outcome of ant-plant interactions.

AB  - Simple Summary Increasing the proportion of concentrate in the diet is a common strategy to improve the performance of ruminants. However, this may lead to abnormal rumen fermentation, which is a threat to animal health. As a green feed additive, yeast product (YP) is often used to regulate rumen fermentation and maintain animal health, but its mechanism of action on ruminants is unclear. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of YP (yeast culture + yeast live cells) on rumen fermentation parameters, abnormal metabolites and microbiota in sheep. Our findings suggest that YP can improve rumen fermentation parameters, change the activity of rumen digestive enzymes and reduce the concentration of abnormal metabolites. In addition, we found that YP significantly changed the relative abundance of microorganisms attached to rumen feed particles and affected microbial function. This study provides new insights into the regulation mechanism of feed additives on rumen fermentation and improves our understanding of YP on rumen fermentation regulation. Yeast products (YP) are commonly used as rumen regulators, but their mechanisms of action are still unclear. Based on our previous studies, we questioned whether yeast products would have an impact on rumen solid-associated (SA) and liquid-associated (LA) microorganisms and alter rumen fermentation patterns. Thirty 3-month-old male sheep weighing 19.27 +/- 0.45 kg were selected and randomized into three groups for 60 days: (1) basal diet group (CON group), (2) basal diet add 20 g YP per day (low YP, LYP group) and (3) basal diet add 40 g YP per day (high YP, HYP group). The results demonstrated that the addition of YP increased rumen cellulase activity, butyrate and total volatile fatty acid (TVFA) concentrations (p < 0.05), while it decreased rumen amylase activity and abnormal metabolites, such as lactate, lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and histamine (HIS) (p < 0.05). Metagenomic analysis of rumen microorganisms in three groups revealed that YP mainly influenced the microbial profiles of the SA system. YP increased the relative abundance of R. flavefaciens and decreased methanogens in the SA system (p < 0.05). With the addition of YP, the abundance of only a few lactate-producing bacteria increased in the SA system, including Streptococcus and Lactobacillus (p < 0.05). However, almost all lactate-utilizing bacteria increased in the LA system, including Megasphaera, Selenomonas, Fusobacterium and Veillonella (p < 0.05). In addition, YP increased the abundance of certain GHs family members, including GH43 and GH98 (p < 0.05), but decreased the abundance of some KEGG metabolic pathways involved in starch and sucrose metabolism, biosynthesis of antibiotics and purine metabolism, among others. In conclusion, the addition of YP to high-concentrate diets can change the abundance of major functional microbiota in the rumen, especially in the solid fraction, which in turn affects rumen fermentation patterns and improves rumen digestibility.

AB  - Simple Summary Herbivorous insects and their host plants have a long history of co-evolution. Plants produce specialized morphological structures known as trichomes, which may be involved in the antibiosis and antixenosis traits of the host plant when interacting with insect herbivores. The host plant also produces chemicals that may act as a repellent or antifeedant to reduce infestation by herbivores. Several studies over the last few decades have revealed that trichomes perform an important role in plants' defense against herbivores. However, little information is available on the physical and chemical defense of indigenous and commercial Thai rice varieties against major pests such as the brown planthopper (BPH). In this study, we found a negative relationship between the density of prickle trichomes and the BPH infestation level. The volatile organic compound (VOC) emission profiles from rice plants indicated that beta-Sesquiphellandrene induced by BPH possibly repelled BPH. Plant trichomes generally act as a physical defense against herbivore attacks and are present in a variety of plants, including rice plants. This research examined the physical and chemical defenses of rice plants against the brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens (Stal) (Hemiptera: Delphacidae). A total of 10 rice varieties were used in this study. An electron microscope was used to observe trichomes. Constitutive and induced volatile compound profiles were assessed using GC-MS analyses. The preference of BPH for volatiles from the 10 rice plants was tested using a two-choice arena olfactometer system. The density of prickle trichomes had a negative relationship with the BPH injury level. Without BPH infestation, the volatile of the most resistant rice variety (Rathu Heenati (RH)) was preferred by BPH than those of the other varieties, with the exception of Gled Plah Chawn. However, the relative BPH preference for volatiles from the RH variety decreased during BPH infestation. When rice plants were infested by BPH, the numbers of VOCs and these quantities decreased. In the RH variety, the emission of essentities found without BPH infestation ceased during infestation by BPH. During the BPH infestation, rice plants started to emit new VOCs that were not detected before the BPH infestation started. In conclusion, we discovered that rice plants defended against BPH by changing VOC components during BPH infestation and beta-Sesquiphellandrene was likely the most effective component.

AB  - Simple Summary In laboratory animal research, many procedures and tests will be stressful for the animals, as they are forced to participate. Training animals to voluntarily participate using reward-based training such as clicker training or luring may reduce levels of stress, and thereby increase animal welfare. Clicker training is traditionally used in zoos, aquariums, and with pets to train the animals to cooperate during medical procedures, whereas in experimental research, luring seems to be the preferred training method. This descriptive case study aims to present the behaviour of clicker trained and lured pigs when they are subjected to a potentially fear- and stress-evoking behavioural test-the novel task participation test-in which the pigs must walk a short runway with a novel walking surface. All eight trained pigs voluntarily participated and only one of the lured pigs showed a behaviour indicating decreased welfare. Hence, training pigs to cooperate during experimental procedures resulted in a smooth completion of the task with no signs of fear or anxiety in seven out of eight animals, and we thus suggest that training laboratory pigs prior to experimental procedures or tests should always be done to ensure low stress levels. In laboratory animal research, many procedures will be stressful for the animals, as they are forced to participate. Training animals to cooperate using clicker training (CT) or luring (LU) may reduce stress levels, and thereby increase animal welfare. In zoo animals, aquarium animals, and pets, CT is used to train animals to cooperate during medical procedures, whereas in experimental research, LU seem to be the preferred training method. This descriptive case study aims to present the behaviour of CT and LU pigs in a potentially fear-evoking behavioural test-the novel task participation test-in which the pigs walked a short runway on a novel walking surface. All eight pigs voluntarily participated, and only one LU pig showed body stretching combined with lack of tail wagging indicating reduced welfare. All CT pigs and one LU pig displayed tail wagging during the test, indicating a positive mental state. Hence, training pigs to cooperate during experimental procedures resulted in a smooth completion of the task with no signs of fear or anxiety in seven out of eight animals. We suggest that training laboratory pigs prior to experimental procedures or tests should be done to ensure low stress levels.

AB  - Simple Summary Understanding the genetic basis of animal growth and heat tolerance is essential if genetic enhancement technologies are employed to promote these traits. This study examined potential genes and economic factors that might be associated with growth and heat tolerance in two sheep breeds. In total, 120 male lambs of the Barki and Aboudeleik breeds, 60 of each breed, were used in this investigation. Lambs from Barki have much better growth traits than those from Aboudeleik. PCR-DNA sequencing of the growth and heat tolerance genes revealed SNPs in the nucleotide sequences between Barki and Aboudeleik lambs. The discovered SNPs were found to significantly associate with growth and heat tolerance traits. Lambs from Barki had a better economy than those from Aboudeleik. This study explored the potential genes and economic factors that might be associated with growth and heat tolerance in two sheep breeds. Data on growth performance from the third month to six months of age were obtained based on records. In comparison to Aboudeleik lambs, Barki lambs developed considerably greater starting body weight, final body weight, final body weight gain, daily weight gain, and percentage increase in BW/month. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were found between lambs of the two breeds using PCR-DNA sequencing of CAST, LEP, MYLK4, MEF2B, STAT5A, TRPV1, HSP90AB1, HSPB6, HSF1, ST1P1, and ATP1A1 genes. Lambs from each breed were divided into groups based on detected SNPs in genes related to growth. The least squares means of the differentiated groups revealed a significant correlation of detected SNPs with growth and heat tolerance attributes (p <= 0.05). Barki lambs elicited greater total variable costs, total costs, total return, and net return values. The Barki sheep provided the best economic efficiency value when comparing the percentage difference between net profit and economic efficiency. Together with economic considerations, SNPs found may be used as proxies for marker-assisted selection of the best breed of sheep for traits related to growth and heat tolerance.

AB  - Gastric chemosensing and gastric acid secretion affect nutrient utilization. Dietary peptides influence intestinal amino acid utilization, yet their regulation of gastric chemosensing and gastric acid secretion remains unknown. Herein, a pig model was employed to study the gastric response to dietary peptide-enriched casein hydrolysate versus intact casein. A total of 16 crossbred pigs (Duroc x Landrace x Yorkshire; 19.09 +/- 0.61 kg; 63 +/- 2 days of age) were randomly assigned to either an intact casein supplementation diet (n = 8) or a hydrolyzed casein supplementation diet (n = 8) for 28 days. Results showed that casein hydrolysate increased hydrochloric acid concentrations, parietal cell numbers, and H+-K+-ATPase activities in the stomach. Gastric chemosensing was upregulated, as indicated by the increased expression of peptide and amino acid chemosensors (G Protein-Coupled Receptor 92 and Calcium-Sensing Receptor) in the dorsum of the tongue, gastric corpus, and antrum. Signaling pathways involved in gastric acid secretion were also enhanced by casein hydrolysate, including extracellular stimuli (histamine, gastrin, and acetylcholine), their receptors, and intracellular signaling molecules. The upregulated gastric acid secretion was accompanied by lower amino acid concentrations in the gastric digesta and increased pepsin activity. These results demonstrate that casein hydrolysate enhances gastric chemosensing and gastric acid secretion, providing a promising nutritional strategy for regulating amino acid digestion.

AB  - A study was conducted for 90 days in two cycles on 45thday (Cycle I), and 90th day (Cycle II) in 144 vermibins with precomposted cow dung (T1), elephant dung (T2), cow dung + elephant dung (T3) in combination with leaf substrates of Ficus religiosa, Azadirachta indica, Terminalia catappa, Carica papaya, Vitex negundo, Acalypha indica and Borassus flabellifer to generate nutrient-enriched vermicompost. Different vermibin feedstock materials were retained as experimental setup in other substrates with earthworm (vermicompost) and without earthworm (compost). This method was employed in the current study to decompose environmental leaf debris into the earthworm's mass production and transform it into high-value manure for long-term soil fertility control. The majority of the substrates exhibit pH and electrical conductivity in vermicomposts showed an increment while the total organic carbon and carbon to nitrogen ratio were significantly lowered. A prominent percentage increment of total NPK contents (P < 0.05) in vermicompost over initial values (N: 7.09-164.03; P: 4.39-101.09; K: 0.45-84.10). Among the vermibed substrates, Ficus religiosa leaf litter mixed with T3 showed stabilized co-coons and juveniles in Cycle I (45 days), while sub-adults and adults growth was favored in Cycle II (90 days). The higher reproductive potential of earthworms could be due to the composition and palatability of the sub-strate combination. This study provides a platform for utilizing leaf wastes in combination with animal wastes amended to reproduce earthworms, nutrient enrichment which could benefit soil fertility improvement.

AB  - The ability to efficiently introduce site-specific genetic modifications to the mammalian genome has been dramatically improved with the use of the CRISPR/Cas9 system. CRISPR/Cas9 is a powerful tool used to generate genetic modifications by causing double-strand breaks (DSBs) in DNA. Artemis (ART; also known as DCLRE1C), is a nuclear protein and is essential for DSB end joining in DNA repair via the canonical non-homologous end joining (c-NHEJ) pathway. In this work, we tested whether ART deficiency affects DNA repair following CRISPR/Cas9 induced DSBs in somatic cells. We also demonstrated the effect of microinjection timing on embryo developmental ability and gene targeting efficiency of CRISPR/Cas9 system to disrupt the interleukin 2 receptor subunit gamma (IL2RG) locus using porcine in vitro fertilization (IVF) and somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) derived embryos. In comparison to non-injected controls, CRISPR/Cas9 injection of IVF derived zygotes at 4 h and 8 h after fertilization did not impact cleavage and blastocyst rate. Gene modification rate was observed to be higher, 53.3% (9/16) in blastocysts injected 4 h post-fertilization as compared to 11.1% (1/9) in blastocysts injected 8 h post-fertilization. Microinjection 8 h after chemical activation of SCNT derived embryos decreased blastocyst development rate compared to non-injected controls but showed a higher gene modification efficiency of 66.7% as compared to 25% in the 4 h post-activation injection group. Furthermore, we observed that male ART(-/- )and ART(+/-) porcine fetal fibroblast (pFF) cells showed lower modification rates (2.5% and 1.9%, respectively) as compared to the ART intact cell line (8.3%). Interestingly, the female ART (-/- ) and ART(+/-) pFF cells had modification rates (4.2% and 10.1%, respectively) similar to those seen in the ART intact cells. This study demonstrates the complex effect of various parameters such as microinjection timing and ART deficiency on gene editing efficiency in in vitro derived porcine embryos.

AB  - Research in recent years has shown that some species of predatory mites, considered to be typically associated with soil and litter, can also be found on plants. Such species include Blattisocius mali, which is an effective predator of acarid mites, nematodes and the eggs of moths and which can disperse by means of drosophilid fruit flies. Apart from soil and litter or storage, it has also been recorded on the bark of apple trees and the leaves of strawberries, thus suggesting its possible predation of/feeding on herbivorous mites and insects. Our goal was to examine whether B. mali could consume different development stages of two polyphagous herbivores, the two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae, and the western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis, as well as the drosophilid fruit fly Drosophila hydei. In 24 h cage tests, single, starved B. mali females consumed all types of prey offered, i.e., the eggs, males and females of spider mites; the first-instar larvae and prepupae of thrips; and the eggs and first-instar larvae of fruit flies. The potential for B. mali to prey upon these insects and mites was confirmed. However, to estimate whether it can also effectively reduce their population, additional tests on the predator's survival, fecundity and prey preference are needed.

AB  - Main conclusion Cultivated tomatoes harboring the plastid-derived sesquiterpenes from S. habrochaites have altered type-VI trichome morphology and unveil additional genetic components necessary for piercing-sucking pest resistance. Arthropod resistance in the tomato wild relative Solanum habrochaites LA1777 is linked to specific sesquiterpene biosynthesis. The Sesquiterpene synthase 2 (SsT2) gene cluster on LA1777 chromosome 8 controls plastid-derived sesquiterpene synthesis. The main genes at SsT2 are Z-prenyltransferase (zFPS) and Santalene and Bergamotene Synthase (SBS), which produce alpha-santalene, beta-bergamotene, and alpha-bergamotene in LA1777 round-shaped type-VI glandular trichomes. Cultivated tomatoes have mushroom-shaped type-VI trichomes with much smaller glands that contain low levels of monoterpenes and cytosolic-derived sesquiterpenes, not presenting the same pest resistance as in LA1777. We successfully transferred zFPS and SBS from LA1777 to cultivated tomato (cv. Micro-Tom, MT) by a backcrossing approach. The trichomes of the MT-Sst2 introgressed line produced high levels of the plastid-derived sesquiterpenes. The type-VI trichome internal storage-cavity size increased in MT-Sst2, probably as an effect of the increased amount of sesquiterpenes, although it was not enough to mimic the round-shaped LA1777 trichomes. The presence of high amounts of plastid-derived sesquiterpenes was also not sufficient to confer resistance to various tomato piercing-sucking pests, indicating that the effect of the sesquiterpenes found in the wild S. habrochaites can be insect specific. Our results provide for a better understanding of the morphology of S. habrochaites type-VI trichomes and paves the way to obtain insect-resistant tomatoes.

AB  - Innate fear-related behavioral responses have evolved as strategies for survival.
   The neural circuits responsible for defensive responses, studied mainly in rodents, have been substantially preserved across evolution.
   Amygdala collects sensory information (visual, auditory and olfactory) in the cortical division and conveys it to the striatal output division. Distinct amygdala nuclei/subnuclei are activated by different fearful stimuli, such as exposure to a predator or to an aggressive conspecific. The same stimuli segregation is observed in downstream structures, i.e., hypothalamus and PAG.
   In guinea pigs, the circuits underlying Tonic Immobility (TI) and freezing in response to a natural predator, have been mapped in different subnuclei of the same amygdala area.
   In the PAG circuits, defensive responses are differentially represented along the dorsoventral and rostro-caudal axis. The coordination of behavioral, anti-nociceptive and autonomic responses is due to the overlapping of the involved neurons in longitudinal columns.

AB  - Background Studies of parasite communities and patterns in the Antarctic are an important knowledge base with the potential to track shifts in ecological relations and study the effects of climate change on host-parasite systems. Endemic Nototheniinae is the dominant fish group found in Antarctic marine habitats. Through their intermediate position within the food web, Nototheniinae link lower to higher trophic levels and thereby also form an important component of parasite life cycles. The study was set out to gain insight into the parasite fauna of Nototheniops larseni, N. nudifrons and Lepidonotothen squamifrons (Nototheniinae) from Elephant Island (Antarctica). Methods Sampling was conducted at three locations around Elephant Island during the ANT-XXVIII/4 expedition of the research vessel Polarstern. The parasite fauna of three Nototheniine species was analysed, and findings were compared to previous parasitological and ecological research collated from a literature review. Results All host species shared the parasites Neolebouria antarctica (Digenea), Corynosoma bullosum (Acanthocephala) and Pseudoterranova decipiens E (Nematoda). Other parasite taxa were exclusive to one host species in this study. Nototheniops nudifrons was infected by Ascarophis nototheniae (Nematoda), occasional infections of N. larseni with Echinorhynchus petrotschenkoi (Acanthocephala) and L. squamifrons with Elytrophalloides oatesi (Digenea) and larval tetraphyllidean Cestoda were detected. Conclusion All examined fish species' parasites were predominantly euryxenous regarding their fish hosts. The infection of Lepidonotothen squamifrons with Lepidapedon garrardi (Digenea) and Nototheniops larseni with Echinorhynchus petrotschenkoi represent new host records. Despite the challenges and limited opportunities for fishing in remote areas, future studies should continue sampling on a more regular basis and include a larger number of fish species and sampling sites within different habitats.

AB  - African swine fever (ASF) is considered as one of the most threatening diseases for the pig farming industry all over the world. Due to the lack of an effective vaccine, organized farms and backyard rearing must strictly enforce control measures in order to combat the disease. The present report describes the ASF epidemic in a piggery in Uttar Pradesh state, India. The pathological samples were collected from the affected pigs and processed for histopathological and molecular studies. Gross lesions comprised of cyanosis of ear pinna, multi-focal hemorrhagic spots on ventral abdomen and inner aspect of thigh, highly congested mesenteric lymph nodes with marbling, marked congestion, hemorrhages and splenomegaly, interstitial pneumonia, and multi-focal endocardial hemorrhages on papillary muscles and wall of ventricle in heart. Histopathological investigation revealed marked congestion and hemorrhages of mesenteric lymph node, liver and spleen. Depletion of lymphocytes from the splenic white pulp was visible in the splenic parenchyma. The virus was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction and phylogenetic analysis revealed a distinct clustering of the Uttar Pradesh virus isolates from Vietnam with other Ib group isolates, indicating a close genetic relationship between these samples. Additionally, the mutant Chinese virus isolate showed clear genetic differences with the Vietnamese Ib group, confirming its suitability as an out-group for comparison. The study represents the first report of ASF outbreak in North India, establishing the phylogenetic relationship between ASF virus circulating in the study area and other regions.

AB  - Babesia is a diverse genus of piroplasms that parasitize the red blood cells of a wide variety of mammals and avian species, including humans. There is a lack of knowledge on the Babesia species of carnivores and mesomammals in the eastern United States and the potential impacts of these species on the health of humans and domestic animals. We surveyed 786 wild mammals in the eastern United States by testing blood, spleen, and heart samples with PCR targeting the 18S rRNA region of apicomplexan parasites. We also performed PCR targeting the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 ( cox1) region of each unique clade identified with 18S rRNA sequencing. We found a high positivity of Babesia spp. infection in raccoons ( Procyon lotor), foxes ( Vulpes vulpes and Urocyon cinereoargenteus), and striped skunks ( Mephitis mephitis), and low positivity in Virginia opossums ( Didelphis virginiana). No Babesia infections were detected in coyotes ( Canis latrans), black bears ( Ursus americanus), groundhogs ( Marmota monax), muskrats ( Ondatra zibethicus), or mink ( Neovison vison). Skunks carried a diverse number of strains including a potential novel species of Babesia related to B. gibsoni, a strain closely related to a B. microti-like species known to cause disease in river otters, as well as a separate B. microti-like strain. Raccoons primarily carried B. microti-like strains, though there was a high diversity of sequences including Babesia lotori, Babesia sensu stricto MA230, and Babesia sp. 'Coco.' Foxes exclusively carried B. vulpes. In addition to Babesia spp., a high positivity of Hepatozoon spp. infection was found in mink, while low positivity was found in raccoons and muskrats. Wildlife in the eastern United States carry a diverse range of Babesia species including several novel strains of unknown clinical significance.

AB  - Simple Summary Sow reproductive performance is crucial in the entire pig industry. However, the heritability of reproductive traits is slowthat it is difficult to make great genetic progress by traditional breeding methods. Therefore, in this study, we performed genome-wide association analyses of litter traits in French White sows to explore genes related to sow reproductive traits and we finally detected a notable region (10.72-11.06 Mb on chromosome 7) and four promising genes (JARID2, PDIA6, FLRT2 and DICER1). The results of this study provide a theoretical basis for subsequent molecular breeding. The reproductive traits of sows are one of the important economic traits in pig production, and their performance directly affects the economic benefits of the entire pig industry. In this study, a total of 895 French Large White pigs were genotyped by GeneSeek Porcine 50K SNP Beadchip and four phenotypic traits of 1407 pigs were recorded, including total number born (TNB), number born alive (NBA), number healthy piglets (NHP) and litter weight born alive (LWB). To identify genomic regions and genes for these traits, we used two approaches: a single-locus genome-wide association study (GWAS) and a single-step GWAS (ssGWAS). Overall, a total of five SNPs and 36 genomic regions were identified by single-locus GWAS and ssGWAS, respectively. Notably, fourof all five significant SNPs were located in 10.72-11.06 Mb on chromosome 7, were also identified by ssGWAS. These regions explained the highest or second highest genetic variance in the TNB, NBA and NHP traits and harbor the protein coding gene ENSSSCG00000042180. In addition, several candidate genes associated with litter traits were identified, including JARID2, PDIA6, FLRT2 and DICER1. Overall, these novel results reflect the polygenic genetic architecture of the litter traits and provide a theoretical reference for the following implementation of molecular breeding.

TI  - Efficient Detection Method of Pig-Posture Behavior Based on Multiple Attention Mechanism
T2  - COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE
LA  - English
AB  - Due to the low detection precision and poor robustness, the traditional pig-posture and behavior detection method is difficult to apply in the complex pig captivity environment. In this regard, we designed the HE-Yolo (High-effect Yolo) model, which improves the Darknet-53 feature extraction network and integrates DAM (Dual attention mechanism) of channel attention mechanism and space attention mechanism, to recognize the posture behaviors of the enclosure pigs in real-time. First, the pig data set is clustered and optimized by the K-means algorithm to obtain a new anchor frame size. Second, the DSC (Depthwise separable convolution) and h-switch activation function are innovatively introduced into the Darknet-53 feature extraction network, and the C-Res (Contrary residual structure) unit is designed to build Darknet-A feature extraction network, so as to avoid network gradient explosion and ensure the integrity of feature information. Subsequently, DAM integrating the spatial attention mechanism and the channel attention mechanism is established, and it is further combined with the Incep-abate module to form DAB (Dual attention block), and HE-Yolo is finally built by Darknet-A and DAB. A total of 2912 images of 46 enclosure pigs are divided into the training set, the veri-cation set, and the test set according to the ratio of 14 : 3:3, and the recognition performance of HE-Yolo is verified according to the parameters of the precision P, the recall R, the AP (i.e., the area of P-R curve) and the MAP (i.e., the average value of AP). The experiment results show that the AP values of HE-Yolo reach 99.25%, 98.41%, 94.43%, and 97.63%, respectively, in the recognition of four pig-posture behaviors of standing, sitting, prone and sidling of the test set. Compared with other models such as Yolo v3, SSD, and faster R-CNN, the mAP value of HE-Yolo is increased by 5.61%, 4.65%, and 0.57%, respectively, and the single-frame recognition time of HE-Yolo is only 0.045 s. In the recognition of images with foreign body occlusion and pig adhesion, the mAP values of HE-Yolo are increased by 4.04%, 4.94%, and 1.76%, respectively, while compared with other models. Under different lighting conditions, the mAP value of HE-Yolo is also higher than that of other models. The experimental results show that HE-Yolo can recognize the pig-posture behaviors with high precision, and it shows good generalization ability and luminance robustness, which provides technical support for the recognition of pig-posture behaviors and real-time monitoring of physiological health of the enclosure pigs.

TI  - Inverse modelling of carbonyl sulfide: implementation, evaluation and implications for the global budget
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
LA  - English
AB  - Carbonyl sulfide (COS) has the potential to be used as a climate diagnostic due to its close coupling to the biospheric uptake of CO2 and its role in the formation of stratospheric aerosol. The current understanding of the COS budget, however, lacks COS sources, which have previously been allocated to the tropical ocean. This paper presents a first attempt at global inverse modelling of COS within the 4dimensional variational data-assimilation system of the TM5 chemistry transport model (TM5-4DVAR) and a comparison of the results with various COS observations. We focus on the global COS budget, including COS production from its precursors carbon disulfide (CS2) and dimethyl sulfide (DMS). To this end, we implemented COS uptake by soil and vegetation from an updated biosphere model (Simple Biosphere Model - SiB4). In the calculation of these fluxes, a fixed atmospheric mole fraction of 500 pmol mol(-1) was assumed. We also used new inventories for anthropogenic and biomass burning emissions. The model framework is capable of closing the COS budget by optimizing for missing emissions using NOAA observations in the period 2000-2012. The addition of 432 Gg a(-1) (as S equivalents) of COS is required to obtain a good fit with NOAA observations. This missing source shows few year-to-year variations but considerable seasonal variations. We found that the missing sources are likely located in the tropical regions, and an overestimated biospheric sink in the tropics cannot be ruled out due to missing observations in the tropical continental boundary layer. Moreover, high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere require extra COS uptake or reduced emissions. HIPPO (HIAPER Pole-to-Pole Observations) aircraft observations, NOAA airborne profiles from an ongoing monitoring programme and several satellite data sources are used to evaluate the optimized model results. This evaluation indicates that COS mole fractions in the free troposphere remain underestimated after optimization. Assimilation of HIPPO observations slightly improves this model bias, which implies that additional observations are urgently required to constrain sources and sinks of COS. We finally find that the biosphere flux dependency on the surface COS mole fraction (which was not accounted for in this study) may substantially lower the fluxes of the SiB4 biosphere model over strong-uptake regions. Using COS mole fractions from our inversion, the prior biosphere flux reduces from 1053 to 851 Gg a(-1), which is closer to 738 Gg a(-1) as was found by Berry et al. (2013). In planned further studies we will implement this biosphere dependency and additionally assimilate satellite data with the aim of better separating the role of the oceans and the biosphere in the global COS budget.

AB  - Plant defensins (gamma-thionins) are antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) constituting the host defense system. They are known to interact with the cell membranes to exhibit antifungal and antibacterial activity. Though defensin genes are inducible under biotic and abiotic stress, their involvement in insect herbivore defense is not well studied. In this work we studied the phylogeny, structural diversity, biochemical and functional properties of defensins from Capsicum annuum L with particular emphasis on their interaction with insect and fungal pathogens. Phylogenetic analysis of defensin peptides from Solanaceae, Pinaceae, Fabaceae, Asteraceae, Brassicaceae and similar peptides from invertebrates divided them into ten groups and Capsicum peptides were represented in most of them. Three thionin (CanThio-1, -2, -3) and two defensin (CanDef-20, -21) genes isolated from the flowers of Capsicum annuum were cloned and recombinant proteins were expressed. The mature peptide amino acid sequences of CanThio and CanDef were 54-75 aa with 21.82 to 73.81% similarity. They contained the conserved features of defensin peptides like the gamma core region and the presence of eight cysteine residues. Predicted structural alignment indicated that CanThio and CanDef had structural diversity and structurally unaligned loop regions.
   The recombinant CanThio and CanDef inhibited 5% - 65% Aspergillus oryzae amylase activity at 20 mu M and similar to 20% of Helicoverpa armigera gut amylase activity at 50 mu M peptide concentrations. CanThio-2 displayed bovine trypsin inhibition (similar to 14%) while all the CanThio and CanDef inhibited similar to 20% of H. armigera gut proteinase activity at 20 mu M. H. armigera larvae fed on an artificial diet incorporated with recombinant CanThio-2 and CanDef-20 (125 mu g/ml) exhibited a 15% reduction in larval mass and 13% reduction in pupal mass. The CanThio and CanDef peptides also exhibited antifungal properties against pathogenic fungus Fusarium oxysporum at 5 mu g/ml, where CanThio-2 and CanDef-20 showed the strongest activity, which may be attributed to the positively charged amino acids in the gamma-core region.
   We conclude that despite having relatively similar conserved three-dimensional structures CanThio and CanDef display functional variability, which can be utilized for enhancing insect and fungal resistance in plants.

AB  - Biomass waste is a desirable additive in livestock feces biochar preparation due to its easy access, better moisture adjustment, and abundant organic content. In the present study, co-pyrolysis of livestock feces (PM: pig manure, CM: chicken manure) and biomass wastes (WC: wood chips, BS: bamboo sawdust, RH: rice husk, and CH: chaff) with different blending ratios was conducted at 600 degrees C to investigate the biochar characteristic and Cu/Zn immobilization performances. The results showed that WC and BS have more significant effect on the increase in fixed carbon content and heating value and the decrease in ash content of biochar. The biochar with lower pH and electrical conductivity is obtained from co-pyrolysis of manure with RH and CH. Compared with CM-based biochar, PM-based biochar presented better potential as fuel and soil remediation considering the higher heating value and lower aromatic H/C ratio. Specially, the residual fractions of Cu and Zn in PM biochar increased from 73.09% and 65.54% to 90.68% and 72.31% after 10 wt% BS addition and those in CM biochar increased from 81.07% and 73.57% to 88.87% and 84.11% after 10 wt% WC addition, which induced the lowest environmental risk of biochar. This work provided a strategy and direction for targeted enhancement in biochar characteristics with selective biomass addition during manure pyrolysis, which is beneficial to the local treatment and utilization of farm wastes.

AB  - ASFV is the only known double-stranded insect-borne DNA virus, which can rapidly infect domestic pigs and wild boars with ticks as transmission medium. Since it was first discovered in 1921, it quickly spread to all parts of the world and brought huge economic losses to the pig industry all over the world. At present, there is still no safe and effective vaccine for ASFV. Here, we developed a quantum-dot labeled antibody test strip for the detection of antibodies against ASFV pp62. The pp62 protein was labeled with quantum dots, and the antibody test strip was developed uses it in a detection mode of labeled antigen-SPA interceptor-monoclonal antibody quality control. The test strip showed high sensitivity, the positive detection limit of the strip was 1: 10(6) by continuous multiple dilution using the positive standard serum of ASFV antibody as reference. The test strip showed good specificity, and there was no cross reaction with other swine diseases virus (PCV2, PRRSV, CSFV, PPV). Using the detection results of commercialized kit for African swine fever virus as reference, 80 ASFV antibody negative serum and 4 different ASFV antibody positive serum were detected using the ASFV pp62 quantum-dot labeled antibody test strip. The results were consistent with the commercial kit. This study provides a new detection method for the prevention and control of African swine fever.

AB  - Simple Summary Cystic echinococcosis is a world-wide zoonotic disease of food animals and humans. The disease negatively impacts food production, causes socio-economic hardship and is an animal welfare concern. Here, we identified and deployed a potential candidate antigen, iEg67 kDa crude antigen, for ELISA kit development that improved diagnostics for cystic echinococcosis in both cattle and buffalo, with 100% sensitivity and 93.8% specificity. The next steps are to validate and optimize this 67 kDa protein-based ELISA kit for sero-diagnosis of cystic echinococcosis in other species of food animals. Cystic echinococcosis (hydatidosis) is a world-wide zoonotic disease of mainly humans, livestock and dogs, caused by Echinococcus granulosus. The disease can negatively impact food production and animal welfare and causes socio-economic hardship. Here, we aimed to identify the local bovine hydatid cyst fluid (BHCF) antigen for developing a sero-diagnostic assay to be used for the pre-slaughter screening of food animals. In total, 264 bovines approved for slaughter in Pakistan were subjected to serum collection and post-mortem screening for hydatid cysts. These cysts were assessed microscopically to assess fertility and viability, and by PCR for molecular confirmation of species. A BHCF antigen was identified from positive sera via SDS-PAGE, confirmed by Western blot, and quantified via a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay. The quantified crude BHCF antigen (iEg67 kDa) was then used in ELISA screening to test all sera collected from known positive and negative animals based on hydatid cyst presence/absence. Of the 264 bovines examined, 38 (14.4%) showed hydatid cysts during post-mortem examination. All of these individuals, plus an additional 14 (total: 52; 19.6%) tested positive based on less time-consuming ELISA examination. Based on ELISA, occurrence in females (18.8%) was significantly higher than in males (9.2%) and was higher in cattle (19.5%) compared to buffalo (9.5%). The infection rate increased with age in both host species: cumulatively, 3.6% in animals aged 2-3 years, 14.6% in 4-5-year-olds and 25.6% in 6-7-year-olds. The occurrence of cysts in cattle was significantly higher in the lungs (14.1%) compared to their livers (5.5%), whereas the opposite was true in buffalo (6.6% livers, 2.9% lungs). For both host species, most cysts in the lungs were fertile (65%), while the majority in the liver were sterile (71.4%). We conclude that the identified iEg67 kDa antigen is a strong candidate for the development of a sero-diagnostic screening assay for the pre-slaughter diagnosis of hydatidosis.

AB  - With a possible origin from bats, the alphacoronavirus Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) causes significant hazards and widespread epidemics in the swine population. However, the ecology, evolution, and spread of PEDV are still unclear. Here, from 149,869 fecal and intestinal tissue samples of pigs collected in an 11-year survey, we identified PEDV as the most dominant virus in diarrheal animals. Global whole genomic and evolutionary analyses of 672 PEDV strains revealed the fast-evolving PEDV genotype 2 (G2) strains as the main epidemic viruses worldwide, which seems to correlate with the use of G2-targeting vaccines. The evolving pattern of the G2 viruses presents geographic bias as they evolve tachytely in South Korea but undergo the highest recombination in China. Therefore, we clustered six PEDV haplotypes in China, whereas South Korea held five haplotypes, including a unique haplotype G. In addition, an assessment of the spatiotemporal spread route of PEDV indicates Germany and Japan as the primary hubs for PEDV dissemination in Europe and Asia, respectively. Overall, our findings provide novel insights into the epidemiology, evolution, and transmission of PEDV, and thus may lay a foundation for the prevention and control of PEDV and other coronaviruses.

AB  - The global climate changes are causing an increase in the number and harmfulness of slugs. Deroceras agreste (Linnaeus, 1758) (Stylommatophora, Agriolimacidae) is a polyphagous phytophage that damages over 150 species of plants, including many vegetables, cultivated berries and grasses. Other than decrease in yield, slugs cause deterioration of consumer qualities of the products, promote infections of plants, and are intermediate hosts of some parasites of mammals and birds. Thus, slugs impose great losses on agricultural farming, and therefore the objective of our study was determining the variability of locomotor activity of D. agreste slugs in reaction to aromatic substances. We determined repellent or attractive effects of those substances for the purpose of further using the obtained data for plant protection. We tested 52 substances and their mixtures, which were conditionally divided into the following groups: chemical solvents, plant extracts, aromatizers, organic acids and synthetic cosmetic additives. Only dimethyl sulfoxide could be identified as an attractant. All the rest of the substances increased the speed of the slugs to various degrees, but had no significant effect on the direction of the animals' movement. Gasoline increased the speed of the slugs' movement by 3.20 times, xylene by 4.56. The most effective organic acids and aromatizers to increase the moving speed of slugs were avobenzone and formic acid: the first caused a 2.83-fold increase in the moving speed, the other a 3.16-fold increase. Only one of 13 aromatic substances changed the direction of the slugs' movement during the experiment - ss-ionone. As with the plant extracts, the highest effect on locomotor activity of slugs was exerted by tree bark of Quillaja saponaria (3.64-fold) and Aesculus hippocastanum extract (4.33-fold). Furthermore, together with Capsicum frutescens, they changed the direction the mollusks were moving in, and therefore could be used as repellents. Synthetic cosmetic additives hydrolyzed silk and chrysalide oil exerted the greatest effects on the lcomotor activity of slugs (3.16 and 3.20 times, respectively). A total of 78.6% of the slugs moved away from chrysalide oil, and thus this oil may be suggested as a repellent, as well as mousse de babassu and cocamidopropyl betaine (84.6% and 78.6%, respectively). Therefore, a large amount of the tested substances to one or another extent made the slugs move faster, but most of them did not alter the direction in which the slugs were moving.

AB  - The forest cockchafer (Melolontha hippocastani Fabr.) is a significant European polyphagous pest in forests. Both the adults and grubs damage trees. During hibernation - from pupation (VII) to leaving the soil (IV), changes in the position of the adults in the soil were observed every month. The grubs of future males finished feeding earlier and pupated. The males hatched earlier than the females. The males' greater tolerance to cold compared to females was proven under laboratory conditions, which is also related to the shallower depths at which males overwinter. An analysis of the position of the pupae (in July) and the imagoes (in September) indicates that some individuals did not stay at the place of hatching but descended lower if the soil temperature did not drop below 7 & DEG;C. Hibernating males and females start to ascend toward the surface in January and February, respectively, even at soil temperatures below 5 & DEG;C. The observed commencements of swarming lead to the conclusion that a necessary condition is an air temperature of > 10 & DEG;C and a soil temperature of > 7 & DEG;C for a period of 7-10 days.

AB  - Camelina [Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz] is an emerging oilseed crop that is attracting interest because of its high environmental adaptability and oil and protein quantity and quality. Seventeen camelina varieties of different geographical origins, sown in the same locality on two sowing dates, were compared for oil, protein, and antinutritional compounds in the meal. ANOVA showed that sowing time significantly affected the content of main fatty acids, whereas 1000-seed weight, glucosinolates (GLSs), trypsin inhibitor (TI), monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids were related to the genotype. Among the varieties analyzed, Pearl and CCE26 proved to be the best source of healthy oil, with high n-3/n-6 ratio, whereas Luna and Przybrodzka, having a lower content of GLSs and TI, were suitable for animal feed. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) allowed to group the 17 varieties into three subgroups, and the largest variation was observed among the Canadian varieties.

AB  - The cryopreservation reduces ram sperm quality, decreasing the pregnancy rate of ewes inseminated with thawed sperm. Hence, we aimed to improve the post-thaw quality of ram sperm replacing egg yolk on Tris-Glucose extender with different concentrations of LDL (2 or 8%), associated with the addition of 10 mM non-enzymatic antioxidants (ascorbic acid, hydroxytoluene butylate, ascorbyl palmitate, and trehalose). Semen samples were collected from six rams, split into different treatments, and frozen. After thawing, kinematic (CASA), structural (propidium iodide and carboxyfluorescein diacetate) and functional (hypoosmotic test) sperm membrane integrity was assessed. Total motility, VCL, and LIN were also assessed in thawed samples during 3 h of incubation (38 degrees C). The results showed that hydroxytoluene butylate at 10 mM in Tris-Glucose extender with 8% LDL improved velocity parameters immediately post -thaw compared with Tris-Glucose egg yolk extender, as well as prevented the reduction of total motility and VCL after incubation. There was no benefit of adding ascorbic acid and trehalose. Moreover, for the first time, it was shown the motility impairment promoted by ascorbyl palmitate to ram sperm.

AB  - Disruption of the estrous cycle affects fertility and reproductive health. Follicular dynamics are key to the regularity of the estrous cycle. We identified a novel lincRNA, HEOE, showing significant upregulation in the ovaries during the estrus phase across various pig breeds. Functional analysis revealed that HEOE is responsive to luteinizing hormone (LH) stimulation, modulating transcriptional suppression and alternative splicing in ovarian granulosa cells (GCs). This leads to increased GC apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation. Mechanistically, HEOE inhibits miR-16 maturation in the nucleus, and sequesters miR-16 in the cytoplasm, thereby collectively reducing miR-16's inhibition on ZMAT3, enhancing the expression of ZMAT3, a key factor in the p53 pathway and alternative splicing, thereby regulating follicular development. This effect was validated in both mice and pig follicles. Persistent overexpression or suppression of HEOE throughout the estrous cycle impairs cycle regularity and reduces litter size. These outcomes are associated with HEOE reduced follicular PGF2 alpha levels and modulation of the cAMP signaling pathway. Our data, combined with public databases, indicate that the high expression of HEOE during the estrus phase is crucial for maintaining the estrous cycle. HEOE is a potential therapeutic target for regulating fertility and ensuring estrous cycle regularity in pigs.

AB  - Changes in hydroxyproline metabolism are reported to promote tumorigenesis. HOGA1 is a useful marker for diagnosing primary hyperoxaluria 3, catalysing the final step of mitochondrial hydroxyproline metabolism from 4-hydroxy-2-oxoglutarate (HOG) to glyoxylate and pyruvate; however, its specific mechanism in RCC remains unclear. This study investigated the role of HOGA1 in the pathogenesis of ccRCC. The results showed that HOGA1 was decreased significantly in tumour tissues, with this low expression associated with a poor prognosis in patients with ccRCC. QTL mapping showed that Hoga1 was cis-regulated. Gene enrichment analyses showed that Hoga1 co-expressed genes were enriched in the Wnt/beta-catenin signalling pathway. Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo assays demonstrated that HOGA1 significantly inhibited the proliferation, invasion and migration of renal carcinoma cells via the Wnt/beta-catenin-c-Myc/CyclinD1 axis, probably via regulating the level of HOG. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that HOGA1 has a tumour suppressor role by inhibiting the Wnt/beta-catenin signalling pathway. This finding provides new insights into the function of HOGA1 in ccRCC.

AB  - Herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) are crucial chemical cues guiding insect herbivores and their natural enemies to the potential hosts. However, the effects and underlying mechanisms of HIPVs on insect development and reproduction remain underexplored. This study investigated the cotton bollworm Helicoverpa armigera-induced cotton volatiles as well as their impacts on larval performance, adult fecundity and transcriptome of H. armigera. Upon cotton bollworm feeding, the volatile compositions of cotton leaves, calyxes, and bolls were altered, with (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate (HAC) being the most significantly induced volatile. HAC exposure had negative effects on H. armigera, including reduced food intake, slower larval growth, prolonged larval lifespan, and a significant decrease in adult fecundity. RNA-Seq and qRT-PCR analysis revealed that HAC exposure altered the expression of genes related to cuticles, muscles, and juvenile hormone metabolism in larvae. In adults, the transcriptome changes were less pronounced and mainly associated with carbohydrate metabolism. Our results suggest that cotton bollworm feeding induces HAC production, which negatively impacts bollworm development and reproduction by modulating gene expression. These findings provide new insights into the role of HIPVs in insect herbivore physiology and their potential for biological control.

AB  - Preimplantation development is an important window of human embryogenesis. However, ethical constraints and the limitations involved in studying human embryos often necessitate the use of alternative model systems. Here we identify the guinea pig as a promising small animal model to study human preimplantation development. Using single-cell RNA-sequencing, we generated an atlas of guinea pig preimplantation development, revealing its close resemblance to early human embryogenesis in terms of the timing of compaction, early-, mid- and late-blastocyst formation, and implantation, and the spatio-temporal expression of key lineage markers. We also show conserved roles of Hippo, MEK-ERK and JAK-STAT signalling. Furthermore, multi-species analysis highlights the spatio-temporal expression of conserved and divergent genes during preimplantation development and pluripotency. The guinea pig serves as a valuable animal model for advancing preimplantation development and stem cell research, and can be leveraged to better understand the longer-term impact of early exposures on offspring outcomes.

AB  - Salmonella is a global health threat, with pig production being one of the main sources of human salmonellosis. The current study investigated the antivirulence properties of geraniol for inhibiting the in vitro colonization of Salmonella. The minimum inhibitory (MIC) and bactericidal concentrations (MBC) of geraniol against Salmonella typhimurium followed by the sub-MIC of geraniol were determined. Results provided clear evidence that geraniol at 1/8 MIC can be used as an effective, non-toxic antivirulence compound to inhibit virulence factors (motility, adhesion, and invasiveness) affecting the colonization of S. typhimurium on IPEC-J2 cells. Additionally, the findings signified that microfluidics is an emerging technology suitable for the preparation of stable liposomes with a small size (<200 nm) and high encapsulation efficiency (EE) of up to 92.53%, which can act as effective carriers of geraniol into the pig gastrointestinal tract (GIT), targeting Salmonella, preventing colonization, and thus increasing the safety of the food supply chain.

AB  - The nutritional value of fat consumption depends on both the fatty acid composition and the positional distribution of fatty acids within the triglyceride molecule. This research studies the effect of feeding with three different diets (4% lard-enriched; 11.5% high-oleic sunflower-enriched; and extensive feeding mainly with acorns) on the composition of fatty acids in the sn-2 position (and sn-1,3) of triglycerides and the textural properties of subcutaneous fat in heavy Iberian pigs (n = 210 castrated males). A moderate dietary enrichment with oleic acid in mixed diets did not alter the regulation of the sn-2 position of triglyceride (69.9% and 13.9% of palmitic and oleic acids, respectively), but the extremely high intake of oleic acid in pigs fed mainly on acorns changed the proportions of palmitic and oleic acids at the sn-2 position in the subcutaneous fat of pigs (55.0% and 27.2%, respectively). Hardness, adhesiveness, cohesiveness, gumminess, and chewiness showed the least values in EXT pigs, and the greatest values in LARD-fed barrows. SUN cohesiveness and gumminess did not differ from those fed LARD. In addition, Iberian pigs raised in free-range conditions had a more favorable nutritional lipid profile for human health compared to pigs fed conventional diets.

AB  - Human milk (HM) is the primary source of nutrients and bioactive components that supports the growth and development of infants. However, the proteins present in human milk may change depending on the period of lactation. In this light, the objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of lactation period on HM utilizing a data-independent acquisition (DIA) approach to identify the differences in HM whey protein proteomes. As part of the study, whey proteins of January, February, and June in human milk were studied. The results identified a total of 1563 proteins in HM whey proteins of which 114 groups were subunits of differentially expressed proteins as revealed by cluster analysis. Protein expression was observed to be affected by the period of lactation with expression levels of plasminogen, thrombospondin-1, and tenascin higher during January, keratin, type I cytoskeletal 9 highest in February, and transcobalamin-1 highest in June. The results of this study contribute to expand our understanding of the human whey proteome but also provide strong evidence for the nutritional difference of HM during different lactation periods.

AB  - At the current rate of progress, there will probably still be 2.8 billion people world-wide without safely managed sanitation by 2030. To incentivise and increase implementation of sustainable faecal sludge management (FSM), especially in low and middle-income countries like Cambodia, human waste must be regarded as a resource. However, planning data, e.g. on the quantities, composition and fate of faecal sludge after leaving households, are inadequate and lack accuracy. The aim of this study was to provide baseline data for effective FSM planning by sanitation stakeholders in Phnom Penh. This was done by quantifying sludge volumes generated, transport logistics and resource recovery potential to incentivise sustainable management. Interviews were conducted with users and emptying and transportation contractors, together with collection of technical data about on-site sanitation systems. Geographical coordinates of household sampling locations and disposal sites were also mapped. The results revealed that Cheung Ek and Kob Srov wetlands are the main recipients of faecal sludge collected in Phnom Penh with the amount of 18,800 m(3) and 13,700 m(3) annually, respectively. The analysis showed that faecal sludge in Phnom Penh contains valuable resources such as nitrogen (6 tons), phosphorus (13 tons) and energy (148-165 GWh) annually, but in-depth investigations of appropriate treatment options for resource recovery are required. Detailed documentation of the location of potential recoverable resources from faecal sludge would assist decision-makers in developing action plans for sustainable FSM in Phnom Penh and similar cities.

AB  - Simple Summary In the context of a shortage of feed resources and a complete ban on veterinary antibiotics, searching for green additives that can improve the production performance of ruminants has become a popular research topic. Oregano essential oil (EO) inhibits rumen gas production (GP) and regulates animal digestive metabolism, and cobalt lactate (Co) can improve feed digestibility. However, previous studies on EO of oregano and Co showed different results. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the effects of different EOC addition levels on rumen in vitro fermentation and rumen bacterial community composition, and the experimental data obtained showed that all five EOC (0.1425% cobalt lactate + 1.13% oregano essential oil + 98.7275% carrier) addition levels in this experiment had no significant effect on nutrient digestibility. However, the addition of 1500 mg center dot L-1 EOC significantly improved rumen fermentation parameters and altered the microbiota composition. All presented data provide a theoretical basis for the application of oregano essential oil and cobalt in ruminant nutrition. The objective of this experiment was to evaluate the effect of different EOC (0.1425% cobalt lactate + 1.13% oregano essential oil + 98.7275% carrier) levels on in vitro rumen fermentation and microbial changes. Six EOC levels (treatments: 0 mg center dot L-1, CON; 50 mg center dot L-1, EOC1; 100 mg center dot L-1, EOC2; 400 mg center dot L-1, EOC3; 800 mg center dot L-1, EOC4 and 1500 mg center dot L-1, EOC5) were selected to be used to in vitro incubation. The in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD), in vitro neutral detergent fiber digestibility (IVNDFD), in vitro acid detergent fiber digestibility (IVNDFD), pH, ammonia-nitrogen (NH3-N) concentration, total volatile fatty acid (TVFA) concentration and microbial protein (MCP) concentration were measured after 48 h incubation, after which the groups with significant nutrient digestibility and fermentation parameters were subjected to 16S rRNA sequencing. The results showed that the total gas production (GP) of the EOC5 group was higher than that of the other groups after 12 h of in vitro incubation. TVFA, NH3-N and MCP concentrations were also shown to be higher in group EOC5 than those in other groups (p < 0.05), while NH3-N and MCP concentrations in the EOC2 group were lower than those in other groups significantly (p < 0.05). The molar ratio of acetic acid decreased while the molar ratio of propionic acid increased after the addition of EOC. 16S rRNA sequencing revealed that the rumen microbiota was altered in response to adding EOC, especially for the EOC5 treatment, with firmicutes shown to be the most abundant (43.1%). The relative abundance of Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group was significantly lower, while the relative abundance of uncultured_bacterium_f_Muribaculaceae and Succiniclasticum was significantly higher in the EOC5 group than those in other groups (p < 0.05). Comprehensive analysis showed that EOC (1500 mg center dot L-1) could significantly increase gas production, alter sheep rumen fermentation parameters and microbiota composition.

AB  - In most cases, the unused by-products of venison, including deer tallow, are disposed of in rendering plants. Deer tallow contains essential fatty acids and can be used to prepare products for everyday food and advanced applications. This work aimed to process deer tallow into hydrolyzed products using microbial lipases. A Taguchi design with three process factors at three levels was used to optimize the processing: amount of water (8, 16, 24%), amount of enzyme (2, 4, 6%), and reaction time (2, 4, 6 h). The conversion of the tallow to hydrolyzed products was expressed by the degree of hydrolysis. The oxidative stability of the prepared products was determined by the peroxide value and the free fatty acids by the acid value; further, color change, textural properties (hardness, spreadability, stickiness, and adhesiveness), and changes at the molecular level were observed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The degree of hydrolysis was 11.8-49.6%; the peroxide value ranged from 12.3 to 29.5 mu val/g, and the color change of the samples expressed by the change in the total color difference (triangle E*) was 1.9-13.5. The conditions of enzymatic hydrolysis strongly influenced the textural properties: hardness 25-50 N, spreadability 20-40 N/s, and stickiness < 0.06 N. FTIR showed that there are changes at the molecular level manifested by a decrease in ester bonds. Enzymatically hydrolyzed deer tallow is suitable for preparing cosmetics and pharmaceutical matrices.

AB  - Simple Summary The assessment of the depth of anesthesia in pigs is challenging. The nociceptive withdrawal reflex is a physiological, polysynaptic spinal reflex occurring in response to noxious stimulations, and the tracking of its thresholds has been shown to be possibly useful in evaluating the depth of anesthesia. In the present study, we investigated how increasing the dose of the anesthetic drug propofol influences the nociceptive withdrawal reflex thresholds in pigs. The nociceptive withdrawal reflex thresholds were continuously recorded while increasing the dose of propofol that was administered. Each animal underwent the same experimental protocol on three different days. We found that the nociceptive withdrawal reflex thresholds increased with an increasing dose of propofol, and that the same trend was present on the three experimental days. Our results suggest that the assessment of the nociceptive withdrawal reflex thresholds may complement the depth of anesthesia evaluation in pigs receiving propofol.Abstract The nociceptive withdrawal reflex (NWR) is a physiological, polysynaptic spinal reflex occurring in response to noxious stimulations. Continuous NWR threshold (NWRt) tracking has been shown to be possibly useful in the depth of anesthesia assessment. The primary aim of this study was to describe how propofol modulates the NWRt over time in pigs. Five juvenile pigs (anesthetized three times) were included. An intravenous (IV) infusion of propofol (20 mg/kg/h) was started, and boli were administered to effect until intubation. Afterwards, the infusion was increased every ten minutes by 6 mg/kg/h, together with an IV bolus of 0.5 mg/kg, until reaching an electroencephalographic suppression ratio (SR) of between 10% and 30%. The NWRt was continuously monitored. For data analysis, the time span between 15 min following intubation and the end of propofol infusion was considered. Individual durations of propofol administration were divided into five equal time intervals for each pig (TI1-TI5). A linear regression between NWRt and TI was performed for each pig. Moreover, the baseline NWRt and slopes of the linear regression (b1) were compared among days using a Friedman Repeated Measures Analysis of Variance on Ranks. The NWRt always increased with the propofol dose (b1 = 4.71 +/- 3.23; mean +/- standard deviation). No significant differences were found between the baseline NWRt and the b1 values. Our results suggest that the NWRt may complement the depth of anesthesia assessment in pigs receiving propofol.

AB  - Adolescence is a critical period for social experience-dependent oligodendrocyte maturation and myelination. Adolescent stress predisposes to cause irreversible changes in brain structure and function with lasting effects on adulthood or beyond. However, the molecular mechanisms linking adolescent social isolation stress with emotional and social competence remain largely unknown. In our study, we found that social isolation during adolescence leads to anxiety-like behaviors, depression-like behaviors, impaired social memory and altered patterns of social ultrasonic vocalizations in mice. In addition, adolescent social isolation stress induces demyelination in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of mice, with decreased myelin-related gene expression and disrupted myelin structure. More importantly, clemastine was sufficient to rescue the impairment of emotional and social memory by promoting remyelination. These findings reveal the demyelination mechanism of emotional and social deficits caused by social isolation stress in adolescence, and provides potential therapeutic targets for treating stress-related mental disorders.

AB  - This study compared two semen collection methods-artificial vagina (AV) and electro-ejaculator (EE)-to evaluate their effects on sperm quality and the metabolomic profile of goat seminal plasma (SP). Semen samples were analyzed for sperm characteristics, and SP was assessed using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization quadrupole Orbitrap mass spectrometry. Sperm collected via AV showed lower ejaculate volume but significantly higher concentration and motility than EE. Metabolomic profiling revealed 568 and 350 metabolites in positive and negative ion modes, respectively, with 105 and 77 showing significant differential expression. In the negative ion mode, metabolites such as bezafibrate, phosphatidylinositol 16 and 18, and benzothiazoline were down-regulated in AV, while docosahexaenoic acid, arachidonic acid, phosphatidylcholine, rutin, pyruvate, famotidine, and citrate were up-regulated. In the positive ion mode, metabolites including astaxanthin, lapachol, and 3-acetylaconitine were down-regulated, while mannitol, choline, L-carnitine, and indirubin were up-regulated in AV. KEGG pathway enrichment showed 30 significantly altered pathways. This is the first study to assess the impact of AV and EE on the metabolomic profile of goat SP. The identified metabolites serve as promising biomarkers for evaluating sperm quality and assessing reproductive potential, with implications for improving semen collection techniques and conserving genetic resources.

AB  - It has been reported that N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) plays an important role in zygote genome activation during embryonic development, but the effects of METTL3 under oxidative stress in the early development of goat embryos remain largely unknown. In this study, zygotes were monitored at 72 and 168 h after fertilization, and they developed to the 8-cell stage and blastocyst stage under hypoxic conditions and normoxic conditions. Single-cell transcriptome sequencing was performed at the 8-cell stage and the blastocyst stage in the goat embryos, the differ-entially expressed METTL3 was screened from the sequencing results. We found that microinjection of small interfering RNA (siRNA) against METTL3 caused developmental arrest, both 8-cell rates (37.45 +/- 2.21% vs. 47.09 +/- 1.38%; P < 0.01) and blastocyst rates of Si-METTL3 (12.17% +/- 2.84 vs. 20.83 +/- 3.61%; P < 0.01) in Si-METTL3 group were significantly decreased compared with that of control under hypoxic conditions, significant changes were found in the m6A-related genes and the expression levels of critical transcription factors, such as, NANOG, GATA3, CDX2 and SOX17, were decreased. This study revealed the key role of METTL3 in the regulation of embryonic development under oxidative stress, and laid the foundation for further study of the crucial mechanism of oxidative stress during the early embryonic development of goats.

AB  - Utah prairie dogs (UPDs, Cynomys parvidens) arc colonial, herbivorous rodents listed under the Endangered Species Act as threatened. Little is known about UPD population dynamics at higher elevations in the species' range. From 2013 through 2016, we studied UPDs on five colonies at 2,645 to 2,873 in elevation on the Awapa Plateau, Utah, USA. Primary production increases with precipitation and precipitation increases with elevation on the plateau. We hypothesized that UPD body condition, reproduction, survival, and population growth all would vary directly with precipitation and elevation. Each year, we live-trapped UPDs from late-Jun through Aug, weighing each UPD, aging it as adult or pup, measuring its right hind foot, marking it for unique identification, and releasing it at point of capture. Fleas from live-trapped UPDs and opportunistically collected rodent carcasses, and rodent carcasses themselves, were tested for the agent of sylvatic plague (Yersinia pestis), a lethal invasive pathogen. Adult UPD body condition (mass:foot) increased with elevation. In addition, UPD reproduction (pups:adults) and population growth (lambda) increased with precipitation. Annual survival declined from 0.49 in 2013-2014 to 0.24 in 2015-2016. We captured 421 UPDs in 2013 but only 149 in 2016. Sylvatic plague may have contributed to population declines. Notwithstanding, plague detection (yes/no by colony and year) had no statistical effect on population growth or annual survival, raising suspicion about the predictive value of binary plague detection variables. Generally speaking, efforts to conserve UPDs may benefit from the restoration and preservation of large colonies at mesic sites.

AB  - Hard cheeses are an important source of nutrients and biologically active substances, particularly fatty acids, in the human diet. Among the most valuable and attractive hard cheeses to consumers are those produced o n small-scale farms from raw goat milk. The unique microbiome of raw goat milk creates distinctive taste and aroma characteristics of the cheeses and significantly influences the fatty acid composition and quality of milk fat. The determination of the fatty acid composition of Caciotta and Canestrato hard cheeses made from raw goat milk during the ripening period of 24 and 12 months, respectively, was conducted four times using gas chromatography. The primary saturated fatty acids in Caciotta and Canestrato cheeses are palmitic, stearic, capric, and myristic acids, comprising over 55% of the total fatty acid content. Among the unsaturated fatty acids in Caciotta and Canestrato cheeses, the sum of oleic and linoleic acids exceeds 25% of the total fatty acids. There were no significant trends in the dynamics of short-chain, medium-chain, and long-chain fatty acid content in Caciotta and Canestrato cheeses during the ripening period. In both cheeses, the main omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acid is linolenic acid, and the main omega 6 polyunsaturated fatty acid is linoleic acid. Their ratio in the cheeses flu c tuate d within the range of 2.8:1-4.6:1 throughout the ripening period. The accumulation of polyunsaturated fatty acids in Caciotta cheese increase d during its ripening period, accompanied by a decrease in the delta-9 desaturase index (C-14 ). In Canestrato cheese, the delta-9 desaturase index (C-14 ) shows a direct correlation with its age. During the ripening period, the atherogenic index of Canestrato cheese fat decrease d , while the hypocholesterolemic/hypercholesterolemic acid ratio increase d , whereas this pattern was not observed in Caciotta cheese. The research results can be used as criteria for selecting healthy nutrition, assessing the naturalness, and authenticity of artisanal hard cheeses made from goat milk.

AB  - The grain aphid, Sitobion miscanthi causes serious damage by removing nutritional content from wheat plants and transmitting viral diseases. The use of resistant wheat cultivars is an effective method of aphid management. To identify S. miscanthi resistant cultivars, preliminary antixenosis resistance screening was conducted on 112 Ethiopian and 21 Chinese wheat accessions and varieties along with bioassay to test for further antixenosis resistance, identification of aphid feeding behavior using electrical penetration graph (EPG), and imaging of leaf trichome densities using a 3D microscope. According to antixenosis resistance screening, one highly-resistant, 25 moderately-resistant, and 38 slightly-resistant wheat cultivars to S. miscanthi were identified. Aphid choice tests showed that Luxuan266, 243726, and 213312 were the least preferred after 12, 24, 48, and 72 h of S. miscanthi release. Longer duration of Np, longer time to first probe, and shorter duration of E2 waveforms were recorded in Lunxuan266, 243726, and 213312 than in Beijing 837. The trichome density on adaxial and abaxial leaf surfaces of Lunxuan266, 243726 and 213312 was significantly higher than on those of Beijing 837. We concluded that Lunxuan266, 243726, and 213312 were antixenosis resistant to S. miscanthi based on the choice test, EPG results, and leaf trichome densities.

AB  - Over the last few decades, the extent of marine kelp forests has decreased along the west coast of Kyushu in Japan. We monitored the distribution of seaweeds and seawater temperatures off Nomo, Nagasaki, western Kyushu from 2010 to 2019, to examine the relationship between seaweed distribution and abundance, and water temperature, with particular attention to Ecklonia radicosa. In 2010, Ecklonia cava ssp. kurome, E. radicosa and Sargassum macrocarpum dominated along the transect. However, E. cava ssp. kurome and S. macrocarpum disappeared by December 2013. Moreover, E. radicosa drastically decreased in 2016 and has not been observed since 2017. In contrast, small macroalgae such as Zonaria diesingiana increased in abundance after the larger macroalgal species disappeared. Water temperatures in the spring of 2016 were the highest recorded in the decade from 2010 to 2019 (18.2-19.7(degrees)C) and blades of E. radicosa were frequently lost in 2016, probably because of browsing by herbivorous fish. Previous studies showed that feeding rates of herbivorous fish increase, while relative growth rates of E. radicosa are stable, within the recorded temperature range. Changes in the balance between fish herbivory and seaweed productivity due to increasing water temperatures could be responsible for the decline of E. radicosa.

AB  - If gastric acidity is to be encouraged, it may be beneficial to eliminate some feed elements from pig starter meals since they bind more acid in the stomach than others. The cereals (wheat, maize, and barley), soybean meal, commercial mineral supplement, and two feed mixtures (one of them with the additive Zeolit) were evaluated. In this study, it was discovered that adding zeolite to the feed mixture had the effect of lowering its initial pH (P<0.001), buffering (P<0.05) and binding capacity (P<0.05). This study aimed to measure the buffering and acid-binding capacity of some ingredients commonly used in growing pig feeds and estimate the coefficient of correlation between crude protein, ash, and the buffering capacity of feed ingredients with significant linear correlation (P<0.05 and P<0.01, respectively). The combined impact of the individual feed mixture components' individual buffering capacities has not been proven.

AB  - Fructose, the most abundant hexose sugar in fetal fluids and the blood of sheep and other ungulates and cetaceans, is synthesized from glucose via the polyol pathway in trophectoderm and chorion. However, the cell-specific and temporal expression of enzymes for the synthesis and metabolism of fructose in sheep conceptuses (embryo and placental membranes) and placentomes has not been characterized. This study characterized key enzymes involved in fructose synthesis and metabolism by ovine conceptuses throughout pregnancy. Day 17 conceptuses expressed mRNAs for the polyol pathway (SORD and AKR1B1) and glucose and fructose metabolism (HK1, HK2, G6PD, OGT, and FBP), but not those required for gluconeogenesis (G6Pase or PCK). Ovine placentomes also expressed mRNAs for SORD, AKR1B1, HK1, and OGT. Fructose can be metabolized via the ketohexokinase (KHK) pathway, and isoforms, KHK-A and KHK-C, were expressed in ovine conceptuses from Day 16 of pregnancy and placentomes during pregnancy in a cell-specific manner. The KHK-A protein was more abundant in the trophectoderm and cotyledons of placentomes, while KHK-C protein was more abundant in the endoderm of Day 16 conceptuses and the chorionic epithelium in placentomes. Expression of KHK mRNAs in placentomes was greatest at Day 30 of pregnancy (P < 0.05), but not different among days later in gestation. These results provide novel insights into the synthesis and metabolism of fructose via the uninhibited KHK pathway in ovine conceptuses to generate ATP via the tricarboxylic cycle, as well as substrates for the pentose cycle, hexosamine biosynthesis pathway, and one-carbon metabolism required for conceptus development throughout pregnancy.

AB  - Experiences are linked to emotions impacting memory consolidation and associated brain neuronal circuits. Posttraumatic stress disorder is an example of strong negative emotions affecting memory processes by flashbacks of past traumas. Stress-related memory deficits are also observed in major depressive disorder (MDD). We recently highlighted that sex-specific blood-brain barrier (BBB) alterations underlie stress responses in mice and human depression. However, little is known about the relationship between emotional valence, memory encoding and BBB gene expression. Here, we investigated the effects of novel object recognition (NOR) test, an experience considered of neutral emotional valence, on BBB properties in dorsal vs ventral hippocampus (HIPP) in the context of various environmental conditions (arena size, handling, age). The HIPP is a brain area central for learning and memory processes with the dorsal and ventral subregions being associated with working memory vs reference memory retrieval, respectively. Expression of genes related to BBB integrity are altered in line with learning and memory processes in a region- and sex-specific manner. We observed correlations between poor learning, anxiety, stress-induced corticosterone release and changes in BBB-associated gene expression. Comparison of BBB transcriptomes between sexes also revealed profound differences at baseline in both ventral and dorsal HIPP. Finally, we identified circulating vascular biomarkers, such as sE-selectin and matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9), altered following NOR exposure supporting that recognition memory formation has an impact on the neurovasculature. Although deemed as a neutral valence test, NOR experimental conditions can shift it toward a negative valence, impacting performance and highlighting the need to minimize anxiety when performing this commonly used test in mice.

AB  - Temperature can influence the developmental rate and reproductive potential of herbivorous insects and mites. Amblyseius swirskii Athias-Henriot is an effective phytoseiid predator with a significant ability to repress pest populations. To better understand the effect of temperature on the performance of A. swirskii, we studied temperature-dependent population growth and reproductive potential of the predatory mite under six constant temperatures (20, 22, 25, 27, 30, and 32 degrees C), providing 75 +/- 5% RH and a photoperiod of 16 L: 8 D h. The average fecundity was 12.85, 18.24, 22.2, 27.24, 28.6, and 52.57 eggs/female at 20-32 degrees C, respectively. The highest gross reproductive rate (GRR= 26.08 eggs/individual), net reproductive rate (R-0= 22.51 eggs/individual), and intrinsic rate of increase (r= 0.174 day(-1)) were recorded at 27 degrees C. The finite rate of increase (lambda) and mean generation time (T) of A. swirskii were profoundly affected by temperature and varied from 1.101 to 1.190 day(-1) and 10.85 to 19.09 days, respectively. Data obtained during this study indicated that 27 degrees C is the best temperature for rearing this predatory mite. This study improves our findings of the temperature range to optimize the mass rearing of A. swirskii as an effective predatory mite.

AB  - A fast and accurate operational model of electron density is crucial in many scientific disciplines including crystallography, molecular biology, pharmaceutical, and structural chemistry. In quantum crystallography, the aspherical refinement of crystal structures is becoming increasingly popular because of its accurate description in terms of physically meaningful properties. The transferable aspherical atom model (TAAM) is quick and precise, though it requires a robust algorithm for atom typing and coverage of the most popular atom types present in small organic molecules. Thus, the University at Buffalo Databank (UBDB) has been renamed to the Multipolar Atom Types from Theory and Statistical clustering (MATTS) data bank, broadened, restructured, and implemented into the software DiSCaMB with 651 atom types obtained from 2316 small-molecule crystal structures containing C, H, N, O, P, S, F, Cl, and Br atoms. MATTS2021 data bank now covers most of the small molecules, peptides, RNA, DNA, and some frequently occurring cations and anions in biological, pharmaceutical, and organic materials, including the majority of known crystal structures composed of the above elements. The multipole model parameters (Pval, kappa, kappa', Plm) obtained for different atom types were greatly influenced by neighboring atom types, hybridization, geometrical strain in the ring system, and charges on the molecule. Contrary to previous findings, the atoms showing variable oxidation states and ions deviate from the linear dependence of monopole-derived charges on the expansion-contraction kappa parameter.

AB  - Fetal growth restriction (FGR) is associated with uteroplacental insufficiency, and neurodevelopmental and structural brain deficits in the infant. It is currently untreatable. We hypothesised that treating the maternal uterine artery with vascular endothelial growth factor adenoviral gene therapy (Ad.VEGF-A(165)) normalises offspring brain weight and prevents brain injury in a guinea pig model of FGR. Pregnant guinea pigs were fed a restricted diet before and after conception and received Ad.VEGF-A(165) (1 x 10(10) viral particles, n = 18) or vehicle (n = 18), delivered to the external surface of the uterine arteries, in mid-pregnancy. Pregnant, ad libitum-fed controls received vehicle only (n = 10). Offspring brain weight and histological indices of brain injury were assessed at term and 5-months postnatally. At term, maternal nutrient restriction reduced fetal brain weight and increased microglial ramification in all brain regions but did not alter indices of cell death, astrogliosis or myelination. Ad.VEGF-A(165 )increased brain weight and reduced microglial ramification in fetuses of nutrient restricted dams. In adult offspring, maternal nutrient restriction did not alter brain weight or markers of brain injury, whilst Ad.VEGF-A(165) increased microglial ramification and astrogliosis in the hippocampus and thalamus, respectively. Ad.VEGF-A(165) did not affect cell death or myelination in the fetal or offspring brain. Ad.VEGF-A(165) normalises brain growth and markers of brain injury in guinea pig fetuses exposed to maternal nutrient restriction and may be a potential intervention to improve childhood neurodevelopmental outcomes in pregnancies complicated by FGR.

AB  - Reproduction in females is an energetically demanding process. We assumed that adiponectin (ADPN), known for its role in energy balance maintenance, is also engaged in the regulation of uterine steroidogenesis in the pig. We determined the impact of ADPN alone or in combination with insulin (INS) on testosterone (T), estrone (E1) and estradiol (E2) secretion by porcine endometrium and myometrium, uterine expression of CYP17A1 and CYP19A3 genes, and endometrial abundance of P450C17 and P450AROM proteins during the peri-implantation period and the oestrous cycle, using radioimmunoassay, qPCR, and Western Blot, respectively. During pregnancy, in the endometrial explants from days 10-11, ADPN decreased CYP17A1 gene expression, P450C17 protein abundance and T secretion, whereas increased E1 secretion. On days 12-13 of pregnancy, ADPN decreased CYP17A1 and CYP19A3 expression, P450C17 and P450AROM protein abundance and E1 secretion, but stimulated T secretion. On days 15-16 of pregnancy, ADPN decreased P450C17 protein accumulation but enhanced CYP19A3 expression and E1 secretion. On days 27-28 of pregnancy, ADPN increased CYP17A1 and CYP19A3 mRNA content and T secretion in this tissue and decreased P450C17 content. ADPN effect on myometrial explants was dependent on stage of gestation or oestrous cycle. Moreover, INS treatment modulated basal and ADPN-affected steroidogenic enzymes gene and protein expression and steroids secretion. The results obtained indicate that ADPN may affect processes required for successful implantation such as steroidogenesis. ADPN and INS were also shown to modulate each other action, which indicates that the proper course of uterine steroidogenesis may be dependent on both hormones' interaction.

AB  - Camellia oleifera Abel. is an economically important woody edible-oil species that is mainly cultivated in hilly areas of South China. The phosphorus (P) deficiency in the acidic soils poses severe challenges for the growth and productivity of C. oleifera. WRKY transcription factors (TFs) have been proven to play important roles in biological processes and plant responses to various biotic/abiotic stresses, including P deficiency tolerance. In this study, 89 WRKY proteins with conserved domain were identified from the C. oleifera diploid genome and divided into three groups, with group II further classified into five subgroups based on the phylogenetic relationships. WRKY variants and mutations were detected in the gene structure and conserved motifs of CoWRKYs. Segmental duplication events were considered as the primary driver in the expanding process of WRKY gene family in C. oleifera. Based on transcriptomic analysis of two C. oleifera varieties characterized with different P deficiency tolerances, 32 CoWRKY genes exhibited divergent expression patterns in response to P deficiency stress. qRT-PCR analysis demonstrated that CoWRKY11, -14, -20, -29 and -56 had higher positive impact on P-efficient CL40 variety compared with P-inefficient CL3 variety. Similar expression trends of these CoWRKY genes were further observed under P deficiency with longer treatment period of 120d. The result indicated the expression sensitivity of CoWRKYs on the P-efficient variety and the C. oleifera cultivar specificity on the P deficiency tolerance. Tissue expression difference showed CoWRKYs may play a crucial role in the transportation and recycling P in leaves by affecting diverse metabolic pathways. The available evidences in the study conclusively shed light on the evolution of the CoWRKY genes in C. oleifera genome and provided a valuable resource for further investigation of functional characterization of WRKY genes involved to enhance the P deficiency tolerance in C. oleifera.

AB  - It is often assumed that carbon nanotubes (CNTs) stimulate neuronal differentiation by transferring electrical signals and enhancing neuronal excitability. Given this, CNT-hydrogel composites are regarded as potential materials able to combine high electrical conductivity with biocompatibility, and therefore promote nerve regeneration. However, whether CNT-hydrogel composites actually influence neuronal differentiation and maturation, and how they do so remain elusive. In this study, CNT-hydrogel composites are prepared by in situ polymerization of poly(ethylene glycol) around a preformed CNT meshwork. It is demonstrated that the composites facilitate long-term survival and differentiation of pheochromocytoma 12 cells. Adult neural stem cells cultured on the composites show an increased neuron-to-astrocyte ratio and higher synaptic connectivity. Moreover, primary hippocampal neurons cultured on composites maintain morphological synaptic features as well as their neuronal network activity evaluated by spontaneous calcium oscillations, which are comparable to neurons cultured under control conditions. These results indicate that the composites are promising materials that could indeed facilitate neuronal differentiation while maintaining neuronal homeostasis.

AB  - Simple Summary Caesarean section is a common surgery performed in sheep, wherefore the animal is often placed in the supine position, which can lead to compromised lung function caused by pressure from the rumen and the full uterus. The forestomach system in ruminants contains fluids and electrolytes, which can function as a great reservoir for the blood equilibrium. The ruminal fluid as well as kidney function in sheep undergoing surgical procedures has so far been little examined in research. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of the type of anaesthesia as well as pregnancy status on these parameters. Based on our results, we can state that inhalational anaesthesia with added oxygen improves the oxygen saturation and partial pressure of oxygen in the blood of sheep in the supine position. Kidney function can be maintained with a minimal electrolyte infusion regime and changes in electrolytes in ruminal fluid could be observed. Background: Performing Sectio Caesarea in sheep under general anaesthesia is a common procedure in veterinary practice. The abdominal cavity can be accessed via linea alba, for which the ewe is positioned in the supine position, whereby rumen and uterus can compromise lung function. Although the rumen represents an important reservoir for fluid and electrolytes, and kidney function during anaesthesia is essential, these parameters have not been focused on in research. Therefore, the objective of this study is to contribute data on blood parameters, ruminal fluid, and kidney function tests during laparotomy. Methods: Laparotomy was performed in 14 ewes, whereof five animals were pregnant ewes (PE) and nine non-pregnant ewes (NPE). A total of seven animals received isoflurane in addition to oxygen (inhalational anaesthesia (InhA)) and seven ewes were anaesthetised with xylazine and ketamine (total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA)); all ewes received lumbosacral anaesthesia. Blood, urine, and ruminal fluid were sampled every hour over a three-hour period. Results: On comparing InhA to TIVA, higher values were detected for TIVA in haemoglobin, paced cell volume, sodium, phosphate, glucose concentration in the blood, and phosphate in ruminal fluid. Lower values were detected for TIVA in partial pressure of oxygen, oxygen saturation, and creatinine clearance. On comparing PE to NPE, higher values were detected in PE in magnesium and ruminal calcium. Lower values in PE were detected in chloride, base excess in the blood, and ruminal phosphate. Over time, an increase in partial pressure of carbon dioxide, glucose in the blood, glucose in urine, and a decrease in protein and albumin could be observed. Conclusion: Surgery in sheep in the supine position should be performed with additional oxygen to maintain physiological pO(2) and sO(2) values. Kidney function could be maintained with a minimal electrolyte infusion regime. Additional glucose is not necessary, even in pregnant ewes. Further research should be conducted on parameters in ruminal fluid.

AB  - Gastrointestinal side effects of donepezil, including dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea, occur in 20-30% of patients. The pathogenesis of these dysmotility associated disorders has not been fully clarified yet. Pharmacokinetic parameters of donepezil and its active metabolite 6-O-desmethyldonepezil were investigated in experimental pigs with and without small intestinal injury induced by dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). Morphological features of this injury were evaluated by a video capsule endoscopy. The effect of a single and repeated doses of donepezil on gastric myoelectric activity was assessed. Both DSS-induced small intestinal injury and prolonged small intestinal transit time caused higher plasma concentrations of donepezil in experimental pigs. This has an important implication for clinical practice in humans, with a need to reduce doses of the drug if an underlying gastrointestinal disease is present. Donepezil had an undesirable impact on porcine myoelectric activity. This effect was further aggravated by DSS-induced small intestinal injury. These findings can explain donepezil-associated dyspepsia in humans.

AB  - Simple Summary The monitoring and analysis of sheep behavior can reflect their welfare and health, which is beneficial for grazing management. For automatic classification and the continuous monitoring of grazing sheep behavior, wearable devices based on inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors are important. The accuracy of different machine learning algorithms was compared, and the best one was used for the continuous monitoring and behavior classification of three grazing sheep on pasture with three different sward surface heights. The results showed that the algorithm automatically monitored the behavior of grazing sheep individuals and quantified the time of each behavior. Behavior classification and recognition of sheep are useful for monitoring their health and productivity. The automatic behavior classification of sheep by using wearable devices based on IMU sensors is becoming more prevalent, but there is little consensus on data processing and classification methods. Most classification accuracy tests are conducted on extracted behavior segments, with only a few trained models applied to continuous behavior segments classification. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of multiple combinations of algorithms (extreme learning machine (ELM), AdaBoost, stacking), time windows (3, 5 and 11 s) and sensor data (three-axis accelerometer (T-acc), three-axis gyroscope (T-gyr), and T-acc and T-gyr) for grazing sheep behavior classification on continuous behavior segments. The optimal combination was a stacking model at the 3 s time window using T-acc and T-gyr data, which had an accuracy of 87.8% and a Kappa value of 0.836. It was applied to the behavior classification of three grazing sheep continuously for a total of 67.5 h on pasture with three different sward surface heights (SSH). The results revealed that the three sheep had the longest walking, grazing and resting times on the short, medium and tall SHH, respectively. These findings can be used to support grazing sheep management and the evaluation of production performance.

AB  - Simple Summary CuSO4 is a commonly used growth-promoting agent in pig production. It is clear that long-term intake of excess CuSO4 will damage the reproductive performance of pigs. To better understand the toxic mechanism of CuSO4 and the alleviating effect of quercetin on it, the oxidative stress level and mitochondrial status of porcine follicular granulosa cells treated with CuSO4, or quercetin combined with CuSO4 were investigated in this study. Our results suggest that quercetin could alleviate toxicity induced by high levels of copper in porcine ovarian granulosa cells by scavenging ROS and improving mitochondrial function.Abstract CuSO4 is the most commonly used feed additive in pig production at present, but long-term ingestion of excessive copper would lead to chronic copper toxicity. High copper could reduce the reproductive efficiency of sows and seriously affect the development of the pig industry. Quercetin (QUE), a powerful antioxidant, reduces toxicity of a number of heavy metals. Porcine granulosa cells (pGCs) are crucial to the fate of follicle development. The present study found that high concentrations of CuSO4 induced ROS production, which resulted in decreased mRNA expression of antioxidant-related genes GPX4, CAT, and SOD2 and increased mRNA expression of SOD1, TRX, and HO-1. The protein expression of antioxidant enzymes SOD2 and HO-1 decreased. Moreover, the concentration of MDA increased, the activity of CAT decreased, and the content of GSH decreased. After high copper treatment, the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was decreased and the morphological structure was changed. However, the combined treatment with Quercetin (QUE) reversed these changes, and the level of cellular oxidative stress decreased. Therefore, we conclude that high copper has oxidative toxicity to pGCs, and QUE could remove the ROS induced by high copper, protect mitochondria from oxidative stress damage, and improve the function of pGCs.

AB  - The development of new technologies during the processes of Anaerobic Digestion (AD) has occurred through the use of new types of additives, to maximize the CH4 production. Therefore, this study aimed to technically analyze the effect of magnetite powder in the AD process of the pigs' litter in anaerobic reactors under mesophilic conditions. In this sense, the experiments were carried out in triplicate under two sequential processes to analyze the physicochemical characteristics and concentrations of trace elements (Fe, Zn, Mn, and Cu) before and after AD. The volume of biogas and yields of CH4 were analyzed under normal conditions of temperature and pressure, to infer the role of magnetite in the digestion process. The results showed that the magnetite powder has a significant impact on yields of methane during the digestion process of pig slurry. The maximum methane generated were 3.82.10(-2) Nm(3)CH(4)/kg vs with the addition of 8 g of magnetite. The minimum methane produced was 2.18.10(-2) Nm(3)CH(4)/kg vs with the addition of 12 g of magnetite. The concentrations of trace elements were consistent with the literature data contributing to the smooth progress of the enzymatic activities of the methanogenic microorganisms.

AB  - Previous studies have raised the hypothesis that laboratory-reared insects may lose their ability to induce plant defenses because induction-associated gut bacteria may be eliminated by antibiotics used in artificial diets. The present study was conducted to determine whether maize (Zea mays L., Poaceae) responses to Spodoptera frugiperda (JE Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) differ when field-collected vs. laboratory-reared insects are feeding. One fifth instar from the laboratory or field was released onto a resistant or a susceptible landrace variety at vegetative stages 4 and 6 (V4 and V6), or plants remained uninfested. Five days later, damage was estimated and sections of maize leaves were fed to forth instars in a Petri dish assay to assess the effects of previous feeding on weight gain, leaf consumption, and nutritional indices of conspecifics. Initially, field-collected larvae caused more damage on V4, but not on V6 maize plants, than laboratory-reared larvae. In V6 plants, the resistant variety showed less leaf damage than the susceptible variety. In a Petri dish assay, there were no differences between effects of laboratory-reared and field-collected larvae on the measured parameters, but larvae from both sources promoted increased susceptibility in maize plants at the V4, but not the V6 stage. This was characterized by higher weight gain and higher efficiency of conversion of ingested food (ECI) (on both maize varieties), and lower metabolic cost (MC) (on one variety) when S. frugiperda larvae fed on leaves pre-infested with laboratory-reared larvae compared to leaves of uninfested plants. Conversely, S. frugiperda larvae fed on leaves pre-infested with field-collected larvae consumed a greater amount of leaf tissue (on both varieties) compared to leaves of uninfested plants. A similar experiment with neonates showed no effects of landrace variety or previous infestation on insect weight and survival, but insects obtained a higher body weight when fed on V4 compared to V6 plants. In conclusion, S. frugiperda laboratory-reared larvae were equally able as field-collected larvae to induce susceptibility in V4 maize plants, and maize plants were more resistant to the pest at the V6 than at the V4 stage.

AB  - Porcine respiratory complex syndrome has a strong economic impact on the swine breeding sector, as well as a clear repercussion on the wellbeing of the animals, leading to overuse of antimicrobial molecules. Algal extracts used in short-term treatments are empirically recognized by farmers as having a positive effect on pigs' health, however, their mechanisms of action are not well known and more research is needed. Herein we studied the short and median term impact of three algal extracts, in vitro, on the pro-inflammatory and antiviral responses of porcine primary blood monocytes and alveolar macrophages, as well as the susceptibility of the treated cells to infection by Porcine Respiratory and Reproductive Syndrome Virus (PRRSV) and the Aujeszky's Disease Virus (ADV). All extracts presented a pro-inflammatory short-term effect, associated for two of them, with an inhibition of the PRRSV replication. Conversely, the three extracts presented an anti-inflammatory median term effect, with no impact on PRRSV replication. The observed immune modulation prompts us to test, in vivo, the anti-PRRSV action of algal extracts and strengthen the interest for this natural resource.

AB  - Desert dust exposure is associated with adverse respiratory health effects. Desert dust is a complex pollutant mixtures that includes respirable crystalline and amorphous particles, metals, and microbial constituents. Given the health effects of desert dust and its heterogeneity, as yet unidentified harmful biological pathways may be triggered. Therefore, we exposed human in vitro air-liquid interface co-cultures of alveolar epithelial A549 cells and THP-1 macrophages to Saharan dust (SD). For comparison, we used the known pulmonary toxicant DQ12 quartz dust. Via RNA sequencing, we identified that SD but not DQ12 increased the gene expression of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF). These findings were confirmed by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR. SD dose-dependently upregulated GMCSF and GCSF expression with significant 7 and 9-fold changes, respectively, at the highest tested concentration of 31 mu g/cm2. Furthermore, we observed that SD significantly enhanced the secretion of GM-CSF and GCSF by 2-fold. Both cytokines have previously been associated with lung diseases such as asthma and fibrosis. Hence, we present two molecular messengers that may contribute to the adverse health effects of desert dust and might serve as drug targets for this globally relevant non-anthropogenic air pollutant.

AB  - The comment titled "Factors related to Bacillus thuringiensis and gut physiology" disputes some of the inferences in the paper "An Alkaline Foregut Protects Herbivores from Latex in Forage, but Increases Their Susceptibility to Bt Endotoxin" published in this journal. The key points in the dissent are the following: 1. Bt is generally safe to non-target species. 2. Transgenic Bt crops provide additional ecological benefits due to reductions in conventional pesticide use. 3. Susceptibility to Bt does not indicate alkalinity, nor vice versa. My response is summarized as follows: 1. Bt can form non-specific pores at concentrations of 100 ng/mL in culture, and so is potentially unsafe for animals with gut environments in which Bt persists at or above this level. 2. Initial reductions in insecticide applications have not been sustained and are even increasing in areas planted with transgenic Bt cotton. 3. Acidic guts degrade Bt more efficiently, but I concede that gut alkalinity does not imply susceptibility to Bt due to many factors including resistance in target species, toxin heterogeneity and variable modes of action. However, the susceptibility of foregut-fermenting herbivores with alkaline guts to Bt intoxication cannot be invalidated without further study.

AB  - We have previously shown that normoxia serum-starved extracellular vesicle (EV) therapy improves myocardial function, perfusion, and angiogenesis in a swine model of chronic myocardial ischemia. Hypoxia-modified EVs have increased abundance of anti-oxidant, pro-angiogenic, and pro-survival proteins. The purpose of this study is to investigate the differential effects of normoxia serum-starved EVs and hypoxia-modified EVs on myocardial function, perfusion, and microvascular density in chronically ischemic myocardium. Yorkshire swine underwent placement of an ameroid constrictor to the left circumflex artery to induce chronic myocardial ischemia. Two weeks later, the pigs underwent intramyocardial injection of either normoxia serum-starved EVs (NOR, n = 10) or hypoxia-modified EVs (HYP, n = 7). Five weeks later, pigs were euthanized, and ischemic myocardium was harvested. Hypoxia EV treatment was associated with improved contractility compared to NOR, as well as improved capillary density, without changes in arteriolar density. There were trends towards improved perfusion at rest and during pacing in the HYP group compared to NOR. Ischemic myocardium in the HYP group had increased pro-angiogenic Akt and ERK signaling and decreased expression of anti-angiogenic markers compared to the NOR group. In the setting of chronic myocardial ischemia, hypoxia-modified EVs may enhance contractility, capillary density, and angiogenic signaling pathways compared to normoxia serum-starved EVs.

AB  - Livestock farming has exerted intense environmental pressure on our planet. The high emissions to the environment and the high demands of resources for the production process have encouraged the search for decarbonization and circularity in the livestock sector. In this context, the objective of this study was to evaluate and compare the environmental performance of two different uses for biogas generated in the anaerobic digestion of animal waste, either for electricity generation or biomethane. For this purpose, a life cycle assessment approach was applied to evaluate the potential of anaerobic digestion as a management technology for three different livestock wastes, related to beef cattle, dairy, and sheep in the Brazilian animal production context. The results suggest that the treatment scenarios focusing on biomethane generation were able to mitigate the highest percentage of damages (77 to 108%) in the global warming category when compared to the scenarios without the use of anaerobic digestion (3.00 center dot 102 to 3.71 center dot 103 kgCO2 eq) or in the perspective of electricity generation (mitigation of 74 to 96%). In terms of freshwater eutrophication, the generation of electricity (- 2.17 center dot 10-2 to 2.31 center dot 10-3 kg P eq) is more favorable than the purification of biogas to biomethane (- 1.73 center dot 10-2 to 2.44 center dot 10-3 kg P eq), due to the loss of methane in the upgrading process. In terms of terrestrial ecotoxicity, all scenarios are very similar, with negative values (- 1.19 center dot 101 to - 7.17 center dot 102 kg 1,4-DCB) due to the benefit of nutrient recovery, especially nitrogen, associated with the use of digestate as fertilizer, which was one of the critical points in all scenarios. Based on these results, it is evident that proper management of all stages of the treatment life cycle is the key to decarbonization and circularity in livestock waste management. The biogas use does not present different effects on the environmental performance of the scenarios studied, demonstrating that the purpose should be chosen according to the needs of each plant or management system.

AB  - Normal neurodevelopment requires precise expression of the key ubiquitin ligase gene Ube3a. Comparing newly generated mouse models for Ube3a downregulation (models of Angelman syndrome) vs. Ube3a upregulation (models for autism), we find reciprocal effects of Ube3a gene dosage on phenotypes associated with circadian rhythmicity, including the amount of locomotor activity. Consistent with results from neurons in general, we find that Ube3a is imprinted in neurons of the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), the pacemaking circadian brain locus, despite other claims that SCN neurons were somehow exceptional to these imprinting rules. In addition, Ube3a-deficient mice lack the typical drop in wake late in the dark period and have blunted responses to sleep deprivation. Suppression of physical activity by light in Ube3a-deficient mice is not due to anxiety as measured by behavioral tests and stress hormones; quantification of stress hormones may provide a mechanistic link to sleep alteration and memory deficits caused by Ube3a deficiency, and serve as an easily measurable biomarker for evaluating potential therapeutic treatments for Angelman syndrome. We conclude that reduced Ube3a gene dosage affects not only neurodevelopment but also sleep patterns and circadian rhythms.

AB  - Comparative studies were carried out on the fattening of the lambs from the Sharri and Kosova strains of sheep raised in a traditional way, which is still practiced in Kosova today. To examine the weight, 24 lambs of each strain (Sharri and Kosova) were taken and were reared in the traditional way for up to 100 days. The dynamics of the body mass of the lambs was monitored every 10 days. The average birth weight of the lambs from the Sharri breed is 4.156 kg and for the Kosova breed 3.558 kg. The lambs from both strains have doubled the male yeast on the 20th day, when the Sharri strain of lambs have a live weight of 8.381 kg, and the Kosova strain has a live weight of 7.637 kg. The lambs are with their mothers until the 40th day and are fed with meadow hay and ground corn. On the 40th day, the lambs from the Sharri strain had achieved a dry weight of 11.116 kg, while those from the Kosovar strain reached 10.593 kg. The lambs from the 40th day to the 100th day are separated from their mothers during the day and are fed with meadow hay and ground corn, the sheep crawl at night and then the lambs are let loose and stay overnight with their mothers until the 100th day. On the 100th day when they were slaughtered, the lambs of the Sharri strain achieved a live weight of 24.903 kg and the Kosova strain of 23.191 kg. The slaughter rate of lambs from the Sharri strain is 52.06% and for the Kosova strain 49.02%. The share of muscle tissue in the mass of the carcass in the Sharri strain is 56.586%, fat tissue with 19.914% and bone tissue with 23.631%, in the Kosova strain, muscle tissue is represented by 55.384%, fat by 18.752% and bone by 26.586%. The average daily growth rates obtained is a result of the breed and the diet.

AB  - Simple Summary: The transition from sow's milk to a vegetable-based diet around weaning is one of the most critical periods in a pig's life, due to the strong association between undigested nutrients and post weaning diarrhoea. For practical and economic reasons, piglets are weaned before their gastro-intestinal tract has fully developed. Early provision of creep feed could be one way of promoting gut maturation and may thus be used as a preventive tool for post weaning diarrhoea instead of medicinal zinc oxide. Increasing the activity of enzymes involved in the digestive processes might enhance gut maturation, thereby preparing the piglet for weaning. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the effect of dry and liquid creep feed on growth performance, enzyme activity and the number of pigs actually consuming creep feed. In conclusion, in this on-farm setup, the pigs fed the dry diet displayed a greater enzyme activity in the proximal part of the small intestine and a higher weight gain, suggesting more mucosal maturation and adaptation to a vegetable-based diet.The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of two dietary treatments (liquid creep feed (LCF) and dry creep feed (DCF)) offered during the suckling period on feed disappearance, number of eaters, and intestinal enzymatic development at weaning in an on-farm study with 347 piglets. Piglets were allocated to either the DCF or LCF treatment from day 10 to day 24 postpartum for 9 h a day. Red ferric oxide (1%) was added to the diet to categorize piglets into eating categories (good eaters, moderate eaters, or non-eaters) via faecal swabs. At weaning, 40 piglets were sampled for intestinal enzymatic development. The LCF treatment increased the dry matter disappearance from day 10-18 (p < 0.001). The percentage of good eaters, moderate eaters and non-eaters did not differ between treatments (p > 0.05). The DCF pigs displayed greater average daily gain (ADG) pre-weaning (p = 0.024), and a greater body weight (BW) at day 61 (p < 0.001). The activity of lactase, maltase and sucrase in the proximal part of the small intestine were greatest (p < 0.001) in the DCF pigs.

AB  - Ketamine hydrochloride serves multiple purposes, including its use as a general anesthetic, treatment for depression, and recreational drug. In studies involving rodents, ketamine is utilized as a model for schizophrenia. However, it is unclear whether age affects the behavioral response induced by repeated ketamine administration and if it modifies the expression levels of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) and purinergic receptors (P2X1, P2X4, P2X7). In the present study, we evaluated the effect of intraperitoneal administration of subanesthetic ketamine dose (30 mg/Kg) for fourteen days on young (35 days of age) and adult (76 days of age) mice on different behavioral tests. Nest-building behavior was evaluated during the fourteen-day treatment; short-term memory and social interaction tests were assessed twenty-four hours after the last administration of ketamine. Interestingly, only adult mice treated with ketamine showed impaired nest-building and novel object recognition. In the hippocampus, an area related to memory and cognition, ketamine administration showed no changes in the relative expression of GluN1, P2X4, and P2X7 while increasing GluA2 and P2X1 only in young mice. In contrast, when assessing the protein levels of P2X1 and P2X7 in the hippocampus following ketamine treatment, young mice exhibited a decrease in P2X1 levels while P2X7 levels increased. In contrast, adult mice showed the opposite pattern; P2X1 levels were higher, and P2X7 levels decreased. These results suggest that adult mice are more vulnerable to repeated ketamine administration than young mice and that a differential response of P2X1 and P2X7 might contribute to ketamine-induced behavioral changes.

AB  - Diagnosis of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), or prion diseases, is based on the detection of proteinase K (PK)-resistant PrPSc in post-mortem tissues as indication of infection and disease. Since PrPSc detection is not considered a reliable method for in vivo diagnosis in most TSEs, it is of crucial importance to identify an alternative source of biomarkers to provide useful alternatives for current diagnostic methodology. Ovine scrapie is the prototype of TSEs and has been known for a long time. Using this natural model of TSE, we investigated the presence of PrPSc in exosomes derived from plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) and the levels of candidate microRNAs (miRNAs) by quantitative PCR (qPCR). Significant scrapie-associated increase was found for miR-21-5p in plasma-derived but not in CSF-derived exosomes. However, miR-342-3p, miR-146a-5p, miR-128-3p and miR-21-5p displayed higher levels in total CSF from scrapie-infected sheep. The analysis of overexpressed miRNAs in this biofluid, together with plasma exosomal miR-21-5p, could help in scrapie diagnosis once the presence of the disease is suspected. In addition, we found the presence of PrPSc in most CSF-derived exosomes from clinically affected sheep, which may facilitate in vivo diagnosis of prion diseases, at least during the clinical stage.

AB  - In the present study, the phylogenetic relationship among Myliobatiformes was reconstructed from the Indian waters based on the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COXI) gene. Overall, 307 sequences (18 collected from Mandapam fish landing centres, Tamil Nadu, and 289 from the previous literatures) from 34 species of Myliobatiformes were clustered under two major phylogenetic clades. The families Mobulidae, Rhinopteridae, Plesiobatidae, and Gymuridae were monophyletic, while the families Myliobatidae and Dasyatidae were polyphyletic. Further, the genera Aetomylaeus (Myliobatidae) and Pateobatis (Dasyatidae) show polyphyly by showing deep genetic divergence in the phylogenetic tree. Based on the phylogenetic tree analysis, Himanutra uarnak appears to be H. tutul in the Indian waters. Similarly, Neotrygon indica should be consistently used instead of N. kuhlii, as Indian specimens forms a distinct subclade within N. kuhlii species complex. In this study, it is also observed that several entries in the NCBI GenBank are erroneous; thus, an updation of data is recommended based on the present study. The biogeographic patterns revealed H. tutul, Maculabatis gerrardi, Brevitrygon imbricata, and Gymnura poecilura from the Indian coast form a separate haplotype compared to other geographical areas (Indo-west Pacific). In addition, G. poecilura and B. imbricata were genetically divergent between east and west coast populations of India, indicating a possibility of cryptic species.

AB  - The introduction and the later dispersal of domestic cattle in China had played an enormous part in food production, handicraft manufacture, and ritual activities. However, we lack the details of pastoral economies, herding strategies, and utilization patterns of cattle in ancient China. This study, for the first time, uses biometrical assessments to investigate post-domesticated cattle husbandry and how it changed over time. Biometric data from eight sites dating from the Late Neolithic to the Late Bronze Age were evaluated using kernel analysis and mixture analysis. Results indicated that the general body size of cattle first decrease and then increase. By combining the estimated distribution of male and female individuals, we can see that the sex ratios affect size variation during Bronze Age times. Although no breed improvement has been detected so far, the herding and slaughtering strategies over time are different.

AB  - Simple SummaryThe quality of in vitro matured oocytes is usually lower than that of in vivo matured oocytes, possibly due to the absence of some important signal regulators in vitro. In this study, we found that progesterone and androstenedione were upregulated in FF during in vivo pig oocyte maturation. The supplementation of progesterone or androstenedione during in vitro maturation significantly improved the pig oocyte maturation rate or subsequent embryo developmental competence.Oocytes matured in vitro are useful for assisted human and farm animal reproduction. However, the quality of in vitro matured oocytes is usually lower than that of in vivo matured oocytes, possibly due to the absence of some important signal regulators in vitro. In this study, untargeted metabolomics was used to detect the changes in the metabolites in the follicular fluid (FF) during in vivo pig oocyte maturation and in the culture medium during in vitro maturation. Our results showed that the total metabolite changing profile of the in vivo FF was different from that of the in vitro maturation medium, but the levels of 23 differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs) changed by following the same trend during both in vivo and in vitro pig oocyte maturation. These 23 metabolites may be important regulators of porcine oocyte maturation. We found that progesterone and androstenedione, two factors in the ovarian steroidogenesis pathway enriched from the DEMs, were upregulated in the FF during in vivo pig oocyte maturation. The levels of these two factors were 31 and 20 fold, respectively, and they were higher in the FF than in the culture medium at the oocyte mature stage. The supplementation of progesterone and androstenedione during in vitro maturation significantly improved the pig oocyte maturation rate and subsequent embryo developmental competence. Our finding suggests that a metabolic abnormality during in vitro pig oocyte maturation affects the quality of the matured oocytes. This study identified some important metabolites that regulate oocyte maturation and their developmental potential, which will be helpful to improve assisted animal and human reproduction.

AB  - The antler is the unique mammalian organ found to be able to regenerate completely and periodically after loss, and the continuous proliferation and differentiation of mesenchymal cells and chondrocytes together complete the regeneration of the antler. Circular non-coding RNAs (circRNAs) are considered to be important non-coding RNAs that regulate body development and growth. However, there are no reports on circRNAs regulating the antler regeneration process. In this study, full-transcriptome high-throughput sequencing was performed on sika deer antler interstitial and cartilage tissues, and the sequencing results were verified and analyzed. The competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network related to antler growth and regeneration was further constructed, and the differentially expressed circRNA2829 was screened out from the network to study its effect on chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation. The results indicated that circRNA2829 promoted cell proliferation and increased the level of intracellular ALP. The analysis of RT-qPCR and Western blot demonstrated that the mRNA and protein expression levels of genes involved in differentiation rose. These data revealed that circRNAs play a crucial regulatory role in deer antler regeneration and development. CircRNA2829 might regulate the antler regeneration process through miR-4286-R+1/FOXO4.

AB  - The ability to make predictions based on stored information is a general coding strategy. A prediction error (PE) is a mismatch between expected and current events. Our memories, like ourselves, are subject to change. Thus, an acquired memory can become active and update its content or strength by a labilization-reconsolidation process. Within the reconsolidation framework, PE drives the updating of consolidated memories. In the past our lab has made key progresses showing that a blockade in the central cholinergic system during reconsolidation can cause memory impairment, while reinforcement of cholinergic activity enhances it. In the present work we determined that PE is a necessary condition for memory to reconsolidate in an inhibitory avoidance task using both male and female mice. Depending on the intensity of the unconditioned stimulus (US) used during training, a negative (higher US intensity) or positive (lower US intensity/no US) PE on a retrieval session modified the behavioral response on a subsequent testing session. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the cholinergic system modulates memory reconsolidation only when PE is detected. In this scenario administration of oxotremorine, scopolamine or nicotine after memory reactivation either enhanced or impaired memory reconsolidation in a sex-specific manner.

AB  - Pearl oyster shells comprise two layers, a prismatic and nacreous layer, of calcium carbonate. The nacreous layer has been used in Chinese medicine since ancient times. In this study, we investigated the effects of the extract from the nacreous layer of pearl oysters (nacre extract) on D-galactose-induced brain and skin aging. Treatment with nacre extract led to the recovery of D-galactose-induced memory impairment, as examined using the Barnes maze, novel object recognition, and Y-maze tests. A histological study showed that nacre extract suppressed D-galactose-induced neuronal cell death and the expression of B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)-associated X protein (Bax), which causes apoptosis in the hippocampus. In addition, the expression levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which counteracts age-related brain dysfunction, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent deacetylase (sirtuin 1), which delays aging and extends lifespan, increased after nacre extract treatment. Moreover, the nacre extract showed anti-aging effects against D-galactose-induced skin aging; it suppressed D-galactose-induced wrinkle formation, decreased skin moisture, decreased epidermal thickness, and destroyed collagen arrangement associated with aging. Furthermore, the nacre extract suppressed oxidative stress associated with aging in the brain and skin by upregulating the expression of catalase and superoxide dismutase. The expression level of the cellular senescence marker p16, which is induced by oxidative stress, was elevated in the hippocampus and skin epidermal layer of D-galactose-treated mice, and it was suppressed by the administration of nacre extract. These results show that the nacre extract can suppress D-galactose-induced aging by enhancing anti-oxidant activity and suppressing p16 expression. Thus, the nacre extract may be an effective anti-aging agent.

AB  - Obsessive -compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic and debilitating illness that has been considered a polygenic and multifactorial disorder, challenging effective therapeutic interventions. Although invaluable advances have been obtained from human and rodent studies, several molecular and mechanistic aspects of OCD etiology are still obscure. Thus, the use of non-traditional animal models may foster innovative approaches in this field, aiming to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of disease from an evolutionary perspective. The zebrafish (Danio rerio) has been increasingly considered a powerful organism in translational neuroscience research, especially due to the intrinsic features of the species. Here, we outline target mechanisms of OCD for translational research, and discuss how zebrafish-based models can contribute to explore neurobehavioral aspects resembling those found in OCD. We also identify possible advantages and limitations of potential zebrafish-based models, as well as highlight future directions in both etiological and therapeutic research. Lastly, we reinforce the use of zebrafish as a promising tool to unravel the biological basis of OCD, as well as novel pharmacological therapies in the field.

AB  - Camelina sativa has considerable promise as a dedicated industrial oilseed crop. Its oil-based blends have been tested and approved as liquid transportation fuels. Previously, we utilized metabolomic and transcriptomic profiling approaches and identified metabolic bottlenecks that control oil production and accumulation in seeds. Accordingly, we selected candidate genes for the metabolic engineering of Camelina. Here we targeted the overexpression of Camelina PDCT gene, which encodes the phosphatidylcholine: diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase enzyme. PDCT is proposed as a gatekeeper responsible for the interconversions of diacylglycerol (DAG) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) pools and has the potential to increase the levels of TAG in seeds. To confirm whether increased CsPDCT activity in developing Camelina seeds would enhance carbon flux toward increased levels of TAG and alter oil composition, we overexpressed the CsPDCT gene under the control of the seed-specific phaseolin promoter. Camelina transgenics exhibited significant increases in seed yield (19-56%), seed oil content (9-13%), oil yields per plant (32-76%), and altered polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) content compared to their parental wild-type (WT) plants. Results from [14C] acetate labeling of Camelina developing embryos expressing CsPDCT in culture indicated increased rates of radiolabeled fatty acid incorporation into glycerolipids (up to 64%, 59%, and 43% higher in TAG, DAG, and PC, respectively), relative to WT embryos. We conclude that overexpression of PDCT appears to be a positive strategy to achieve a synergistic effect on the flux through the TAG synthesis pathway, thereby further increasing oil yields in Camelina.

AB  - The application of organic manure is an effective way to develop sustainable agriculture. However, the application of organic manure may be associated with a potential risk of heavy metal pollution for soil and crops. In this study, the effects of organic cow manure (T1) (as base fertilizer), organic pig manure (T2) (as base fertilizer) and chemical fertilizer (T3) on winter wheat grain yields, grain quality, heavy metal concentrations and heavy metal bioconcentration factors (BCFs) in a soil-wheat system were studied from November 2021 to June 2023. The results showed that the winter wheat grain yields in the T1 and T2 treatments were lower than those in the T3 treatment by 2.57-38.0% and 10.5-25%, respectively. There were no significant differences in quality indexes of winter wheat grain among different fertilizer treatments. The concentrations of heavy metals in topsoil and winter wheat were 0.12-76.11 mu g/g and 0.01-43.25 mu g/g, respectively. The BCFs of heavy mental in the soil-wheat grain system was 0-2.92. In general, there were no significant differences in heavy metals' concentrations in topsoil and wheat grain among different fertilizer treatments. In summary, compared with chemical fertilizer, the short-term application of organic manures had no significant effect on heavy metals concentrations in topsoil and wheat.

AB  - Simple Summary To relieve stress during the weaning of piglets, pig farmers use functional feed additives that improve gastrointestinal function. Fermented products show this kind of potential. Fermented rapeseed meal is a source of valuable protein and also has a positive effect on animals' health parameters and gastrointestinal microbiota. In this work, we demonstrated that fermentation is an effective way to improve the nutritional value of rapeseed meal. The results also showed that the presence of lactic acid bacteria in diets containing a fermented component had a positive effect on metabolic processes in pigs. As the content of lactic acid is stable over time, it favourably influences the feed microbiota, which translates into animal health. The study assessed the influence of rapeseed meal (RSM) fermented using Bacillus subtilis 87Y on the feed microbiota, intestinal microbiota, blood biochemical parameters, and content of minerals in the blood plasma and faeces of piglets. Modulation of the microbial composition of feed containing fermented rapeseed meal (FRSM) and of the faeces of pigs consuming it was observed. There was a significant increase in the number of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and a decrease in the total number of coliforms and Clostridium perfringens in the faeces of animals from the experimental groups. FRSM in the diet of piglets was shown to improve the mineral balance by increasing the levels of P, Ca, and Mg in the blood plasma and reducing their amount in the faeces. A beneficial effect on parameters of protein and lipid metabolism was also noted, resulting in an increase in the levels of total protein (TP) and albumins (ALB) and a reduction in triacylglycerols (TG) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in the blood plasma of the piglets. The research results indicate that the presence of FRSM in the diet of weaners can be a preventive factor in intestinal dysbiosis and support the maintenance of homeostasis.

AB  - Pig face recognition plays an important role in the intelligent breeding and accurate management of pigs, and the mobile and embedded applications of this technology in the management of small and medium-sized pig farms are in great demand; therefore, in order to make the model more suitable for use in small and medium-sized pig farms, in this study, PCA pre-treatment was added to the traditional method. The experiment shows that the model is suitable for small and medium-sized pig farms, and it can promote the intelligent transformation of pig breeding management.To explore the application of a traditional machine learning model in the intelligent management of pigs, in this paper, the influence of PCA pre-treatment on pig face identification with RF is studied. By this testing method, the parameters of two testing schemes, one adopting RF alone and the other adopting RF + PCA, were determined to be 65 and 70, respectively. With individual identification tests carried out on 10 pigs, accuracy, recall, and f1-score were increased by 2.66, 2.76, and 2.81 percentage points, respectively. Except for the slight increase in training time, the test time was reduced to 75% of the old scheme, and the efficiency of the optimized scheme was greatly improved. It indicates that PCA pre-treatment positively improved the efficiency of individual pig identification with RF. Furthermore, it provides experimental support for the mobile terminals and the embedded application of RF classifiers.

AB  - Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a progressive deteriorating mental state with a feeling of worthlessness and frequent mood swings. Several studies reported the favorable effects of natural drug substances on MMD associated oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. The present study is attempted to examine whether carveol could affect lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) induced depression, and if so, how nuclear factor E2-related factor (Nrf2) contributed to the neuroprotective effects of carveol mechanistically. Two experimental cohorts were used using the SD rats: first to evaluate the promising dose of carveol (whether 20 mg/kg or 50 mg/kg) and secondly to determine the effect of carveol on Nrf2-mediated antidepression. Significant neuronal alterations were noticed in the cortex and hippocampus regions in the LPS-treated group, accompanied by elevated inflammatory cytokine levels such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), cyclooxygenase (COX-2), and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (p-JNK). Moreover, amassing of free radicals exacerbated lipid peroxidase (LPO) and oxidative stress with a limited antioxidant capacity. Carveol (20 mg/kg) significantly ameliorated these detrimental effects by promoting the antioxidant Nrf2 gene and protein, which critically regulate the downstream antioxidant and anti-inflammatory pathway. To further elaborate our hypothesis, we employed all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), an Nrf2 inhibitor, and we found that ATRA exaggerated LPS-induced depressive-like effects associated with elevated neuroinflammatory markers. Our results demonstrated that carveol (20 mg/kg) could activate the endogenous antioxidant Nrf2, which regulates the downstream antioxidant signaling pathway, eventually leading to amelioration of LPS-induced neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration.

AB  - The massive generation of pig manure significantly contributes to the emission of greenhouse gases; in addition, its poor disposal represents a serious risk to human and animal health. In recent years, the microbial fermentation process has become relevant because it is considered a circular bioeconomy strategy, guaranteeing the recovery of agro-industrial waste and waste management. In this work, the production of lactic acid and biomass was evaluated from an anaerobic bioconversion process of swine residues in the presence of L. acidophilus. A 5 L capacity reactor was used, and different stirring speeds were evaluated (100, 150, and 200 rpm). It was concluded that the highest production of lactic acid and biomass was 30.15 and 111.52 g/L, respectively, which were reached during the experiments carried out at 100 rpm. The biomass was analyzed to determine the content of carbohydrates, proteins, and cell count, which were 0 g/L, 17.16%, and 3.45x10(7)cfu/g, respectively. Finally, the fuzzy logic technique was applied, and response surface graphs were generated to determine the variables with the greatest impact on lactic acid and biomass generation.

AB  - Grazing studies were carried out over a 5-year period using pregnant cows, yearling calves and 2-year-old heifers to investigate the influence of diet on intake, methane (CH4) emissions and retention of nitrogen (N). Monoculture legume (birdsfoot trefoil, BFT and cicer milkvetch, CMV) or grass (meadow bromegrass, MBG) pastures were rotationally stocked, and during year 4 and year 5, treatments were contrasted with total mixed rations (TMR) fed in confinement. The sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) method was used to continuously measure enteric CH4 emissions. Intake was greater on legume pastures and on TMR than on grass pastures, and enteric CH4 emissions per unit of intake were lower on legumes compared with grass pastures. Legume pastures had elevated non-fiber carbohydrate (NFC) concentrations (400 g kg(-1) dry matter; DM) typical of perennial legumes cultivated in the Mountain West. A N balance calculated in 2017-2018 demonstrated that N retention was greater for TMR and legume than grass pastures. Enteric CH4 emissions of grazing cow herds account for the majority of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from beef production and can be significantly reduced by using highly digestible forage legumes. The N retention of legumes can potentially enhance the efficiency of N use, thereby increasing the sustainability of grasslands.

AB  - Early pregnancy failure occurs when a mature embryo attaches to an unreceptive endometrium. During the formation of a receptive endometrium, extracellular vesicles (EVs) of the uterine fluids (UFs) deliver regulatory molecules such as small RNAs to mediate intrauterine communication between the embryo and the endometrium. However, profiling of small RNAs in goat UFs' EVs during pregnancy recognition (day 16) has not been carried out. In this study, EVs were isolated from UFs on day 16 of the estrous cycle or gestation. They were isolated by Optiprep (TM) Density G radient (ODG) and verified by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), and Western blotting. Immunostaining demonstrated that CD63 was present both in the endometrial epithelium and glandular epithelium, and stain intensity was greater in the pregnant endometrium compared to the non-pregnant endometrium. Small RNA sequencing revealed that UFs' EVs contained numerous sRNA families and a total of 106 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs). Additionally, 1867 target genes of the DEMs were obtained, and miRNA-mRNA interaction networks were constructed. GO and KEGG analysis showed that miRNAs were significantly associated with the formation of a receptive endometrium and embryo implantation. In addition, the fluorescence in situ hybridization assay (FISH) showed that chi-miR-451-5p was mainly expressed in stromal cells of the endometrium and a higher level was detected in the endometrial luminal epithelium in pregnant states. Moreover, the dual-luciferase reporter assay showed that chi-miR-451-5p directly binds to PSMB8 and may play an important role in the formation of a receptive endometrium and embryo implantation. In conclusion, these results reveal that UFs' EVs contain various small RNAs that may be vital in the formation of a receptive endometrium and embryo implantation.

In this study, we analysed suggested changes to the Swedish welfare legislation between 1988 and 2019 relating to horses, cattle and pigs, including the written motivations, the written stakeholder responses and the actual changes to the final regulations. We used a sample of 77 legal requirements to assess in depth whether the animal welfare level was affected by these changes in the legislation. The results showed that the animal welfare requirements in Sweden for cattle, pigs and horses increased overall during the 30-year study period, but that a number of specific requirements had been relaxed to satisfy interests other than animal welfare. Thus, the new requirements should be evaluated more fully in order to determine whether they serve their purpose in practice.</p>

   Sweden is often seen as a leading country in animal welfare and legislation, but some recent amendments to the legislation are perceived as relaxing animal welfare requirements in order to improve the competitiveness of the relevant industry and of farmers. In this study, we analysed the suggested and actual changes in the Swedish national animal welfare regulations relating to horses, cattle and pigs between 1988 and 2019 and the consequences for the intended animal welfare level. The regulations and amendments, including the proposals, the written motivations, the stakeholders' written responses to the proposed amendments and the final amendments, were scrutinised in detail. A sample of 77 requirements was then selected to assess whether and how the animal welfare level was affected by these legislative changes. The results indicated that the animal welfare protection level for cattle, pigs and horses increased overall during the 30-year period, but that a number of specific requirements had been relaxed to meet objectives other than animal welfare. It was more difficult to determine whether animal welfare improved in practice during the same period, due to the lack of systematic evaluations of the consequences of amending the regulations. Future evaluations are needed to evaluate the outcome of new legislative requirements and to monitor whether they serve their purpose in practice.</p>

AB  - The aim of study was to evaluate the use of digital images to predict body weight (BW) and classify the body condition score (BCS) of dairy goats. A total of 154 female Saanen and Alpine goats were used to obtain eight body measurements features from digital images: withers height (WH), rump height (RH), body length (BL), chest depth (D), paw height (PH), chest width (CW), rump width (RW), rump length (RL). All animals were weighed using manual scales, and their BCS was evaluated on a scale of 1 to 5. For classification purposes, the BCS was grouped into three categories: low (1-2), moderate (2-3), and high (>3). Pearson's correlation analysis and the Random Forest algorithm were performed. It was possible to predict BW using image features with an R2 of 0.87, with D (22.14%), CW (18.93%) and BL (15.47%) being the most important variables. For the BCS, the classification accuracy was 0.4054 with the CW (20.38%) the most important variable followed by RH and RL with 15.78% and 12.63%, respectively. It was concluded that digital image features can be used to obtain precise estimates of body weight, but it is necessary to increase data variability to improve the BCS classification of dairy goats.

AB  - PCV2 is one of the most economically important viral agents in swine worldwide. Recently, PCV3 has been frequently reported, and the co-infection of PCV2 and PCV3 is common in China. In order to explore the distribution, epidemiology and genetic diversity of PCV2 and PCV3, a total of 1,760 clinical tissue samples were randomly collected from 18 different regions in Henan province of China from October 2018 to September 2019 and screened for the presence of PCV2 and PCV3 by a duplex real-time PCR assay. The results showed that the positive rates of PCV2 and PCV3 were 72.90% and 5.17% respectively, and the co-infection rate of the two viruses was 3.64%. PCV2 and PCV3 are prevalent all year round. The prevalence of PCV2 in diseased pigs was 83.98%, higher than that in slaughterhouse pigs, while the prevalence of PCV3 in diseased pigs was 2.16%, slightly lower than that in slaughterhouse pigs. Furthermore, the complete genomes of 14 PCV2 and 3 PCV3 strains were obtained, among which 1 belonged to PCV2a, 5 belonged to PCV2b and 8 belonged to PCV2d. A new variant strain (XX2) might escape the host immune system. The phylogenetic analysis of PCV3 showed high nucleotide identity (>98%) between sequences obtained in this study and reference sequences. The results of this study might enrich the epidemiological data of PCV2 and PCV3 in Henan province and provide reference information for the comprehensive prevention and control of PCVAD.

AB  - Monitoring wildlife health in remote and vast regions of the Arctic can be difficult and expensive, but community-based monitoring programs can help alleviate these issues. Reliable bio-monitoring tools, compatible with sample types collected from remote regions, are needed to determine indicators of population health, such as reproductive rates. We sought to establish methods to diagnose pregnancy in muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus) using samples that are commonly collected in harvester-based sampling programs: blood on filter paper and feces. We first evaluated three pregnancy tests, pregnancy-associated glycoproteins (PAG) on filter paper blood samples and fecal progesterone and estrogen metabolites (FPM and FEM), using 12 captive female muskoxen of known pregnancy status. Pregnancy diagnostics using PAG were highly sensitive (100 %) and specific (100 %), with a diagnostic threshold of 19.4 percent positivity (%P) relative to the positive control of the test kit. FPM and FEM diagnostic accuracy differed by hormone and time period. FPM was most accurate in mid-gestation and FEM most accurate in late gestation (sensitivities and specificities of 100 %), but both were overall less accurate than the PAG test during gestation. PAG %P followed a biphasic pattern during gestation, FPM peaked in midgestation, and FEM peaked in late-gestation. Following the captive trial, we applied these tests to fecal samples and blood on filter paper samples from 159 adult female muskoxen that were submitted by harvesters through community-based monitoring programs in the Canadian Arctic. The observed patterns of PAG, FPM, and FEM in wild muskoxen throughout gestation were similar to captive muskoxen, though with lower levels of the respective biomarker, requiring different diagnostic thresholds for each test. This work with captive and wild muskoxen provides guidelines for pregnancy diagnostics in muskoxen throughout gestation using samples that can be easily collected by harvesters, allowing for improved monitoring of difficult to access populations through community-based approaches.

AB  - The continuous increase of costs with mineral fertilisers made farmers search for alternatives, while livestock producers face strong challenges to, sustainably, manage large amount of manure. It is, therefore, important to provide strategies that could enhance the use of manures in agriculture, recycling nutrients and organic matter. This study aimed to evaluate the use of manure-based fertilisers (MBFs), with tailored N:P2O5 ratios, to values commonly used by farmers: 1:1, 2:1 and 0.5:1. These MBFs were applied to a sandy soil and the resulting nitrogen mineralisation, nitrification rates and greenhouse gases emission were measured. Raw manures (cattle slurry [CaS], pig slurry [PiS] and poultry manure [PoM]) were used directly to obtain the 1:1 N:P2O5 ratio. For the 2:1 ratio, two MBFs were produced with each raw manure, plus the addition of urea or ammonium sulphate to provide additional N. To prepare the P richer fertiliser with a 0.5:1 ratio, the pig slurry solid fraction was used on its own, while the CaS and PoM were blended with superphosphate (SP) or with phosphoric acid, to provide additional P. In the 1:1 ratio, both slurries had higher mineralisation rates (similar to 35% of the organic N applied) and lower environmental impact, compared with PoM. Blending PoM with urea, for the 2:1 ratio, improved the N mineralisation rate, while decreasing the N2O and CO2 emissions to almost half the value observed with the raw PoM, enhancing its fertiliser value. The addition of SP to PoM decreased the N2O emissions and presented a similar nitrification rate as the raw material. The results demonstrate that it is possible to produce MBFs with these specific N:P2O5 ratios, with potential agronomical and environmental benefits, compared with the raw material.

AB  - Under the background of the current promotion of global green, environmental protection, and energy conservation, the sustainable conversion of low-cost agricultural waste biomass into high value-added products has become a hot topic. Herein, agricultural waste camellia seed shells obtained after pressing oil are used to prepare porous carbon materials with a high specific surface area (SSA) and excellent electrochemical properties for the application of supercapacitors. The effects of different chemical activators and mass ratios on the pore structure and electrochemical properties of agricultural waste camellia seed shell-derived activated carbon (CSSC) were investigated. It has been found that the CSSC activated by KOH presents excellent physical and electrochemical performances, and the pore structures of all the prepared activated carbons were predominantly a combination of mesopores and micropores. Especially, owing to the high SSA (1219 m(2) g(-1)) and porous structure of the CSSC-KOH-1:3 material, the electrode provides an outstanding specific capacitance of 305 F g(-1) at a current density of 0.5 A g(-1). Furthermore, the symmetric supercapacitor assembled with CSSC-KOH-1:3 electrodes can deliver a high energy density (15.37 W h kg(-1)) and power density (12.9 kW kg(-1)), and it can still maintain high cycling stability even after 10,000 charge and discharge processes. Therefore, this work provides a significant exploration for the high-value application of the agricultural waste camellia seed shell and low-cost preparation of the porous carbon for the application of high-performance supercapacitors.

AB  - The objective of the present study was to test the hypothesis of B. subtilis and B. licheniformis supplementation to a negative control diet in comparison to a standard control diet, had the potential to improve the performance and nutrient digestibility of growing-finishing pigs. For this purpose, 384 fattening pigs of 85 d of age were allotted to three treatments: a standard diet, a negative control (NC) diet (5% soybean meal replaced by 5% rapeseed meal), or a NC diet + probiotic. After reaching a body weight of approximately 110 kg, all animals going to the slaughterhouse (87% of total pigs) were selected to measure carcass quality. Moreover, the apparent total tract digestibility of protein was evaluated at the end of the grower period. The results of this study indicate that supplementation of the tested Bacillus-based probiotic significantly improved average daily gain (ADG, +14.6%) and Feed:gain ratio (F:G, -9.9%) during the grower phase compared to the NC diet. The improvement observed during the grower phase was maintained for the whole fattening period (ADG, +3.9%). Probiotic supplementation significantly improved the total apparent faecal digestibility of dry matter and crude protein in pigs at the end of the grower period. The improvements observed with the additive tested could indicate that supplementation of the Bacillus-based probiotic was able to counteract the lower level of crude protein and standardised ileal digestible amino acids in the NC diet by means of improved protein digestibility.

AB  - Simple Summary Alternative animal feed sources are being used for the rearing of small ruminants. Among them, the use of agri-food by-products stands out. This strategy meets the demands of consumers towards natural products, offering beneficial effects on meat quality linked to their antioxidant activity properties. In addition, meat ageing allows substantial improvements in palatability attributes, especially tenderness and flavour. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of dietary anthocyanin addition on volatile compounds of meat from goat kids during ageing. For this work, 60 male and female kids were divided into two groups: red orange and lemon extract (RLE group; n = 30), which received an RLE extract (90 mg/kg of live weight); and control (CON group; n = 30). The phytoextract in dry powder form was rich in bioflavonoids such as flavanones (about 16%) and anthocyanins (about 3%). After slaughtering, the longissimus thoracis et lumborum muscle was aged at 4 degrees C. The volatile organic compound (VOC) and sensorial analyses were carried out at 1, 3 and 7 days. A total of 10 chemical families were identified during the ageing process. Aldehydes were the most abundant VOC, followed by ketones and alcohols. Their contents increased during the process, showing after 7 days of ageing mean values of 20,498, 2193 and 1879 ng/g of meat, respectively. Regarding dietary effects, carboxylic acids, hydrocarbons and thiols presented significant differences between treatments, with higher carboxylic acid contents observed in RLE samples (437 vs. 467 ng/g of meat for CON and RLE batches, respectively; p < 0.05). On the contrary, hydrocarbons (436 vs. 254 ng/g of meat for CON and RLE batches, respectively) and thiols (160 vs. 103 ng/g of meat for CON and RLE batches, respectively) displayed significantly (p < 0.01) higher amounts in CON compared to the RLE group. Regarding ageing time, the tenderness, juiciness, odour and overall assessment parameters showed significantly higher scores at the end of the whole process (p < 0.05). On the other hand, only odour displayed significant differences between treatments, reaching higher scores in CON samples (p < 0.05). Therefore, ageing time improved the sensorial properties (tenderness, juiciness, odour and overall assessment) and the VOC content, whereas the inclusion of anthocyanins in the kids' diet did not have a great impact on the properties of aged meat.

AB  - Excess ammonia produced during the decomposition of nitrogen-rich substrates inhibits the anaerobic digestion (AD) process while it increases the concentration of ammonium nitrogen (NH4+) in the digestate. Digestate is commonly applied to farmland, causing nitrogen loss via runoff and volatilization. Therefore, developing an integrated strategy to promote the overall efficiency of AD systems susceptible to ammonia toxicity events, is worthy of consideration. Herein, a step-feeding approach to combat ammonia toxicity in AD process in which, intermittent rather than continuous substrate feeding was tested. A pilot-scale, mesophilic (37 +/- 1 degrees C), fed-batch AD reactor (working volume similar to 6.67 m(3)), was operated as the biomethanation step in a novel biorefinery concept, to recover bioenergy and nutrients (struvite) from pig slurry. The results showed that methane production yield achieved was 89.7 % of the theoretical at high ammonia levels (4.44 g NH4+-N L-1), indicating an efficient AD process under strong ammonia stress. The production rate of precipitate was 4.0 kg t(-1) feedstock, while X-Ray Diffraction analysis revealed that purity of struvite crystal was 98 % w/w. Orthorhombic crystals and homogeneous distribution of significant elements (O, P, N, and Mg) in the precipitate were observed through scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray analysis. Recoveries of nitrogen and phosphorus were 48.5 % and 68.5 % from the digestate, respectively. Furthermore, the chemical and sanitary (i.e., Escherichia coli, Enterobacteriaceae and Salmonella) indicators of the precipitate were in line with the EU Fertilizer Regulation. Overall, the obtained results indicate that it is possible to establish an integrated efficient nutrient and energy recovery process for the simultaneous production of high-yield biogas and high-purity struvite fertilizer from pig slurry, which could yield a gross profit of 5.79 <euro> t(-1) feedstock.

AB  - BackgroundHundreds of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites have been found to be potential genetic markers of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, SNPs related to T2DM in minipigs have been less reported. This study aimed to screen the T2DM-susceptible candidate SNP loci in Bama minipigs so as to improve the success rate of the minipig T2DM model. MethodsThe genomic DNAs of three Bama minipigs with T2DM, six sibling low-susceptibility minipigs with T2DM, and three normal control minipigs were compared by whole-genome sequencing. The T2DM Bama minipig-specific loci were obtained, and their functions were annotated. Meanwhile, the Biomart software was used to perform homology alignment with T2DM-related loci obtained from the human genome-wide association study to screen candidate SNP markers for T2DM in Bama miniature pigs. ResultsWhole-genome resequencing detected 6960 specific loci in the minipigs with T2DM, and 13 loci corresponding to 9 diabetes-related genes were selected. Further, a set of 122 specific loci in 69 orthologous genes of human T2DM candidate genes were obtained in the pigs. Collectively, a batch of T2DM-susceptible candidate SNP markers in Bama minipigs, covering 16 genes and 135 loci, was established. ConclusionsWhole-genome sequencing and comparative genomics analysis of the orthologous genes in pigs that corresponded to the human T2DM-related variant loci successfully screened out T2DM-susceptible candidate markers in Bama miniature pigs. Using these loci to predict the susceptibility of the pigs before constructing an animal model of T2DM may help to establish an ideal animal model.

AB  - Herbivory by defoliating insects affects physiological processes, and it is laborious to quantify using millimeter paper. However, this process is facilitated by digital image analysis (DIA), whose automation is necessary for greater simplicity and repeatability. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the precision and efficiency of automated DIA to measure herbivory in soybean (Glycine max L.) leaflets caused by the cabbage looper Trichoplusia ni Hubner and bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) leaflets caused by the beet armyworm Spodoptera exigua Hubner. The leaflets were digitized with a desktop scanner and measured for their extent of herbivory, dimensions and shape with a Digimizer, LaminaBatch and Macf-IJ, a routine implemented in ImageJ. Resolutions of 100, 200 and 300 pixels per inch (ppi) were compared on the images of the bean leaflets. Thresholds of 115, 135 and 155 were evaluated in the LaminaBatch. The herbivory in the soybean leaflets was measured with Macf-IJ, LaminaBatch and BioLeaf and also estimated visually by six evaluators with and without the use of the Obermeyer scale. Resolutions of 100, 200, and 300 ppi were effective to obtain the dimensions of leaflets from the images and determine the dimensions and amount of defoliation in the bean leaflets, although the efficiency was inversely higher as the resolution increased. Macf-IJ, LaminaBatch with a threshold of 155 and Digimizer were effective at measuring the leaf area and loss of tissue in the soybean and bean leaflets. Macf-IJ was more efficient at measuring the amount of herbivory and the dimensions of the leaflets. The evaluators overestimated the amount of leaf loss in the soybean leaflets, and the use of the Obermeyer scale increased the accuracy. The use of Bioleaf, LaminaBatch, and Macf-IJ make it easy to accurately and precisely measure the amount of herbivory on scanned images.

AB  - Background The optimal use of feed resources must be considered by most livestock farmers. The use of low-cost agricultural by-products and the processing of these materials is one possible solution in this respect. One such compound is edible button mushroom waste (EM), a large amount of which is produced annually in the mushroom production cycle worldwide.
   Results Bulk density 100 of EM was smaller than the other groups. These changes also applied to alfalfa for bulk density, which was higher than the replaced waste. The dry matter solubility of EM was higher than that of alfalfa hay, whereas the ash solubility rate for EM was greater compared to alfalfa. Replacing up to 210 g kg(-1) alfalfa with EM did not affect the production of purine derivatives, microbial protein, nitrogen excreted in urine and feces, and retained nitrogen, although the organic matter digestibility (OMD) increased, whereas the crude protein digestibility and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) decreased (P < 0.05). Fermentation potential, gas production rate, metabolizable energy and short-chain fatty acids were increased. On replacing up to 210 g kg(-1) alfalfa with EM, the diet OMD increased, whereas the crude protein and NDF digestibility decreased (P < 0.05).
   Conclusion EM usage in the experimental diets did not affect the production of purine derivatives, microbial protein, nitrogen excreted in urine and feces, and retained nitrogen. The physical properties, chemical composition and nutritional value of EM, as well as its low cost, show that it can be used as an alternative part of the diet forage in the ruminant's diet.

AB  - Helicoverpa armigera Hubner (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae; Hubner) is the major insect pest of pigeon pea [Cajanus cajan; Fabales: Fabaceae; (L.) Millspaugh] worldwide. Research to develop pest management strategies for H. armigera in pigeon pea has focused heavily on developing less susceptible cultivars, with limited practical success. We examined how pigeon pea crop stage influences plant susceptibility to H. armigera using a combination of glasshouse and laboratory experiments. Plant phenology significantly affected oviposition with moths laying more eggs on flowering and podding plants but only a few on vegetative plants. Larval survival was greatest on flowering and vegetative plants, wherein larvae mostly chose to feed inside flowers on flowering plants and on the adaxial surface of expanding leaves on vegetative plants. Larval survival was poor on podding plants despite moths laying many eggs on plants of this stage. When left to feed without restriction on plants for 7 days, larvae feeding on flowering plants were >10 times the weight of larvae feeding on plants of other phenological stages. On whole plants, unrestricted larvae preferred to feed on pigeon pea flowers and on expanding leaves, but in no-choice Petri dish assays H. armigera larvae could feed and survive on all pigeon pea reproductive structures. Our results show that crop stage and the availability of flowers strongly influence pigeon pea susceptibility to H. armigera. An increased understanding of H. armigera-pigeon pea ecology will be useful in guiding the development of resistant varieties and other management tactics.

AB  - Understanding and quantifying the release of fission products like silver (Ag) from TRistructural ISOtropic (TRISO) fuel particles is important to assess the safe operation of advanced high temperature reactors. Although the silicon carbide (SiC) layer of TRISO particles is effective as the main fission product barrier, Ag can be released from intact TRISO particles. A mechanistic model for the effective Ag diffusivity, D-eff, was previously developed as a function of temperature and microstructure variables informed by atomistic modeling of Ag diffusivity. In this study, we use this model to explore how experimental temperature uncertainties impact the overall predicted Ag release. This analysis indicates that calculated temperature uncertainties have a significant impact on the overall Ag release predictions. Furthermore, we show that the time average volume average (TAVA) temperature is not an appropriate proxy for the detailed temperature histories to predict fission product release due to the Arrhenius dependence of Ag diffusivity with respect to temperature. The detailed temperature histories, therefore, provide the most accurate results and are of most importance for modeling efforts. Overall, this work shows the importance of considering the experimental uncertainty of the temperature on computational predictions of fission product transport and release and the need for more accurate temperature histories from future experiments.

AB  - Ammonia (NH3) is a key PM2.5 precursor that significantly contributes to haze formation and air quality degradation. Livestock farming accounts for more than 50 % of China's annual NH3 emissions, and large-scale pig farms represent a major anthropogenic source. However, the current systematic knowledge of NH3 emissions characteristics from large-scale pig farms is still deficient, and there are insufficient studies localized for China. We conducted year-round intensive monitoring of NH3 emissions from a representative large-scale pig farm in the Yangtze River Delta to quantify the interactions between growth stage and season. In terms of seasonal variation, NH3 emissions peaked in summer at 3.95 kg NH3<middle dot>year(-1)<middle dot>head(-1) and were lowest in winter at 1.53 kg NH3<middle dot>year(-1)<middle dot>head(-1). For the growth stages, we found that the average annual emission factors for piglet houses, nursery houses, fattening houses, gestation houses, and farrowing houses (with some piglets included) were 0.24, 0.84, 1.83, 3.55, and 5.61 kg NH3<middle dot>year(-1)<middle dot>head(-1). In addition, this study found that temperature was the key driver of NH3 emissions (mean Spearman's r = 0.66, P < 0.001), whereas the overall correlation for humidity was weaker, with emissions significantly suppressed only in winter when ventilation was inadequate (average r = 0.49, P < 0.001). Based on local conditions, the farm-level annual NH3 emission factor was determined to be 2.45 kg NH3<middle dot>year(-1)<middle dot>head(-1), highlighting the critical summer period for targeted mitigation. These findings provide a scientific basis for refining regional emission inventories and for developing stage- and season-specific abatement strategies that support PM2.5 control and the sustainable transformation of intensive pig production in the Yangtze River Delta.

AB  - Sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides), a hardy deciduous shrub of the Elaeagnaceae family, grows wild at high altitudes in Asia and Europe and is known for its excellent nutritional, medicinal, and ecological value. However, research on its chloroplast genome is limited. In this study, we sequenced, assembled, and annotated the chloroplast genomes of four subspecies of H. rhamnoides. The structure, nucleotide diversity, simple and long repeat sequence sites, and codon bias of their chloroplast genomes were compared. Their chloroplast genomes (size range 156,185-156,510 bp) consisted of a pair of inverted repeats (IR) sequences (26,658-26,664 bp) separating a small single-copy region (19,025-19064 bp) from a large single-copy region (83,842-84,118 bp). Gene order, IR boundaries, codon usage, and repetitive sequence distribution showed similarities across the four genomes. Except for H. rhamnoides subsp. mongolica 'wulanshalin', which was missing the matK gene, the subspecies contained 131 genes, including 85 protein-coding genes, 38 tRNA genes, and 8 rRNA genes. We also uncovered 373 cpSSRs, 175 long repeat sequences, and 9 regions with high variability worth substantiation in future population genetics research. Meanwhile, a phylogenetic tree of the Elaeagnaceae family was constructed from CDSs, showing that all Hippophae taxa were clustered in the same group and formed a sister clade with Elaeagnus taxa. Among the Hippophae taxa, H. gyantsensis, H. neurcar, and H. salicifolia were grouped, but H. tibetana was clustered with H. rhamnoides.

AB  - Simple Summary Lactating hyperprolific sows present with oxidative stress, which affects feed intake and milk production. The metabolic response of animals is to mobilize body reserves, resulting in a negative energy balance. In this context, this study suggested the use of phytogenic additives in the feed of lactating sows to improve body conditions during the lactation period and milk production, yielding adequate piglet performance. The study verified that using phytogenics in the feed of lactating sows resulted in improved bromatological parameters of the milk and improved the performance of sows and piglets.Abstract The objective was to evaluate the effect of phytogenic supplementation in the feed of lactating sows on the performance parameters of sows and suckling piglets. Ninety-three lactating sows of commercial lines (sows TN70) were distributed in a completely randomized design. The treatments adopted were a control diet without phytogenics (control) and a control diet with phytogenic supplementation in the feed. Performance parameters and the behaviors of sows and piglets were evaluated, in addition to milk composition and the biochemical parameters of the animals. The use of phytogenics did not affect the feed intake or tissue mobilization of the sows. However, it improved the production and quality of milk and reduced the possibility of light piglets at weaning by 22.16 percentage points. Regarding biochemical parameters, phytogenics improved animal recovery in the lactation period, as proven by an increase in the serum concentration of total protein and urea. Sows that received phytogenics exhibited increased behaviors of inactivity (3.16%), breastfeeding (1.15%), and water consumption (0.95%). In conclusion, using phytogenics in the feed of lactating sows improves the performance of the litters without affecting the body condition of the sows, with increased milk production and enhanced protein and lactose concentration.

AB  - Pathogenic microorganisms can impact the behavior and physiology of herbivores by direct or indirect means. This study demonstrated that yellow peach moth Conogethes punctiferalis larvae feeding on Penicillium-infected apples exhibited significantly longer body length and weight parameters compared to the control group. The sequencing of gut 16S rRNA showed a significant increase in the diversity and abundance of bacteria in the larvae feeding on Penicillium-infected apples. Additionally, transcriptomic sequencing of the larval gut indicated significant upregulation of genes related to digestion and cuticle formation after consuming Penicillium-infected apples. Furthermore, enzyme activity assays revealed notable changes in the trypsin and lipase activity. Consequently, these alterations in gut microbiota structure, diversity, and gene expression levels may underlie the observed growth and developmental variations in C. punctiferalis larvae mediated by pathogenic microorganisms. This study holds theoretical significance for a deeper understanding of the tripartite interaction among microorganisms, insects, and plants as well as for the development of novel pest control measures based on gut microbiota.

AB  - Anxiety disorders are the most common neuropsychiatric disorders diagnosed in adolescence and adulthood. Stress can lead to an increase in anxiety-related behaviors, although the consequences of stress in rodents are typically investigated only in adults. The levels of Neuropeptide Y (NPY), a mediator of stress resilience, are reduced in adult patients with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. For rodents, footshock is a physical stressor that increases anxiety-like behavior and reduces NPY in adults, however, the effects in adolescents are unknown. Here we used a 30-min unpredictable footshock protocol to investigate the differences in behavior and stress-relevant molecules between adolescent (6 weeks) and adult (3 months) male C57Bl6/J mice. The protocol resulted in fear expression in both ages as observed by enhanced freezing during footshock and elevation in plasma corticosterone and NPY shortly after exposure. However, effects on approach/avoidance behavior were different between the two ages. One week after footshock exposure, adult mice showed reduced open arm time and entries on elevated plus maze (EPM), whereas adolescent mice showed no effect. Footshock mice in both age groups displayed reduced activity levels in EPM and open field. The hypolocomotion did not relate to motor deficits, as there were no differences between footshock and control groups using rotarod. Surprisingly, we found that the adolescent mice had elevated NPY peptide expression in hippocampus, whereas adults had reduced expression one week after footshock exposure. Together, these results demonstrate that stress differentially affects both behavior and the important stress resilience factor NPY in adolescents compared to adults.

AB  - Ectopic expression of Xist on the putative active X chromosome is a primary cause of the low developmental efficiency of cloned mouse and pig embryos. Suppression of abnormal Xist expression via gene knockout or RNA interference (RNAi) can significantly enhance the developmental competence of cloned mouse and pig embryos. RLIM is a Xist expression activator, whereas REX1 is an Xist transcription inhibitor, as RLIM triggers Xist expression by mediating the proteasomal degradation of REX1 to induce imprinted and random X chromosome inactivation in mice. This study aimed to test whether the knockdown of RLIM and overexpression of REX1 can repress aberrant Xist expression and improve the developmental ability of cloned male pig embryos. Results showed that injection of anti-RLIM small interfering RNA significantly decreased Xist messenger RNA abundance, increased REX1 protein level, and enhanced the preimplantation development of cloned male porcine embryos. These positive effects were not observed in cloned male pig embryos injected with REX1 expression plasmid, which might be due to the low expression efficiency of injected REX1 plasmid and/or the short half-life of expressed REX1 protein. The findings from this study indicated that RLIM participated in the ectopic activation of Xist expression in cloned pig embryos by targeting REX1 degradation. Furthermore, this study provided a new method to improve cloned pig embryo development by the inhibition of Xist expression via RNAi of RLIM.

AB  - Simple Summary Flow cytometry (FC) is the recommended technique for assessing sperm quality. In comparison with fluorescence microscopy (FM), FC supports analyses of much larger sperm populations and generates more reliable results. However, FC is not always accessible, and sperm populations are often evaluated with the use of FM. In the present study, FC and FM were used to assess the functionality of various organelles in European red deer epididymal spermatozoa stored in liquid nitrogen. Spermatozoa were collected from the epididymides of hunter-harvested European red deer stags. The epididymides were stored in a refrigerator (2-4 degrees C) for 12 h before analysis. The study demonstrated that the refrigerated storage of the epididymides for 12 h had no significant effect on the sperm quality before cryopreservation, but it significantly influenced the percentage of early necrotic sperm after thawing. The results of FM and FC assays differed significantly, excluding in the assessment of the plasma membrane integrity. However, the results of both assays revealed significant correlations between the examined variables, except for mitochondrial activity. The study demonstrated that the spermatozoa from epididymides chill-stored for 12 h can be used for cryopreservation. Fluorescence microscopy and FC are equally reliable techniques, but FM was more useful for evaluating mitochondrial activity. Thawed spermatozoa, sampled post mortem from the fresh epididymides of European red deer and epididymides stored for up to 12 h at 2-4 degrees C, were evaluated by fluorescence microscopy (FM) and flow cytometry (FC). The sperm samples were extended and cryopreserved. The sperm motility (CASA), sperm viability (SYBR+/PI-), acrosome integrity, mitochondrial activity, apoptotic changes, and chromatin stability were assessed. Sperm were analyzed by FM before cryopreservation, and by FM and FC after thawing. Epididymal storage time (for 12 h) had no significant effect (p > 0.05) on the examined variables before cryopreservation. After thawing, the storage variants differed (p < 0.05) in the percentage of apoptotic sperm (FM and FC) and DNA integrity (FC). The results of FM and FC differed (p < 0.05) in all the analyzed parameters, excluding SYBR+/PI. Significant correlations (p < 0.01) were observed between the sperm viability, acrosome integrity, and the percentage of non-apoptotic spermatozoa, regardless of the applied technique. In FM, the above parameters were also significantly correlated with mitochondrial activity. The study demonstrated that European red deer spermatozoa stored in the epididymides at 2-4 degrees C for 12 h can be used for cryopreservation. Both techniques were equally reliable, but FM was better suited for evaluating mitochondrial activity whereas FC was more useful in the evaluation of DNA fragmentation.

AB  - Parasites are generally overdispersed among their hosts, with far-reaching implications for their population dynamics and control. The factors determining parasite overdispersion have long been debated. In particular, stochastic parasite acquisition and individual host variation in density-dependent regulation through acquired host immunity have been identified as key factors, but their relative roles and possible interactions have seen little empirical exploration in parasite populations. Here, Taylor's power law is applied to test the hypothesis that periodic parasite removal destabilises the host-parasite relationship and increases variance in parasite burden around the mean. The slope of the power relationship was compared by analysis of covariance among 325 nematode populations in wild and domestic ruminants, exploiting that domestic ruminants are often routinely treated against parasite infections. In Haemonchus spp. and Trichostrongylus axei in domestic livestock, the slope increased with the frequency of anthelmintic treatment, supporting this hypothesis. In Nematodirus spp., against which acquired immunity is known to be strong, the slope was significantly greater in post-mortem worm burden data than in faecal egg counts, while this relationship did not hold for the less immunogenic genus Marshallagia. Considered together, these findings suggest that immunity acting through an exposure-dependent reduction in parasite fecundity stabilises variance in faecal egg counts, reducing overdispersion, and that periodic anthelmintic treatment interferes with this process and increases overdispersion. The results have implications for the diagnosis and control of parasitic infections in domestic animals, which are complicated by overdispersion, and for our understanding of parasite distribution in free-living wildlife. Parasite-host systems, in which treatment and immunity effectively mimic metapopulation processes of patch extinction and density dependence, could also yield general insights into the spatio-temporal stability of animal distributions.

AB  - The leather materials are used in a multitude of sectors, including footwear, apparel, handicrafts, and the automotive industry. Due to the radiant heat generated by a laser beam, the laser cutting of leather results in a carbonized cut edge. There is currently no technology available for measuring the carbonization along the contour edges of leather. The purpose of this experimental investigation was to determine the impact of power diode-based laser cutting on the carbonization of machined buffalo leather with the help of a digital microscope to improve the machining process. The ATR-FTIR spectrum was used to analyze the carbon-related functional group in the mid-IR spectrum of carbonized leather samples. It was found that the proposed method can measure the amount of carbon deposition in the cutting zone. The lower amplitude duty cycle with higher feed rate can reduce carbon formation owing to the lower thermal energy distribution. The amplitude (4.5 V), duty cycle (70%) and feed rate (90 mm/s) can produce optimal performance measures.

AB  - MCR-positive Escherichia coli (MCRPEC) have been reported in humans worldwide. The high prevalence of mcr-1 poses clinical and environmental risks due to its diverse genetic mechanisms. Given the vital role of animals and the environ-ment in the spread of antibiotic resistance, a "One Health" perspective should be taken when addressing antimicrobial resistance issues. This study conducted a prospective study in six farms (located in Jiaxing City, Zhejiang province, China) in 2019. MCRPEC strains were screened from samples of different sources. The molecular epidemiological sur-veys and transmission potential were investigated by whole-genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. MCRPEC were detected in different farms with various sources. Sequence type complex 10 was dominant and distributed widely in multiple sources. Core-genome multilocus sequence type (cgMLST) analysis indicated that clonal transmission could occur within and between farms. In addition, mcr-1 genes with different locations showed different transmission ten-dencies. The study indicated that interspecies and cross-regional transmission of MCRPEC could occur between differ-ent sectors in farms. Further surveillance and research of non-clinical MCRPEC strains are necessary to reduce the threat of MCRPEC.

AB  - L-Selenomethionine is one of the important organic selenium sources. The supplementation of L-selenomethionine in diets is significant to improve the health of pigs. Ammonia is a major pollutant in the atmosphere and piggery, posing a threat to human and animal health. Although ammonia exposure can damage the heart, the mechanism of cardiac toxicity by ammonia is still unknown. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of cardiac injury induced by ammonia exposure in pigs and the protective effect of L-selenomethionine on its cardiotoxicity. The results showed that the blood ammonia content of pig increased significantly in ammonia group, the expressions of energy metabolism-related genes (LDHA, PDK4, HK2, and CPTIB) and the oxidative stress indexes were significantly changed (P < 0.05), the AMPK/PPAR-gamma/NF-kappa B signaling pathways were activated, the chromatin edge aggregation and nuclear pyknosis were observed in ultrastructure, the apoptotic cells were significantly increased (P < 0.05), and the mRNA and protein expressions of apoptosis-related genes (Bcl-2, Bax, Cyt-c, caspase-3, and caspase-9) were significantly affected (P < 0.05). The above changes were significantly alleviated in ammonia + L-selenomethionine group, but there were still significant differences compared with the C group (P < 0.05). Our results indicated that ammonia exposure could cause energy metabolism disorder and oxidative stress and induce apoptosis of cardiomyocytes through AMPK/PPAR-gamma/NF-kappa B pathways, which could lead to cardiac injury and affect cardiac function. L-Selenomethionine could effectively alleviate the cardiac damage caused by ammonia and antagonize the cardiotoxicity of ammonia.

AB  - The Physalis genus includes species of commercial importance due to their ornamental, edible and medicinal properties. These qualities stem from their variety of biologically active compounds. We performed a metabolomic analysis of three Physalis species, i.e., P. angulata, P. grisea, and P. philadelphica, differing in domestication stage and cultivation practices, to determine the degree of inter-species metabolite variation and to test the hypothesis that these related species mount a common metabolomic response to foliar damage caused by Trichoplusia ni larvae. The results indicated that the metabolomic differences detected in the leaves of these species were species-specific and remained even after T. ni herbivory. They also show that each Physalis species displayed a unique response to insect herbivory. This study highlighted the metabolite variation present in Physalis spp. and the persistence of this variability when faced with biotic stressors. Furthermore, it sets an experimental precedent from which highly species-specific metabolites could be identified and subsequently used for plant breeding programs designed to increase insect resistance in Physalis and related plant species.

AB  - Swainsonine, an indolizidine alkaloid, is an a -mannosidase and mannosidase II inhibitor that alters glycoprotein processing and causes lysosomal storage disease. Swainsonine is the toxic principle in several plant species worldwide and causes severe toxicosis in livestock grazing these plants. All swainsonine-containing plant taxa investigated to date are associated with fungal symbionts that produce swainsonine. Among the swainsonine-containing convolvulaceous species, Ipomoea carnea Jacq. is associated with a seed-transmitted symbiont belonging to the fungal order Chaetothyriales. The nature of this association was unclear; therefore, this association was investigated further using microscopy. Macroscopic and microscopic data reported here demonstrate that the Chaetothyriales symbiont associated with I. carnea grows ectopically on the adaxial (upper) surface of leaves as lacy mycelia in plants that contain swainsonine and was not present on plants lacking swainsonine that were derived from fungicide-treated seeds. Hyphae were not observed on the surface of any other tissues including the abaxial (lower) leaf surface, petiole, and stem. Mycelia were not visible in internal tissues below the epidermis, and there did not appear to be any hyphal extensions within the fibrovascular bundles or stomata. Longitudinal and (or) cross sections of the stems or petioles did not show evidence of hyphae growing between cells. These results suggest an epibiotic growth habit of the Chaetothyriales symbiont in association with I. carnea.

AB  - Zearalenone (ZEA) is a prevalent mycotoxin found in moldy diets and is associated with reproductive dysfunction. However, the molecular underpinning of ZEA in impairment of spermatogenesis remains largely unknown. To unveil the toxic mechanism of ZEA, we established a co-culture model using porcine Sertoli cells and porcine spermatogonial stem cells (pSSCs) to investigate the impact of ZEA on these cell types and their associated signaling pathways. Our findings showed that low concentration of ZEA inhibited cell apoptosis, while high concentration induced cell apoptosis. Furthermore, the expression levels of Wilms' tumor 1 (WT1), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) were signifi-cantly decreased in ZEA treatment group, while concurrently upregulating the transcriptional levels of the NOTCH signaling pathway target genes HES1 and HEY1. The addition of the NOTCH signaling pathway inhibitor DAPT (GSI-IX) alleviated the damage to porcine Sertoli cells caused by ZEA. Gastrodin (GAS) significantly increased the expression levels of WT1, PCNA and GDNF, and inhibited the transcription of HES1 and HEY1. GAS also efficiently restored the decreased expression levels of DDX4, PCNA and PGP9.5 in co-cultured pSSCs sug-gesting its potential in ameliorating the damage caused by ZEA to Sertoli cells and pSSCs. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that ZEA disrupts pSSCs self-renewal by affecting the function of porcine Sertoli cell, and highlights the protective mechanism of GAS through the regulation of the NOTCH signaling pathway. These findings may offer a novel strategy for alleviating ZEA-induced male reproductive dysfunction in animal production.

AB  - Sulfur-containing amino acids such as methionine and cysteine play critical roles in immune system and redox status. A body of evidence shows that metabolic aspects of supplemented Met and Cys may differ in the body. Therefore, the study aimed to investigate the effects of dietary Met and Cys supplementation in immunologically challenged weaned pigs. Forty weaned piglets (6.5 +/- 0.3 kg) were randomly allocated to five treatment groups. The treatment included: (1) sham-challenged control (SCC), (2) challenged control (CC), (3) MET (CC + 0.1% (DL)-Met), (4) CYS (CC + 0.1% (L)-Cys), and (5) MET + CYS (CC + 0.1% (DL)-Met + 0.1% (L)-Cys). On day 7, all pigs were intramuscularly injected with either Escherichia coli O55:B5 lipopolysaccharides (LPS) or phosphate-buffered saline. Blood, liver, and jejunum samples were analyzed for immune response and redox status. The CC group had lower (P < 0.05) villus surface area and higher (P < 0.05) flux of 4-kDa fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran (FD4) than the SCC group. A lower (P < 0.05) glutathione (GSH) concentration was observed in the jejunum of pigs in the CC group than those in the SCC group. Dietary Cys supplementation increased (P < 0.05) villus surface area, GSH levels, and reduced (P < 0.05) the flux of FD4 in the jejunum of LPS-challenged pigs. Dietary Met supplementation enhanced (P < 0.05) hepatic GSH content. Pigs challenged with LPS in the MET group had lower serum IL-8 concentration than those in the CC group. There was a Met x Cys interaction (P < 0.05) in serum IL-4 and IL-8 concentrations, and Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity. Dietary (L)-Cys supplementation restored intestinal integrity and GSH levels that were damaged by lipopolysaccharides administration. Dietary (DL)-Met supplementation improved hepatic GSH and reduced systemic inflammatory response, but antagonistic interaction with dietary (L)-Cys supplementation was observed in the inflammatory response and redox status.

AB  - Deoxynivalenol (DON) is a type of mycotoxin commonly found in food and animal feed. When consumed, it can have harmful effects on the intestine. The porcine digestive system is physiologically similar to that of humans, making pigs a suitable model for studying DON-induced enterotoxicity. However, the exact ways DON causes intestinal damage in pigs still need to be fully understood. To address this knowledge gap, this study aimed to identify hub genes associated with enterotoxicity caused by DON exposure. Transcriptomic datasets from porcine jejunal explants exposed to DON were extensively analyzed using bioinformatic techniques in this study. A total of 265 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, with 238 being up-regulated and 27 being downregulated, indicating that exposure to DON tends to increase gene expression. Further analysis revealed that the up-regulated DEGs were enriched in tumor necrosis factor, nuclear factor kappa-B, mitogen-activated protein kinases, and Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription-related signaling pathways. In addition, Weighted gene co-expression network analysis was performed to identify highly co-expressed modules. Then, genes in the highest co-expressed module were intersected with the up-regulated DEGs to construct a Protein-Protein Interaction network, resulting in 237 overlapping genes. Subsequently, 6 hub genes (CXCR4, PTGS2, ICAM1, IL-1A, IL-1B, and IL-10) that played a central role in the response to DON were identified using cytohubba in conjunction with the Molecular Complex Detection. In summary, exposure to DON is more likely to result in increased rather than decreased gene expression. Six of the upregulated genes, which are involved in immunoregulation and inflammation, were identified as hub genes related to DON-induced enterotoxicity in pigs. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying DON-induced enterotoxicity and could guide interventions for this condition.

AB  - This study was conducted to monitor the cellular and molecular changes of buffalo cumulus-oocytes complexes (COCs) cultured under high or low oxygen levels. Morphologically good quality COCs (n = 1627) were screened using brilliant cresyl blue (BCB) staining and placed into three groups (BCB+, BCB- and control). All groups of COCs were cultured under low (5%) or high (20%) oxygen tensions. Intracellular and molecular changes including oocyte ultrastructure, lipid contents, mitochondrial activity and transcript abundance of genes regulating different pathways were analyzed in the matured oocyte groups. The results revealed that oxygen tension did not affect cumulus expansion rates, however the BCB+ group had a higher (P <= 0.05) expansion rate compared with the BCB- group. BCB- oocytes recorded the lowest meiotic progression rate (P <= 0.05) under high oxygen levels that was linked with an increased level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) compared with the BCB+ oocytes. Ultrastructure examination indicated that BCB+ oocytes had a higher rate of cortical granules migration compared with BCB- under low oxygen tension. In parallel, our results indicated the upregulation of NFE2L2 in groups of oocytes cultured under high oxygen tension that was coupled with reduced mitochondrial activity. In contrast, the expression levels of MAPK14 and CPT2 genes were increased (P <= 0.05) in groups of oocytes cultured under low compared with high oxygen tension that was subsequently associated with increased mitochondrial activity. In conclusion, data from the present investigation indicated that low oxygen tension is a favourable condition for maintaining the mitochondrial activity required for nuclear maturation of buffalo oocytes. However, low-quality oocytes (BCB-) responded negatively to high oxygen tension by reducing the expression of gene-regulating metabolic activity (CPT2). This action was an attempt by BCB- oocytes to reduce the increased levels of endogenously produced ROS that was coupled with decreased expression of the gene controlling meiotic progression (MAPK14) in addition to nuclear maturation rate.

AB  - The anterior pituitary plays a critical role in the endocrine system, contains gonadotrophs, which regulate reproductive efficiency by secreting follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). PPP2R2A is a serine-threonine phosphatase that regulates reproductive functions in both females and males, its function in pituitary cells remain unclear. Hu sheep is a highly prolific breed, which makes it suitable for studying reproductive mechanisms. In this study, the relative abundances of PPP2R2A mRNA expression were higher in the pituitary of highprolificacy (HF) Hu sheep compared to those of low-prolificacy (LF) Hu sheep. Additionally, we demonstrated that PPP2R2A promotes pituitary cell proliferation and gonadotropin secretion using the EdU assay and ELISA, respectively. Moreover, it inhibits pituitary cell apoptosis using flow cytometry. Furthermore, PPP2R2A may affect pituitary cell function by regulating the AKT/ mTOR signaling pathway. In summary, our findings suggest that PPP2R2A may play a role in regulating pituitary function and influencing the secretion of gonadotropins.

AB  - Although the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) plays a vital role in male reproduction, the molecular relationships among FSH, autophagy, and the secretory function of Sertoli cells remain largely undetermined. In this study, we sought to investigate the effects of FSH on dairy goat Sertoli cell autophagy and the role of autophagy in protein clearance. FSH treatment of primary Sertoli cells was found to enhance the expression level of LC3-II, reduce p62 degradation and the number of lysosomes, and downregulate the levels of LAMP2 protein and lysosomal gene mRNAs. Further analyses revealed that starvation-induced autophagy promotes the trans location of transcription factor EB (TFEB) from the cytoplasm to nucleus and its binding to the promoter region of LAMP2, whereas FSH suppresses the nuclear translocation of TFEB. Moreover, we found that the FSH-mediated inhibition of autophagy extends the biological half-lives of androgen-binding protein (ABP), glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), and stem cell factor (SCF) and promotes the secretion of these proteins. Collectively, these observations indicate that FSH inhibits autophagy by reducing lysosomal biogenesis, which is associated with the suppression of TFEB nuclear translocation via activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, thereby extending the biological half-lives and enhancing the expression of ABP, GDNF, and SCF in dairy goat Sertoli cells.

AB  - An Indigenous Trichoderma asperellum strain was isolated from the tea soil of Nagrakata, situated in Dooars region of West Bengal. Its liquid suspension was evaluated under field conditions at different locations in Assam, Darjeeling and Dooars for two seasons for the management of branch canker disease. Its effect on vegetative plant growth, natural enemies and phytotoxicity was also studied. Among seven treatments, there were four concentrations of T. asperellum in comparison with T. harzianum (market sample), copper oxychloride, and untreated control. Findings of the investigation showed that the disease protection level was the highest when indigenous Trichoderma was applied at a concentration of 1600 ml per hectare. The disease protection level was 4.06-4.28, 4.65-4.90 and 4.12-4.40 in Assam, Darjeeling and Dooars, respectively. It promoted vegetative growth in terms of increased green leaf yield. The same concentration could produce higher made tea per hectare as compared to untreated control. In the Assam it was 2227 and 2260 kg as compared to 1986 and 2015 kg in untreated control during the first and second year, respectively. In Darjeeling, it was 390 and 438 kg against 347 and 390 kg in control; similarly, in Dooars it was 1787 and 1840 kg against 1592 and 1640 kg per hectare in the first and second year, respectively. The tested antagonist was safe for Chrysoperla carnea and Oxyopes javanus without having phytotoxicity on tea plants. It is concluded that the native antagonist could be a promising option for the management of canker disease, especially for organic tea gardens.

AB  - The paper presents updates of the knowledge on the species diversity and distribution of the mustard family (Cruciferae, or Brassicaceae) in Uzbekistan and Middle Asia in general, predominantly based on authors' collections of 2023-2024. Most of the novelties regard alien plants that include national records of Diplotaxis muralis and Hirschfeldia incana, both representing new genera in the flora of the country ( Diplotaxis in Middle Asia as a whole) as well as updated data on the distribution of Brassica napus, Camelina sativa, Cardamine hirsuta, Sisymbrium officinale and S. orientale in Uzbekistan; the latter is also newly found in Tajikistan. For native Draba kuramensis, Lepidium tianschanicum, Parrya pinnatifida, P. tojibaevii, Scapiarabis popovii and Strigosella latifolia, additional localities are adduced including the first collections of Draba kuramensis documenting its occurrence in Uzbekistan. Besides, the presence of Sisymbrium orientale in Turkmenistan along with the absence of Brassica nigra in Uzbekistan (and Middle Asia) and Cardamine densiflora in Tian Shan and Kazakhstan are commented.

AB  - In angiosperms, basic leucine-zipper (bZIP) TGACG-motif-binding (TGA) transcription factors (TFs) regulate developmental and stress-related processes, the latter often involving NON EXPRESSOR OF PATHOGENESIS-RELATED GENES (NPR) coregulator interactions. To gain insight into their functions in an early diverging land-plant lineage, the single MpTGA and sole MpNPR genes were investigated in the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha.We generated Marchantia MpTGA and MpNPR knockout and overexpression mutants and conducted morphological, transcriptomic and expression studies. Furthermore, we investigated MpTGA interactions with wild-type and mutagenized MpNPR and expanded our analyses including TGA TFs from two streptophyte algae.Mptga mutants fail to induce the switch from vegetative to reproductive development and lack gametangiophore formation. MpTGA and MpNPR proteins interact and Mpnpr mutant analysis reveals a novel coregulatory NPR role in sexual reproduction. Additionally, MpTGA acts independently of MpNPR as a repressor of oil body (OB) formation and can thereby affect herbivory.The single MpTGA TF exerts a dual role in sexual reproduction and OB formation in Marchantia. Common activities of MpTGA/MpNPR in sexual development suggest that coregulatory interactions were established after emergence of land-plant-specific NPR genes and contributed to the diversification of TGA TF functions during land-plant evolution.

AB  - This is the first record of Exorista deligata (Pandell & eacute;, 1896) (Diptera: Tachinidae) as a parasitoid of Hyposidra talaca (Walker, 1860) (Lepidoptera: Geometridae) from India. H. talaca is a major and new emerging defoliator of the Tea plant Camellia sinensis (L) Kuntze (Theaceae). It completes multiple generations per year without diapause on C. sinensis, resulting in heavy crop loss. The field-collected larvae/pupa of H. talaca were checked for parasitoid infestations and reared until either the host or parasitoid emerged. The parasitoid was identified as E. deligata with morphological characteristics and confirmed by the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit-I (COX-CO1) gene sequencing technique. The parasitoid is infrequent with unexplored parasitic biology. It parasitises the larva and completes its lifecycle inside the developing H. talaca by entirely devouring the host. The mean percent parasitisation caused by E. deligata studied herein was 25.4% (range 5.88%-57.69%). Based on its parasitisation ability, we suggest the species could be a potential biological control agent to address the damage mitigation caused by the tea looper pest, H. talaca.

AB  - Plants defend from herbivores by activating a plethora of genetic and biochemical mechanisms aimed at reducing insect survival and plant damage. In this study, we analyzed constitutive and insect damage induced macromolecules, antioxidant enzymes and corresponding antioxidants in order to identify strength of resistance in maize in response to attack by Sesamia inferens. There were significant differences among the maize genotypes for all the test biochemicals. Further, the S. inferens damage resulted in significant increase in total proteins, total sugars, catalase, phenyl ammonia lyase, tyrosine ammonia lyase, total antioxidants, total phenol, tannins and Ferric ion reducing antioxidant power, but there was also a significant variation in increase in these biochemicals with respect to genotypes. The integrative analysis of these macromolecules, antioxidant enzymes and antioxidants revealed that the S. inferens damage in maize is characterized by higher secondary metabolite production and a strong redox response in resistant maize genotypes, mainly mediated by tannins and phenols as anti-nutritive compounds. Furthermore, the maize genotypes viz., CPM 2, CPM 9, CPM 13, CPM 15 and CML 345 were found with greater constitutive and/or pink stem borer induced defense phytochemicals like enzymatic activity and nonenzymatic antioxidant defense biochemicals, thus could be used to develop S. inferens resistant varieties of maize.

AB  - Milk is an integral and therefore complex structural element of mammalian nutrition. Therefore, it is simple to conclude that lactation, the process of producing milk, is as complex as the mammary gland, the organ responsible for this biochemical activity. Nutrition, genetics, epigenetics, disease pathogens, climatic conditions, and other environmental variables all impact breast productivity. In the last decade, the number of studies devoted to epigenetics has increased dramatically. Reports are increasingly describing the direct participation of microRNAs (miRNAs), small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally, in the regulation of mammary gland development and function. This paper presents a summary of the current state of knowledge about the roles of miRNAs in mammary gland development, health, and functions, particularly during lactation. The significance of miRNAs in signaling pathways, cellular proliferation, and the lipid metabolism in agricultural ruminants, which are crucial in light of their role in the nutrition of humans as consumers of dairy products, is discussed.

AB  - This study aims to assess the effects of aqueous extracts from four wild plants, including Polypodium vulgare(PV-AE), Chamaemelum nobile (CN-AE), Ocimum forsskaolii Benth (OF-AE), and Lavandula stoechas (LS-AE), on the physiological health, metabolic responses, and milk yield and quality of dairy ewes. A total of 40 dairy ewes of the Sicilo-Sarde breed were treated for 75 days with aqueous plant extracts at a dose of 10 mL/day. Feed intake and body weight were measured, oxidative stress biomarkers were evaluated, and metabolism, liver activity, kidney function, and blood-related markers were assessed. Besides, milk production and composition were analyzed. Significant improvements in feed intake and body weight were observed in the treated groups. Similarly, metabolic, biochemical, and hematological parameters improved significantly, as evidenced by the modulation of lipid peroxidation, an increase in thiol-group level, and enhanced antioxidant enzyme activities. Added to that, electrolyte balance was regulated compared to the control group. Notably, the extract-enriched groups showed a significant increase in milk yield, along with higher milk fat, protein content, and total solids. Moreover, an improved lipid profile was observed, featuring a higher proportion of unsaturated fatty acids (C18:1, C18:2) and a reduced atherogenic index (AIh). In particular, CN-AE proved to be the most effective for the key parameters analyzed. Overall, this study concluded that incorporating aqueous extracts from the studied plants into ewe feed could serve as a natural alternative to chemical additives, promoting ewe health, enhancing dairy production, and supporting more sustainable and environmentally friendly farming practices in the Mediterranean region.

AB  - Secretory trichomes and colleters are two of the secretory structures whose exudates may cover the body of the plant. Such secretions comprise resins or mucilages which are associated with an array of ecological roles. In Rosaceae, secretory trichomes have been reported for the leaves while colleters associated with leaf teeth. Our study aimed to identify the secretory structures of Rosa lucieae and understand the ecological role played by these glands as interpreted by morphoanatomical and histochemical studies. Samples from developing and fully mature leaves were collected, fixed, and processed according to usual techniques for light and scanning electron microscopy. In R. lucieae, colleters are restricted to the leaf and stipular margins and are associated with the teeth. They present a parenchymatous axis surrounded by a secretory palisade epidermis and usually fall off after the secretory activity is finished. Different from colleters, secretory trichomes are persistent. They present a multicellular secretory head and stalk. They are found at the base of the leaflet, petiolule, rachis, and petiole and occasionally on the stipular and leaf margins. The colleters predominantly secrete mucilages while the secretory trichomes secrete lipids and terpenes, both via cuticle rupture. The secretory activity of colleters is predominant in the leaf primordia, holding leaflets together and protecting meristems and leaves from desiccation, while the secretory trichomes maintain their secretory activity at different stages of leaf development, protecting different regions of the leaf against pathogens and herbivores.

AB  - BACKGROUNDIn interspecific competitive interactions at the same trophic level, herbivores are often hypothesized to exhibit a fast life-history strategy characterized by early reproduction and a short lifespan. Here, we analyzed the shift in life history of the psyllid Bactericera gobica when it interacts with the aphid Aphis gossypii, the thrips Frankliniella occidentalis, or the mite Aceria pallida in similar ecological niches because all of them cause damage to goji berry leaves.RESULTSWe found that psyllids displayed a typical fast life history when interacting with aphids and thrips. Psyllids that interacted with mites also reproduced earlier than those without any interactions, but later than those interacting with aphids and thrips. Trophic competition typically led to a loss of fecundity in psyllids. To mitigate this loss, psyllids that interacted with mites allocated more resources to reproduction compared to those interacting with aphids and thrips, resulting in their reproduction being spread over a longer lifespan. This life history can be best described as a bet-hedging strategy.CONCLUSIONOur study suggests that interspecific interactions cannot be solely explained by invoking faster life histories. Instead, the shift in life history may converge towards a finely-tuned match between interacting species. Interactions between psyllids and mites increase psyllid fecundity, potentially promoting the persistence of both species. (c) 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Sleep deprivation (SD) not only directly affects an individual's work efficiency but also negatively impacts various cognitive functions such as memory, attention, and learning as fatigue increases. Over the past few decades, numerous researchers have conducted lots of studies on the effects of SD on cognition, particularly memory. In this paper, we first review the effects of SD on memory function based on behavioral studies. Then, we further elaborate on recent advances in the physiological mechanisms of SD, including synaptic plasticity in structure and function, levels of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters, and the expression of related synaptic protein signals. It has been observed that SD modulates the expression of synaptic protein signals and downstream signaling pathways by influencing changes in synaptic activities (such as dendritic spine density, synaptic connectivity strength, and the balance of excitatory and inhibitory synapses), ultimately affecting behavior. This review aims to provide insights into the research progress on the effects of SD on memory and its underlying mechanisms, providing a reference for future studies on sleep function and related mechanisms, as well as the development of strategies to mitigate memory deficits caused by SD.

AB  - Background Plant immunity against pathogens and pests is comprised of complex mechanisms orchestrated by signaling pathways regulated by plant hormones [Salicylic acid (SA) and Jasmonic acid (JA)]. Investigations of plant immune response to phytopathogens and phloem-feeders have revealed that SA plays a critical role in reprogramming of the activity and/or localization of transcriptional regulators via post-translational modifications. We explored the contributing effects of herbivory by a phytopathogen vector [Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri] and pathogen [Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CaLas)] infection on response of sweet orange [Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck] using manipulative treatments designed to mimic the types of infestations/infections that citrus growers experience when cultivating citrus in the face of Huanglongbing (HLB) disease. Results A one-time (7 days) inoculation access period with CaLas-infected vectors caused SA-associated upregulation of PR-1, stimulating defense response after a long period of infection without herbivory (270 and 360 days). In contrast, while repeated (monthly) 'pulses' of 7 day feeding injury by psyllids stimulated immunity in CaLas-infected citrus by increasing SA in leaves initially (up to 120 days), long-term (270 and 360 days) repeated herbivory caused SA to decrease coincident with upregulation of genes associated with SA metabolism (BMST and DMR6). Similarly, transcriptional responses and metabolite (SA and its analytes) accumulation in citrus leaves exposed to a continuously reproducing population of D. citri exhibited a transitory upregulation of genes associated with SA signaling at 120 days and a posterior downregulation after long-term psyllid (adults and nymphs) feeding (270 and 360 days). Conclusions Herbivory played an important role in regulation of SA accumulation in mature leaves of C. sinensis, whether or not those trees were coincidentally infected with CaLas. Our results indicate that prevention of feeding injury inflicted by D. citri from the tritrophic interaction may allow citrus plants to better cope with the consequences of CaLas infection, highlighting the importance of vector suppression as a component of managing this cosmopolitan disease.

AB  - Background We previously reported that miR-195 exerts neuroprotection by inhibiting Sema3A and cerebral miR-195 levels decreased with age, both of which urged us to explore the role of miR-195 and miR-195-regulated Sema3 family members in age-associated dementia.Methods miR-195a KO mice were used to assess the effect of miR-195 on aging and cognitive functions. Sema3D was predicted as a miR-195 target by TargetScan and then verified by luciferase reporter assay, while effects of Sema3D and miR-195 on neural senescence were assessed by beta-galactosidase and dendritic spine density. Cerebral Sema3D was over-expressed by lentivirus and suppressed by si-RNA, and effects of over-expression of Sema3D and knockdown of miR-195 on cognitive functions were assessed by Morris Water Maze, Y-maze, and open field test. The effect of Sema3D on lifespan was assessed in Drosophila. Sema3D inhibitor was developed using homology modeling and virtual screening. One-way and two-way repeated measures ANOVA were applied to assess longitudinal data on mouse cognitive tests.Results Cognitive impairment and reduced density of dendritic spine were observed in miR-195a knockout mice. Sema3D was identified to be a direct target of miR-195 and a possible contributor to age-associated neurodegeneration as Sema3D levels showed age-dependent increase in rodent brains. Injection of Sema3D-expressing lentivirus caused significant memory deficits while silencing hippocampal Sema3D improved cognition. Repeated injections of Sema3D-expressing lentivirus to elevate cerebral Sema3D for 10 weeks revealed a time-dependent decline of working memory. More importantly, analysis of the data on the Gene Expression Omnibus database showed that Sema3D levels were significantly higher in dementia patients than normal controls (p < 0.001). Over-expression of homolog Sema3D gene in the nervous system of Drosophila reduced locomotor activity and lifespan by 25%. Mechanistically, Sema3D might reduce stemness and number of neural stem cells and potentially disrupt neuronal autophagy. Rapamycin restored density of dendritic spines in the hippocampus from mice injected with Sema3D lentivirus. Our novel small molecule increased viability of Sema3D-treated neurons and might improve autophagy efficiency, which suggested Sema3D could be a potential drug target.Conclusion Our results highlight the importance of Sema3D in age-associated dementia. Sema3D could be a novel drug target for dementia treatment.

AB  - Vegetable lanolin is an alternative vegan substitute for animal lanolin, a product of sheep skin secretion. In this work, the equivalence of replacing anhydrous lanolin with its vegetable analogue for the creation of cosmetic emulsion products with targeted actions was investigated. The percentage of the fatty acid composition of lanolin and vegetable lanolin was determined using a gas chromatograph. The cosmetic properties of lanolin and its vegan substitute were studied in a modelled inert system based on mineral oil. The antioxidant activity of the cosmetic emulsion was determined by the ferrocyanide method. The amount of moisture and fat was determined using a tester with a digital high-sensitivity sensor. The basis of vegetable lanolin is C26:0 cerotinic (73.2 +/- 0.20%), C18:1 oleic (10.5 +/- 0.10%) and C18:2 linoleic (7.2 +/- 0.07%). The basis of lanolin is fatty acids, such as C18:2 linoleic (25.7 +/- 0.15%), C18:1 oleic (24.1 +/- 0.10%), and C16:0 palmitic (5.4 +/- 0.06%). The emulsion with lanolin has a higher antioxidant activity (1.2 +/- 0.02 optical density D) and provides a balance of moisture and fat on the skin for a longer time (3 h) when compared to the emulsion with vegetable lanolin (2 h). The obtained data confirm the importance of the fatty acid composition of a cosmetic product for its functional performance. Finally, the data are promising for the development of a vegan cosmetic emulsion with a prolonged moisturising effect and enhanced antioxidant properties.

AB  - Simple Summary Simple Summary: Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a rapidly evolving pathogen responsible for outbreaks in pig herds globally. Mutations in the S protein of PEDV have resulted in new variants and a reduction in vaccine efficacy. This epidemiological survey in northeast China from 2015 to 2022 examined the prevalence of enteroviruses co-infected with PEDV and the structural mutations in the spike (S) protein resulting from mutations of the S gene from 2011 to 2022. Notably, two distinct mutations in the emerging 2022 HEB strain were identified. These findings enhance the understanding of PEDV co-infection and genetic evolution in northeast China.Abstract Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a rapidly evolving virus that causes outbreaks in pig herds worldwide. Mutations in the S protein of PEDV have led to the emergence of new viral variants, which can reduce vaccine immunity against prevalent strains. To understand the infection and variation pattern of PEDV in China, an extensive epidemiological survey was conducted in northeast China from 2015 to 2022. The genetic diversity of enteroviruses co-infected with PEDV and the PEDV S gene was analyzed, common mutation patterns that may have led to changes in PEDV virulence and infectivity in recent years were identified, and structural changes in the surface of the S protein resulting from mutations in the PEDV S gene from 2011 to 2022 were reviewed. Of note, two distinct mutations in the emerging 2022 HEB strain were identified. These findings provide a basis for a better understanding of PEDV co-infection and genetic evolution in northeast China.

AB  - Herbivorous pests in agricultural systems are often characterised by their direct impact on crops, however indirect effects can compromise critical agroecosystem services like pollination. Cucurbit production relies on pollinators, but also suffers from cucumber beetles (Acalymma vittatum and Diabrotica spp.) that have an affinity for cucurbit flowers, which may reduce pollination. Over four field seasons, we observed pollination in two cucurbit crops, watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) and pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo) and assessed the impact of flower-infesting cucumber beetles on the identity, number, and duration of pollinator visits. In all years of the study and across both crops, pollinator visitation decreased as cucumber beetle density increased. Wild bees disproportionately supplied pollination services to infested flowers and were responsible for the majority (60%-70%) of visitation at higher floral infestations (>5 beetles/flower). Supplemented pollinators spent >50% less time on flowers infested with beetles compared to flowers without beetles, however this was only noted in 1 year in watermelon. While herbivory is known to impact pollination in cucurbits, we demonstrate that the presence of herbivores in cucurbit flowers can also impact pollinator activity. Further, these changes may have important implications to the pollination and pest management programs used in these systems.

AB  - Fixed-time artificial insemination is an important technique in swine production that can improve reproductive efficiency and meat production quality through making better use of the genetic potential of breeding males and reducing the costs associated with double or multiple inseminations. Our goal was to evaluate the vaginal application of the GnRH agonist triptorelin acetate to synchronize ovulation in post-weaning sows and facilitate the implementation of a single, fixed-time insemination. In the first experiment, the efficacy of treatment with triptorelin in animals with or without signs of estrus was analyzed using a single insemination at a fixed time, compared to a control group following the standard insemination strategy. The farrowing rate was comparable between the triptorelin and control groups (100 vs. 87.50%), but triptorelin treatment without estrus had a lower rate (50%). Litter size did not differ between the groups. Estradiol and progesterone levels at 96 and 120 h post-weaning were similar in the control and triptorelin groups (p > 0.05). These results suggest that triptorelin has the potential to synchronize ovulation in pigs without affecting post-weaning hormonal profiles. In a second experiment, the objective was to evaluate the productive and economic impact of implementing a treatment with triptorelin acetate 96 h after weaning, compared to the standard insemination protocol. Sows were grouped according to treatment (control vs. triptorelin) and estrus onset (<= 5 days and >5 days after weaning, which was considered late estrus). The farrowing rate was lower in the late-estrus control group than in the control and triptorelin groups, and similar to that in the late-estrus triptorelin group. No differences were found in litter size and live or dead piglets born (p > 0.05). We developed an estimation model to assess the cost/benefit of intravaginal triptorelin administration at 96 h post-weaning. The overall result was that the use of triptorelin increased the financial benefit per inseminated sow by EUR 15-20. This improvement was mainly related to an increase in the reproductive performance of the treated sows compared to the control sows and the reduction in the number of inseminations per sow. These results highlight the potential of triptorelin to optimize reproductive management in pigs, improving efficiency and economic viability.

AB  - The aim of this research was to determine the optimal conditions for the process of the microencapsulation of phenol-rich grape pomace extract (GPE) using spray drying and goat whey protein (GW) as a coating. The encapsulation was carried out with the aim of protecting the original bioactive components extracted from grape pomace to ensure their stability and protection from external agents, as well as antioxidant activity, during the conversion of the liquid extract into powder and during storage. Using the response surface methodology, an inlet air temperature of 173.5 degrees C, a GW ratio of 2.5 and a flow rate of 7 mL/min were determined as optimum process parameters. Under these conditions, a high yield (85.2%) and encapsulation efficiency (95.5%) were achieved with a satisfactorily low moisture content in the product (<5%). The amount of coating had the greatest influence on the MC properties. GW showed a more pronounced stabilising effect on the phenolic compounds in GPE during a longer storage period compared to anthocyanins. The results obtained indicate the potential of GW as a coating and are an example of the possible upcycling of GPE and GW, which can lead to a high-quality product that can be a functional ingredient.

AB  - Dysfunction in emotion regulation (ER) and autobiographical memory are components of major depressive disorder (MDD). However, little is known about how they mechanistically interact with mood disturbances in real time. Using machine learning-based neural signatures, we can quantify negative affect (NA), ER, and memory continuously to evaluate how these processes dynamically interact in MDD. Unmedicated individuals with MDD (N = 45) and healthy volunteers (HV; N = 38) completed a negative autobiographical memory functional magnetic resonance imaging task wherein they recalled, distanced from (an ER strategy), and immersed into memories. We used a negative affect signature (PINES) and an emotion regulation signature (ERS) to quantify moment-to-moment NA and ER. We then examined whether memory engagement, indexed by hippocampal activity, predicted subsequent change in PINES and ERS over time. During memory recall and immersion, greater hippocampal activity predicted increased PINES across groups. During distancing, greater hippocampal activity in HVs predicted increased ERS but not PINES. In MDD, greater hippocampal activity predicted increased PINES but not ERS. Findings suggest abnormalities in the real-time relationship between memory, NA, and ER in MDD. During distancing, as predicted, HVs showed an attenuation of the linkage between memory engagement and NA, and they had subsequent increases in ER following memory reactivation. In contrast, MDD was characterized by continued linkage between memory engagement and NA, without subsequent increases in ER. Deficits in engagement of ER and ineffective modulation of NA following negative memory recall may contribute to the mood disturbances in MDD and are potential targets for clinical intervention.

AB  - Simple Summary During estrus in female pigs, a series of signs are exhibited, such as reddening and swelling of the vulva, as well as mucus discharge from the vulva, which signal ovulation and readiness for mating. We analyzed RNA-seq data from the vulva and vagina tissues of two pig breeds at different stages of estrus to elucidate their regulatory mechanisms by analyzing the differential expression genes (DEG) and long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNA), as well as the utilization of alternative polyadenylation (APA) sites. The functions of these factors contribute to a better understanding of the regulatory mechanisms underlying estrus expression in gilts.Abstract The fertility rate and litter size of female pigs are critically affected by the expression of estrus. The objective of this study was to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of estrus expression by analyzing the differential expression of genes and long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNA), as well as the utilization of alternative polyadenylation (APA) sites, in the vulva and vagina during the estrus and diestrus stages of Large White and indigenous Chinese Mi gilts. Our study revealed that the number of differentially expressed genes (DEG) in the vulva was less than that in the vagina, and the DEGs in the vulva were enriched in pathways such as "neural" pathways and steroid hormone responses, including the "Calcium signaling pathway" and "Oxytocin signaling pathway". The DEGs in the vagina were enriched in the "Metabolic pathways" and "VEGF signaling pathway". Furthermore, 27 and 21 differentially expressed lincRNAs (DEL), whose target genes were enriched in the "Endocrine resistance" pathway, were identified in the vulva and vagina, respectively. Additionally, we observed that 63 and 618 transcripts of the 3 '-untranslated region (3 '-UTR) were lengthened during estrus in the vulva and vagina, respectively. Interestingly, the genes undergoing APA events in the vulva exhibited species-specific enrichment in neural or steroid-related pathways, whereas those in the vagina were enriched in apoptosis or autophagy-related pathways. Further bioinformatic analysis of these lengthened 3 '-UTRs revealed the presence of multiple miRNAs binding sites and cytoplasmic polyadenylation element (CPE) regulatory aspects. In particular, we identified more than 10 CPEs in the validated lengthened 3 '-UTRs of the NFIX, PCNX4, CEP162 and ABHD2 genes using RT-qPCR. These findings demonstrated the involvement of APA and lincRNAs in the regulation of estrus expression in female pigs, providing new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying estrus expression in pigs.

AB  - Heat stress is an increasing challenge for production animals, particularly in warmer regions of the world. The aim of this study was to compare the fit of three different relationships when modelling respiration rate (RR) and rectal temperature (RT) in animals exposed to increased load. Data from three published studies on finishing pigs, gestating sows and dairy cows were analysed. RR and RT are characterized by being unaffected by increased heat load as long as it is kept below a certain level, and in warmer conditions they increase with increased heat load. As an expression of heat load either the air temperature or the ET (Effective Temperature) was used. The ET unites the effect of air temperature, air humidity and velocity on the animal perception of increased heat load. The relationship between RR and RT and the temperature or the ET was analysed by multiple change point regression and the cubic relationships were modelled. In general, the models provided better fits for RR compared to RT. Relationships with an unaffected piece followed by a quadratic relationship and the cubic relationships performed nearly equally well. Using ET resulted in better correlations than using temperature alone for gestating sows and dairy cows.

AB  - Diaphania indica (Saunders) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) is an important pest of snake gourd, Trichosanthes anguina (L.). A comparative analysis of Chlorophyll a and b, total chlorophyll, proteins, phenols, reactive oxygen species (ROS), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), malondialdehyde (MDA) and antioxidative enzymes [catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione S-transferase (GST), ascorbate peroxidase (APOX), pyrogallol peroxidase (PPX) and guaiacol peroxidase (GPX)] of three snake gourd cultivars, MNSR-1 (MNS), Baruipur Long (BAR) and Polo No. 1 (POLO) after 4 or 12 h of D. indica feeding were conducted to observe the induced defense mechanism of these cultivars (n = 5). 3,3 & backprime;-Diaminobenzidine (DAB) and nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) staining, and expression of TaCAT3 gene were observed in undamaged and insect-damaged cultivars (n = 3). Chlorophyll a and b, total chlorophyll and proteins decreased with increased feeding time in each cultivar. Total ROS, H2O2, MDA, phenols and antioxidative enzymes were enhanced with increased feeding time in each cultivar. After 12 h of feeding, DAB staining was 5.43 and 8.71% higher in POLO than MNS and BAR (P < 0.05), respectively, whereas NBT staining was 8.68 and 30.22% higher in POLO than MNS and BAR (P < 0.05), respectively. In contrast, significant increases in activities of enzymatic antioxidants (CAT, PPX and GPX) and total phenols were observed in POLO than MNS and BAR (P < 0.05). After 12 h of insect feeding, induction of TaCAT3 gene was significantly higher in POLO than MNS (P < 0.05). This study concludes that MNS and BAR were more susceptible to D. indica than POLO.

AB  - BACKGROUNDA promising strategy to optimize biological control of insect pests is selecting crop varieties with indirect defense traits. Indirect plant defenses recruit natural enemies to kill pests and include chemical attractants like herbivore-induced plant volatiles. In prior laboratory assays, we found sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) cultivar ATx3409/RTx436 infested with sorghum aphid (Melanaphis sorghi Theobald) was attractive to natural enemies and emitted more chemical attractants than two other cultivars. In this field study, we manually infested 9-week-old sorghum plants with aphids and quantified differences in natural enemy and aphid densities among cultivars throughout the growing season. We also used field cages to control access of natural enemies to plants and estimate their effects on aphid suppression.RESULTSWe found strong evidence that indirect plant defenses confer economically relevant control of aphid pest populations and that laboratory assays can accurately predict natural enemy recruitment in the field. In 2022, there were three times more lady beetles (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), lacewings (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae and Hemerobiidae), hover flies (Diptera: Syrphidae), and parasitoids (Hymenoptera: Braconidae and Aphelinidae) per aphid on ATx3409/RTx436 than on the other two cultivars. In the field cage experiment, natural enemies reduced aphid densities by up to 83% one week after aphid infestation. ATx3409/RTx436 was the only cultivar to remain below the economic threshold throughout the growing season, indicating that this cultivar would not require any pesticide applications to control aphids. In 2023, there were similar abundances of natural enemies and aphid densities across cultivars, the latter of which remained near zero throughout the growing season, likely due to extremely hot temperatures and drought that may have contributed to aphid mortality.CONCLUSIONOur findings demonstrate that indirect plant defenses enhance biological control and deliver economically important pest suppression. Cultivar screening and selection for indirect defense traits provides a promising avenue to improve crop protection and breeding for resistance. (c) 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - In fishing communities, livelihoods and well-being depend on sustaining access to key fisheries through changes in natural resource management. In Alaska, the rationalization of the commercial fishery for Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis) in 1995 led to the consolidation of the halibut fleet. The high cost of halibut catch shares have since become a crucial barrier to prospective entrants, especially small-scale operations with few options for portfolio diversification. However, quantitative approaches to understanding that barrier face an information gap: datasets on harvest and catch share ownership in fisheries lack common identifiers for individuals. We match individuals across harvest and catch share ownership data from 1991 through 2019, enabling a detailed examination of entrants and non-entrants - those who acquire or do not acquire halibut catch shares over the time series. We compare fisheries portfolios in terms of participation and earnings through duration, dissimi-larity, and network analyses. Differences over time and between entrants and non-entrants emerge across ana-lyses. For both groups, cohorts of participants shrink and real individual earnings increase over the time series. However, entrants' cohorts have decreased further relative to historical participation, while entrants' real earnings and fisheries portfolio compositions have diverged from those of non-entrants. Our results reveal broad differences in Alaska fisheries participants' access to a critical fishery, underscoring the role of catch shares in shaping fishing communities' opportunities and resilience in the face of social and environmental change.

AB  - Endophytic Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo-Crivelli) Vuillemin can promote plant growth and health and protect them against herbivores. Two endophytic strains of B. bassiana, BS195 (isolated from soil) and BNE20 (isolated from cucumber), were used by foliar spray and root soaking to evaluate B. bassiana ability to colonize cucumber plants and promote their growth under stressful greenhouse conditions in two separate experiments, as well as its efficacy against Liriomyza sativae Blanchard in a controlled setting. The results showed that the effects significantly depended on the inoculation method and fungal strain. Both B. bassiana strains colonized endophytically the tissues of all cucumber plant parts 30 days post-inoculation, with root soaking being significantly better than foliar spray. The present study showed that the application of B. bassiana BS195, mainly through root soaking, enhanced many growth and health parameters, including plant height, root length, number of leaves, leaf area, fresh and dry weight, the content of dry matter, and the total phenolic content. Cucumber plant treatment with B. bassiana significantly reduced the infestation, severity, number of pupae, and adult emergence of L. sativae after 35 and 51 days of adult release with greater efficiency with the root soaking method. We conclude that introducing B. bassiana through root soaking seems to be effective in stimulating plant growth, and can be a promising technique in controlling L. sativae populations on cucumber plants.

AB  - Principal component analysis was used to search for relationships among communities of predators (Coccinellidae, Syrphidae, and Chrysopidae), aphids, and environmental conditions in crops of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) in 2016, 2017, and 2018. The aphid species collected were Schizaphis graminum (Rondani), Rhopalosiphum maidis (Fitch), and Melanaphis sacchari (Zehntner). M. sacchari was most abundant, with abrupt decrease in abundance over the years. Twelve species of Coccinellidae predators, two Chrysopidae, and 13 of Syrphidae were identified. Principal component analysis revealed a stronger relationship between M. sacchari and predators than weather. The relationship among Hippodamia convergens Guerin-Meneville, Scymnus (Pullus) dozieri Gordon, and M. sacchari was excellent.

AB  - In contrast to predictions from nitrogen limitation theory, recent studies have shown that herbivorous migratory insects tend to be carbohydrate (not protein) limited, likely due to increased energy demands, leading them to preferentially feed on high carbohydrate plants. However, additional factors such as mechanical and chemical defenses can also influence host plant choice and nutrient accessibility. In this study, we investigated the effects of plant protein and carbohydrate availability on plant selection and performance for a migratory generalist herbivore, the Australian plague locust, Chortoicetes terminifera. We manipulated the protein and carbohydrate content of seedling wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) by increasing the protein:carbohydrate ratio using nitrogen (N) fertilizer, and manipulated the physical structure of the plants by grinding and breaking down cell walls after drying the plants. Using a full factorial design, we ran both choice and no-choice experiments to measure preference and performance. We confirmed locust preference for plants with a lower protein-carbohydrate ratio (unfertilized plants). Unlike previous studies with mature wild grass species, we found that intact plants supported better performance than dried and ground plants, suggesting that cell wall removal may only improve performance for tougher or more carbohydrate-rich plants. These results add to the growing body of evidence suggesting that several migratory herbivorous species perform better on plants with a lower protein:carbohydrate ratio.

AB  - Domestication has shaped the population structure and agronomic traits of tea plants, yet the complexity of tea population structure and genetic variation that determines these traits remains unclear. We here investigated the resequencing data of 363 diverse tea accessions collected extensively from almost all tea distributions and found that the population structure of tea plants was divided into eight subgroups, which were basically consistent with their geographical distributions. The genetic diversity of tea plants in China decreased from southwest to east as latitude increased. Results also indicated that Camellia sinensis var. assamica (CSA) illustrated divergent selection signatures with Camellia sinensis var. sinensis (CSS). The domesticated genes of CSA were mainly involved in leaf development, flavonoid and alkaloid biosynthesis, while the domesticated genes in CSS mainly participated in amino acid metabolism, aroma compounds biosynthesis, and cold stress. Comparative population genomics further identified similar to 730 Mb novel sequences, generating 6,058 full-length protein-encoding genes, significantly expanding the gene pool of tea plants. We also discovered 217,376 large-scale structural variations and 56,583 presence and absence variations (PAVs) across diverse tea accessions, some of which were associated with tea quality and stress resistance. Functional experiments demonstrated that two PAV genes (CSS0049975 and CSS0006599) were likely to drive trait diversification in cold tolerance between CSA and CSS tea plants. The overall findings not only revealed the genetic diversity and domestication of tea plants, but also underscored the vital role of structural variations in the diversification of tea plant traits.

AB  - In-line inspection (ILI) is essential for maintaining the integrity of natural gas pipelines. In ILI, pipeline inspection gauges (PIGs) autonomously navigate through pipelines under real-time and resource-constrained conditions to measure pipeline irregularities. Elbow and T-junction detection and estimation (ETDE) play a critical role in enabling PIG navigation to avoid speed excursions which prevent effective data collection or even damage the PIG and pipelines. Existing approaches are often computationally intensive, incomplete, or late estimations, making them unsuitable for real-time operation in such environments. This paper proposes a real-time elbow and T-junction detection and estimation (RT-ETDE) framework that efficiently detects elbows and T-junctions and estimates their critical parameters for PIG navigation using 3D point clouds. Our framework relies on intelligent point cloud partition and feature extraction together with simple geometric solutions which greatly reduce computational complexity. Furthermore, several real-time adaptation techniques are introduced to ensure real-time operation. Experimental results on a prototype pipeline demonstrate that the RT-ETDE framework consistently detects elbows and T-junctions while achieving a 10 Hz frame rate on a real PIG processing unit, validating its suitability for next-generation pipeline inspection systems.

AB  - It is critically necessary to maximize the efficiency of agricultural methods while concurrently reducing the cost of production. Varieties, types, and fruit classification grades are crucial to fruit production. High expenditure, inconsistent subjectivity, and tedious labor characterize traditional and manual varieties classification. This study developed machine learning (ML) models to classify ten apple varieties, extracting the histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) and color moments from RGB apple images. Support vector machine (SVM), random forest classifier (RFC), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classification models were trained with 10-fold stratified cross-validation (Skfold) by using the textural and color features, and a GridSearch was implemented to fine-tune the hyperparameters. The trained models, SVM, RFC, MLP, and KNN were tested with separate test data and performed well, having an accuracy of 98.17%, 96.67%, 98.62%, and 91.28%, respectively. Having the top results, the MLP and SVM models demonstrated the potential of applying HOG and color moments to train ML models for classifying apple varieties. This study suggests conducting further research to thoroughly examine additional image features and determine the impact of combining features and utilizing different classifiers.

AB  - The PM rat strain (an abbreviation of the words "pendulum-like" and "movements") was obtained by selection for enhanced stereotypical pendulum-like head movements, which is one of the forms of manifestation of catatonia. The catatonic syndrome is characterized by psychomotor dysfunction and can occur in individuals with various psychopathologies and neurological diseases, as well as with pharmacological effects. In addition to stereotypy, a predisposition to audiogenic epileptic seizures was also noted in the PM rats in the process of selection. It is known that the pathogenesis of epilepsy is associated with an imbalance of excitation and inhibition processes in the central nervous system, in which the activity of the glutamatergic system plays an important role. To assess the contribution of the brain glutamatergic system of PM rats to the development of catatonic-like and epileptic symptoms, the aim of the work was to study the amount of glutamate and glutamine in the brain structures (hippocampus, frontal cortex, striatum) and blood serum and the expression of the brain glutamatergic system genes in PM rat strain. Using real-time PCR method, an increase in the amount of mRNA of the Grm2 and Slc1a3 genes, a decrease in the amount of mRNA of the Gad1 in the hippocampus, as well as an increase in the amount of mRNA of the Grm2 and Grm5 genes in the frontal cortex, were demonstrated in PM rats. HPLC method demonstrated an increase in the amount of glutamate in the hippocampus of PM rats, which can affect the level of excitation in the brain and, together with a decrease in glutamine in the hippocampus and blood serum, reflects changes in glutamate metabolism. Data obtained indicate the involvement of the glutamatergic system in the development of catatonic-like and epileptic symptoms in PM rat strain and contribute to the development of ideas about the hippocampus as a center of epileptogenesis.

AB  - Indoor temperature is a critical environmental factor for piglets that affects the health, welfare, and production efficiency of domesticated pigs. However, there are limited reports about wireless intelligent thermal control and management system for piglets in largescale pig farms, and evaluation energy saving. This paper presents an Automatic Thermal Control and Management System (ATCMS) of micro-environment for piglets, that could provide a suitable production environment and reduce the energy consumption. ATCMS includes automatic temperature control system (ATCS), multipoint temperature management system (MTMS) and remote access. The infrared heating lamps are chosen in the ATCS for their good performance in heating rate and heating distribution. In order to meet a scientific temperature requirements of piglet growth, the suitable thermal ranges of each growth-stage (STREG) are employed as intelligent control strategies to generate an automatic and precise heating control. MTMS is responsible for communicating with ATCSs and transmitting information to database server for record based on wireless technology. Remote access offers information services for remote administrators by smart phones and clients via Internet. The experiments of ATCMS were carried out both in winter and summer at Binsheng Breeding Piggery Farm, Acheng City, Heilongjiang Province, China. Results showed that the temperature provided by ATCS had been kept in STREG of piglets during the whole winter period. When the indoor temperature during summer period were in or above STREG, heating lamps were turned off by ATCS for a long time. The energy consumption of ATCS were 63.60% in winter and 39.35% in summer with continuous heating system operation. Therefore, ATCMS could take the suitable thermal ranges of each growth-stage as an intelligent control principle to give an automatic and precise control to heating devices in order to meet a scientific temperature requirements of piglet growth.(c) 2020 China Agricultural University.

AB  - The species diversity of Fomes in China has not been well studied, and all Fomes samples were previously identified as Fomes fomentarius based on morphology. Recent phylogenetic and morphological analyses on Fomes were carried out and one new species from Yunnan Province of southwest China, Fomes hengduanensis, , was discovered. F. hengduanensis is characterized by perennial, pileate basidiomata with small ungulate pilei, greyish brown, fawn to dark grey, concentrically zonate and sulcate upper surface, greyish brown pore surface when fresh, distinct sterile margin, a trimitic hyphal system bearing clamp connections on generative hyphae, clavate to fusoid cystidioles, cylindrical basidiospores measuring 9.5-14 x 4.5-7 mu m, and growing on Quercus semecarpifolia in montane forest. It differs from the most common species F. fomentarius by smaller basidiospores (9.5-14 x 4.5-7 mu m vs . 15-21 x 5-7 mu m), and also differs by the DNA sequences. We present the new species with illustrated description, molecular work and comparison with morphologically similar or related species.

AB  - Pigs are one of the most widely used animal models for research due to their similarity to humans, and one of the models of choice for skin research. In this article, we worked with porcine earlobe skin, characterized for a uniaxial tensile test in a universal mechanical test machine (Cellscale (R) Univert). The data obtained from the uniaxial tensile test were fitted to constitutive models for stress derived from the Ogden and Mooney-Rivlin stress-energy density function. The parameters for the Ogden and Mooney-Rivlin hyperelastic models were calibrated using the least squares optimization of Levenberg-Marquardt. In this study, the first constitutive model of the porcine earlobe was established, the model demonstrates the anisotropy of the tissue. This is seen in the classic J-shape, which characterizes soft tissues. These data will be valuable as a reference point for future animal studies, and provide information for pig skin models.

AB  - The study aimed to investigate and compare the morphological and growth characteristics of three Korean native black goat strains: Dangjin, Jangsu, and Tongyeong. The objective was to test the hypothesis that each strain exhibits unique physical and growth traits, reflecting their genetic and environmental adaptations. These insights are intended to support conservation strategies by providing baseline data essential for the preservation and selective breeding of these genetic resources. A total of 804 goats were assessed from 2010 to 2022, with data collected on coat color, presence of wattles, horn structure, body weight, and measurements (body length, depth, chest width, and chest girth) at various growth stages (birth, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of age). Body weights and measurements were recorded using a calibrated digital scale and tape measure, respectively, with each goat measured individually by trained personnel to minimize error. Morphological characteristics were noted based on visual inspection. For statistical analysis, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted using the General Linear Model (GLM) procedure to assess the fixed effects of strain, sex, and age on various growth characteristic variables; and results were presented as means +/- standard deviation (SD). The data revealed that they possessed horns and displayed black or dark brown coat colors, but rarely exhibited wattles. Birth weights were generally consistent across strains, though the Tongyeong strain had the lowest birth weights. At 12 months, males and females in the Tongyeong strain significantly exhibited lower body weights and smaller body measurements compared to the Dangjin and Jangsu strains, highlighting a notable distinction in growth patterns among the strains (p<0.05). Across all strains, male goats were generally larger than females, with body length and depth measurements showing similar trends (p<0.05). Overall, the findings suggest that the Tongyeong strain is characterized by a smaller body size at comparable growth stages, potentially reflecting unique genetic or environmental adaptations within this strain.

AB  - The gradual decline in feed resources for livestock needs alternate ways to ensure non-stop feed supply throughout the year. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of vegetable waste and rice straw silage (VTRS) on immune response, antioxidant status, and microbial changes in duodenum and caecum in Hu sheep. Eight healthy male Hu sheep were randomly distributed into control (fed farm roughage) and VTRS (fed vegetable waste silage) groups for 35 days. Results had shown that silage had less mycotoxin content (p < 0.05). The VTRS increased butyrate content in duodenal digesta, while acetate, butyrate, total volatile fatty acids (TVFA), and valerate were enhanced in caecal digesta (p < 0.05). The VTRS also increased amylase activity in duodenum and ileum tissues, along with GLUT2 and SGLT1 expressions. In serum, Interleukin-10 (IL-10) concentration and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) were increased while malondialdehyde (MDA) was decreased. An increase in T-AOC and GSH-Px activity was also observed, along with increased IL-6, immunoglobulin A (IgA), and catalase in duodenum tissue (p < 0.05). Prevotella was increased in the duodenum and caecum, with Prevotellacae UCG-001 and Christensenellacae R-7 group representing the VTRS group in the duodenum (p < 0.05). KEGG pathway prediction also indicated the enrichment of energy metabolism-related pathways. Significant microbes had shown a significant correlation with immune parameters. It can be concluded that vegetable waste silage has the ability to improve antioxidant status, enhance energy metabolism, and balance intestinal microbiota in Hu sheep.

AB  - Simple Summary African swine fever (ASF) causes serious economic losses to the global pig industry. Unfortunately, there is currently no effective and safe vaccine, although its development is actively continuing. To date, experimental vaccines based on the use of live attenuated strains of the ASF virus (ASFV) obtained by the deletion of viral genes responsible for virulence are the most effective. However, deletion of the same gene in different ASFV isolates can lead to different results. In our work, we have shown that, unlike some other isolates, the deletion of the CD2 gene from the genome of the virulent Congo strain does not lead to its weakening, although it affects the onset of ASF infection in domestic pigs. African swine fever (ASF) is an infectious disease that causes the most significant losses to the pig industry. One of the effective methods for combating this disease could be the development of vaccines. To date, experimental vaccines based on the use of live attenuated strains of the ASF virus (ASFV) obtained by the deletion of viral genes responsible for virulence are the most effective. Deletion of the EP402R gene encoding a CD2-like protein led to the attenuation of various strains of the ASFV, although the degree of attenuation varies among different isolates. Here we have shown that the deletion of the EP402R gene from the genome of a high-virulent Congo isolate did not change either the virulence of the virus or its ability to replicate in the swine macrophage cell cultures in vitro. However, in vivo, animals infected with & UDelta;Congo-v_CD2v had a delay in the onset of the disease and viremia compared to animals infected with the parental strain. Thus, deletion of the CD2 gene in different isolates of the ASFV has a different effect on the virulence of the virus, depending on its genetic background.

AB  - The primary intend of this research is to determine the standard drinking water quality build upon on the Pollution Index of Groundwater (PIG) and health risk index. For this, fifty groundwater samples were chosen and determined for chief cations & anions in the Southwestern part of Cuddapah basin (SW). Maximum samples are under the allowable level of W.H.O standards except Fluoride and nitrate concentrations. Around 60% and 62.5% of the groundwater surpass the allowable range (1.5 mg/L) of fluoride and nitrate (45 mg/L), respectively. As a result, groundwater is not potable due to fluoride and nitrate levels, and a health risk assessment was conducted in this area. From the PIG values; 80% of the samples fall under insignificant pollution category. Nitrate Pollution Index value shows that; 88% of the groundwater polluted with high nitrate content as per national guide lines for drinking purpose. As per USEPA guidelines non carcinogenic effect of nitrate and fluoride in this region vary from 0.01 to 14.48 (adults), 0.02-14.68 (children), 0.01-11.8 (infants), while 92.5, 92.5%, 80% of groundwater is surpass the recommended value (>1) of THI for adults, children and infants. Higher fluoride concentration may be due to geogenic and higher levels of nitrate concentration may be due to human induced activities including fertilizers, industrial effluent and service pipe leakage. The predominant geochemical processes in this region are weathering, ion exchange and to reduce fluoride and nitrate-contaminated in water intake in the research area, precautions should be adopted.

AB  - Host plant quality is recognized to have a significant impact on the performance of herbivorous insects. Nitrogen, a fundamental element, plays a crucial role in plant life cycles, serving as a limiting resource for both plants and herbivores. Despite nitrogen-fertilized plants generally exhibiting enhanced nutritional content, responses to nitrogen variations remain non-uniform, depending on specific insect feeding guilds and the nature of herbivore-plant interactions. In the context of modern agriculture, fertilizers are essential for maintaining soil fertility and crop productivity. Focusing on corn, a fundamental crop in the American continent, heightened fertilizer input has significantly increased yields. However, the intricate relationship between pest behavior and fertilization practices necessitates elucidation. This study aimed to examine the effects of varying levels of nitrogen fertilization on the survivorship, developmental time, and performance of the corn leafhopper Dalbulus maidis (DeLong & Wolcott) (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae), a major maize pest and vector of the corn stunt disease. Bioassays were carried out under controlled conditions, and the vector was fed on maize plants subjected to three fertilization levels (100, 200, and 300 ppm). The results indicate that higher levels of nitrogen fertilization doubled the survival rate of nymphs and accelerated their development into adults. Additionally, adults that received high levels of nitrogen fertilization exhibited twice the longevity and fecundity. The reported findings could contribute to predicting the population dynamics of this crop pest and would enable rational decision-making when intervening for D. maidis control.

AB  - The latest study aimed to identify the effects of organic manure (sheep manure) with four concentrations (0, 5, 10, and 15 g seedling-1 ) and nano-zinc four levels (0, 1, 2, and 3 g L-1)-1 ) on the growth of peach cultivar Hollywood seedlings. The experiment began in 2022 at private nurseries in Babylon province, Iraq. The nano-zinc application with three foliar sprays transpired at 30-day intervals. The experiment continued in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replications. The addition of organic manure treatment (15 g seedling-1 ) excelled in traits of seedling length, stem diameter, number of leaves, chlorophyll content, shoot dry weight, leaves area, and zinc in the leaves, with highest averages of 62.03 cm, 8.08 mm, 51.20 leaf seedling-1 , 43.8 SPAD, 57.35 g seedling-1 , 1322.3 cm2, 2 , and 56.40 mg kg-1 , respectively, compared with the control treatment. The addition of nano-zinc (3 g L-1)-1 ) was significantly superior in performance and excelled other treatments by revealing the highest values for the above growth traits, i.e., 60.45 cm, 7.83 mm, 50.90 leaves seedling-1 , 42.35 SPAD, 54.85 g seedling-1 , 1251.90 cm2, 2 , and 53.63 mg kg-1 , respectively.

AB  - We previously demonstrated that the histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA), improves the development of cat-cow interspecies somatic cell nuclear transfer (iSCNT) embryos. In this study, we investigated if 50 nM TSA treatment for 24 h would improve the rate of embryo development to the blastocyst stage in cat-pig iSCNT embryos, compared with cat-cow iSCNT embryos under same treatment. Despite the SCNT technique (Piezo technique) differing from our previous study (conventional technique), we confirmed that TSA supplementation at 50 nM improved the development of cat-cow iSCNT blastocysts. Porcine oocytes showed the capability to support cat iSCNT embryo development up to the blastocyst stage without TSA treatment although bovine oocytes did not. The blastocyst developmental rate of TSA treated cat-pig iSCNT embryos was significantly lower than that of the non-treated groups (0.68 and 7.95%, respectively, p < 0.05). We used in vitro-fertilized (IVF) porcine embryos to compare the effects of acetylation levels on H3K9 between cat-pig iSCNT embryos and naturally fertilized embryos. We found no differences in acetylation levels of H3K9 between the TSA treated and non-treated iSCNT groups, and the levels were lower than that of IVF embryos. In conclusion, the effects of TSA treatment on iSCNT embryo production were found to be species-specific and dependent on individual characteristics.

AB  - Studies regarding how environmental risk evolves in abandoned mining areas in the medium term have been seldom carried out. The answer to this question is not obvious despite it is essential in order to evaluate the need to take urgent control measures in these areas. Fifty-two samples corresponding to soils (from natural pasture and arable lands) and mine tailings were collected in the surroundings of an old Spanish Pb/Zn mine (San Quintin, Central Spain). Current concentrations of pseudo-total and available metal (loid)s (Pb, Zn, Cd, Cu, As and Ag) were determined and the environmental risk assessment (ERA) was conducted with these data and those corresponding to a sampling previously carried out in 2006. ERA was carried out by calculating the geoaccumulation index (Igeo), the pollution load index (PLI) and the potential ecological risk index (PER). Results demonstrated that Pb and Zn concentrations have increased in the soils of the plots surrounding the mining areas causing a moderate rise in most of the determined pollution indices between 2006 and 2020. It was especially significant in the pastureland areas, with increases up to 17% in the number of soil samples that reached the highest risk classification in 2020 as compared to those taken in 2006. The results obtained here demonstrate that the environmental risk can actually increase in a continuous way in abandoned mining areas despite the closure of the mining operation and the effect of the possible natural attenuation.

AB  - 1. Animal personality influences how individuals perceive and react to different stimuli, such as food quality and predation risk, thereby shaping foraging behaviour. As a consequence, animal personality is predicted to influence the diet and dietary specialisation of individuals within a population, but animal personality and dietary specialisation have yet to be linked.
   2. Here, we tested whether individual diet and dietary specialisation are a function of animal personality, using an arboreal herbivore, the common brushtail possum, as a model species. We hypothesised that proactive individuals have more diverse foraging opportunities than reactive individuals. We therefore predicted that proactive animals (more exploratory, bold and more active) would be less specialised, with a broader and higher quality diet than their reactive counterparts. We quantified the personality traits and dietary niche using proportional similarity index and specialisation categories of possums (n = 30) in a population flanking native eucalypt woodland and residential gardens in suburban Sydney, Australia.
   3. We found that personality traits were related to the breadth and quality of the realised diets of individual possums. As predicted, proactive individuals had a broad, high-quality diet with less individual dietary specialisation than reactive individuals. Highly exploratory individuals had a more diverse diet than less exploratory individuals, and bold individuals were more likely than shy individuals to consume plants on the ground.
   4. Our study demonstrates an important link between animal personality and individual dietary specialisation. The finding that the personality of individuals is associated with different diet choices within the same landscape is fundamentally significant. First, personality as a driver of niche partitioning likely reduces within-species competition and hence could contribute to adaptive capacity. Second, the strength of ecological processes arising from interactions (e.g. predator-prey and plant-herbivore interactions) could differ among individuals according to their personality traits.
   5. Our findings are also relevant for effectively managing both threatened native and invasive species. Management strategies will be improved by incorporating knowledge of individual traits and their ecological consequences, plus the ecological context of food-and fear-scapes.

AB  - This paper develops a functional hybrid factor regression modelling framework to handle the heterogeneity of many large-scale imaging studies, such as the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative study. Despite the numerous successes of those imaging studies, such heterogeneity may be caused by the differences in study environment, population, design, protocols or other hidden factors, and it has posed major challenges in integrative analysis of imaging data collected from multicentres or multistudies. We propose both estimation and inference procedures for estimating unknown parameters and detecting unknown factors under our new model. The asymptotic properties of both estimation and inference procedures are systematically investigated. The finite-sample performance of our proposed procedures is assessed by using Monte Carlo simulations and a real data example on hippocampal surface data from the Alzheimer's disease study.

AB  - Heavy metals (HMs) remain persistent in soil for a long time and thus present a long-term threat of environmental pollution. In this study, the concentrations of some HMs (As, Cu, Zn, Pb, and Mo) in soil, potentially affected by the ex-operation of a metallurgical plant-specifically, a copper smelter in Alaverdi Town, northeastern Armenia-were measured, based on which, the HM contamination and its ecological, biological, and health effects were assessed. Concentrations of HMs (Cu, Zn, and Pb) were also measured in different plant (leaves) and invertebrate species that occur in the soil over the metallurgical factory site in order to assess the potential for the bioremoval of HMs from the soil. The results showed that the ex-operation of the metallurgical facility created such contamination in the soil that it caused a noticeable loss of invertebrate biomass in the soil and posed ecological, non-carcinogenic (for children), and carcinogenic health hazards. The investigated plant and invertebrate species were characterized by different capacities for the accumulation of HMs from the soil, based on which the plant species Fraxinus excelsior, Acer platanoides, Robinia pseudoacacia, and Aesculus hippocastanum and the invertebrate species Deroceras caucasicum, Limax flavus, and Eisenia rosea are recommended to be used for the selective removal of HMs (Cu, Zn, and Pb) from the soil.

AB  - Simple Summary: Senecavirus A (SVA) is a virus that affects pigs and causes skin lesions that look similar to those caused by serious foreign animal diseases like foot-and-mouth disease. Because of this, every case requires careful investigation to rule out more severe threats. In 2015, a major outbreak of SVA raised concerns across the U.S. swine industry. However, since then, there has been little research on how often SVA occurs in U.S. pig farms. This study examines how frequently new SVA outbreaks happen in breeding herds to better understand how the virus spreads, as well as when and where it is most commonly detected. Our findings show that while SVA continues to affect U.S. breeding herds each year, it remains relatively uncommon, with only in a small proportion of herds affected. Outbreaks tend to happen more often in the second half of the year, with most cases occurring in the Midwest. Understanding these patterns can help farmers and veterinarians to improve prevention strategies and limit the impact of SVA on swine production. Senecavirus A (SVA) is an endemic pathogen with ongoing relevance to the U.S. swine industry due to its clinical resemblance to foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) and its potential impact on animal health and trade. This study analyzes the incidence and geographic distribution of SVA outbreaks in U.S. breeding herds from January 2015 to December 2024. We used enhanced surveillance by combining diagnostic data from veterinary diagnostic laboratories and practitioners' reports to assess SVA incidence, identifying temporal fluctuations and regional patterns. Our findings indicate that the cumulative incidence of SVA in U.S. breeding herds is low overall (<2.5% per year), with peak incidence observed during the third and fourth quarters of the calendar year. Outbreaks are more frequently reported in the Midwest. Our results suggest potential seasonality or regional factors influencing disease transmission. The median time interval between SVA outbreaks for sites experiencing more than one outbreak is 402 days. This study provides valuable insights into the current epidemiology of SVA in U.S. breeding herds, and highlights the need for continued monitoring and preparedness to prevent future outbreaks.

AB  - Most scholarship and policy documentation that examines the problem of "rhino poaching" assumes that the potential for economic gain drives impoverished people to hunt threatened and endangered wildlife illegally. The amount of money illegal hunters can extract from the lethal trade in rhinoceros' horn is extraordinary. Yet, the provocation of one convicted hunter, who referred to rhinos as "the mine" (as in a gold mine) reveals complicated meanings underneath and adjoined to monetary explanations. In the transfrontier region comprising the Kruger and Limpopo National Parks, men have responded to colonial and post-colonial dispossession through institutions of migrant labour. When dispossessed mine labourers developed the wealth of southern African colonial states, they salvaged for themselves, economic benefits, status, and dignity. In the post-colonial context, the protection of threatened species forecloses opportunities for migrant labour and generates the need for "peripheral" or illegal labour. The killing of protected wildlife to trade in their parts enables hunters to extract money, cultural continuity, and dignity from the very processes that impoverish and dispossess them. Improved understandings of people's motivations to hunt wildlife illegally necessitate theorisations that are more explicitly co-produced, derived from and responsive to the people living (and dying) with conservation by dispossession.

AB  - Knowing the duration insect pests are in the environment is vital for growers to determine management schemes and apply treatments. Unfortunately, experiments to determine long-term insect performance across plant cultivars are infrequently conducted. With that in mind, we report here the performance of Spodoptera frugiperda, the fall armyworm, on jasmonic acid (JA) induced/non-induced soybean cultivars. JA induction increases plant defensive compounds and can be considered an equivalent to a plant's response to herbivory. S. frugiperda is a global pest, with infestations in soybeans becoming an emerging problem, making information on this pest's performance on soybeans warranted. Thus, we reared larvae on two different soybean cultivars with contrasting defensive strategies when induced with JA and measured 7-day survival, development time to pupation, and pupal mass. Plant cultivar and JA induction were both important causes of mortality. Although plant cultivars varied in their amounts of constitutive/inducible defenses, this did not cause an interactive effect between plant cultivar and induction. Insect development to pupation was also extended when fed on induced plants regardless of cultivar, while pupal mass was not affected. Overall, induced plant defenses lowered larval survival and extended development time which would alleviate pest pressure and extend the period growers have for detecting infestations.

AB  - ICAM2 is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and plays an important role in inflammatory response and xenograft rejection. This study aimed to analyze the expression regulation pattern, sequence characteristics and potential biological functions of ICAM2 gene in the Banna mini-pig inbred lines. The results showed that the full-length CDS of ICAM2 gene was 834 bp, encoding 277 amino acids, including 11 exons and 10 introns. The ICAM2 gene contained two conserved domains, which were members of the ICAM_N family and the Ig superfamily; the gene has a transmembrane helix and a signal peptide sequence. Multi-species phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that the gene was highly conserved in Rodentia, Primates, Perissodactyla and Artiodactyla. Protein-protein interaction network analysis indicated that ICAM2 interacted closely with ICAM1, ITGAL, ICAM3, ITGB2 and MSN. ICAM2 mRNA was highly expressed in tissues such as the liver, spleen, lymph nodes and tonsils, and its protein was mainly expressed in the cytoplasm. In summary, these findings laid the foundation for future studies on the role of the ICMA2 gene in key biological processes such as the immune system of BMI pigs and xenotransplantation immune rejection.

AB  - Red deer (Cervus elaphus) blood is widely used as a health product. Mixed culture fermentation improves the flavor and bioavailability of deer blood (DB), and both DB and its enzymatic hydrolysates exhibit anti-fatigue activities in vivo. To elucidate the bioactive ingredients, enzymatic hydrolysates were fractioned into different peptide groups using reversed phase resin chromatography, and then evaluated using an exhaustive swimming mice model to assess swimming time and biochemical parameters. The structures of the bioactive peptides were elucidated by high performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass detection. Thirty-one compounds were identified as glutamine or branched-chain amino acids containing short peptides, of which Val-Ala-Asn, Val-Val-Ser-Ala, Leu(Ile)-Leu(Ile)-Val-Thr, Pro-His-Pro-Thr-Thr, Glu-Val-Ala-Phe and Val-Leu(Ile)-Asp-Ala-Phe are new peptides. The fractions containing glutamine or valine short peptides, Ala-Gln, Val-Gln, Val-Val-Ser-Ala, Val-Leu(Ile)-Ser improved exercise endurance by increasing hepatic glycogen (HG) storage. The peptides group containing Leu(Ile)-Leu(Ile), Asp-Gln, Phe- Leu(Ile), Val-Val-Tyr-Pro contributed to decreased muscle lactic acid (MLA)accumulation and to an increase in HG. The anti-fatigue activities of DB hydrolysates were attributed to the synergistic effects of different types of peptides.

AB  - The crevalle jack Caranx hippos is a significant fishery resource in the Caribbean Sea; however, biological information necessary for its effective management is currently lacking. To address this gap, this study conducted an integrated multiannual analysis of fishery-dependent data on the size structure, maturity, and spatiotemporal dynamics of landings in six Colombian Caribbean regions. This study found that encircling gillnets, drift gillnets, and seine nets yielded a higher catch in terms of mass, whereas handlines, encircling gillnets, and fixed gillnets captured small and immature specimens. These practices, which affect both adult and immature populations, appear to pose a significant threat to stock health, highlighting the need for preventive approaches to fishery management in Colombian waters. Additionally, the results revealed sexual dimorphism, with females being smaller than males, and the size at maturity of females was estimated at 54.2 cm LT (81 % immature and 19 % mature). Furthermore, this study recorded annual fluctuations in the number of landed specimens at all sites, with La Guajira in the northeastern area of the Colombian Caribbean and Atla<acute accent>ntico in the southwest area showing the highest values. The findings suggest a decrease in the size at maturity of C. hippos over a span of ten years, with an average reduction of 2.25 cm LT per year, in response to fishing pressure. In addition, spatiotemporal factors that affect fleet operations play a key role in these fluctuations. This study emphasises the need to adopt comprehensive approaches to improve our understanding of the reproductive dynamics of crevalle jack stocks to ensure the sustainability of artisanal fishing.

AB  - Slow and consistent nutrient release by organic fertilizers can improve plant nutrient balance and defenses, leading to herbivore avoidance of organically managed crops in favor of conventional crops with weaker defenses. We propose that this relative attraction to conventional plants, coupled with the use of genetically modified, insecticidal crops (Bt), has created an unintentional attract-and-kill system. We sought to determine whether Bt and non-Bt corn Zea mays L. plants grown in soil collected from five paired organic and conventional fields differed in attractiveness to European corn borer [Ostrinia nubilalis (Hubner)] moths, by conducting ovipositional choice and flight tunnel assays. We then examined the mechanisms driving the observed differences in attraction by comparing soil nutrient profiles, soil microbial activity, plant nutrition, and plant volatile profiles. Finally, we assessed whether European corn borer abundance near corn fields differed based on soil management. European corn borer preferred plants grown in conventional soil but did not discriminate between Bt and non-Bt corn. Organic management and more alkaline soil were associated with an increased soil magnesium:potassium ratio, which increased plant magnesium, and were linked to reduced European corn borer oviposition. There was an inconsistent trend for higher European corn borer moth activity near conventional fields. Our results extend the mineral balance hypothesis describing conventional plant preference by showing that it can also improve attraction to plants with genetically inserted toxins. Unintentional attract (to conventional) and (Bt) kill is a plausible scenario for pest declines in response to Bt corn adoption, but this effect may be obscured by variation in other management practices and landscape characteristics.

AB  - Synthetic deer antler peptides (TSKYR, TSK, and YR) stimulate the proliferation of human chondrocytes and osteoblasts and increase the chondrocyte content of collagen and glycosamino-glycan in vitro. This study investigated the peptide mixture's pain relief and chondroprotective effect in a rat model of collagenase-induced osteoarthritis. Thirty-six adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups: control (saline), positive control (hyaluronic acid), and ex-perimental (peptides). Intra-articular collagenase injections were administered on days 1 and 4 to induce osteoarthritis in the left knees of the rats. Two injections of saline, hyaluronic acid, or the peptides were injected into the same knees of each corresponding group at the beginning of week one and two, respectively. Joint swelling, arthritic pain, and histopathological changes were evaluated. Injection of the peptides significantly reduced arthritic pain compared to the control group, as evidenced by the closer-to-normal weight-bearing and paw withdrawal threshold test results. Histological analyses showed reduced cartilage matrix loss and improved total cartilage degeneration score in the experimental versus the control group. Our findings suggest that intra-articular injection of synthetic deer antler peptides is a promising treatment for osteoarthritis.

AB  - Simple Summary In cases of birth difficulties in sheep, caesarean sections can be life-saving. It is, however, important for farmers to know whether the ewe is likely to conceive again. In field cases following birth difficulties, many factors such as the problematic delivery itself or any underlying health problems will also influence these outcomes. In order to assess a potential direct effect of surgery, it is important to study healthy animals undergoing pre-planned operations. Animals from a university sheep flock were, therefore, studied retrospectively by evaluating their breeding records. Caesarean sections were performed by veterinary students as part of their training, and the subsequent breeding outcomes were compared to animals which had only lambed naturally. There was no negative effect of caesarean surgery on the subsequent pregnancy rate or on lamb viability or birth weights. However, in the pregnancy immediately following a surgical delivery, a smaller number of lambs was born per ewe, and a higher number of mating attempts was necessary to achieve pregnancy. The number of lambs born returned to pre-caesarean levels in further subsequent pregnancies. We, therefore, conclude that caesarean sections in sheep have very little influence on their long-term reproductive performance; this procedure is, therefore, worthwhile.Abstract Post-surgical reproductive performance following ovine caesarean section has not been well studied. To assess any direct effects of surgical delivery in the absence of confounders such as dystocia or underlying diseases, we studied elective surgery performed in healthy animals for teaching purposes. Four hundred and eleven paired breeding records following vaginal delivery (n = 233), elective caesarean section (n = 122), and subsequent further vaginal deliveries in animals with a history of one prior elective caesarean operation (n = 56) were evaluated retrospectively. The overall subsequent pregnancy rate was 95%. Multivariable statistical analyses did not reveal any significant influence of planned caesarean surgery on subsequent conception, stillbirth, perinatal lamb mortality, lamb birth weights, or the incidence of premature foetal death (mummification and abortion). A significantly higher number of mating attempts was, however, necessary. Also, a significant reduction in litter size was seen in the first pregnancy immediately following a surgical delivery in comparison to animals which had previously only delivered vaginally (p = 0.001), but litter size returned to pre-caesarean levels in further follow-up pregnancies in animals with a history of one elective caesarean section (p = 0.436). Subsequent long-term reproductive performance of sheep following elective caesarean section is thus excellent, and the results encourage retention for breeding.

AB  - A variety of factors affect how much certain plants are eaten by herbivorous insects. In the eastern foothills of the Rocky Mountains of Alberta, Canada, Parnassius smintheus larvae have been described as virtually monophagous on Sedum lanceolatum, however a second host plant Rhodiola integrifolia is found in the region. We explore the differences in herbivory, larval performance, and oviposition between host plants. We also surveyed host plant abundance in the field to determine the amount of feeding damage on both species. In the lab, we found that there was no preference for feeding on S. lanceolatum versus R. integrifolia. The growth and survival of P. smintheus larvae also was not affected by the host plant. In the field we found much lower rates of herbivory on R. integrifolia than S. lanceolatum. We conclude that there are differences in herbivory observed in the field because P. smintheus larvae encounter R. integrifolia much less than S. lanceolatum. Possible mechanisms include the two host plants occurring in different microhabitats, P. smintheus females not ovipositing near R. integrifolia, or P. smintheus larvae not being able todetect R. integrifolia from a distance.

AB  - The following leafhoppers (Deltocephalinae: Bonaspeiini) of the Fynbos Biome of South Africa are treated: Colistra parvulus (Linnavuori, 1961) is redescribed and three new species of Colistra Davies are described, i.e., C. acapitatus sp. n., C. bucapitatus sp. n. and C. semialius sp. n.; four species of Proekoides Stiller, 1986 are reviewed with the addition of P. postspina sp. n.; Proekes cephaleus (Naude, 1926) is redescribed with details of the female ovipositor, and three new species, i.e., P. hemiplatyphalis sp. n., P. tetracaphalis sp. n., P. diacaphalis sp. n.; a new genus, Xhoreus gen. n. is described with one new species, X. ulosentus sp. n. All species are of similar appearance, size and with reduced hind wings. Two species, C. acapitatus and C. bucapitatus, were collected on Rooibos tea. Keys are provided to species of Colistra, Proekes and Proekoides. Distribution models show limited ranges in the Western Cape province and confined to the Fynbos Biome while Xhoreus ulosentus is possibly endemic to the Cape Peninsula. The validity of the tribe Bonaspeiini is discussed.

AB  - Withanolides are a substantial bio-diverse group of naturally occurring steroidal lactones. Herein, ten still undescribed withanolides (1-10), along with the knowns withaferin A (11), 2,3-dihidrowithaferin A (12), and two other non-withanolides, vomifoliol (13) and the N-trans-p-coumaroyltyramine (14), were isolated from the hexane/EtOAc 1:1 leaf extract of Athenaea velutina (Sendtn.) D'Arcy (Solanaceae). The structures of the undescribed withanolides were elucidated by an extensive analysis of their spectroscopic data: 1D and 2D NMR, HRESIMS, single-crystal X-ray diffraction, and ECD calculations. The antiproliferative properties of the withanolides were evaluated against the human cancer cell lines: central nervous system (SNB-19), prostate (PC-3), colon (HCT-116), and leukemia (HL-60), and a murine fibroblast-like cell (L-929). Withanolides 15-17, isolated from the same plant in a previous work, were included for the pharmacological tests. Compounds 15 and 16 exhibited cytotoxic activity for all cancer cells, while 2 was selectively more cytotoxic to HL-60 cells. In addition, the withanolides were evaluated in guinea pig cardiac tissues. Compounds 15 and 16 showed cardiotonic activity, devoid of a positive chronotropic effect which is a good pharmacological profile for an inotrope agent.

AB  - The ten-eleven translocation (TET) enzyme family, which includes TET1/2/3, participates in active DNA demethylation in the eukaryotic genome; moreover, TET1/2/3 are functionally redundant in mice embryos. However, the combined effect of TET1/2/3 triple-gene knockdown or knockout on the porcine oocytes or embryos is still unclear. In this study, using Bobcat339, a specific small-molecule inhibitor of the TET family, we explored the effects of TET enzymes on oocyte maturation and early embryogenesis in pigs. Our results revealed that Bobcat339 treatment blocked porcine oocyte maturation and triggered early apoptosis. Furthermore, in the Bobcat339-treated oocytes, spindle architecture and chromosome alignment were disrupted, probably due to the huge loss of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC)and concurrent increase in 5-methylcytosine (5mC). After Bobcat339 treatment, early parthenogenetic embryos exhibited abnormal 5mC and 5hmC levels, which resulted in compromised cleavage and blastocyst rate. The mRNA levels of EIF1A and DPPA2 (ZGA marker genes) were significantly decreased, which may explain why the embryos were arrested at the 4-cell stage after Bobcat339 treatment. In addition, the mRNA levels of pluripotency-related genes OCT4 and NANOG were declined after Bobcat339 treatment. RNA sequencing analysis revealed differentially expressed genes in Bobcat339-treated embryos at the 4-cell stage, which were significantly enriched in cell proliferation, cell component related to mitochondrion, and cell adhesion molecule binding. Our results indicated that TET proteins are essential for porcine oocyte maturation and early embryogenesis, and they act by mediating 5mC/5hmC levels and gene transcription.

AB  - Metals are harmful inorganic pollutants in aquatic environments when their concentrations are higher than expected (or tolerated) and, in low concentrations, they can lead sublethal genetic injuries. Baseline frequencies of micronucleated cells (MN parts per thousand) of three mangrove crab species were established in a pristine mangrove (Jureia-Itatins Ecological Station, JIES). Aratus pisonii, Ucides cordatus and Goniopsis cruentata belong to different functional groups, regarding the diet and lifestyle. Overall, the baseline MN parts per thousand of G. cruentata (1.7 +/- 1.2; mean +/- sd) was higher than that of A. pisonii (0.9 +/- 1.1) and U. cordatus (1.3 +/- 0.9). These differences can be explained by the diet (gl, green leaves; sl, senescent leaves; a, animal items; or their combination) and lifestyle of these species, as their degree of contact with abiotic compartments (w, water; s, sediment). Aratus pisonii is an arboreal crab and specialist herbivore, associated with few compartments (w + gl); Ucides cordatus is a digger crab, generalist herbivore, using three compartments (w + s + sl); and Goniopsis cruentata is a cursorial crab, omnivorous, exploring more compartments (w + s + sl + a). Thus, using a broader range of compartments and a more diverse diet were correlated with a higher genotoxicity. Metals in JIES were registered in environmentally safe concentrations but seem to influence the baseline MN parts per thousand in crab species. Higher genotoxicity was registered in species that interact with more compartments (especially the sediment), a fact that should be considered in monitoring processes.

AB  - The aim of this study was to elucidate the impact of porcine pancreatic enzymes (Creon (R) pancrelipase) in comparison to microbial-derived alpha amylase (MD amylase) on the small intestine wall structure, mucosal glycogen accumulation, and enterocyte turnover. The impact of enzyme supplementation on the small intestine was explored in 18 pigs with surgically induced exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI). Four healthy pigs served as the control group. EPI led to reduced villus length, crypt depth, and thickness of the mucosa and muscularis layers compared to those of healthy pigs. All these changes appeared to be reversible after enzyme supplementation. Brush border thickness was decreased in EPI and increased with both enzyme preparations, with MD amylase treatment leading to the highest values in the proximal jejunum. No EPI-induced changes were observed in the goblet cell (GC) population, but significant increases in GC number and area were observed following MD amylase treatment. Glycogen accumulation within the duodenal mucosa was significantly increased in EPI pigs. EPI was also shown to significantly increase apoptotic activity and decrease proliferative activity in comparison to healthy animals, while both enzyme preparations resulted in the complete recovery of both proliferative and apoptotic activity in all investigated intestinal segments. Creon (R) influenced the morphology of the small intestine. However, supplementation of exogenous microbial amylase alone also affected gut morphology in a similar way to that of the complex host pancreatic enzymes offered orally. These data indicate that in addition to their role in digestion of nutrients in EPI, intraluminal pancreatic enzymes, especially amylase, contribute to gut health through maintenance of the intestinal wall architecture and physiological enterocyte turnover.

AB  - Simple Summary Nowadays, society demands certification and authentication methodologies that are able to clarify the origin of different livestock products. This is considered of paramount importance in order to not only provide accurate information to consumers, but also to protect producers against fraudulent practices. In this context, the aim of this study is to establish a methodology to authenticate the grazing activity of dairy goats. To achieve this, milk and faeces samples were analysed using Near-Infrared Spectroscopy. The good results obtained in discriminant models demonstrated differences in both types of matrices when the two feeding regimes were compared. The development of this methodology could extend its use not only in dairy systems of goats but also in other animal species and systems. Consumers are increasingly prone to request information about the production systems of the food they buy. For this purpose, certification and authentication methodologies are necessary not only to protect the choices of consumers, but also to protect producers and production systems. The objective of this preliminary work was to authenticate the grazing system of dairy goats using Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) analyses of milk and faeces of the animals. Spectral information and several mathematical pre-treatments were used for the development of six discriminant models based on different algorithms for milk and faeces samples. Results showed that the NIRS spectra of both types of samples had some differences when the two feeding regimes were compared. Therefore, good discrimination rates were obtained with both strategies (faeces and milk samples), with classification percentages of up to 100% effectiveness. Discrimination of feeding regime and grazing authentication based on NIRS analysis of milk samples and an alternative sample such as faeces is considered as a potential approach for dairy goats and small ruminant production.

AB  - A sustainability evaluation of aviation fuels derived from camelina was conducted within the arid regions of China for mitigating climate risk and enhancing water-use efficiency timely and reliably. So, based on climatic conditions, soil conditions, and crop growth characteristics, the stages and life-cycle water footprints, life-cycle energy consumption, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of aviation fuel produced using camelina were investigated and the water footprint (WF), including the green water footprint (WFg), blue water footprint (WFb), and grey water footprint (WFgr) for each phase in producing selected sustainable aviation fuels assessed. Results showed a WF ranging from 0.016 to 0.0162, 0.055 to 0.0556, 0.0631 to 0.0638 and 0.0277-0.028 m(3)/MJ of raw materials for the growth stage in corn, soybean, camelina, and canola, respectively, and the results were most influenced by climate change. The WFt (life cycle water footprint) was analyzed based on a feedstock basis, with WF(t)s of 0.276, 0.3131, 0.2053 and 0.0933 m(3)/MJ of sustainable aviation fuel obtained for produced aviation fuel using corn, soybean, camelina, and canola, respectively. The main contribution to the WFt occurs during crop growth, with green and blue water influenced by factors such as climate and crop type and grey water influenced by fertilizer application. The life cycle energy consumption and GHG emissions assocaited with corn, soybean, camelina, and canola were in the range of 0.2-1.12 MJ/MJ and 12.34-31.25 g/MJ, respectively, which is 32.9-90.2 % and 60-92.9 % lower as compared to conventional fossil fuels. Combined with the climatic and soil conditions in Northwest China, from the perspective of the WF, energy consumption, and GHG emissions, camelina is suitable as a feedstock for the production of sustainable aviation fuels in Northwest China. However, the cultivation of high-yielding varieties and improvements to the production technology are necessary for its viable use.

The Indian livestock sector is one of the largest in the world with a total livestock population of 535.82 million, similar to 10.7% of the world's livestock population. Buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) holds significant importance in India and other Asian countries, notably contributing to their economies by surpassing cattle in milk production and providing various valuable products. The limited availability of genomic and transcriptomic resources for buffaloes hinders the efforts to enhance their traits for increased milk and meat production. To address this gap, this study adopted the state-of-the-art bioinformatics tools to analyse 2429 transcriptomes representing 438 BioSamples from 23 BioProjects obtained from a public domain database, representing 76 different types of tissues and cell types from all major organ systems in buffalo species (river and swamp). The outcome of this exhaustive genomic data led to the development of a relational buffalo expression database based on a three-tier architecture named as BuffExDb (http://46.202.167.198/buffex/). The user-friendliness and flexibilities in retrieval of tissue-specific genes (TSGs) and their functional annotation are the major characteristics of BuffExDb. This is the first of its kind that offers an effortlessly navigable and filterable database, enabling users to examine and visualize the expression levels of each tissue across multiple samples, simultaneously. It also provides the Tau score parameter for the identification of TSGs along with their essential roles in tissue development, maintenance, and function as observed through the enrichment test for gene ontologies. The exhaustive outcome of this work would pave the way for the biological, functional, and evolutionary studies for easy access. This prior information based on tissue-specific mechanisms can be used for future genomic research, especially in association studies in endeavour of enhanced buffalo breeding and conservation programmes.Database URL: http://46.202.167.198/buffex/

AB  - The current study evaluated the impact of increasing levels of supplemental black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) oil, a novel and sustainable feed ingredient, on growth performance and blood chemistry indices in nursery pigs. Pigs were weaned at 21 days of age (n = 192; body weight = 6.9 +/- 0.15 kg) and randomly allotted within sex and body weight to 1 of 4 dietary treatments, using 48 pens (4 pigs/pen). Treatments contained 0, 2, 4, or 6% supplemental BSFL oil, replacing equivalent quantities of corn oil. A 3-phase feeding program was used with 14, 11, and 15 days for phase 1 to 3, respectively. Supplementation of BSFL oil linearly (p <= 0.052) improved pig body weight and daily gain throughout the study and overall. No differences were observed in feed intake; however, feed efficiency was linearly improved with BSFL oil supplementation for phase 1 and 2 (p < 0.05). Serum cholesterol increased linearly (p = 0.002) and platelet count tended to increase linearly (p = 0.082) with increasing BSFL oil. No other differences were detected in blood chemistry and all results were within normal ranges. In conclusion, BSFL oil is a valuable, energy-dense feed ingredient that can promote growth performance of nursery pigs.

AB  - Driven by economic interests, adding adulterations in chili powder is a problem which threatens people's health. Thanks to its nondestructive, rapid, and portable advantages, electronic nose has more potential to be used for adulteration detection than the traditional methods. An approach for identifying the adulterants in chili powder was proposed in this paper. Firstly, an electronic nose system with 10 gas sensors was designed, and then the response images were drawn based on the response signals of the electronic nose. Afterwards, gas features were extracted from those response images by using a histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) algorithm. Finally, an SVM-based identification model was constructed to achieve the identification of plant adulterants in chili powder. The experimental results showed that the identification accuracy of the adulterant categories (almond shell, red beetroot, and tomato peel) based on the HOG features could reach up to 98.3%, and the identification results for adulterant content were 94.2%, 93.3%, and 95%, respectively. Furthermore, in order to compare the efficiency of the proposed identification approach, the widely used model AlexNet was also investigated and discussed.

AB  - Laboratory studies have revealed that strigolatone (SL) and karrikin (KAR) signalling mediate responses to abiotic and biotic stresses, and reshape branching architecture that could increase reproductive performance and crop yields. To understand the ecological function of SL and KAR signalling, transgenic lines of wild tobacco Nicotiana attenuata, silenced in SL/KAR biosynthesis/signalling were grown in the glasshouse and in two field plots in the Great Basin Desert in Utah over four field seasons. Of the lines silenced in SL and KAR signalling components (irMAX2, irD14, irKAI2 and irD14 x irKAI2 plants), which exhibited the expected increases in shoot branching, only irMAX2 plants showed a strong leaf-bleaching phenotype when grown in the field. In the field, irMAX2 plants had lower sugar and higher leaf amino acid contents, lower lifetime fitness and were more susceptible to herbivore attack compared to wild-type plants. These irMAX2 phenotypes were not observed in glasshouse-grown plants. Transcriptomic analysis revealed dramatic responses to high-light intensity in irMAX2 leaves in the field: lutein contents decreased, and transcriptional responses to high-intensity light, singlet oxygen and hydrogen peroxide increased. PAR and UV-B manipulations in the field revealed that the irMAX2 bleaching phenotype is reversed by decreasing PAR, but not UV-B fluence. We propose that NaMAX2 functions in high-light adaptation and fitness optimisation by regulating high-light responses independently of its roles in the SL and KAR signalling pathways. The work provides another example of the value of studying the function of genes in the complex environments in which plants evolved, namely nature.

AB  - The aim of the research was to evaluate the impact of consumption of pork enriched with selenium on selenium concentration, antioxidant status and lipid parameters of consumers. The research involved 59 probands in four experiments from the general population of Slovakia. The probands consumed 200 g of enriched meat with organic selenium from pork fed with selenized yeast three times a week during one month. Probands of exp.1 consumed freshly prepared lunch and probands of exp. 2-4 consumed sterilized meat. During the experiment, three blood collections were carried out. After short-term consumption of enriched pork with selenium, concentration of selenium in the blood serum of probands increased significantly in exp. 1 and 4 (P < 0.05). TAS increased significantly after 28 days in exp. 2, 3 and 4 (P < 0.05 and P < 0.001). The level of T-C and TG significantly decreased in exp. 2 and 4 (P < 0.05). HDL-C levels non-significantly increased (P > 0.05) in exp. 1, 3, and 4. The levels of LDL-C significantly decreased in exp. 2 (P < 0.05). These results demonstrated that pork appears to be a suitable component for increase the selenium intake of consumers.

AB  - Tobacco smoking is classified as a human carcinogen. A wide variety of new products, in particular electronic cigarettes (e-cigs), have recently appeared on the market as an alternative to smoking. Although the in vitro toxicity of e-cigs is relatively well known, there is currently a lack of data on their long-term health effects. In this context, the aim of our study was to compare, on a mouse model and using a nose-only exposure system, the in vivo genotoxic and mutagenic potential of e-cig aerosols tested at two power settings (18 W and 30 W) and conventional cigarette (3R4F) smoke. The standard comet assay, micronucleus test and Pig-a gene mutation assay were performed after subacute (4 days), subchronic (3 months) and chronic (6 months) exposure. The generation of oxidative stress was also assessed by measuring the 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine and by using the hOGG1modified comet assay. Our results show that only the high-power e-cig and the 3R4F cigarette induced oxidative DNA damage in the lung and the liver of exposed mice. In return, no significant increase in chromosomal aberrations or gene mutations were noted whatever the type of product. This study demonstrates that e-cigs, at high-power setting, should be considered, contrary to popular belief, as hazardous products in terms of genotoxicity in mouse model.

AB  - Simple Summary Preselected potential causal variants from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for genomic prediction is an appealing strategy for improving the accuracy of genomic prediction. Here, we performed genomic prediction using preselected variants identified with a large GWAS meta-analysis on three growth and carcass traits in Large White pigs. Compared to using the SNP chip data, the accuracies of genomic predictions based on different SNP preselection strategies were on average improved by 0.3 to 2% using the genomic best linear unbiased prediction given genetic architecture (BLUP|GA) model. Our results provide new opportunities for future applications of genomic prediction in livestock and poultry by using large amounts of genotype data.Abstract Preselected variants associated with the trait of interest from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) are available to improve genomic prediction in pigs. The objectives of this study were to use preselected variants from a large GWAS meta-analysis to assess the impact of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) preselection strategies on genome prediction of growth and carcass traits in pigs. We genotyped 1018 Large White pigs using medium (50k) SNP arrays and then imputed SNPs to sequence level by utilizing a reference panel of 1602 whole-genome sequencing samples. We tested the effects of different proportions of selected top SNPs across different SNP preselection strategies on genomic prediction. Finally, we compared the prediction accuracies by employing genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP), genomic feature BLUP and three weighted GBLUP models. SNP preselection strategies showed an average improvement in accuracy ranging from 0.3 to 2% in comparison to the SNP chip data. The accuracy of genomic prediction exhibited a pattern of initial increase followed by decrease, or continuous decrease across various SNP preselection strategies, as the proportion of selected top SNPs increased. The highest level of prediction accuracy was observed when utilizing 1 or 5% of top SNPs. Compared with the GBLUP model, the utilization of estimated marker effects from a GWAS meta-analysis as SNP weights in the BLUP|GA model improved the accuracy of genomic prediction in different SNP preselection strategies. The new SNP preselection strategies gained from this study bring opportunities for genomic prediction in limited-size populations in pigs.

AB  - The present study was an attempt to evaluate the antimicrobial and anthelmintic potential of two Amanita species, i.e., A. orsonii and A. glarea, along with their qualitative mycochemical screening. Maceration technique was adopted to make crude extracts in non-polar (petroleum ether and chloroform) and polar (ethanol and distilled water) solvents. Qualitative mycochemical screening revealed the presence of a variety of secondary metabolites like terpenoids, flavonoids, tannins, alkaloids, saponins, and cardiac glycosides. Antimicrobial activities were carried out by using agar well diffusing method against four bacterial and one fungal strain. The antibacterial potential ranged between 4.86 +/- 0.088 mm and 34.83 +/- 0.166 mm with maximum inhibition zone exhibited by petroleum ether extract against Pseudomonas fluorescens and least potential by distilled water macerate of A. orsonii against the Escherichia coli. The antifungal activity ranged between 14.5 +/- 0.288 and 24.76 +/- 0.145 mm, with the highest potential provided by chloroform extract of A. orsonii and least capability put forward by A. glarea by petroleum ether extract against Fusarium solanii. Antibiotics and antimycotic discs were used as standard and some of the crude extracts showed bigger zone of inhibition as compared to standard. Different concentrations of ethanolic extracts of both mushrooms were subjected to anthelmintic potential against parasite Haemonchus contortus. All the crude extracts were more potent than standard oxfandazole used. Anthelmintic potential ranged between 9.9 +/- 0.057 and 54.93 +/- 0.033 minutes for death of parasite, while the paralyzed time ranged between 4.86 +/- 0.088 and 24.86 +/- 0.088 minutes. From the results obtained it was concluded that both mushrooms can be used as potential source of curative antibacterial, antifungal, and anthelmintic agents against several diseases that might be used in pharmaceutical industries for making medicines and to screen out secondary metabolites in future.

AB  - Cyanobacteria are photosynthetic microorganisms that compose phytoplankton and therefore have a trophic relationship with zooplankton, which represent an important link for energy flux in aquatic food webs. Several species can form blooms and produce bioactive metabolites known as cyanotoxins. However, the ecological and adaptative role of these toxins are still under debate. Many studies have addressed the cyanotoxins' function in defense against herbivory when grazing pressure by zooplankton plays a role in phytoplankton top-down control. Thus, the present study evaluated the ecophysiological responses of the cyanobacterial strain Microcystis aeruginosa NPLJ-4 underlying the chemical induced defense against the cladoceran Daphnia gessneri. Exposure to predator infochemicals consisted of cultures established in ASM-1 medium prepared in a filtrate from a culture of adults of D. gessneri at an environmentally relevant density. Daphnia infochemicals promoted a significant increase in toxin production by M. aeruginosa. However, no differences in growth were observed, despite a significant increase in both maximum photosynthetic efficiency and electron transport rate in response to zooplankton. Additionally, there was no significant variation in the production of exopolysaccharides. Overall, although a grazer-induced defense response was demonstrated, there were no effects on M. aeruginosa fitness, which maintained its growth in the presence of Daphnia alarm cues.

AB  - Simple Summary Niacin, an essential vitamin in weaned pig diets, plays an important role in regulating anti-inflammatory effects and gut health. This study aimed to investigate the effects of niacin supplementation in newly weaned piglets' diets on inflammation resistance, immunity enhancement, intestinal antioxidant status, and intestinal microbial composition. Studies have found that niacin can significantly improve immunity, antioxidant status and anti-inflammatory effects in newly weaned piglets, better relieve stress damage caused by weaning, improve colonic microbial diversity, and promote intestinal health. Niacin plays an important role in regulating the gut health of weaned piglets. In this study, 48 25-day-old weaned piglets (7.9 +/- 0.20 kg) produced by 14 sows (3 to 4 piglets per sow) were randomly divided into 4 groups with 6 replicates in each group and 2 piglets in each replicate. Each group was fed diets supplemented with 22.5 (N1), 30 (N2), 45 (N3), and 75 (N4) mg/kg of niacin, respectively. Samples were taken at 7 and 14 d, respectively. The study shows that changes in niacin levels significantly affected the content of IgG and IgM in the serum (p < 0.05). Niacin had a significant effect on antioxidant parameters such as MDA, T-SOD, and CuZn-SOD in the jejunal mucosa of weaned piglets (p < 0.05). Moreover, significant differences were observed in the expression of cytokines such as TGF-beta, TNF-alpha, and COX2 in the jejunal mucosa (p < 0.05). The 16S rRNA sequencing analysis showed that there were significant differences in the colonic species composition, which were also accompanied by changes in the isovaleric acid content (p < 0.05). In conclusion, an appropriate increase in niacin dose based on NRC (2012) has an important role in improving the antioxidant status of weaned piglets, alleviating intestinal inflammation in piglets, improving immunity, and regulating the structure of the microbiota.

AB  - The subterranean termite Reticulitermes lucifugus (Rossi 1792) is distributed in Italy and southern France, both in natural and urban environments. It comprises three lineages: i) R. lucifugus lucifugus (Rossi 1792) in the mainland, ii) R. lucifugus corsicus Clement 1977 in Corsica, Provence, Sardinia and a portion of the Tyrrhenian coast of Italy, iii) a third lineage, not yet described, identified based on the genetic analysis of a few samples from Sicily and from an isolated population in northern Italy, where it was most probably introduced by man. In this study, we characterize genetically (COII and 16S mitochondrial genes) and morphometrically (measurements of alates and soldiers) the Sicilian lineage, based on new samples collected all over the island. Our results confirm the existence of a well supported clade comprising all the samples from Sicily, neatly separated from R. lucifugus lucifugus and R. lucifugus corsicus . No other Reticulitermes species or subspecies was found in Sicily, and the Sicilian lineage was not found in peninsular Italy, suggesting that the strait separating Sicily from the mainland is an effective barrier to termite dispersal. Based on these results, we describe the Sicilian lineage of R. lucifugus as Reticulitermes lucifugus siculus ssp. nov.

AB  - Background: Methionine (Met) is usually the second or third limiting amino acid in swine diets and plays vital roles in promoting the growth, especially, the muscle growth of pigs. This research evaluated the effects of di-etary Met restriction on the growth performance, plasma metabolite concentrations, and myogenic gene expression in growing pigs. Materials and methods: Eight genes in two families (myogenic regulatory factor family and my-ocyte enhancer factor 2 family) were selected for the anal-ysis. Twenty individually penned barrows (crossbred, 23.6 +/- 2.4 kg) were randomly allotted to two dietary treatments (n = 10). A diet based on corn and soybean meal (Diet 1, Met-restricted) was formulated to meet or exceed the energy and nutrient requirements, except for Met. Diet 2 (Met-adequate) was formulated by adding crystalline DL- Met to Diet 1 to meet the Met requirement. During the 4-week feeding trial, average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), and gain to feed ratio (G:F) were measured. Immediately before and after the feeding trial, blood was sampled via jugular venipuncture for plasma nu-trient metabolite analysis, while Longissimus dorsi muscle were sampled via aseptic biopsy for gene expression anal-ysis. Data were analyzed with Student t-test. Results: Pigs fed the Met-restricted diet had lower ADG and G:F (P < 0.01). Plasma Met, cysteine, and taurine concentrations were lower (P < 0.05), while glycine and histidine con-centrations were higher (P < 0.05), in pigs fed the Met-restricted diet. Furthermore, the pigs fed the Met-restricted diet tended to express less myogenic factor 6 (Myf6) and myocyte enhancer factor 2D (Mef2D) mRNA in longis-simus dorsi muscle (P < 0.09). Conclusion: Given the fact that Myf6, assisted by Mef2D, is involved in myocyte differentiation, this study suggests that the reduced growth performance in the Met-restricted pigs may be associated with a reduced muscle cell differentiation.

AB  - Herbivore densities can be regulated by bottom-up and top-down forces such as plant defences and natural enemies, respectively. These forces can interact with each other to increase plant protection against herbivores; however, how much complementarity exists between bottom-up and top-down forces still remains to be fully elucidated. Particularly, because plant defences can hinder natural enemies, how these interactions affect herbivore performance and dynamics remains elusive. To address this topic, we performed laboratory and greenhouse bioassays with herbivorous mite pests and predatory mites on mutant tomato plants that lack defensive hairs on stems and leaves. Particularly, we investigated the behaviour and population dynamics of different phytophagous mite species in the absence and presence of predatory mites. We show that predatory mites do not only perform better on tomatoes lacking defensive hairs but also that they can suppress herbivore densities better and faster on these hairless plants. Hence, top-down control of herbivores by natural enemies more than compensated the reduced bottom-up herbivore control by plant defences. Our results lead to the counter-intuitive insight that removing, instead of introducing, plant defence traits can result in superior protection against important pests through biological control.

AB  - Integrating host plant resistance with biocontrol agents represents a promising strategy for sustainable management of Phthorimaea (Tuta) absoluta (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae), an invasive pest that poses a significant global threat to tomato production. However, morphological resistance traits, secondary metabolites, and plant volatiles in tomato may have adverse effects on natural enemies, thereby influencing the overall efficacy of pest control. This study evaluated the performance of three natural enemies across six tomato genotypes exhibiting various levels of resistance to P. absoluta. First, we evaluated the performance of the parasitoid Trichogramma achaeae on eggs, derived from moths reared on the different tomato genotypes, both in isolation and when presented on respective tomato leaflets. Second, we assessed the performance of the parasitoid Necremnus tutae on tomato genotypes that hosted P. absoluta larvae. And finally, we investigated the predatory capacity of the mirid Macrolophus pygmaeus on tomatoes hosting eggs and larvae of P. absoluta, all derived from moths reared on these genotypes, as well as the survival of predator nymphs on the different tomato genotypes, both with and without P. absoluta eggs. The P. absoluta-susceptible tomatoes, the resistant domesticated Corona F1 and the resistant wild tomato species Solanum neorickii had no significant impact on the parasitism and emergence rates of both parasitoids, or on the predatory efficacy and survival of predator nymphs. In contrast, the resistant wild Solanum arcanum negatively affected the performance of both parasitoids, reduced predatory efficacy and survival of first-instar nymphs, and increased the development time of predator nymphs. Our findings indicate that the resistant genotypes Corona F1 and S. neorickii appears to be compatible with all the natural enemies, whereas S. arcanum appears incompatible.

AB  - Dicarboximide fungicides, including captafol, captan, cyclohexylthiophthalimide, folpet, and procymidone, represent a distinct category of fungicides. 17(3-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 (17(3-HSD1) catalyzes the conversion of estrone to estradiol in mammals. Yet, the impact of these fungicides on 17(3-HSD1 activity remains unknown. In this study, we investigated their inhibition using human placental cytosols, rat and pig ovarian cytosols. Our observations revealed that dicarboximide fungicides significantly inhibited human 17(3-HSD1 activity. Among them, captan showed the strongest potency, with its IC50 of 1.28 mu M, whereas procymidone had an IC50 of 100.71 mu M. However, both rat and pig 17(3-HSD1 enzymes were less sensitive to the inhibition of these fungicides compared to the human enzyme, with captan displaying an IC50 of 5.65 mu M for the rat enzyme and 7.36 mu M for the pig enzyme. Correlation analysis indicated a positive correlation between IC50 values and LogP. Docking analysis revealed that these fungicides bound to cofactor or between the steroid and cofactor binding sites. The dithiothreitol treatment demonstrated that the formation of irreversible bonds between dicarboximide fungicides and the cysteine residues played a key role in the inhibition of 17(3-HSD1 activity. In conclusion, dicarboximide fungicides inhibit 17(3-HSD1 depending on lipophilicity, species, and cysteine residue interactions.

AB  - Plant responses to damage by insectivorous herbivores are well-documented in mature leaves. The resulting herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) protect the plant by attracting carnivorous arthropods and even some insectivorous vertebrates, to parasitize or consume the plant invaders. However, very little is known about plant production of HIPVs in developing buds, particularly when herbivorous insects are too small to be considered a prey item. It is additionally unclear whether plants respond differently to generalist and specialist chewing insects that overlap in distribution. Therefore, we compared HIPV production of Downy oak (Quercus pubescens Willd.) buds infested with freshly hatched caterpillars of Tortrix viridana (specialist) and Operophtera brumata (generalist), against uninfested buds. Of the compounds identified in both years of the experiment, we found that (Z)-hex-3-enyl acetate, (E)-beta-ocimene, acetophenone, linalool, (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene (DMNT), methyl salicylate, alpha-copaene, alpha-humulene, (E)-caryophyllene, and (E,E)-alpha-farnesene appeared to be higher in infested buds compared to controls. We found no difference in HIPV production between the specialist and the generalist herbivores. Production of HIPVs was also associated with leaf damage, with higher HIPV production in more severely attacked buds. Thus, our study shows that oak trees already start responding to insect herbivory before leaves are developed, by producing compounds similar to those found in damaged mature leaves. Future work should focus on how Downy oak may benefit from initiating alarm cues at a time when carnivorous arthropods and insectivorous vertebrates are unable to use herbivorous insects as host or food.

AB  - Simple Summary Sugarcane bagasse (SB), one of the more unconventional feedstuffs, is a processed agricultural and industrial by product. Our results show that SB contains higher levels of crude fiber (42.1%) and neutral detergent fiber (81.3%) than soybean hulls, and it also exhibited the highest volumetric expansion when soaked in water (50 g expanding to 389.8 mL) compared to the other six materials we tested (vegetable scraps, soybean hulls, wheat bran, rice bran meal, rice bran, and corn DDGS). Meanwhile, previous studies have reported that SB is worth being developed and utilized as a pig feedstuff, which could effectively alleviate the shortage of feed resources in the swine industry. In the present study, we explored the effects of SB on the reproductive performance, constipation, and gut microbiota of gestational sows. Our results showed that dietary supplementation of 5% SB can be used as an equivalent substitute for soybean hulls to improve the reproductive performance of sows without affecting their gut microbiota.Abstract This experiment aimed to evaluate the effects of using sugarcane bagasse (SB) as a substitute for soybean hulls and wheat bran in the diet of pregnant sows on their reproductive performance and gut microbiota. A total of seventy-two primiparous sows were randomly divided into four treatment groups, with eighteen replicates of one sow each. The sows were fed a basal diet supplemented with 0% (CON), 5%, 10%, and 15% SB to replace soybean hulls from day 57 of gestation until the day of the end of the gestation period. The results showed that SB contains higher levels of crude fiber (42.1%) and neutral detergent fiber (81.3%) than soybean hulls, and it also exhibited the highest volumetric expansion when soaked in water (50 g expanding to 389.8 mL) compared to the other six materials we tested (vegetable scraps, soybean hulls, wheat bran, rice bran meal, rice bran, and corn DDGS). Compared with the CON, 5% SB significantly increased the litter birth weight of piglets. Meanwhile, 10% and 15% SB significantly increased the rates of constipation and reduced the contents of isobutyric acid and isovaleric acid in feces. Furthermore, 10% and 15% SB significantly disturbed gut microbial diversity with increasing Streptococcus and decreasing Prevotellaceae_NK3B31-group and Christensenellaceae_R-7-group genera in feces. Interestingly, Streptococcus had a significant negative correlation with isobutyric acid, isovaleric acid, and fecal score, while Prevotellaceae_NK3B31-group and Christensenellaceae_R-7-group had a positive correlation with them. In conclusion, our study indicates that 5% SB can be used as an equivalent substitute for soybean hulls to improve the reproductive performance of sows without affecting their gut microbiota.

AB  - Prolificacy is an important trait of animals, specifically for sheep. The Bone morphogenetic protein receptor 1B (BMPR1B) is a major gene affecting the litter size of many sheep breeds. The well-known FecB mutation (Q249R) was associated fully with the hyper prolific phenotype of Booroola Merino. However, the identification of variation in all exonic regions of BMPR1B was rare. In this study, we sequenced all exonic regions of BMPR1B gene of Mongolia sheep breed, and ten novel variants were detected by direct sequencing. Among them, the litter size of the Mongolia ewes with the CC genotype was significantly higher (0.34 additional lambs, p < .05) than those with the TT genotype of the g.29346567C>T single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). The litter size of the Mongolia ewes with the TT genotype was significantly higher (0.19 additional lambs, p < .05 and .31 additional lambs, p < .01, respectively) than those with the GT and GG genotypes of the c.1470G>T SNP. The silent c.1470G>T mutation is predicted to increase the stability of the mRNA secondary structure through reducing minimum free energy and is predicted to change the mRNA secondary structure of BMPR1B. Our findings may give potentially useful genetic markers for increasing litter size in sheep.

AB  - Human use of marijuana at an early age has been reported to lead to cognitive impairment. However, researchers have not yet clearly determined whether this impairment is due to marijuana-induced alterations in the devel-oping nervous system and whether this deficit persists into adulthood after marijuana use has ceased. We administered anandamide to developing rats to assess the effect of cannabinoids on development. We subse-quently evaluated learning and performance on a temporal bisection task in adulthood and assessed the expression of genes encoding principal subunits of NMDA receptors (Grin1, Grin2A, and Grin2B) in the hippo -campus and prefrontal cortex. Rats in two age groups, namely, 21-day-old and 150-day-old rats, received intraperitoneal injections of anandamide or the vehicle for 14 days. Both groups performed a temporal bisection test, which included listening to tones of different durations and classifying them as short or long. The expression of the Grin1, Grin2A and Grin2B mRNAs was evaluated using quantitative PCR in both age groups after extracting mRNA from the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. We observed a learning impairment in the temporal bisection task (p < 0.05) and changes in the response latency (p < 0.05) in rats that received anan-damide. Furthermore, these rats exhibited decreased expression of Grin2b (p = 0.001) compared to those that received the vehicle. In human subjects, the use of cannabinoids during development induces a long-term deficit, but this deficit is not observed in subjects who use cannabinoids in adulthood. Rats treated with anandamide earlier in development took longer to learn the task, suggesting that anandamide exerts a harmful effect on cognition in developing rats. Administration of anandamide during early stages of development induced deficits in learning and other cognitive processes that depend on an adequate estimation of time. The cognitive demands of the environment must be considered when evaluating the cognitive effects of cannabinoids on developing or mature brains. High cognitive demands might induce differential expression of NMDA receptors that improves cognitive capacity, overcoming altered glutamatergic function

AB  - This study aimed to report, for the first time, histopathological lesions caused by an outbreak of acute Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae serotype 8 infections in two farms in Cyprus. Lung tissue samples were collected from two different affected farms (a total of eight samples) for bacterial culture, multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based serotyping and histopathological evaluation. Severe respiratory clinical signs, vomiting, anorexia, sudden deaths, a morbidity rate of around 25.00% and a mortality rate of over 60.00% in the fattening stage were reported. Macroscopic lesions included acute to subacute fibrotic, hemorrhagic and necrotizing pneumonia with occasionally encapsulated nodule-like abscesses and fibrous pleuritis. Histopathological evaluation revealed fibrous exudate between alveolar spaces and connective tissue, areas of necrosis mixed with alveolar macrophages, lymphocytes, plasma cells and necrotic leukocytes surrounding colonies of cocci. The bronchial and bronchiolar epithelia were degenerated and replaced by eosinophilic cell debris mixed with inflammatory cells. Several arteries and capillaries were clotted and/or infiltrated by inflammatory cells. In conclusion, these A. pleuropneumoniae serotype 8 cases were accompanied by acute illness, death and more pronounced bronchitis and bronchiolitis. & COPY; 2023 Urmia University.

AB  - Plasmodiophora brassicae Woronin, the cause of clubroot of crucifers, is now established across most of Alberta, Canada, and has become a major constraint in canola (Brassica napus L.) production. Disease control is achieved mainly by planting clubroot-resistant (CR) canola varieties. The first CR canola in Canada was released in 2009. In 2013, severe clubroot was detected on CR canola in several fields in Westlock County, Alberta, and found to be caused by a 'new' strain of P. brassicae termed '5X'. These strains have been shown to be genetically distinct from other P. brassicae strains in Alberta ('population one') and belong to a second population ('population two') of the pathogen. In this study, multiple molecular markers, specific for 'population two', were used to determine the occurrence of members of this population over time throughout central Alberta. Two hundred and twenty-four clubroot galls collected from 2005 to 2016 from non-CR canola varieties were examined. The presence of 'population two' DNA was detected at low levels in at least 47 of the galls, and it was the predominant population of P. brassicae in another 10 of the samples. These samples were found in Flagstaff County starting in 2008, Westlock County starting in 2009, the County of Vermillion River in 2011 and Red Deer County in 2014. Although relatively uncommon, members of this population were widespread, occurring at locations 168 km apart prior to the release of CR canola.

AB  - Social and environmental factors influence behavior via modulation of brain physiological functions. Environ-mental enrichment (EE) is an animal housing technique that provides complex sensory, motor, and social stimulation, leading to modifications in the innate aggressiveness in group-housed laboratory mice. Brain -derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is encoded by multiple splice variants and plays a critical role in control-ling aggressive behavior in a transcript variant-specific manner. BDNF mediates the beneficial effects of EE on a variety of pathophysiological conditions. These findings led to the hypothesis that EE reduces aggressive behavior by altering the expression of Bdnf mRNA in a transcript variant-specific manner. To test this hypothesis, 3-4-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were randomly group-housed (5 mice per cage) under standard or EE conditions for 6-8 weeks. Aggressive behavior was monitored and levels of Bdnf mRNA variants in aggression-related brain regions were measured. Mice housed in EE cages displayed a significantly lower frequency of aggressive interactions compared to control mice. EE increased levels of Bdnf mRNA variant I (Bdnf I) in the amygdala while it reduced levels of Bdnf I in the hypothalamus, hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, parietal cortex, and brainstem. Meanwhile, EE did not significantly alter levels of Bdnf mRNA variants IIc, IV, and VI in all brain regions examined. These findings support the hypothesis that EE diminishes inter-male aggression by altering Bdnf mRNA expression in a transcript variant-specific and brain region-specific manner. Specifically, brain region-specific alterations in Bdnf I expression may partly mediate EE-induced suppression of inter-male aggression.

AB  - The purpose of this experiment was to evaluate the effects of different levels of BSF on rumen in vitro fermentation gas production, methane (CH4) production, ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), and volatile fatty acids (VFAs). The experiment comprised four treatments, each with five replicates. The control group contained no BSF (BSF0), and the treatment groups contained 5% (BSF5), 10% (BSF10), and 15% (BSF15) BSF, respectively. Results showed that at 3 h, 9 h, and 24 h, gas production in BSF5 and BSF10 was significantly higher than in BSF0 and BSF15 (p < 0.05). Gas production in BSF5 and BSF10 was higher than in BSF0, while gas production in BSF15 was lower than in BSF0. At 6 h and 12 h, CH4 emission in BSF15 was significantly lower than in the other three groups (p < 0.05). There were no differences in the pH of in vitro fermentation after BSF addition (p > 0.05). At 3 h, NH3-N levels in BSF10 and BSF15 were significantly higher than in BSF0 and BSF5 (p < 0.05). At 6 h, NH3-N levels in BSF5 and BSF10 were significantly higher than in BSF0 and BSF15 (p < 0.05). Acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, and total VFAs in BSF0, BSF5, and BSF10 were significantly higher than in BSF15 (p < 0.05). In conclusion, gas production, CH4 emission, NH3-N, acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, and VFAs were highest in BSF5 and BSF10 and lowest in BSF15.

AB  - Simple Summary Horses are large herbivorous hindgut fermenters, and the equine hindgut has been suggested to function as a fluid reservoir when dietary fibre holds water in the intestinal content. Forage-based diets and plant-fibre contributes the most to this hindgut fluid reservoir. However, the fibre content and fibre composition of forage can differ greatly and there is limited research published on which fibre source and what type of fibre that would be the most appropriate. We investigated the effect of a grass forage diet, a legume forage diet and the more conventional forage and concentrate diet, on horses' fluid balance and function of the hindgut fluid reservoir. The three diets implied differences in water intake, body weight and digesta water-holding capacity. Total water intake and body weight were higher when the horses were fed the lucerne forage diet but digesta water-holding capacity was higher when the horses were fed the young grass forage diet. It can be concluded that early harvested forage might benefit fluid balance of athletic horses without increasing body weight. In addition, further studies on plant-fibre and forage diets for horses are of great importance for horse feeding, for advisors, veterinarians and for the diet formulations industry. Horses are herbivores, and their hindgut functions as a fluid reservoir as forage fibre properties have great impact on the water content of digesta and the milieu in the ecosystem. Our objective was to compare the effect of grass fibre maturity and legume forage on the water-holding capacity (WHC) and viscosity of the equine hindgut and the body weight (BW) and fluid balance of horses. Three diets: concentrate and late harvested grass haylage (35:65 energy ratio) (C); early and late harvested grass haylage (80:20) (G); lucerne and late harvested grass haylage (80:20) (L) were fed to six caecum and colon fistulated horses for 28 days in a Latin-square design. Total water intake and BW were higher when the horses were fed Diet L, but the digesta WHC was higher when fed Diet G. Total water excretion (via faeces + urine) and the difference in total water intake-output was higher when fed Diet L. Viscosity, measured on centrifuged digesta fluid, did not differ between diets, but the individual colon data of one horse were higher. In conclusion, early harvested forage might be beneficial for the fluid balance of athletic horses providing a higher WHC of hindgut digesta without increasing BW. The importance of digesta viscosity in relation to equine diets needs further investigations.

AB  - Intensification in cropping systems with limited natural resources has necessitated the determination of agroecosystem sustainability in terms of both economic and environmental aspects. Emergy analysis is adopted to determine the most important indicators related to efficiency, renewability, environmental pressure, and sustainability of potato agroecosystems. The present study was carried out in 2018 using monitoring, questionnaires, and in-person interview with 120 farm managers and farmers in the autumn potato agroecosystems of Golestan province, located in northeastern Iran. The emergy indices were calculated following the determination of different inputs and outputs of the agroecosystems. The spatial distribution of emergy indices was analyzed in geographic information systems (GIS) environment. For this purpose, GIS-emergy tools were defined by different geostatistical and classic interpolation methods. The results revealed that total emergy input was 1.71E + 16 seJ ha(-1) yr(-1) for supporting the potato production system. Among all inputs, groundwater had the highest share because of the high water requirement of the potato crop and surface irrigation in most agroecosystems. Based on the data from the surveyed fields, over two-thirds of the total emergy input was related to the purchased resources, which indicated that potato production systems were extremely open systems and influenced by the market. Furthermore, transformity and specific emergy were 1.50E + 05 seJ J(-1) and 5.41E + 08 seJ gr(-1), respectively, which points to the efficiency of autumn potato production systems. Renewability in this research was almost 22.85%, which indicates the heavy dependence of this production system on non-renewable resources. In potato agroecosystem, emergy yield ratio was equal to 1.44, emergy investment ratio was calculated as 2.29, standard environmental loading ratio was equal to 29.10, modified environmental loading ratio was obtained as 3.38, standard emergy sustainability index was found to be 0.05, and modified emergy sustainability index was equal to 0.57. The emergy indicators attributed to the environment shed light on how this production system exerts extensive environmental impact and is a depleting producing system that needs to use a large amount of energy. In final, acceptance of more sustainable techniques, especially new irrigation systems, conservation tillage methods, and use of suitable potato seeds, may reduce the environmental loading and increase the sustainability of the potato agroecosystems in Golestan province.

AB  - Key message In albino tea cultivars, the content of chlorophyll, carotenoids and metabolites changes significantly, which has an important influence on the regulation mechanism of tea albinism. Albino tea mutants with specific shoot colors (white or yellow) have received extensive attention for their uniqueness. Herein, novel natural mutants of C. sinensis 'Fuyun 6' with yellow leaves (YF-6) and the same genetic background as the original green variety (GF-6) were obtained. The metabolomes of the two species were compared using LC-ESI-MS/MS. A total of 124 significantly changed metabolites (SCMs) were identified in the metabolite profile of YF-6. Compared with GF-6, 64 upregulated metabolites and 60 downregulated metabolites were identified in YF-6. Functional enrichment analysis showed that the differential metabolites were mainly enriched in flavonoid biosynthesis pathway. Moreover, metabolites related to carbon and nitrogen metabolism were enriched in other secondary metabolic pathways. The chlorophyll content in YF-6 was significantly reduced, and the carotenoid content was slightly decreased. A large number of metabolites related to photoprotection accumulated in YF-6, including flavonoids, l-ascorbic acid, lipids, and vitamins and their derivatives. The decrease in chlorophyll content increases the possibility of light stress, thereby facilitating large-scale metabolic reprogramming events under light pressure. This study provides a reference value for further research on the metabolic mechanism of albino tea germplasm and provides new materials for the production and application of tea.

AB  - Auditory disabilities have a large impact on the human population worldwide. Research into understanding and treating hearing disabilities has increased significantly in recent years. One of the most relevant animal species in this context is the guinea pig, which has to be deafened to study several of the hearing pathologies and develop novel therapies. Applying kanamycin subcutaneously and furosemide intravenously is a long-established method in hearing research, leading to permanent hearing loss without surgical intervention at the ear. The intravenous application of furosemide requires invasive surgery in the cervical area of the animals to expose the jugular vein, since a relatively large volume (1 ml per 500 g body weight) must be injected over a period of about 2.5 min. We have established a gentler alternative by applying the furosemide by puncture of the leg veins. For this, custom-made cannula-needle devices were built to allow the vein puncture and subsequent slow injection of the furosemide. This approach was tested in 11 guinea pigs through the foreleg via the cephalic antebrachial vein and through the hind leg via the saphenous vein. Frequency-specific hearing thresholds were measured before and after the procedure to verify normal hearing and successful deafening, respectively. The novel approach of systemic deafening was successfully implemented in 10 out of 11 animals. The Vena saphena was best suited to the application. Since the animals' condition, post leg vein application, was better in comparison to animals deafened by exposure of the Vena jugularis, the postulated refinement that reduced animal stress was deemed successful.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the urgent need to control airborne virus transmission, particularly in indoor environments with limited ventilation. This study evaluates the effectiveness of UVA and UVC irradiation, along with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), in inactivating aerosolized viruses. A 19 m(3) virus aerosol simulation chamber, replicating indoor conditions, was used to simulate human respiratory emissions by aerosolizing Escherichia phage T4 (T4 phages) embedded in a pig mucin medium that mimics respiratory aerosols. Results showed a clear, dose-dependent reduction in viral genome copies with UVC exposure, where a dose of 129.9 mJ/cm(2) reduced over 99% of the viral genome copies. Although less efficient, UVA still contributed to virus inactivation, reducing detectable phages to 20% at 513.30 J/cm(2). Mucin provided a protective effect, making virus removal more challenging. Hydrogen peroxide enhanced disinfection, with 1.6 ppm reducing viral genome copies by 78%, and higher concentrations (up to 16 ppm) achieving over 99% reduction in the dark condition. The combination of UVA/UVC with H2O2 further enhanced disinfection, eliminating detectable virus genome copies entirely. These findings underscore the potential for using combined UV light and chemical treatments to effectively mitigate airborne viral transmission in enclosed spaces.

AB  - BackgroundBrain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression is reduced in the brain of various central nervous system (CNS) disorders, but its relation to peripheral expression remains unclear. This study aimed to determine peripheral BDNF expression affected by BDNF promoter IV defect and enriched environment treatment (EET). Promoter IV defect is associated with CNS disorders and chronic stress, whereas EET increases hippocampal BDNF expression and ameliorates CNS dysfunctions.MethodsEnzyme-linked immunosorbent assay measured BDNF protein levels in eleven regions (hippocampus, frontal cortex, heart, lung, liver, spleen, intestine, kidney, intestine, thymus, muscle, serum) in wild-type and knock-in promoter IV (KIV) mice with or without 3 weeks of EET provided after weaning.ResultsKnock-in promoter IV resulted in BDNF levels significantly decreased in muscle, but significantly increased in intestine, liver, thymus, and serum, which suggests compensatory upregulation of other promoters in those tissues. EET increased BDNF levels in muscle and serum of KIV mice and thymus of wild-type mice, suggesting EET's beneficial effects in muscle motor and adaptive immune regulation. EET increased hippocampal BDNF levels in both genotypes, which significantly negatively correlated with intestine BDNF levels, suggesting its role in the brain-gut axis. EET reduced wild-type heart BDNF levels, possibly through parasympathetic regulation. Significant positive BDNF correlations were observed among serum-muscle, serum-thymus, lung-spleen, and intestine-liver, suggesting inter-organ interaction and regulation of BDNF. Partial Least Squares discriminant analyses (PLS-DA) identified that variations in BDNF levels in intestine, liver, frontal cortex, and serum contribute most to classify promoter IV defect, and those in hippocampus, serum, heart, thymus, and liver contribute most to classify EET effects.ConclusionThis is the first study to demonstrate how genetic and environmental factors affect BDNF expression in peripheral tissues, highlighting the complex BDNF correlations across organ systems and suggesting usefulness of multivariate BDNF analyses for detecting promoter IV defect and enriched environment effects. Elucidation of BDNF's role and regulatory mechanisms in peripheral organ systems may help better our understanding of its connection to CNS disorders and their treatments.

AB  - The consolidation of long-term memory is thought to critically rely on sleep. However, first evidence from a study in Drosophila suggests that hunger, as another brain state, can benefit memory consolidation as well. Here, we report two human (within-subjects crossover) experiments examining the effects of fasting (versus satiated conditions) during a 10-hour post-encoding consolidation period on subsequent recall of declarative and procedural memories in healthy men. In Experiment 1, participants (n = 16), after an 18.5-hour fasting period, encoded 3 memory tasks (word paired associates, a visual version of the Deese-Roediger-McDermott task, finger tapping) and subsequently either continued to fast or received standardized meals. Recall was tested 48 h later in a satiated state. Experiment 2 (n = 16 participants) differed from Experiment 1 in that a What-Where-When episodic memory task replaced the Deese-Roediger-McDermott task and recall was tested only 24 h later in a fasted state. Compared with the satiated state, fasting enhanced cued recall of word paired associates (more correct and faster responses) and item recognition in the What-Where-When task. By contrast, fasting impaired recall of episodic context memory, i.e., spatial context in the Deese-Roediger-McDermott task, and temporalspatial context in the What-Where-When task. Procedural memory (finger tapping) remained unaffected. This pattern suggests a differential effect of fasting selectively promoting consolidation of semantic-like representations in cortical networks whereas hippocampal representations of episodic context are weakened. We speculate that hunger strengthens cortical representations by suppressing hippocampal interference during wake consolidation. Yet, the underlying mechanism remains to be clarified.

AB  - Motivation Ensemble learning, as a powerful machine learning method, improves overall prediction performance by combining the prediction results of multiple base models. Blending, as a popular ensemble learning method, can train multiple base models, input the resulting prediction results to further train meta model and obtain final prediction results. However, conventional blending divides the training set by simple random sampling, which causes bias and large variance, thus affecting the stability and accuracy of prediction performance. In this study, we propose a new algorithm of stratified sampling blending (ssBlending), which addresses the algorithm instability of conventional blending caused by the random partition of the training set, further improving the prediction accuracy.Results We used multiple genotype data sets from different species including animal (pig), plant (loblolly pine), and microorganism (yeast) to test the prediction performance of ssBlending. The across-species multi-dataset verification results reveal that ssBlending is superior to conventional blending in terms of prediction accuracy and stability. In addition, we optimized the training set sampling rate (BestH) to facilitate the practical application of the ssBlending algorithm. In summary, this study proposes a completely new algorithm combing stratification strategy with the conventional blending, which provides more options for ensemble learning in various fields.Availability and implementation https://figshare.com/s/23122a18dc8a35f12ff6.

AB  - Simple Summary: Feeding methods can influence animal feed intake and nutritional digestibility and boost economic benefits. Gut microbes are considered the "second genome" of the host, and different feeding methods can affect the dynamic balance of animal digestive tract microbes. Animal digestive tract microbes can also facilitate the utilization of indigestible nutrients by the body. As a result, we hypothesized that different concentrate feeding sequences would result in diverse gut microbial compositions, which could alter animal growth performance and nutrient digestibility indirectly. The Dezhou donkey (Equus asinus) is a good native herbivorous animal in China, with great foraging efficiency and productivity. There are currently few domestic reports on the best feeding methods for Dezhou donkeys. Therefore, this experiment was carried out to investigate the effects of concentrate feeding sequence on the growth performance, nutrient digestibility, volatile fatty acids (VFA), and fecal microbial composition of Dezhou donkeys (weaned) in order to provide new ideas for the selection of feeding methods for Dezhou donkeys in actual production.
   In this study, effects on the growth performance, nutrient digestibility, volatile fatty acids (VFA) production, and fecal microbiota of weaned donkeys were observed using different concentrate feeding sequences. Fifteen healthy 6-month-old weaned male donkeys with a body weight of 117.13 +/- 10.60 kg were randomly divided into three treatment groups, including group C1 (roughage-then-concentrate), group C2 (concentrate-then-roughage), and group C3 (total mixed ration, TMR). The experiment lasted 35 d. We measured nutrient digestion by the acid-insoluble ash method and analyzed the fecal microbiota of the weaned donkeys by high-throughput sequencing of 16s rRNA genes in the V-3-V-4 region. The results show that group C3 obtained the best growth performance, and the digestibility of crude protein (CP) and crude extract (EE) was significantly higher than that of group C1 (p < 0.05). Acetic acid, isobutyric acid, valeric acid, isovaleric acid, and caproic acid were notably different among all groups (p < 0.05). In addition, we observed that Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were dominant in the fecal microbes of each group, and Firmicutes was significantly higher in group C3 (p < 0.05). At the genus level, the different genera were Treponema, Rikenellaceae-RC9-gut-group, Unidentified-F082, and Bacteroidales-RF16-group (p < 0.05). The prediction of fecal microbiota function by PICRUSt indicated that different feeding sequences had minimal impact on the function of the fecal microbiota, particularly on the high-abundance pathway. In summary, the concentrate feeding sequence changed the composition of the fecal microbe of weaned donkeys.

AB  - Long-term storage may reduce the nutritional quality of brown rice, so the present study aimed to evaluate the nutritional values of long-term-stored nutrition in pig diets. In Exp. 1, 18 Landrace x Yorkshire (L x Y) barrows with an initial body weight (IBW) of 25.48 +/- 3.21 kg were randomly assigned to three treatments, including a corn-based diet, one-year-stored brown rice (BR1) diet, and six-year-stored brown rice (BR6) diet, to determine the digestible energy (DE) and metabolizable energy (ME) values of stored brown rice. In Exp. 2, 24 barrows (L x Y; IBW: 22.16 +/- 2.42 kg) fixed with ileal T-cannula were randomly allotted to four dietary treatments, including a corn diet, two stored brown rice diets, and a nitrogen-free diet, to evaluate the amino acid (AA) digestibility of the stored brown rice. In Exp. 3 and 4, 108 crossbred weaned piglets (L x Y; IBW: 9.16 +/- 0.89 kg) and 90 crossbred growing pigs (L x Y; IBW: 48.28 +/- 3.51 kg) were allotted to three treatment diets, including a control diet and two stored brown rice diets, respectively, to investigate the application of stored brown rice in weaned piglets and fully grown pig diets. The results indicated that there was no significant difference in the DE and ME values between corn and stored brown rice (p > 0.05), while the apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of arginine, histidine, asparagine + aspartic acid (Asx), and the standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of arginine and histidine were higher in the stored brown rice diet compared to the corn diet (p < 0.05). Compared to the corn, the stored brown rice showed no significant effects on growth performance, nutrient-apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD), and serum biochemical indices (p > 0.05) but showed decreased activity in the various digestive enzymes in the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum of the weaned piglets (p < 0.05). Also, the stored brown rice diet showed no significant effects on growth performance, carcass traits, meat quality, as well as the fatty acid profiles in the longissimus dorsi muscle of fully grown pigs compared with the corn diet (p > 0.05). In conclusion, the brown rice stored for 6 years under good conditions had no obvious changes in the available energy and nutrient values. Although it may reduce digestive enzyme activity in the small intestines of the piglets, the stored brown rice showed no obvious adverse effects on growth performance and meat quality and can be effectively used in pig diets.

AB  - A critical chemotherapeutic complication is cardiotoxicity, often leading, in time, to heart failure. In this work, we developed a novel animal protocol using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and electrophysiology (EP) tests, designed to detect subtle structural and functional changes associated with myocardial damage in sub-chronic phases post-chemotherapy. A weekly dose of doxorubicin (DOX) was injected in four juvenile swine throughout a four-week plan, using an intravenous approach that mimics the treatment in cancer patients. We performed cardiac MR imaging as follows: in all four pigs pre-DOX; at 1 and 5 weeks post-DOX in a group of two pigs; and, at 1 and 9 weeks post-DOX in the other two pigs, using Cine imaging to assess ejection fraction (EF) and late gadolinium enhancement to quantify collagen density in the left ventricle. Additionally, X-ray-guided voltage mapping and arrhythmia tests were conducted in the group at 9 weeks post-DOX and in a healthy pig. Tissue samples were collected for histology. The results showed that EF decreased from similar to 46% pre-DOX to similar to 34% within the first 9 weeks post-DOX. This decline in LV function was explained by a gradual increase in collagen density, especially noticeable at week 9 post-DOX as derived from MRI analysis. Furthermore, ventricular fibrillation was induced via rapid pacing at 9 weeks post-DOX, most likely caused by fibrotic patches identified in voltage maps, as confirmed by MRI and collagen-sensitive histological stains. Overall, our novel preclinical protocol was able to reveal key signs of potentially-irreversible tissue changes, along with electrical remodeling and arrhythmia risk in the early months following DOX therapy. Future work will include more datasets to statistically power the study, and will use the protocol to test cardioprotective strategies.

AB  - Macadamia oil has high concentrations of oleic and palmitoleic fatty acids, which can increase tissue sensitivity to insulin, improving glucose absorption efficiency, and reducing lipogenesis through gene modulation. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of macadamia oil associated with vitamin E supplementation on performance, blood parameters, meat quality and sensory characteristics, meat fatty acid profile, and expression of genes associated with lipid metabolism in grazing lambs. The experimental treatments were control diet (Control), Control + 0.1% of body weight of macadamia oil (MO), MO + 745 IU of vitamin E/dry matter (MOVE). Macadamia oil improved feed efficiency, reflecting a lower dry matter intake, as the average daily weight gain did not differ from Control. Meat quality parameters were not affected by macadamia oil or vitamin E supplementation. Supplementation with macadamia oil improved meat appearance, flavor, and overall liking. Supplementation with macadamia oil provided a higher proportion of C18:3 n3 and a lower proportion of CLA. The expression of SREBP-1c, PPAR-alpha, SCD1, and ELOVL6 genes were not modified with the supplementation of macadamia oil and vitamin E. In conclusion, supplementation with macadamia oil improves feed efficiency and meat quality; and the inclusion of 745 IU of vitamin E/kg of dry matter for grazing lambs reduces 36% of lipid oxidation of the meat.

AB  - Ionotropic receptors (IRs) play a central role in detecting chemosensory information from the environment and guiding insect behaviors and are potential target genes for pest control. Empoasca onukii Matsuda is a major pest of the tea plant Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Ktze, and seriously influences tea yields and quality. In this study, the ionotropic receptor gene EonuIR25a in E. onukii was cloned, and the expression pattern of EonuIR25a was detected in various tissues. Behavioral responses of E. onukii to volatile compounds emitted by tea plants were determined using olfactometer bioassay and field trials. To further explore the function of EonuIR25a in olfactory recognition of compounds, RNA interference (RNAi) of EonuIR25a was carried out by ingestion of in vitro synthesized dsRNAs. The coding sequence (CDS) length of EonuIR25a was 1266 bp and it encoded a 48.87 kD protein. EonuIR25a was enriched in the antennae of E. onukii. E. onukii was more significantly attracted by 1-phenylethanol at a concentration of 100 mu L/mL. Feeding with dsEonuIR25a significantly downregulated the expression level of EonuIR25a, after 3 h of treatment, which disturbed the behavioral responses of E. onukii to 1-phenylethanol at a concentration of 100 mu L/mL. The response rate of E. onukii to 1-phenylethanol was significantly decreased after dsEonuIR25a treatment for 12 h. In summary, the ionotropic receptor gene EonuIR25a was highly expressed in the antennae of E. onukii and was involved in olfactory recognition of the tea plant volatile 1-phenylethanol. The present study may help us to use the ionotropic receptor gene as a target for the behavioral manipulation of E. onukii in the future.

AB  - Drugs of abuse, including alcohol and stimulants like cocaine, produce effects that are subject to individual variability, and genetic variation accounts for at least a portion of those differences. Notably, research in both animal models and human subjects point toward reward sensitivity and impulsivity as being trait characteristics that predict relatively greater positive subjective responses to stimulant drugs. Here we describe use of the eight collaborative cross (CC) founder strains and 38 (reversal learning) or 10 (all other tests) CC strains to examine the heritability of reward sensitivity and impulsivity traits, as well as genetic correlations between these measures and existing addiction-related phenotypes. Strains were all tested for activity in an open field and reward sensitivity (intake of chocolate BOOST (R)). Mice were then divided into two counterbalanced groups and underwent reversal learning (impulsive action and waiting impulsivity) or delay discounting (impulsive choice). CC and founder mice show significant heritability for impulsive action, impulsive choice, waiting impulsivity, locomotor activity, and reward sensitivity, with each impulsive phenotype determined to be non-correlating, independent traits. This research was conducted within the broader, inter-laboratory effort of the Center for Systems Neurogenetics of Addiction (CSNA) to characterize CC and DO mice for multiple, cocaine abuse related traits. These data will facilitate the discovery of genetic correlations between predictive traits, which will then guide discovery of genes and genetic variants that contribute to addictive behaviors.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the relationship between the MRF gene family members and slaughter characteristics in Saanen kids with varying slaughter weights. Twenty male kids of the Turkish Saanen breed were individually fattened for 60 days after weaning under an intensive management system. The kids were divided into two groups: low slaughter weight (L; n = 11; <= 29 kg) and high slaughter weight (H; n = 13; >29) at the end of the fattening. After slaughter, muscle samples from Longissimus-dorsi (LD) and Semitendinosus (ST) muscles were obtained. Carcass characteristics were higher in H than in L kids (p < 0.05). Myogenic Factor 5 gene expression level in the LD muscle of H kids was higher (p < 0.05) than that of L kids. A similar trend was observed regarding Myogenic Factor 6 and Myoblast Determination Factor gene expression levels in the LD muscle (p < 0.05). Also, the Myogenin gene expression level of H kids was higher than that of L kids in both muscles (p < 0.05). There were positive correlations among the slaughter weight, carcass characteristics, and some MRF gene expression levels in both muscles (p < 0.05) that the higher gene expression increases the weight and affects the carcass characteristics. The study results suggest that the difference in slaughter weight at the end of fattening in Saanen kids may be due to the expression level of myogenic regulatory factor (MRF) genes. Fattening performance and MRF genes may have a positive correlation.

AB  - Introduction: Glucagon-like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) and Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) administration has been associated with neuroprotective effects in neurodegenerative disorders. We conducted a comprehensive synthesis of known effects of GLP-1 and GLP-1 RAs on the cognitive, cellular, and molecular changes in neurodegenerative diseases. Methods: We examined preclinical and clinical paradigms that investigated changes in neurodegenerative disease pathology following administration of GLP-1 and GLP-1 RAs. Relevant articles were retrieved through OVID (MedLine, Embase, AMED, PsychINFO, JBI EBP Database), PubMed, and Web of Science from database inception to September 27th, 2024. Primary studies investigating the aforementioned changes following GLP-1 and GLP-1 RA administration were retrieved for analysis (n = 62). Results: GLP-1 and GLP-1 RAs (i.e. dulaglutide, exenatide, liraglutide, lixisenatide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide) improved cognitive and motor function in neurodegenerative diseases in preclinical and clinical paradigms. Additionally, GLP-1 and GLP-1 RAs were associated with modulating changes in neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and proliferative pathways. Discussion: We observed that GLP-1 and GLP-1 RAs modulate molecular and cellular changes known to govern the phenomenology of neurodegenerative diseases. Future research should examine the interaction between signaling molecules, neuronal subpopulations, and cognitive effects affected by GLP-1 and GLP-1 RA administration.

AB  - In this study, the hydrolysates of deer tendons with antioxidant activity and promoting bone proliferation activity were prepared using ultrasound. The results indicated that ultrasound (60 min) treatment had noticeable effects on the structure and enzymolysis degree of collagen protein, including looser structure, less alpha-helix/ beta-turn, more hydrophobic groups, and a higher degree of hydrolysis in comparison with others. Besides, compared with unpretreated collagen hydrolysates (CPHs), the hydrolysates with ultrasound treatment (60 min) showed significant effects on bone proliferation (cell proliferation rate: 63.9 +/- 4.8%), alkaline phosphatase activity (14.488 U/mg), and antioxidant activities (DPPH radical scavenging rate: IC50 =4.05 mg/mL and ferric ion reducing antioxidant power (FRAP): 0.17 mmol Fe2+/mg). CPHs (ultrasound 60 min) also could protect MC3T3-E1 cells from H2O2-induced damage by reducing the ROS and [Ca2+]i. Taken together, these results might provide a basis for the ultrasound-assisted preparation of potential antioxidant hydrolysates to be applied in the food industry.

AB  - The gastric proton pump (H+,K+-ATPase) responsible for the H+ secretion of gastric acid is an essential therapeutic target for acid-related diseases. H+,K+-ATPase belongs to a P-2-type ATPase family. Here, we examined the effects of a newly synthesized dihydropyrazole derivative KYY-008 on the H+,K+-ATPase. KYY-008 concentration-dependently inhibited the enzyme activity of the ATPase in the membrane fractions prepared from isolated hog gastric mucosa and from human kidney HEK293 cells in which gastric H+,K+-ATPase is exogenously expressed. The IC50 values in these samples were 3.4 mM and 3.7 mM, respectively. In addition, KYY-0 08 significantly inhibited the H+,K+-ATPase-derived H+ uptake into the tightly sealed vesicles prepared from the hog gastric mucosa. In contrast, KYY-0 08 has no effect on the activities of other P2-type ATPases such as Na+,K+-ATPase and Ca2+-ATPase. KYY-0 08 did not change the ionic currents of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, that were potential targets for some dihydropyrazole derivatives. Together, we discovered a new dihydropyrazole derivative which acts as a selective inhibitor of gastric H+,K+-ATPase. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Prenatal stress often results in maternal immune activation (MIA) that can impact prenatal brain development, molecular processes, and substrates and products of metabolism that participate in physiological processes at later stages of life. Postnatal metabolic and immunological stressors can affect brain metabolites later in life, independently or in combination with prenatal stressors. The effects of prenatal and postnatal stressors on hippocampal metabolites were studied using a pig model of viral MIA exposed to immunological and metabolic stressors at 60 days of age using gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Postnatal stress and MIA elicited effects (FDR-adjusted p-value < 0.1) on fifty-nine metabolites, while eight metabolites exhibited an interaction effect. The hippocampal metabolites impacted by MIA or postnatal stress include 4-aminobutanoate (GABA), adenine, fumarate, glutamate, guanine, inosine, ornithine, putrescine, pyruvate, and xanthine. Metabolites affected by MIA or postnatal stress encompassed eight significantly (FDR-adjusted p-value < 0.1) enriched Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes Database (KEGG) pathways. The enriched arginine biosynthesis and glutathione metabolism pathways included metabolites that are also annotated for the urea cycle and polyamine biosynthesis pathways. Notably, the prenatal and postnatal challenges were associated with disruption of the glutathione metabolism pathway and changes in the levels of glutamic acid, glutamate, and purine nucleotide metabolites that resemble patterns elicited by drugs of abuse and may underlie neuroinflammatory processes. The combination of MIA and postnatal stressors also supported the double-hit hypothesis, where MIA amplifies the impact of stressors later in life, sensitizing the hippocampus of the offspring to future challenges. The metabolites and pathways characterized in this study offer evidence of the role of immunometabolism in understanding the impact of MIA and stressors later in life on memory, spatial navigation, neuropsychiatric disorders, and behavioral disorders influenced by the hippocampus.

AB  - Tributyltin (TBT), an organotin compound frequently detected in the coastal environments, poses a threat to aquatic organisms. The lined seahorse (Hippocampus erectus) is a vulnerable species found in nearshore water habitats. The mechanisms by which this fish responds to TBT exposure are not yet fully understood. Histological, biochemical, and transcriptional analyses were conducted, and the results showed that 60 days of exposure to 50 and 500 ng/L TBT caused significant tin accumulation and liver damage to seahorses. Antioxidant defenses and immune responses to TBT exposure in the livers of seahorses were further investigated. The enzymatic activity of superoxide dismutase and malondialdehyde content increased, while catalase activity decreased. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that a series of genes involved in the antioxidant defense system were highly induced to protect the hepatic cells from oxidative damage. TBT exposure also resulted in the induction of genes associated with immune and inflammatory processes, representing a stress response to combat the adverse environmental conditions in the exposed seahorses. Furthermore, seahorses showed an increased health risk, according to the elevation of the expression of genes with tumor-promoting effects, when exposed to TBT. These findings contribute to our understanding of the adverse effects of TBT exposure on seahorses, and their potential defense mechanisms. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Physical exercise has been associated with improved cognition and may even reduce memory deficits after brain injuries. The aims of this work were to: 1) assess whether voluntary physical exercise can reduce the deficits associated with traumatic brain injury (TBI) in two different components of episodic-like memory based on object recognition, temporal order memory ("when"), and object location memory ("where"); and 2) determine whether changes in levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, as well as alterations in hippocampal cytokines, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), may influence the effects exercise has on either or both tasks. The rats were distributed into a sham group, a TBI group that remained sedentary (TBI-sed), and a TBI group that had access to a running wheel for a 25-day period from post-injury day 11 (TBI-exe). The rats were sacrificed after the "where" memory task, at post-injury day 37. Physical exercise restored the "when" and "where" memories, which had been impaired by the TBI, and increased the concentration of BDNF in the hippocampus, but not the prefrontal cortex. Neither TBI nor exercise were found to significantly affect hippocampal cytokines, IGF-1 or VEGF at this time post-injury. BDNF levels showed significant positive correlations with exercise, and with "when" (but not "where") memory. These results indicate that post-injury physical exercise restores "when" and "where" object recognition memory tasks after TBI, and that increased BDNF seems to be involved in this effect, particularly with regard to "when" memory.

AB  - Contact inhibition is a key cellular phenomenon that prevents cells from hyper-proliferating upon reaching confluence. Although not fully characterized, a critical driver of this process is the Hippo signaling pathway, whose downstream effector yes-associated protein plays pivotal roles in cell growth and differentiation. Here, we provide evidence that the E3 ligase WWP1 (WW-domain containing protein 1) mono-ubiquitinates AMOTL2 (angiomotin-like 2) at K347 and K408. Mono-ubiquitinated AMOTL2, in turn, interacts with the kinase LATS2, which facilitates recruitment of the upstream Hippo pathway component SAV1 and ultimately promotes yes-associated protein phosphorylation and subsequent cytoplasmic sequestration and/or degradation. Furthermore, contact inhibition induced by high cell density promoted the localization and stabilization of WWP1 at cell junctions, where it interacted with Crumbs polarity proteins. Notably, the Crumbs complex was functionally important for AMOTL2 mono-ubiquitination and LATS activation under high cell density conditions. These findings delineate a functionally important molecular mechanism in which AMOTL2 mono-ubiquitination by WWP1 at cell junctions and LATS activation are tightly coupled to upstream cell density cues.

AB  - The effects of intra-hippocampal manipulation of glycine receptors on the reconsolidation of recent and late longterm spatial memory were evaluated and assessed in the Morris water maze. The results obtained from the intrahippocampal infusion of glycine and taurine demonstrated that taurine at a 100 nmol/side dose impaired the reconsolidation of recent and late long-term spatial memory. In comparison, at a dose of 10 nmol/side, it only affected the reconsolidation of late long-term spatial memory, reinforcing that there are differences between molecular mechanisms underlying recent and late long-term memory reconsolidation. On the other hand, glycine impaired the reconsolidation of early and late spatial memory when infused at a dose of 10 nmol/side, but not at a dose of 100 nmol/side, unless it is co-infused with an allosteric site antagonist of the NMDA receptor. Altogether these results show that glycine acting in situ in the hippocampal CA1 region exerts a pharmacological effect on U-curve, which can be explained by its concomitant action on its ionotropic receptor GlyR and on its NMDA receptor co-agonist site.

AB  - Weeds can play numerous important roles in pest suppression in agroecosystems. These include influencing the host searching behaviors of herbivorous pests and their natural enemies and providing shelter and alternative food sources for predators and parasitoids. Virginia pepperweed, Lepidium virginicum, is a widespread naturalized weed in Hawaii and can often be found in and around agricultural fields. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family and is a known host plant of the diamondback moth (DBM), Plutella xylostella. In this study, we found that DBM preferentially oviposit on L. virginicum (vegetative stage) when presented with a choice of cabbage. Using laboratory and semi-field trials, we investigated the responses of the natural enemies of DBM to the vegetative stage of L. virginicum and cabbage infested with DBM larvae. When DBM-infested plants were placed in the field for 48 h, more spiders and parasitized DBM larvae were recovered from the L. virginicum than from cabbage. In laboratory choice experiments, we demonstrated that the dominant DBM parasitoid species in Hawaii (Cotesia vestalis) oviposited in more host larvae on L. virginicum compared to cabbage, though this had no particular benefit for parasitoid development (adult size and sex ratio). Our findings suggest that the presence of L. virginicum in cabbage agroecosystems could be beneficial by serving to divert DBM oviposition away from cabbage and promoting predator and parasitoid populations.

AB  - Determining the temperament related traits of sheep, such as the coping style with various stress factors such as people, a new environment and social isolation, is essential in terms of improving animal welfare and increasing productivity. The classification of sheep according to their behavioral responses to the mentioned stress factors is evaluated by objective or subjective methods by expert observers. However, visual examinations that rely on human observation are more likely to make mistakes and are time consuming. Therefore, it is important to make this process faster, easier and more reliable. The phenotypic and genetic heritability of temperament traits in sheep are examined using behavioral tests such as arena and isolation box. The spatial features of the temper-ament classes in these tests are generally similar. At the same time, since the behavior traits are composed of time series, defining or classifying these features with image-based approaches can present challenges. In this study, we propose a video-based approach to overcome this challenge, using videos of behavioral traits obtained from fear tests. In this approach, we used a combination of optical flow for capturing temporal features and con-volutional neural networks for capturing spatial features. The experimental results show that, balanced datasets in terms of the number of sheep, the BOF-VGG19 model trained with the transfer learning method is 90%, the BOF-CovnLSTM model using ConvLSTM networks is 95%, and the BOF-CNN model using CNNs is 100%, were determined as the optical flow models that classify fear test behavior traits the most successfully. The success rate of UNB-CNN and B-CNN models trained on raw images was 70%. As a result, we obtained successful results in classifying behavioral traits in models trained with optical flow pre-processed data sets balanced in terms of sheep numbers. At the same time, using a combination of optical flow and convolutional neural networks in videos where spatial features between temperament classes are similar enhanced the classification accuracy of fear behavior traits by capturing temporal features.

AB  - Tea (Camellia sinensis L.), the most popular beverage worldwide and an important cash crop in China, plays a crucial role in the socio-economic landscape. Reactive nitrogen (Nr) loss from tea cultivation in China has become a major environmental problem due to the high input of N fertilizers. However, the scale of the Nr loss and its environmental impact on tea production in China remains unknown. Hence, we conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis of ammonia volatilization (NH3), nitrogen oxide (NOx), nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, N leaching (total nitrogen, TN), and N runoff (TN) losses in tea plantations in China. The total Nr loss in Chinese tea plantations was 376 Gg yr(-1) (149 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) in 2014, with N leaching, NH3 volatilization, N2O emissions, NOx emissions, and N runoff losses accounting for 52.2 %, 33.2 %, 7.5 %, 5.4 %, and 1.7 %, respectively. The total Nr loss-related environmental damage cost of tea cultivation reached 9.53 billion CNY yr(-1) in 2014, which was 7.7 % of the total tea production output value. The bulk of the environmental damage cost was attributed to NH3 volatilization (49.1 %), N2O emissions (24.9 %), and N leaching (19.2 %). Large Nr losses occurred during tea production in Sichuan, Hubei, Guizhou, Yunnan, Zhejiang, and Hunan provinces, accounting for 17.7 %, 17.0 %, 13.4 %, 10.7 %, 7.6 %, and 7.0 % of the total Nr losses in China, respectively. Our analysis showed that the adoption of integrated nutrient management reduced N fertilizer inputs to 300 kg N ha(-1), lowered Nr loss from 376 Gg to 172 Gg yr(-1), and reduced the environmental damage cost of N loss by 45.4 %. These findings, along with detailed data on the N balance of tea cultivation, provides critical information needed to develop effective region-specific N nutrient management practices and policies for sustainable and profitable tea crop production in China, and possibly in other similar geographies.

AB  - A restrictive approach in managing Protected Areas (PA) is often attributed to 'Western' ideas of nature. This view claims that national elites embraced Western ideas of nature-which supposedly has no place for humans-to produce pristine wilderness in PAs by banning grazing, fishing, and foraging inside them. This article foregrounds cultural politics as an alternate driver of creating wilderness in the global south. The article explores the history of conservation of the Greater One-horned Rhino (Rhinoceros unicornis) in Kaziranga Wild Life Sanctuary (KWLS), the previous avatar of Kaziranga National Park in Assam, India. It shows that Assamese cultural politics pertaining to the rhino not only augmented the Assam Forest Department's (FD) enduring efforts to sanitise KWLS from human activities but also paved the way for the militarised protection of the rhino, which in turn, reinforced wilderness. By the late 1960s, when a larger debate about wildlife conservation surfaced in India, developments in KWLS subtly informed exclusionary conservation in other national parks and tiger reserves.

AB  - Whey wastewater is considered to be the main polluting product of the dairy industry. Electrocoagulation (EC) and electrooxidation (EO) processes using aluminum electrodes and inactive boron-doped diamond (BDD), respectively, were applied to reduce the chemical oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen (TN), phosphate (PO4-3), nitrate (NO3-), chloride (Cl-), total phenolic compounds (TPCs), and optical density. In parallel, thermal desorption-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (TD-GC/MS) with HiSorb passive sorption extraction probe was employed to monitor the emitted volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from the electrochemical treatments. A total of 35 VOCs were extracted and identified in the raw whey wastewater, while 27 and 53 VOCs were identified in the EC and EO treated whey wastewater, respectively. EO-treatment was more concerning as chlorinated VOCs were detected showing a total presence of 50%. Two trichloromethanes (THMs), methane bromodichloro and trichloromethane, as well as ethane 1,2-dichloro, and propane 1,2-dichloro were quantified and their mean concentrations were 5.0, 125.2, 15.1, and 6.4 ppb(v), respectively. Overall, the aroma profile remained mostly unaffected by the EC-treatment. Also, COD, TN, Cl-, NO3-, PO4-3, TPCs, and optical density presented a reduction of 7.4, 52.5, 11.9, 27, 16.8, 54.8, and 17.3% with EC. On the contrary, EO was only effective for COD and optical density, with removal of 14.3, and 23.5%, respectively, while all the other concentrations of pollutants increased (TN, Cl-, NO3-, PO4-3, TPCs).

AB  - Diesel exhaust particulate matter (DEPM) are important components of urban air pollution worldwide. Recent studies proved that airborne DEPM can enter the human brain, which was associated with brain and mental diseases. In this study, we investigated the effects of DEPM exposure on behavior, and explored potential mechanisms from the perspective of metabolism in specific brain regions and short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in the gut using mice. The results showed that inhalation of DEPM induced locomotor hyperactivity and a tendency for memory decline in mice. Exposure to DEPM disrupted motor behavior generation related cerebellar Purkinje cells, induced widespread reduction of neurotransmitters in the frontal cortex, and downregulated expression of genes encoding Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and involved in the Brain-blood-barrier (BBB) in the hippocampus. Moreover, there was a DEPM dose-dependent increase in fecal SCFA levels. Correlation analysis showed that DEPM-induced locomotor hyperactivity was mainly associated with decreased neurotransmission in the frontal cortex and increased gut SCFAs, and those associations were discussed. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms underpinning behavioral changes caused by air pollution, and extends our knowledge on the toxicity and health effects of airborne pollutants.

AB  - Simple Summary The prevention, treatment, and control of swine dysentery, ileitis, and porcine salmonellosis diseases, respectively, caused by infection with Brachyspira hyodysenteriae, Lawsonia intracellularis, and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, still relies on the use of antimicrobials. The goal of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of four commercially available non-antimicrobial compounds in preventing lesions caused by these bacteria using an in vitro intestinal culture model. The findings suggest that the non-antimicrobial compounds studied may have beneficial effects for the host based on the explant model data shown. These findings represent a step towards finding alternatives to antimicrobials usage and control of swine diseases in pork production. Swine dysentery, ileitis, and porcine salmonellosis are production-limiting diseases of global importance for swine production. They are caused by infection with Brachyspira hyodysenteriae, Lawsonia intracellularis, and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, respectively. Currently, the prevention, treatment, and control of these diseases still relies on antimicrobials. The goal of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of four commercially available non-antimicrobial compounds in preventing lesions caused by the bacteria cited above using an in vitro intestinal culture model. A total of five pigs per pathogen were used and multiple compounds were evaluated. For compound F (a fungal fermented rye), S (a blend of short and medium chain fatty acids), and P (a synergistic blend of short and medium chain fatty acids, including coated butyrates), a total of four explants/pig for each treatment were used, while for compound D (an extract of carob and thyme) only 12 explants/pig for each treatment were used. Explants were exposed to a combination of pathogen only (n = 4/compound/pig), compound only (n = 4/compound/pig), or pathogen and compound (n = 4/compound/pig) and sampled at two time-points. Histopathology and gene expression levels were evaluated to investigate the treatment effect on explants. Short and medium-chain fatty acids, and an extract of carob and thyme, was found to mitigate lesions due to B. hyodysenteriae exposure. A fungal fermented prebiotic increased healthy epithelial coverage when explants were exposed to L. intracellularis or S. Typhimurium. These findings represent a step towards finding alternatives to antimicrobials usage and control of swine dysentery, ileitis, and salmonellosis in pork production.

AB  - Cognitive impairment (CI) is a disabling concomitant of multiple sclerosis (MS) with a complex and controversial pathogenesis. The cytokine interleukin-17A (IL-17A) is involved in the immune pathogenesis of MS, but its possible effects on synaptic function and cognition are still largely unexplored. In this study, we show that the IL-17A receptor (IL-17RA) is highly expressed by hippocampal neurons in the CA1 area and that exposure to IL-17A dose-dependently disrupts hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) through the activation of its receptor and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). During experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), IL-17A overexpression is paralleled by hippocampal LTP dysfunction. An in vivo behavioral analysis shows that visuo-spatial learning abilities are preserved when EAE is induced in mice lacking IL 17A. Overall, this study suggests a key role for the IL-17 axis in the neuro-immune cross-talk occurring in the hippocampal CA1 area and its potential involvement in synaptic dysfunction and MS-related CI.

AB  - Here, we investigate the effects of obesity induced by monosodium glutamate (MSG) on cognitive impairment and whether this model induces any alteration in the affinity, density, and subtypes of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) in rat hippocampus. Healthy rats were used as controls, and MSG-obese rats were selected via the Lee index > 0.300. The effects of MSG-induced obesity on hippocampal spatial learning and memory processes were evaluated by using the working memory versions of the Morris' water maze task and the evaluation of mAChRs by binding assay and their subtypes by immunoprecipitation assays. [H-3]Quinuclidinyl benzilate specific binding analysis showed that the equilibrium dissociation constant (K-D) did not differ between control and MSG, indicating that affinity is not affected by obesity induced by MSG. The maximum number of binding sites (B-max) obtained in MSG subjects was lower than that obtained from control rats, indicating a decrease in the expression of total mAChRs. Immunoprecipitation assays reveal a decrease in the expression of M-1 subtype of MSG when compared with control rats (M-2 to M-5 subtypes did not differ between control and MSG). We also observed that MSG promotes a disruption of the spatial working memory which was accompanied by a decrease in the M-1 mAChR subtype in rat hippocampus, thus suggesting deleterious long-term effects besides the obesity. In conclusion, these findings provide new insights into how obesity can influence spatial learning and memory that is hippocampal-dependent. The data suggest that the M-1 mAChR subtype protein expression is a potential therapeutic target.

AB  - Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is a significant pathogen responsible for porcine circovirus-associated diseases (PCVAD), and it is widely prevalent in pig farms, leading to huge economic losses for the pig industry. Currently, the ability of PCV2 to enhance its own replication by using the antiviral inflammatory factors IFN alpha, IFN beta, and IL-2 and its complex immune escape mechanism remain unclear, which has attracted wide attention. Research has indicated that GTPase-activating protein (SH3 domain)-binding protein 1 (G3BP1) is involved in the innate immune response to a variety of viruses, primarily by regulating and composing stress granules (SGs) to inhibit viral replication. Our initial studies identified elevated G3BP1 expression during PCV2 infection, paradoxically promoting PCV2 replication. In light of this phenomenon, this study aims to elucidate how PCV2 regulates G3BP1 to enhance its replication. Our findings demonstrate that G3BP1 overexpression further activates PCV2-induced expression of RIG-I, MDA5, cGAS and STING, thereby promoting IFN beta production and affecting cell cycle arrest in the S phase, facilitating PCV2 replication. Moreover, interactions were observed between PCV2 Cap protein and G3BP1's RGG domain, and between PCV2 Rep protein and G3BP1's NTF2 and RRM domains, potentially promoting viral protein nuclear transfer. In summary, PCV2 enhances its replication by modulating G3BP1 to induce IFN beta production and directly binds viral proteins to promote viral protein nuclear transfer. This research provides a foundation for further investigation into the immune evasion mechanisms of PCV2.

AB  - Fertilizers generally influence the nutritional quality or defense ability of the plants, which can indirectly cause an increase in populations of herbivorous insect pests such as grape phylloxera, Daktulosphaira vitifoliae (Homoptera: Phylloxeridae, Fitch). The effects of nutrient solutions on grape-grape phylloxera interactions were analyzed using five concentrations (nitrogen content: 15, 30, 60, 120, and 180 mg/L) of Hoagland's nutrient solution to irrigate Vitis vinifera L. x Vitis labrusca L. (Kyoho). Life table variables and life history variables showed a hump-shaped or an inverted hump-shaped curve as nutrient input level increased. Sixty microgram per liter treatment resulted in the greatest longevity and egg incubation, shortened the nymph duration and significantly increased the adult lifespan. Overall, both excessive and insufficient nutrient inputs curbed growth and multiplication of D. vitifoliae. These results provide a theoretical basis for vineyards for amending fertilizer inputs to prioritize the prevention and control of this pest.

AB  - The lipid endocannabinoid system refers to endogenous cannabinoids (eCBs), the enzymes involved in their synthesis and metabolism, and the G protein-coupled cannabinoid receptors (GPCRs), CB1, and CB2. CB1 re-ceptors (CB1Rs) are distributed in the brain at presynaptic terminals. Their activation induces inhibition of neurotransmitter release, which are gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate (Glu), dopamine, norepi-nephrine, serotonin, and acetylcholine. Postsynaptically localized CB1Rs regulate the activity of selected ion channels and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). CB2Rs are mainly peripheral and will not be consid-ered here. Anandamide metabolism, mediated by cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), generates anandamide-derived prostanoids. In addition, COX-2 regulates the formation of CB1 ligands, which reduce excitatory transmission in the hippocampus (HC). The role of CB1Rs and COX-2 has been described in anxiety, depression, and cognition, among other central nervous system (CNS) disorders, affecting neurotransmission and behavior of the synapses. This review will analyze common pathways, mechanisms, and behavioral effects of manipulation at the CB1Rs/ COX-2 level.

AB  - The site of Barmaky currently marks the oldest Epigravettian occupation of north-western Ukraine shortly after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), dated to around 19 cal. ka BP. Stable isotope analyses of bone collagen from six terrestrial mammals and two bird species show a comparatively highly structured palaeo-food web. Characteristic are high delta 15N values in mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius) bone collagen compared with other herbivores and delta 13C values showing niche partitioning between mammoth and hare on the one hand and reindeer on the other. These findings may indicate differentiated herbivore niches, with different diets and habitats between herbivorous groups. Additionally, different mobility patterns could cause isotopic scatter in food webs. To better understand the context of early post-LGM mammoth behaviour, we compare the mammoth delta 15N values of Barmaky (19.0 cal. ka BP; 7.2 +/- 0.1 parts per thousand) with those of Yudinovo (lower layer: 19.1/18.3-15.1 cal. ka BP and upper layer: 14.8-13.8 cal. ka BP; 7.3 +/- 1.0 parts per thousand), Yeliseevichi (17.6 cal. ka BP; 5.7 +/- 0.8 parts per thousand) and Mezhyrich (18.5-17.5 cal. ka BP; 4.3 +/- 0.8 parts per thousand). At all sites, delta 15N values of mammoths are comparatively high, except for Mezhyrich and a single specimen from Barmaky. In comparison with sedentary hares, mammoths from Barmaky suggest a non-locally dominated delta 15N signal, while the mammoths from Mezhyrich show the local isotope signal. We also discuss the potential role of differences in temperature, precipitation and permafrost development for the different locations. Results from climate models indicate a gradient in temperature and precipitation with possible implications for food availability in the mammoth steppe.

AB  - Oil and gas flowlines operating in subsea or cold terrestrial environments face the risk of forming hydrate deposits and plugs. The pressure differential across a hydrate plug can cause the plug to detach from the pipe wall and travel through the pipeline, potentially impacting a bend or inline equipment, causing damage or injury to personnel. Therefore, the hydrate-solid adhesive shear strength is of interest in estimating the maximum allowable differential pressure across a plug during depressurization procedures before the plug is likely to detach from the pipe wall. Quantifying the changes in adhesive shear strength with time and operational conditions is essential in estimating the potential of hydrate deposits to slough from the pipe wall. This work used a force meter with a cylindrical "pig-style" probe mounted to a single axis motorized test stand to measure the force required to dislodge model THF structure II hydrate plugs in carbon steel pipes. Profilometry measurements were used to quantify the mean surface roughness and relative peak frequency of the pipe surfaces. Contact angle measurements were performed of a water droplet on pristine, sanded, and corroded pipe surfaces immersed in nonpolar solvents. The adhesive shear strength of the hydrate plugs was measured for different subcoolings, solid surface roughness, and surface wettabilities. Subcooling was shown to impact the hydrate-solid adhesive shear strength, and a mixed adhesive/cohesive failure mechanism was observed at the highest subcooling tested. The surface roughness and wettability were also shown to influence the hydrate-solid adhesive shear strength, with readily wetting corroded and sanded carbon steel surfaces resulting in greater interface adhesive strength than the pristine carbon steel system. This is likely due to a Wenzel wetting mode at the interface, resulting in a higher ratio of actual to apparent wetted area as well as establishing a mechanical interlocking mechanism.

AB  - Background: Although the use of antidepressants during pregnancy has increased over the last several decades, their safety has remained a topic of debate. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can cross the placenta and affect perinatal outcomes in infants exposed during pregnancy. Recent studies suggest new risks for not only for structural malformations, but also long-term behavioral, developmental, and emotional disorders in offspring. Aim: We aimed to elucidate the effects by which in utero paroxetine exposure may affect the behavior and hippocampus of the offspring of paroxetine-treated rodent mothers. Methods: Paroxetine was administered daily to pregnant female Wistar rats from embryonic day (ED) 12.5 to ED 21 with oral sondes. Paroxetine 1 mg/kg/day or paroxetine 2.5 mg/kg/day or saline was given to the control group. We evaluated spontaneous locomotor activity, spontaneous alternation behavior using the Y-maze test, and anxiety behavior using the elevated plus maze (EPM) in male offspring at postnatal day 30. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-positive cells in the hippocampus were counted using a fluorescence microscope. Results: Locomotor activities significantly increased in the paroxetine 2.5 mg compared with the control group. The paroxetine 2.5 mg group spent less time in the closed arm than did the control and paroxetine 1 mg groups in the EPM. The number of BrdU-positive cells in the dentate gyrus was significantly increased in the paroxetine 2.5 mg compared with the control group. Conclusions: These findings suggest that oral administration of paroxetine during pregnancy induces hyperactivity, decreases anxiety, and increases cell proliferation in the hippocampus of male offspring.

AB  - Exploiting plant defense mechanisms is a promising tool for pest management i n moder n agriculture. Plant Essential Oils (EOs) are used for the sustainable control of agricultural pests; however, their impact on plant defense has been scarcely investigated. In this work, we study for the first time whether the spraying of EOs can activate plant defense mechanisms in sweet pepper. The olfactory capacity of Encarsia formosa (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae) to respond to defense-activated plants was used to select garlic and peppermint EOs among nine EOs sprayed on sweet peppers. The expression level of defense-related genes in plant tissues and the phytotoxicity were measured in response to EO foliar applications. Moreover, the olfactory responses of the herbivores , Bemisia tabaci(Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) andFrankliniella occiden-talis (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) , and their natural enemies , Orius laevigatus (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae) and Nesidiocoris tenuis (Hemiptera: Miridae) , to EO induced plant volatiles were also investigated. The gene expression analysis revealed activated jasmonic and salicylic acid defense signaling pathways in EO-sprayed sweet pepper plants and a negligible phy-totoxic effect was recorded. Choice tests revealed varying behavioral responses in selected insect models when plants were treated with garlic and peppermint EOs in different concentrations. Our results suggest that garlic and peppermint EO spray applications can enhance the defense mechanisms of sweet pepper s and have a cascading bottom-up effects on the associ-ated food chain. These initial findings provide a foundation for the futur e development of Integrated Pest Management strategies to protect solanaceous crops.

AB  - Simple Summary Milk fatty acid composition and gene expression in the mammary gland were evaluated in dairy ewes supplemented with linseed. The linseed supplementation improves the health and nutrition quality properties of dairy milk, besides affecting the expression of gene networks related to energy balance, RNA binding, circadian rhythm, and nutrient metabolism. This molecular knowledge on the physiology of the mammary gland might provide the basis for more detailed functional studies for future research. Several dietary strategies were adopted to reduce saturated fatty acids and increase beneficial fatty acids (FA) for human health. Few studies are available about the pathways/genes involved in these processes. Illumina RNA-sequencing was used to investigate changes in the ovine mammary gland transcriptome following supplemental feeding with 20% extruded linseed. Comisana ewes in mid-lactation were fed a control diet for 28 days (control period) followed by supplementation with 20% DM of linseed panel for 28 days (treatment period). Milk production was decreased by 30.46% with linseed supplementation. Moreover, a significant reduction in fat, protein and lactose secretion was also observed. Several unsaturated FAs were increased while short and medium chain saturated FAs were decreased by linseed treatment. Around four thousand (1795 up- and 2133 down-regulated) genes were significantly differentially regulated by linseed supplementation. The main pathways affected by linseed supplementation were those involved in the energy balance of the mammary gland. Principally, the mammary gland of fed linseed sheep showed a reduced abundance of transcripts related to the synthesis of lipids and carbohydrates and oxidative phosphorylation. Our study suggests that the observed decrease in milk saturated FA was correlated to down-regulation of genes in the lipid synthesis and lipid metabolism pathways.

AB  - Storing and accessing memories is required to successfully perform day-to-day tasks, for example for engaging in a meaningful conversation. Previous studies in both rodents and primates have correlated hippocampal cellular activity with behavioral expression of memory. A key role has been attributed to awake hippocampal replay - a sequential reactivation of neurons representing a trajectory through space. However, it is unclear if awake replay impacts immediate future behavior, gradually creates and stabilizes long-term memories over a long period of time (hours and longer), or enables the temporary memorization of relevant events at an intermediate time scale (seconds to minutes). In this study, we aimed to address the uncertainty around the timeframe of impact of awake replay by collecting causal evidence from behaving rats. We detected and disrupted sharp wave ripples (SWRs) - signatures of putative replay events - using electrical stimulation of the ventral hippocampal commissure in rats that were trained on three different spatial memory tasks. In each task, rats were required to memorize a new set of locations in each trial or each daily session. Interestingly, the rats performed equally well with or without SWR disruptions. These data suggest that awake SWRs - and potentially replay - does not affect the immediate behavior nor the temporary memorization of relevant events at a short timescale that are required to successfully perform the spatial tasks. Based on these results, we hypothesize that the impact of awake replay on memory and behavior is long-term and cumulative over time.

AB  - Ethiopia has well known paleontological and archaeological sites within the Rift Valley, but relatively little is known of the potential within the surrounding highlands. Here, we present three underexplored sites within and nearby Addis Ababa, Ethiopia's capital city: Fanta, Gemeda, and Koche. These sites were originally mapped in 2008 as part of a rescue project carried out in advance of construction at the Fanta site. As observed in surface contexts and within the modern stream cutbank, Fanta is rich in fossil and archaeological materials. The abundance of hippopotamids at this site (both on the surface and in situ) indicates the presence of a large body of water across the paleolandscape. The site is rich in alcelaphine bovids and equids, and thus likely represents a highland grassland environment. The surface of the site is also rich in artifacts that demonstrate morphologies of the Acheulean technological complex but the relationship of the stone tools to the fauna has yet to be determined. The other sites, Gemeda and Koche are not as rich as Fanta, but may represent other important highland sites. Since discovery, the sites remain underexplored apart from a large-area ground-penetrating radar (GPR) survey at the Fanta site which revealed a vertical succession of reflection packages that have been used to interpret the nature of sedimentary deposits at and away from the exposures. We present the interpretation of previously unpublished GPR data from this survey nearest to the stream cutbank. Finally, all three sites, but especially Fanta, are under threat of destruction from urban development and encroachment, where some of the site has undergone damages and continues to face ongoing destruction. Despite this, the sites offer the opportunity to develop a center of research, education, and tourism with easy access of Ethiopia's growing and dynamic capital city.

AB  - Methoxychlor (MXC) is a man-made organochlorine insecticide capable of disrupting endocrine functions due to its mixed steroidal properties (estrogenic, anti-estrogenic and/or antiandrogenic). Retarded follicle development was recently reported in neonatal pigs treated with MXC. The goal of the current study was to better understand the mechanism of MXC action in the ovary of newborn piglets. By employing RNA-Seq we studied the expression of protein coding (mRNA) and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) transcripts in the ovary of the MXC-treated piglets. Piglets were injected (sc) daily with MXC (100 mg/kg body weight) or corn oil (controls) between postnatal Days 1 and 10 (n = 3 piglets/group). The ovaries excised from 11-day-old piglets were processed for total RNA isolation and subsequent RNA sequencing. Four hundred sixty differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 143 differentially expressed lncRNAs (DELs) were identified in the ovaries of MXC-treated piglets (P-adjusted < 0.05; abs(log2FC) > 1). Functional enrichment analysis showed that MXC altered the expression of genes associated with intracellular and membrane transport, intra-ovarian signaling as well as cell-cell junction and communication. Moreover, positive and negative correlations determined between the identified DEGs and DELs suggest that some lncRNAs may mediate the MXC action in the ovary. The results support the hypothesis that MXC-induced changes in the expression of genes involved in neonatal ovarian folliculogenesis increase the risk of fertility problems in adults.

AB  - (E)-beta-ocimene, a ubiquitous monoterpene volatile in plants, is emitted from flowers to attract pollinators and/or from vegetative tissues as part of inducible defenses mediated by complex signaling networks when plants are attacked by insect herbivores. Wild pear species Pyrus betuleafolia used worldwide as rootstock generally displays valuable pest-resistant traits and is a promising genetic resource for pear breeding. In the current study, transcriptional changes in this wild pear species infested with a polyphagous herbivore Spodoptera litura and the underlying molecular mechanisms were fully investigated. A total of 3,118 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in damaged pear leaf samples. Spodoptera litura larvae infestation activated complex phytohormonal signaling networks in which jasmonic acid, ethylene, brassinosteroids, cytokinin, gibberellic acid and auxin pathways were induced, whereas salicylic acid and abscisic acid pathways were suppressed. All DEGs associated with growth-related photosynthesis were significantly downregulated, whereas most DEGs involved in defense-related early signaling events, transcription factors, green leaf volatiles and volatile terpenes were significantly upregulated. The PbeOCS (GWHGAAYT028729), a putative (E)-beta-ocimene synthase gene, was newly identified in P. betuleafolia transcriptome. The upregulation of PbeOCS in S. litura-infested pear leaves supports a potential role for PbeOCS in herbivore-induced plant defenses. In enzyme-catalyzed reaction, recombinant PbeOCS utilized only geranyl pyrophosphate but not neryl diphosphate, farnesyl pyrophosphate or geranylgeranyl diphosphate as a substrate, producing (E)-beta-ocimene as the major product and a trace amount of (Z)-beta-ocimene. Moreover, as a catalytic product of PbeOCS, (E)-beta-ocimene showed repellent effects on larvae of S. litura in dual-choice bioassays. What is more, (E)-beta-ocimene increased mortalities of larvae in no-choice bioassays. These findings provide an overview of transcriptomic changes in wild pears in response to chewing herbivores and insights into (E)-beta-ocimene biosynthesis in pear plants, which will help elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying pear-insect interactions.

AB  - Flight initiation distance (FID), the distance at which an organism begins to flee from an approaching threat, is a major component of antipredator escape behavior and a potential indicator of threat perception in fishes. In this study, we analyzed the FID of three important rocky-reef fish species targeted by spearfishers, which are of commercial and recreational importance. We tested predictions that FID to a diver threat increases with the following factors: (1) fish body size, (2) less restricted access regimes, and (3) increased historical fishing pressure. We studied three size ranges of three rocky-reef fish species, in three different access regimes (i.e., open access, territorial user rights for fishery areas, no-take marine protected areas), and in two regions (northern and central region with different levels of fishing pressure depending on the species). We conducted an ANOVA to analyze pairwise interactions. We used the mean square criterion to select the models that best explained the variation of our response variable. Our findings indicate that FID can be distinctly elucidated by factors such as individual size, species, access regimes, and regions. Additionally, our models show that interactions involving regions and either species or size further contribute to explain FID variability. FID was higher in larger fishes and those of higher commercial value, outside marine reserves and in the region with the highest historical fishing pressures (based on landings data). This study supports the predictions that increased FID is associated with the threat posed by spearfishing activities. Furthermore, our findings indicate that spearfishing may already be altering the behavior of rocky-reef fishes on the north-central coast of Chile.

AB  - Background The circadian clock, also known as the circadian rhythm, is responsible for predicting daily and seasonal changes in the environment, and adjusting various physiological and developmental processes to the appropriate times during plant growth and development. The circadian clock controls the expression of the Lhcb gene, which encodes the chlorophyll a/b binding protein. However, the roles of the Lhcb gene in tea plant remain unclear. Results In this study, a total of 16 CsLhcb genes were identified based on the tea plant genome, which were distributed on 8 chromosomes of the tea plant. The promoter regions of CsLhcb genes have a variety of cis-acting elements including hormonal, abiotic stress responses and light response elements. The CsLhcb family genes are involved in the light response process in tea plant. The photosynthetic parameter of tea leaves showed rhythmic changes during the two photoperiod periods (48 h). Stomata are basically open during the day and closed at night. Real-time quantitative PCR results showed that most of the CsLhcb family genes were highly expressed during the day, but were less expressed at night. Conclusions Results indicated that CsLhcb genes were involved in the circadian clock process of tea plant, it also provided potential references for further understanding of the function of CsLhcb gene family in tea plant.

AB  - Feed consumption is responsible for the largest shares of resource use required for producing pork. In the European Union (EU), a meat consumption decrease is expected in combination with a growth of meat production driven by foreign demand. This paper presents a multiple environmental assessment of the resource use linked to EU pig feed by performing a material flow analysis of each single feed item constituting the EU pig diet. The global relevance and the trade-driven interlinkages are disclosed by considering the country-specific resource efficiencies of 254 territories. Our analysis reveals that in 2017 a total resource use of 14.5 Mha of land, 51.9 Gm(3) of green water, 3.9 Gm(3) of blue water, 1.23 Mtonnes of nitrogen, 0.35 Mtonnes of phosphorous, and 0.34 Mtonnes of potassium was required to satisfy the EU demand of pig feed. Wheat-based products accounted for the largest share of land use (32%), green water (35%), nitrogen and phosphorous fromfertilizer use (44% and 28%, respectively). Also soybean accounted for a significant share of land use (15%), greenwater (20%) and phosphorous from fertilizer use (25%). Moreover, soybean-related feed items contributed the most to the potassium use (24%). While the domestic production of cereals satisfied the demand, protein-based ingredients such as soybean were largely imported, mainly from South America, outsourcing the related environmental burden. Moreover, most of the feed from extra-EU countries resulted with higher resource use intensities than EU implying a potential resource saving if feed was domestically produced. Results obtained are discussed in relation to the many constraints that limit the possibility of increasing the EU feed production and promising alternative solutions. In particular, while some solutions seem promising in terms of savings, the current EU regulation needs to be redesigned to allow their implementation and the achievement of ambitious EU targets.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of pregnant ewe nutrition on the performance of offspring in terms of meat, wool production, and reproduction. Foetal programming in sheep has focused on several aspects related to foetal growth, postnatal production, behaviour, and immunological performance. Currently, significant efforts are being made to understand the endocrine, metabolic, and epigenetic mechanisms involved in offspring development. Current studies have not only evaluated the foetal period, despite the pre-conception parental nutrition has demonstrated an effect on the foetal, embryonic, and pre-implantation periods and can generate permanent effects in the foetal and postnatal phases. The performance of offspring is the result of interactions between the genome, epigenome, and environmental interventions during conception. Several factors influence the expression of phenotypic characteristics in progenies; however, this study focused on presenting data on the effect of pregnant ewe nutrition alone on foetal growth and the productive aspects of their offspring.

AB  - The long-term harmful effects of arsenic exposure remain one of the important public health issues. The effects of arsenic exposure on the central nervous system, particularly concerning brain structure and function, have been garnering increasing attention. Hence, the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of chronic low-dose arsenic exposure on murine social memory and to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms. Male C57BL/6 mice at six months of age were randomly assigned to a control group and three treatment groups with different arsenic concentrations (50, 100, and 200 mu g/L), with exposure durations of 30, 90, 180, and 360 days. The five-social memory test and three-chamber social memory test results indicated that chronic low-dose arsenic exposure disrupted social memory in mice. Further analysis revealed that arsenic exposure led to degeneration of neurons within the dorsal CA2 of the hippocampus (dCA2) and the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC), which are pivotal for the modulation of social memory, and dCA2 neurons demonstrated structural disruptions and cytoplasmic fragmentation. In addition, arsenic exposure induced neurons and glial cells senescence in both dCA2 and LEC, with a particularly pronounced effect in microglia, and worse with dosage increasing of arsenic exposure, correlating with elevated expression levels of p16(INK4A), ferritin light chain and the senescence-associated secretory factors TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta, and reduced expression of Lamin B1. Moreover, arsenic exposure triggered substantial cytoplasmic lipid droplets accumulation in neurons, astrocytes and microglia, with an upregulation of PLIN2 expression, a protein associated with lipid droplet formation in astrocytes. At the same time, the aberrant accumulation of lipid droplets further aggravated the astrocytes and microglia aging, especially microglia. Additionally, correlation analysis revealed that social memory impairment was negatively correlated with nerve cell senescence and lipid accumulation. Our findings suggest that arsenic exposure induced cellular functional abnormalities by triggering cellular senescence and the accumulation of lipid droplets, thereby exacerbated neuronal degeneration and result in impaired social memory in mice.

AB  - Bluetongue virus (BTV) causes a viral, non-contagious disease that mainly affects sheep, cattle, and wild and farmed ruminants causing damage to these animals and significant economic losses. Culicoides insignis Lutz, the major BTV vector in South America, is one of the most abundant species in Argentina and commonly associated with cattle farms. The morphological identification of Culicoides spp. is routinely carried out with the aid of morphological keys, which mainly refer to the wing patterns, sensillae of palpi, and antennal flagella. Molecular tools applied to taxonomy provide a rapid and efficient method of identification of vector species. An easy protocol for the extraction of total DNA from single midges is herein described, and a forward primer for rapid and reliably test detection by polymerase chain reaction of C. insignis is developed.
