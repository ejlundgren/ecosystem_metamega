AB  - Mammalian Ste-20-like Kinases 1 and 2 (MST1/2) are core serine-threonine kinases of the Hippo pathway regulating several cellular processes, including cell cycle arrest and cell death. Here, we discovered a novel alternative splicing variant of the MST2 encoding gene, STK3, in malignant cells and tumor datasets. This variant, named STK3(triangle 7) or MST2(triangle 7) (for mRNA or protein, respectively), resulted from the skipping of exon 7. MST2(triangle 7) exhibited increased ubiquitylation and interaction with the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase CHIP compared to the full-length protein (MST2(FL)). Exon 7 in STK3 encodes a segment within the kinase domain, and its exclusion compromised MST2 interaction with and phosphorylation of MOB, a major MST1/2 substrate. Nevertheless, MST2(triangle 7) was capable of interacting with MST1 and MST2(FL). Unlike MST2(FL), overexpression of MST2(triangle 7) did not lead to increased cell death and growth arrest. Strikingly, we observed the exclusion of STK3 exon 7 in 3.2-15% of tumor samples from patients of several types of cancer, while STK3(triangle 7) was seldomly found in healthy tissues. Our study identified a novel STK3 splicing variant with loss of function and the potential to disturb tissue homeostasis by impacting on MST2 activities in the regulation of cell death and quiescence.

AB  - The leaves of Clerodendrum polycephalum Baker (Labiatae) are used as a dietary legume supplement and applied ethnomedicinally for the management of epilepsy, convulsion, and spasms. This study is aimed at evaluating the effects of Clerodendrum polycephalum (CP) leaf extract on chemical-induced seizures in mice and the possible mechanisms of action. Swiss albino mice were pretreated with CP (50, 100, or 500 mg/kg, p.o.) prior to intraperitoneal injection of picrotoxin (PTX) or pentylenetetrazole (PTZ). However, the most effective dose was used to elucidate the role of GABAergic and nitric oxide-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (NO-cGMP) signaling mechanisms in mice brains. Accordingly, we evaluated the preventive and reversal effects of CP on kainic acid (KA)-induced temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), oxidative stress, and neuroinflammatory in mice. The pretreatment of mice with CP delayed the latencies to PTX and PTZ-induced seizures and decrement in the period of tonic-clonic attacks. Interestingly, CP (100 mg/kg) completely prevented PTZ-induced tonic-clonic seizures. Contrastingly, flumazenil (benzodiazepine receptor antagonist), N-G-nitro-L-Arginine (L-NNA) (10 mg/kg., neuronal nitric oxide synthase inhibitor), and methylene blue (MB) (2 mg/kg, a soluble guanylyl cyclase inhibitor) but not L-arginine (150 mg/kg., nitric oxide precursor) reversed CP-induced anticonvulsant-like effect in PTZ model. Furthermore, KA-elicited TLE was prevented by CP treatment. CP also attenuated KA-induced oxidative stress, cyooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappa B) elevated expressions in the hippocampus. The study revealed that the ethanolic leaf extract of CP produced anticonvulsant actions through enhancement of antioxidant defense, GABAergic, and NO-cGMP signaling pathways as well as attenuation of inflammatory processes. Practical applications The leaves of Clerodendrum polycephalum Baker (Labiatae) are used as a dietary legume supplement and applied ethnomedicinally for the management of epilepsy, convulsion, and spasms. For this reason, we believe that supplementation of the Clerodendrum polycephalum leaf extract would prevent epileptic-related disorders in mice induced with epileptic conditions using kainic acid and other behavioral phenotypic models. Here, our findings clearly revealed that Clerodendrum polycephalum leaf extract protects against conditions of epileptic-related disorders and thus might be relevant as a dietary supplement in the prevention or delay of the onset of seizures and epileptic behavior.

AB  - Background: Breast carcinoma-amplified sequence 2 (BCAS2) regulates beta-catenin gene splicing. The conditional knockout of BCAS2 expression in the forebrain (BCAS2 cKO) of mice confers impaired learning and memory along with decreased beta-catenin expression. Because beta-catenin reportedly regulates adult neurogenesis, we wondered whether BCAS2 could regulate adult neurogenesis via beta-catenin.
   Methods: BCAS2-regulating neurogenesis was investigated by characterizing BCAS2 cKO mice. Also, lentivirus-shBCAS2 was intracranially injected into the hippocampus of wild-type mice to knock down BCAS2 expression. We evaluated the rescue effects of BCAS2 cKO by intracranial injection of adeno-associated virus encoding BCAS2 (AAV-DJ8-BCAS2) and AAV-beta-catenin gene therapy.
   Results: To show that BCAS2-regulating adult neurogenesis via beta-catenin, first, BCAS2 cKO mice showed low SRY-box 2-positive (Sox2(+)) neural stem cell proliferation and doublecortin-positive (DCX+) immature neurons. Second, stereotaxic intracranial injection of lentivirus-shBCAS2 knocked down BCAS2 in the hippocampus of wild-type mice, and we confirmed the BCAS2 regulation of adult neurogenesis via beta-catenin. Third, AAV-DJ8-BCAS2 gene therapy in BCAS2 cKO mice reversed the low proliferation of Sox2(+) neural stem cells and the decreased number of DCX+ immature neurons with increased beta-catenin expression. Moreover, AAV-beta-catenin gene therapy restored neuron stem cell proliferation and immature neuron differentiation, which further supports BCAS2-regulating adult neurogenesis via beta-catenin. In addition, cells targeted by AAV-DJ8 injection into the hippocampus included Sox2 and DCX immature neurons, interneurons, and astrocytes. BCAS2 may regulate adult neurogenesis by targeting Sox2(+) and DCX+ immature neurons for autocrine effects and interneurons or astrocytes for paracrine effects.
   Conclusions: BCAS2 can regulate adult neurogenesis in mice via beta-catenin.

AB  - Depression is the most common complication of childhood epilepsy, leading to a poor prognosis for seizure control and poor quality of life. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying epileptic depression have not been completely elucidated. Increasing evidence suggests that oxidative stress and neuroinflammation are major contributors to depression. The positive effects of dietary supplementation with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) on depression have been previously reported. However, knowledge regarding the effects of EPA and DHA in managing depressive symptoms in pediatric patients with epilepsy is limited. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the effects of EPA and DHA on epileptic depression in a pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-treated young mouse model. Three-week-old mice were fed a DHA- or EPA-enriched diet for 21 days and treated with PTZ (35 mg/kg, i.p.) every other day for a total of 10 times. EPA was more effective than DHA at alleviating PTZ-induced depressive symptoms. Pathological results revealed that DHA and EPA significantly improved neuronal degeneration in the hippocampus. Analysis of the mechanism revealed that DHA and EPA mitigated PTZ-induced myelin damage by increasing the protein levels of CNPase, Olig2, and MBP. Furthermore, both DHA and EPA reduced neuroinflammation by promoting microglial M2 polarization and suppressing the LCN2-NLRP3 inflammasome pathway. Notably, EPA polarized microglia towards the M2 phenotype. In addition, DHA and EPA decreased oxidative stress by inhibiting NOX2 and enhancing mitochondrial metabolism through the increased expression of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I-V proteins. These findings suggest that DHA and EPA can be used as effective interventions to improve depression in children with epilepsy, with EPA being a particularly favorable option.

AB  - This study investigated the neuroprotective effects of peripheral nerve microcurrent stimulation therapy in a rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Twenty 8-week-old male Sprague Dawley rats weighing 300-330 g were categorised into group A, serving as the healthy control; group B, including rats subjected to MCAO; group C, including rats receiving microcurrent therapy immediately after MCAO, which was continued for one week; and group D, including rats receiving microcurrent therapy one week before and one week after MCAO. A gross morphological analysis, behavioural motion analysis, histological examination, immunohistochemistry, and Western blotting were conducted. Microcurrent therapy significantly reduced ischaemic damage and pyramidal cells of the hippocampus CA1 region. Haematoxylin and eosin staining revealed infarction areas/viable pyramidal cell numbers of 0%/94.33, 28.53%/40.05, 17.32%/80.13, and 5.38%/91.34 in groups A, B, C, and D, respectively (p < 0.001). A behavioural analysis revealed that the total distances moved were 1945.24 cm, 767.85 cm, 1781.77 cm, and 2122.22 cm in groups A, B, C, and D, respectively (p < 0.05), and the mean speeds were 6.48 cm/s, 2.50 cm/s, 5.43 cm/s, and 6.82 cm/s, respectively (p < 0.05). Inflammatory markers (cluster of differentiation 68, interleukin-6, and tumour necrosis factor-alpha) significantly decreased in the treated groups (p < 0.001). Western blotting revealed reduced proinflammatory, oxidative stress, and apoptosis-related protein levels, along with increased angiogenic factors and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway modulation in the treated groups. Peripheral nerve microcurrent stimulation therapy effectively mitigates ischaemic damage, promotes recovery, reduces inflammation, and modulates protein expression, emphasising its potential as a therapeutic strategy for ischaemic stroke.

AB  - Background RBM3 is a key RNA-binding protein that has been implicated in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation and cell cycle regulation. However, its role in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) remains poorly understood.Aims We aimed to investigate the expression levels of RNA-binding motif protein 3 (RBM3) in patients with cSCC and evaluate its effect on cell ability in cSCC and its underlying regulatory mechanisms.Methods The expression of RBM3 in cSCC tissues and A431 cells was determined via immunohistochemistry and western blotting. Plenti-CMV-RBM3-Puro was used to overexpress RBM3. The effect of RBM3 on the proliferation ability of cSCC cells was evaluated using MTT and colony formation assay. Cell apoptosis and cell cycle were determined using flow cytometry, while the protein expressions of BAX, NF-kappa B, BCL2, CASPASE 3, CYCLIN B, CYCLIN E, CDK1, phosphorylated (P)-CDK1, CDK2, P-CDK2, ERK, P-ERK, P-AMPK, AKT, P-AKT, MDM2, and P53 were assessed using western blotting.Results RBM3 expression was significantly downregulated in cSCC tissues and A431 cells. RBM3 overexpression significantly inhibited the cell proliferation and colony formation ability of A431. Notably, RNA-seq results showed that the differentially expressed genes associated with RBM3 were primarily involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, oocyte meiosis, and P53 signaling pathway, as well as the modulation of the MAPK, AMPK, Hippo, mTOR, PI3K/AKT, Wnt, FoxO, and NF-kappa B signaling pathways. Additionally, our findings demonstrated that overexpression of RBM3 inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell cycle arrest of cSCC through modulation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.Conclusion This study provides novel insights into the suppressive roles of RBM3 in cell proliferation and the cell cycle in cSCC and highlights its therapeutic potential for cSCC.

AB  - The secondary metabolites profiling of Nymphaea nouchali stem (NNSE) extract was carried out using a high-resolution mass spectroscopic technique. The antioxidant effects of NNSE, as well as the underlying mechanisms, were also investigated in tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP)-stimulated oxidative stress in RAW264.7 cells. Tandem mass spectroscopy with (-) negative mode tentatively revealed the presence of 54 secondary metabolites in NNSE. Among them, phenolic acids and flavonoids were predominant. Phenolic acids (brevifolincarboxylic acid, p-coumaroyltartaric acid, niazinin B, lalioside, 3-feruloylquinic acid, and gallic acid-O-rutinoside), flavonoids (elephantorrhizol, apigenin-6-C-galactoside 8-C-arabinoside, and vicenin-2), sialic acid (2-deoxy-2,3-dehydro-N-acetylneuraminic acid), and terpenoid (alpha-gamma-onoceradienedione) were identified in NNSE for the first time. Unbridled reactive oxygen species/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) and redox imbalances participate in the induction and development of many oxidative stress-linked diseases. The NNSE exhibited significant free radical scavenging capabilities and was also able to reduce t-BHP-induced cellular generation in RAW264.7 cells. The NNSE prevented oxidative stress by inducing the endogenous antioxidant system and the levels of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) by upregulating Nrf2 through the modulation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), such as phosphorylated p38 and c-Jun N terminal kinase. Collectively, these results indicate that the NNSE exhibits potent effects in preventing oxidative stress-stimulated diseases and disorders through the modulation of the MAPK/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway. Our findings provide new insights into the cytoprotective effects and mechanisms of Nymphaea nouchali stem extract against oxidative stress, which may be a useful remedy for oxidative stress-induced disorders.

AB  - Melatonin is an endogenous hormone that exhibits antioxidant functions and neuroprotective effects. The hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex (PFC) play an important role linked to working memory. 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) can induce oxidative stress and reduce neurogenesis in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus in a rat hippocampus and these alterations are related to working memory deficits. This study aimed to determine the effect of melatonin on 5-FU-induced oxidative stress that interferes with the antioxidant enzymes and protein expression levels in a rat hippocampus and PFC. A total of 68 male Sprague Dawley rats were divided into four groups: vehicle, 5-FU, melatonin and melatonin+5-FU groups. Rats were administered 5-FU (25 mg/kg, i.v.) on days 9, 12, 15, 18 and 21 and received melatonin (8 mg/kg, i.p.) at 19:00 from day 1 to day 21 of the experiment. Lipid peroxidation was assessed by measuring malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. Antioxidant enzyme levels including glutathione peroxidase (GPX), catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were determined. p21 immunofluorescence staining and Western blotting were used to detect the cell cycle arrest and protein expression of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), doublecortin (DCX) and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), respectively. The results showed that melatonin reduced the number of p21-positive cells in the SGZ of the dentate gyrus and increased Nrf2, DCX and BDNF protein expression in rats treated with 5-FU. Moreover, melatonin restored antioxidant enzyme levels and reduced oxidative stress in the hippocampus and PFC caused by 5-FU. These findings reveal a mechanism of the neuroprotective properties of melatonin against 5-FU in a rat hippocampus and PFC.

AB  - Stroke, the third leading cause of death worldwide, is a major cause of functional disability. Cerebral ischemia causes a rapid elevation of adenosine, the main neuromodulator in the brain. The inhibition of adenosine A2A receptors (A2ARs) has been introduced as a potential target in neurodegenerative disorders involving extracellular adenosine elevation. Istradefylline, a selective A2AR antagonist, has been approved for Parkinson's disease (PD) adjunctive therapy and showed neuroprotective effects in PD and Alzheimer's disease. However, the role of A2ARs in post-stroke neuronal damage and behavioral deficits remains unclear. We recently showed that A2AR antagonism prevented the adenosine-induced post-hypoxia synaptic potentiation of glutamatergic neurotransmission following the hypoxia/reperfusion of hippocampal slices. Here, we investigated the potential neuroprotective effects of istradefylline in male Sprague-Dawley rats subjected to pial vessel disruption (PVD) used to model a small-vessel stroke. Rats were treated with either a vehicle control or istradefylline (3 mg/kg i.p.) following PVD surgery for three days. Istradefylline administration prevented anxiety and depressive-like behaviors caused by PVD stroke. In addition, istradefylline significantly attenuated ischemia-induced cognitive impairment and motor deficits. Moreover, istradefylline markedly reduced hippocampal neurodegeneration, as well as GFAP/Iba-1, TNF-alpha, nNOS, and iNOS levels after PVD, but prevented the downregulation of anti-inflammatory markers TGF-beta 1 and IL-4. Together, these results suggest a molecular link between stroke and PD and that the anti-PD drug istradefylline displays translational potential for drug repurposing as a neuroprotective agent for cerebral ischemic damage.

AB  - Vascular dementia (VD) is the second most common dementia syndrome worldwide, and effective treatments are lacking. Gastrodia elata Blume (GEB) has been used in traditional Chinese herbal medicine for centuries to treat cognitive impairment, ischemic stroke, epilepsy, and dizziness. Gastrodin (p-hydroxymethylphenyl-b-D-glucopyranoside, Gas) and Gastrodigenin (p-hydroxybenzyl alcohol, HBA) are the main bioactive components of GEB. This study explored the effects of Gas and HBA on cognitive dysfunction in VD and their possible molecular mechanisms. The VD model was established by bilateral common carotid artery ligation (2-vessel occlusion, 2-VO) combined with an intraperitoneal injection of sodium nitroprusside solution. One week after modeling, Gas (25 and 50 mg/kg, i.g.) and HBA (25 and 50 mg/kg, i.g.) were administered orally for four weeks, and the efficacy was evaluated. A Morris water maze test and passive avoidance test were used to observe their cognitive function, and H&E staining and Nissl staining were used to observe the neuronal morphological changes; the expressions of A beta 1-42 and p-tau396 were detected by immunohistochemistry, and the changes in energy metabolism in the brain tissue of VD rats were analyzed by targeted quantitative metabolomics. Finally, a Hippocampus XF analyzer measured mitochondrial respiration in H2O2-treated HT-22 cells. Our study showed that Gas and HBA attenuated learning memory dysfunction and neuronal damage and reduced the accumulation of A beta 1-42, P-Tau396, and P-Tau217 proteins in the brain tissue. Furthermore, Gas and HBA improved energy metabolism disorders in rats, involving metabolic pathways such as glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and the pentose phosphate pathway, and reducing oxidative damage-induced cellular mitochondrial dysfunction. The above results indicated that Gas and HBA may exert neuroprotective effects on VD by regulating energy metabolism and mitochondrial function.

AB  - The insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP; oxytocinase) is part of the M1 aminopeptidase family and is highly expressed in many tissues, including the neocortex and hippocampus of the brain. IRAP is involved in various physiological functions and has been identified as a receptor for the endogenous hexapeptide Angiotensin IV (Ang IV). The binding of Ang IV inhibits the enzymatic activity of IRAP and has been proven to enhance learning and memory in animal models. The macrocyclic compound 9 (C9) is a potent synthetic IRAP inhibitor developed from the previously reported inhibitor HA08. In this study, we have examined compound C9 and its effects on cognitive markers drebrin, microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in primary hippocampal and cortical cultures. Cells from Sprague Dawley rats were cultured for 14 days before treatment with C9 for 4 consecutive days. The cells were analysed for protein expression of drebrin, MAP2, GFAP, glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4), vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (vGluT1), and synapsin I using immunocytochemistry. The gene expression of related proteins was determined using qPCR, and viability assays were performed to evaluate toxicity. The results showed that protein expression of drebrin and MAP2 was increased, and the corresponding mRNA levels were decreased after treatment with C9 in the hippocampal cultures. The ratio of MAP2-positive neurons and GFAP-positive astrocytes was altered and there were no toxic effects observed. In conclusion, the IRAP inhibitor compound C9 enhances the expression of the pro-cognitive markers drebrin and MAP2, which further confirms IRAP as a relevant pharmaceutical target and C9 as a promising candidate for further investigation.

AB  - LiCl/pilocarpine status epilepticus (SE) induced in immature rats leads, after a latent period, to hippocampal hyperexcitability. The excitability may be influenced by adenosine, which exhibits anticonvulsant activity. The concentration of adenosine is regulated by adenosine kinase (ADK) present in two isoforms-ADK-L and ADK-S. The main goal of the study is to elucidate the changes in ADK isoform expression after LiCl/pilocarpine SE and whether potential changes, as well as inhibition of ADK by 5-iodotubercidin (5-ITU), may contribute to changes in hippocampal excitability during brain development. LiCl/pilocarpine SE was elicited in 12-day-old rats. Hippocampal excitability in immature rats was studied by the model of hippocampal afterdischarges (ADs), in which we demonstrated the potential inhibitory effect of 5-ITU. ADs demonstrated significantly decreased hippocampal excitability 3 days after SE induction, whereas significant hyperexcitability after 20 days compared to controls was shown. 5-ITU administration showed its inhibitory effect on the ADs in 32-day-old SE rats compared to SE rats without 5-ITU. Moreover, both ADK isoforms were examined in the immature rat hippocampus. The ADK-L isoform demonstrated significantly decreased expression in 12-day-old SE rats compared to the appropriate naive rats, whereas increased ADK-S isoform expression was revealed. A decreasing ADK-L/-S ratio showed the declining dominance of ADK-L isoform during early brain development. LiCl/pilocarpine SE increased the excitability of the hippocampus 20 days after SE induction. The ADK inhibitor 5-ITU exhibited anticonvulsant activity at the same age. Age-related differences in hippocampal excitability after SE might correspond to the development of ADK isoform levels in the hippocampus.

AB  - Novel therapeutic strategies for ovarian cancer treatment are in critical need due to the chemoresistance and adverse side effects of platinum-based chemotherapy. Theasaponin E-1 (TSE1) is an oleanane-type saponin from Camellia sinensis seeds. Its apoptosis-inducing, cell cycle arresting and antiangiogenesis activities against platinum-resistant ovarian cancer cells were elucidated in vitro and using the chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay. The results showed that TSE1 had more potent cell growth inhibitory effects on ovarian cancer OVCAR-3 and A2780/CP70 cells than cisplatin and was lower in cytotoxicity to normal ovarian IOSE-364 cells. TSE1 significantly induced OVCAR-3 cell apoptosis via the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways, slightly arresting cell cycle at the G2/M phase, and obviously inhibited OVCAR-3 cell migration and angiogenesis with reducing the protein secretion and expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Western bolt assay showed that Serine/threonine Kinase (Akt) signaling related proteins including Ataxia telangiectasia mutated kinase (ATM), Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), Akt, Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), Ribosome S6 protein kinase (p70S6K) and e IF4E-binding protein 1(4E-BP1) were regulated, and Hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) protein expression was decreased by TSE1 in OVCAR-3 cells. Moreover, TSE1 treatment potently downregulated protein expression of the Notch ligands including Delta-like protein 4 (Dll4) and Jagged1, and reduced the protein level of the intracellular domain (NICD) of Notch1. Combination treatment of TSE1 with the Notch1 signaling inhibitor tert-butyl (2S)-2-[[(2S)-2-[[2-(3,5-difluorophenyl)acetyl]amino]propanoyl]amino]-2-phenylacetate (DAPT), or the Akt signaling inhibitor wortmannin, showed a stronger inhibition toward HIF-1 alpha activation compared with single compound treatment. Taken together, TSE1 might be a potential candidate compound for improving platinum-resistant ovarian cancer treatment via Dll4/Jagged1-Notch1-Akt-HIF-1 alpha axis.

AB  - Previous studies demonstrated that reward circuit plays an important role in smoking. The differences of functional and structural connectivity were found among several brain regions such as thalamus and frontal lobe. However, few studies focused on functional connectivity (FC) in whole-brain voxel level of young smokers. In this study, intrinsic connectivity contrast (ICC) was used to perform voxel-based whole-brain analyses in 55 young smokers and 55 matched non-smokers to identify brain regions with significant group differences. ICC results showed that the connectivity of young smokers in medial frontal cortex (MedFC), supramarginal gyrus anterior division left (L_aSMG), central opercular cortex left (L_CO) and middle frontal gyrus left (L_MidFG) showed a significantly lower trend compared with the non-smokers. The seed-based FC analysis about MedFC indicated that young smokers showed reduced connectivity between the MedFC and left hippocampus, left amygdala compared to non-smokers. Correlation analysis showed that the ICC of MedFC in young smokers was significantly negatively correlated with Fagerstrom test for nicotine dependence (FTND) and Questionnaire on Smoking Urges (QSU). The FC between the MedFC and left hippocampus, left amygdala was significantly negatively correlated with Pack_years. The mediation analysis indicated that ICC of MedFC completely mediated FTND and QSU of young smokers. The results suggest that nicotine accumulation may affect the communication of the frontal lobe with the whole brain to some extent, leading to changes in smoking cravings. The above research also provides in-depth insights into the mechanism of adolescent smoking addiction and related intervention treatment.
   The whole-brain analysis intrinsic connectivity contrast was used to find the abnormalities of connectivity in brain regions such as frontal medial cortex edFC in young smokers. The results may provide in-depth insights into the mechanism of adolescent smoking addiction and highlight the importance and effectiveness of a completely data-driven approach to the problem.image

AB  - Under in vivo conditions, CA1 pyramidal cells from the hippocampus display transitions from single spikes to bursts. It is believed that subthreshold hyperpolarization and depolarization, also known as down and up-states, play a pivotal role in these transitions. Nevertheless, a central impediment to correlating suprathreshold (spiking) and subthreshold activity has been the technical difficulties of this type of recordings, even with widely used calcium imaging or multielectrode recordings. Recent work using voltage imaging with genetically encoded voltage indicators has been able to correlate spiking patterns with subthreshold activity in a variety of CA1 neurons, and recent computational models have been able to capture these transitions. In this work, we used a computational model of a CA1 pyramidal cell to investigate the role of intrinsic conductances and oscillatory patterns in generating down and up-states and their modulation in the transition from single spiking to bursting. Specifically, the emergence of distinct spiking resonances between these two spiking modes that share the same voltage traces in the presence of theta or gamma oscillatory inputs, a phenomenon we call interleaved single and bursting spiking resonance. We noticed that these resonances do not necessarily overlap in frequency or amplitude, underscoring their relevance for providing flexibility to neural processing. We studied the conductance values of three current types that are thought to be critical for the bursting behavior: persistent sodium current (INaP) and its conductance GNaP, delayed rectifier potassium (IKDR) and its conductance GKDR, and hyperpolarization-activated current (Ih) and its conductance Gh. We conclude that the intricate interplay of ionic currents significantly influences the neuronal firing patterns, transitioning from single to burst firing during sustained depolarization. Specifically, the intermediate levels of GNaP and GKDR facilitate spiking resonance at gamma frequency inputs. The resonance characteristics vary between single and burst firing modes, each displaying distinct amplitudes and resonant frequencies. Furthermore, low GNaP and high GKDR values lock bursting to theta frequencies, while high GNaP and low GKDR values lock single spiking to gamma frequencies. Lastly, the duration of quiet intervals plays a crucial role in determining the likelihood of transitioning to either bursting or single spiking modes. We confirmed that the same features were present in previously recorded in vivo voltage-imaging data. Understanding these dynamics provides valuable insights into the fundamental mechanisms underlying neuronal excitability under in vivo conditions.

AB  - Chymosin is an enzyme used to coagulate milk, in the cheese industry. This study aimed to increase recombinant production of the chymosin in Pichia pastoris by determining the optimum copy number and overproduction of a Protein Disulfide Isomerase (PpPDI) chaperon protein. Bos taurus chymosin was expressed under the control of a mutant ADH2 promoter. The clones containing 1-4 gene copy numbers of the chymosin were constructed using the in vitro cloning method, and the effect of chaperone protein on chymosin secretion was investigated. The enzyme production levels are 4, 6.3, 4.5, and 3 IMCU/mL for 1, 2, 3, and 4-copy clones. The secreted chymosin levels increased up to two copies, and increasing the number of copies decreased the secretion level. Therefore, PpPDI was over-expressed in the clones regulated with the ADH2 promoter. The over-expression of PDI gene increased chymosin secretion in clones compared to the counterpart host. However, the highest chymosin level was obtained with C2 (2-copy chymosin containing clone; 6.3 IMCU/mL) and C2P2 (2-copy chymosin/2copy PDI containing clone; 8.2 IMCU/mL). The maximum production was 39 IMCU/mL with the clone C2P2 in the fermenter scale production. The enzyme activity increased approximately 2-fold by adding two copies of the chaperone protein. The combined effect of gene copy number and chaperone overexpression on chymosin production was investigated. Two copies of the chymosin and PpPDI genes were the optimum among the tested clones.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex form of neurodegenerative dementia. Growing body of evidence supports the cardinal role of sirtuin1 (SIRT1) in neurodegeneration and AD development. Recently, adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (Ad-MSCs) have made their mark for a wide array of regenerative medicine applications, including neurodegenerative disorders. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the therapeutic potential of Ad-MSCs in AD rat model, and to explore the possible implication of SIRT1. Ad-MSCs were isolated from rat epididymal fat pads and properly characterized. Aluminum chloride was used to induce AD in rats, and afterward, a group of AD-induced rats received a single dose of Ad-MSCs (2 x 10(6) cell, I.V per rat). One month after Ad-MSCs transplantation, behavioral tests were done, brain tissues were collected, then histopathological and biochemical assessments were performed. Amyloid beta and SIRT1 levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Whereas expression levels of neprilysin, BCL2 associated X protein, B-cell lymphoma-2, interleukin-1 ss, interleukin6, and nerve growth factor in hippocampus and frontal cortex brain tissues were assessed using reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Our data demonstrated that transplantation of Ad-MSCs alleviated cognitive impairment in AD rats. Additionally, they exhibited anti-amyloidogenic, antiapoptotic, anti-inflammatory, as well as neurogenic effects. Furthermore, Ad-MSCs were found to possibly mediate their therapeutic effects, at least partially, via modulating both central and systemic SIRT1 levels. Hence, the current study portrays Ad-MSCs as an effective therapeutic approach for AD management and opens the door for future investigations to further elucidate the role of SIRT1 and its interrelated molecular mediators in AD.

AB  - While the recurrent 22q11.2 deletion is one of the strongest genetic risk factors for schizophrenia (SCZ), variability of its associated neuropsychiatric endophenotypes reflects its incomplete penetrance for psychosis development. To assess whether this phenotypic variability is linked to common variants associated with SCZ, we studied the association between SCZ polygenic risk score (PRS) and longitudinally acquired phenotypic information of the Swiss 22q11.2DS cohort (n = 97, 50% females, mean age 17.7 yr, mean visit interval 3.8 yr). The SCZ PRS with the best predictive performance was ascertained in the Estonian Biobank (n = 201,146) with LDpred. The infinitesimal SCZ PRS model showed the strongest capacity in discriminating SCZ cases from controls with one SD difference in SCZ PRS corresponding to an odds ratio (OR) of 1.73 (95% CI 1.57-1.90, P = 1.47 x 10(-29)). In 22q11.2 patients, random-effects ordinal regression modelling using longitudinal data showed SCZ PRS to have the strongest effect on social anhedonia (OR = 2.09, P = 0.0002), and occupational functioning (OR = 1.82, P = 0.0003) within the negative symptoms course, and dysphoric mood (OR = 2.00, P = 0.002) and stress intolerance (OR = 1.76, P = 0.0002) within the general symptoms course. Genetic liability for SCZ was additionally associated with full scale cognitive decline (ss = -0.25, P = 0.02) and with longitudinal volumetric reduction of the right and left hippocampi (ss = -0.28, P = 0.005; ss = -0.23, P = 0.02, respectively). Our results indicate that the polygenic contribution to SCZ acts upon the threshold-lowering first hit (i.e., the deletion). It modifies the endophenotypes of 22q11.2DS and augments the derailment of developmental trajectories of negative and general symptoms, cognition, and hippocampal volume.

AB  - Myogenesis is a central step in prenatal myofiber formation, postnatal myofiber hypertrophy, and muscle damage repair in adulthood. RNA-Seq technology has greatly helped reveal the molecular mechanism of myogenesis, but batch effects in different experiments inevitably lead to misinterpretation of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). We previously applied the robust rank aggregation (RRA) method to effectively circumvent batch effects across multiple RNA-Seq datasets from 3T3-L1 cells. Here, we also used the RRA method to integrate nine RNA-Seq datasets from C2C12 cells and obtained 3140 robust DEGs between myoblasts and myotubes, which were then validated with array expression profiles and H3K27ac signals. The upregulated robust DEGs were highly enriched in gene ontology (GO) terms related to muscle cell differentiation and development. Considering that the cooperative binding of transcription factors (TFs) to enhancers to regulate downstream gene expression is a classical epigenetic mechanism, differentially expressed TFs (DETFs) were screened, and potential novel myogenic factors (MAF, BCL6, and ESR1) with high connection degree in protein-protein interaction (PPI) network were presented. Moreover, KLF5 cooperatively binds with the three key myogenic factors (MYOD, MYOG, and MEF2D) in C2C12 cells. Motif analysis speculates that the binding of MYOD and MYOG is KLF5-independent, while MEF2D is KLF5-dependent. It was revealed that KLF5-binding sites could be exploited to filter redundant MYOD-, MYOG-, and MEF2D-binding sites to focus on key enhancers for myogenesis. Further functional annotation of KLF5-binding sites suggested that KLF5 may regulate myogenesis through the PI3K-AKt signaling pathway, Rap1 signaling pathway, and the Hippo signaling pathway. In general, our study provides a wealth of untapped candidate targets for myogenesis and contributes new insights into the core regulatory mechanisms of myogenesis relying on KLF5-binding signal.

AB  - Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease is a rare autosomal recessive inherited childhood neurodegenerative disease characterized by the accumulation of cholesterol and glycosphingolipids, involving the autophagy-lysosome system. Inhibition of soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH), an enzyme that metabolizes epoxy fatty acids (EpFAs) to 12-diols, exerts beneficial effects in modulating inflammation and autophagy, critical features of the NPC disease. This study aims to evaluate the effects of UB-EV-52, an sEH inhibitor (sEHi), in an NPC mouse model (Npc) by administering it for 4 weeks (5 mg/kg/day). Behavioral and cognitive tests (open-field test (OF)), elevated plus maze (EPM), novel object recognition test (NORT) and object location test (OLT) demonstrated that the treatment produced an improvement in short- and long-term memory as well as in spatial memory. Furthermore, UB-EV-52 treatment increased body weight and lifespan by 25% and reduced gene expression of the inflammatory markers (i.e., Il-1 beta and Mcp1) and enhanced oxidative stress (OS) markers (iNOS and Hmox1) in the treated Npc mice group. As for autophagic markers, surprisingly, we found significantly reduced levels of LC3B-II/LC3B-I ratio and significantly reduced brain protein levels of lysosomal-associated membrane protein-1 (LAMP-1) in treated Npc mice group compared to untreated ones in hippocampal tissue. Lipid profile analysis showed a significant reduction of lipid storage in the liver and some slight changes in homogenated brain tissue in the treated NPC mice compared to the untreated groups. Therefore, our results suggest that pharmacological inhibition of sEH ameliorates most of the characteristic features of NPC mice, demonstrating that sEH can be considered a potential therapeutic target for this disease.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a monogenic disorder with autosomal dominant inheritance. In HD patients, neurons in the striatum and cortex degenerate, leading to motor, psychiatric and cognitive disorders. Dysregulated synaptic function and calcium handling are common in many neurodegenerative diseases, including HD. N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor function is enhanced in HD at extrasynaptic sites, altering the balance of calcium-dependent neuronal survival versus death signalling pathways. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium handling is also abnormal in HD. The ER, which is continuous with the nuclear envelope, is purportedly involved in nuclear calcium signalling; based on this, we hypothesised that nuclear calcium signalling is altered in HD. We explored this hypothesis with calcium imaging techniques, including simultaneous epifluorescent imaging of cytosolic and nuclear calcium using jRCaMP1b and GCaMP3 sensors, respectively, in striatal spiny projection neurons in cortical-striatal co-cultures from the YAC128 mouse model of HD. Our data show contributions from a variety of calcium channels to nuclear calcium signalling. NMDA receptors (NMDARs) play an essential role in initiating action potential-dependent calcium signalling to the nucleus, and ryanodine receptors (RyR) contribute to both cytosolic and nuclear calcium signals. Unlike previous reports in glutamatergic hippocampal and cortical neurons, we found that in GABAergic striatal neurons, L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (CaV) contribute to cytosolic, but not nuclear calcium signalling. Calcium imaging also suggests impairments in nuclear calcium signalling in HD striatal neurons, where spontaneous action potential-dependent calcium transients in the nucleus were smaller in YAC128 striatal neurons compared to those of wild-type (WT). Our results elucidate mechanisms involved in action potential-dependent nuclear calcium signalling in GABAergic striatal neurons, and have revealed a clear deficit in this signalling in HD. image
   Huntington disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder affecting movement, mood and cognition, and striatal neurons show highest vulnerability to dysfunction and death. Calcium, a key messenger for transmitting external stimuli to the cell's nucleus, helps coordinate new protein expression that ultimately regulates neuronal health and connectivity in the brain. Here, we use a model system to explore the mechanisms of calcium signalling to the nucleus in striatal neurons, revealing critical roles for N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors and ryanodine receptors, and demonstrating early impairment in this pathway in HD.image

AB  - The rhythm of epileptiform activity occurs in various brain injuries (ischemia, stroke, concussion, mechanical damage, AD, PD). The epileptiform rhythm is accompanied by periodic Ca2+ pulses, which are necessary for the neurotransmitter release, the repair of damaged connections between neurons, and the growth of new projections. The duration and amplitude of these pulses depend on intracellular calcium-binding proteins. The effect of the synthetic fast calcium buffer BAPTA on the epileptiform activity of neurons induced by the GABA(A)-receptor inhibitor, bicuculline, was investigated in a 14-DIV rat hippocampal culture. In the epileptiform activity mode, neurons periodically synchronously generate action potential (AP) bursts in the form of paroxysmal depolarization shift (PDS) clusters and their corresponding high-amplitude Ca2+ pulses. Changes in the paroxysmal activity and Ca2+ pulses were recorded continuously for 10-11 min as BAPTA accumulated. It was shown that during BAPTA accumulation, transformation of neuronal patch activity occurs. Moreover, GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons respond differently to the presence of calcium buffer. Experiments were performed on two populations of neurons: a population of GABAergic neurons that responded selectively to ATPA, a calcium-permeable GluK1 kainate receptor agonist, and a population of glutamatergic neurons with a large amplitude of cluster depolarization (greater than -20 mV). These neurons made up the majority of neurons. In the population of GABAergic neurons, during BAPTA accumulation, the amplitude of PDS clusters decreases, which leads to a switch from the PDS mode to the classical burst mode with an increase in the electrical activity of the neuron. In glutamatergic neurons, the duration of PDS clusters decreased during BAPTA accumulation. However, the amplitude changed little. The data obtained showed that endogenous calcium-binding proteins play a significant role in switching the epileptiform rhythm to the recovery rhythm and perform a neuroprotective function by reducing the duration of impulses in excitatory neurons and the amplitude of impulses in inhibitory neurons.

AB  - We investigated the ameliorating effects of astaxanthin (AXA) on methotrexate (MTX) induced damage to the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, cerebellar cortex and blood. We used 24 female Wistar albino rats divided into three groups of eight as follows: sham/control group, single dose of saline intraperitoneally (i.p.) and 7 days orally; MTX group, single dose of 20 mg/kg MTX (i.p.); MTX + AXA group, single dose of 20 mg/kg MTX i.p.+ 100 mg/kg AXA orally for 7 days. For all groups we measured total oxidant status (TOS) and total antioxidant status (TAS) in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and blood. Histological sections of cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellar cortex were inspected microscopically. Caspase-3 (cas-3), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF), growth related oncogene (GRO), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and myelin basic protein (MBP) were estimated immunohistochemically in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellar cortex. In the MTX group, TAS was decreased significantly in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and blood, while TOS was significantly increased. AXA significantly ameliorated oxidative stress parameters in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Histopathological examination revealed degeneration, edema and hyperemia in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellar cortex in the MTX group. AXA treatment ameliorated histopathological changes. MTX decreased MBP expression in cerebral cortex. Although MBP expression was decreased in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellar cortex stimulated with MTX, the expressions of cas-3, GCSF, GRO and iNOS were significantly increased. AXA ameliorated the expression of cas-3, GCSF, GRO, iNOS and MBP. AXA exhibits anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-apoptotic effects on MTX induced toxicity in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellar cortex by increasing MBP expression, regulating inflammatory cytokine release and reducing oxidative stress.

AB  - The ostrich oil of Struthio camelus (Ratite) found uses in folk medicine as an anti-inflammatory in eczema and contact dermatitis. The anti-inflammatory effect of a gamma-lactone (5-hexyl-3H-furan-2-one) isolated from ostrich oil and its formulated nano-emulsion in formalin-induced paw edema was investigated in this study. Ostrich oil was saponified using a standard procedure; the aqueous residue was fractionated, purified, and characterized as gamma-lactone (5-hexyl-3H-furan-2-one) through the interpretation of IR, NMR, and MS analyses. The gamma-lactone was formulated as nano-emulsion using methylcellulose (MC) for oral solubilized form. The gamma-lactone methylcellulose nanoparticles (gamma-lactone-MC-NPs) were characterized for their size, shape, and encapsulation efficiency with a uniform size of 300 nm and 59.9% drug content. The gamma-lactone was applied topically, while the formulated nanoparticles (NPs) were administered orally to rats. A non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (diclofenac gel) was used as a reference drug for topical use and ibuprofen suspension for oral administration. Edema was measured using the plethysmograph method. Both gamma-lactone and gamma-lactone-MC-NPs showed reduction of formalin-induced paw edema in rats and proved to be better than the reference drugs; diclofenac gel and ibuprofen emulsion. Histological examination of the skin tissue revealed increased skin thickness with subepidermal edema and mixed inflammatory cellular infiltration, which were significantly reduced by the gamma-lactone compared to the positive control (p-value = 0.00013). Diuretic and toxicity studies of oral gamma-lactone-MC-NPs were performed. No diuretic activity was observed. However, lethargy, drowsiness, and refusal to feeding observed may limit its oral administration.

AB  - Apoptosis is the main pathological aspect of neuronal injury after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. However the detailed molecular mediators are still under debate. The aim of this study is to explore the effect of cerebral I/R on miR-23a/TGF-beta-activated kinase 1 binding protein 3 (TAB3)/nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B)/p53 axis in rat hippocampus alone and in combination with chlorogenic acid (CGA). Common carotid artery occlusion (CCAO) was performed by nylon monofilament for 20 min to establish a model of ischemic brain injury. CGA (30 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally (ip), 10 min prior to ischemia and 10 min before reperfusion. Examination of hippocampus neurons by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling staining showed that the number of apoptotic neurons was elevated at 24 h after reperfusion. At the molecular levels, I/R injury resulted in an increased protein expression of p53 with a concomitant upregulation of cleaved-caspase3/phosphorelated-caspase3 ratio and cytochrome c level. Further miR-23b gene expression was significantly downregulated after 24 h of reperfusion. Also, we observed increased TAB3 and NF-kappa B protein expressions after 24 h following CCAO. Treatment with CGA significantly reduced the apoptotic damage and also reversed miR-23b gene expression, TAB3 and NF-kappa B protein expressions in hippocampus neurons in I/R rats. In conclusion our data suggest that miR-23b/TAB3/NF-kappa B/p53 axis could play a regulatory role in hippocampus cell death, which provide a new target for novel therapeutic interventions during transit ischemic stroke. It also demonstrated that CGA could reverse these molecular alterations indicating an effective component against hippocampus apoptotic insult following acute I/R injury.

AB  - Introduction: This study investigates the effects and mechanisms of Scutellaria baicalensis flavonoids (SSF) on passive avoidance learning and memory deficits induced by composite amyloid-beta proteins (A beta) via the MEK-ERK-CREB signaling pathway in rats based on network pharmacology and bioinformatics. Methods: Network pharmacology and bioinformatics identified target pathways. An Alzheimer's disease model was induced in male wistar rats using A beta(25-35), AlCl3, and RHTGF-beta(1)(referred to as compound A beta). Memory impairment was confirmed with the Morris water maze. Modeled rats were assigned to a control group and three SSF-treated groups for 33 days. Passive avoidance learning abilities were assessed with a step-down test, and p-crebser133 expression in the hippocampus was detected via immunohistochemistry. Real-time qPCR and western blotting measured mRNA and protein levels of c-Raf, MEKs, Rsk, and zif268 in the hippocampus and cortex. Results: Pathways such as the calcium signaling pathway, Apelin signaling pathway and cAMP signaling pathway were highlighted by KEGG analysis. The model had an 83.30% success rate. Model rats showed dry coats and unresponsiveness, while SSF treatment improved appearance and behavior. In passive avoidance tests, model rats made more errors and had shorter latencies (P < 0.01). They also showed decreased p-CREBSer133 and increased c-Raf, Rsk, and P-MEKs levels (P < 0.01), with reduced Zif268 (P < 0.01). SSF reversed these effects, enhancing p-CREBSer133 and Zif268 while regulating c-Raf, Rsk, and P-MEKs (P < 0.01). Conclusion: SSF ameliorates learning and memory impairments induced by composite A beta, acting through the MEK-ERK-CREB pathway in rats.

AB  - Cortical neurons activated during recent experiences often reactivate with dorsal hippocampal CA1 ripples during subsequent rest. Less is known about cortical interactions with intermediate hippocampal CA1, whose connectivity, functions, and ripple events differ from dorsal CA1. We identified three clusters of puta-tive excitatory neurons in mouse visual cortex that are preferentially excited together with either dorsal or in-termediate CA1 ripples or suppressed before both ripples. Neurons in each cluster were evenly distributed across primary and higher visual cortices and co-active even in the absence of ripples. These ensembles ex-hibited similar visual responses but different coupling to thalamus and pupil-indexed arousal. We observed a consistent activity sequence preceding and predicting ripples: (1) suppression of ripple-suppressed cortical neurons, (2) thalamic silence, and (3) activation of intermediate CA1-ripple-activated cortical neurons. We propose that coordinated dynamics of these ensembles relay visual experiences to distinct hippocampal subregions for incorporation into different cognitive maps.

AB  - Proper postharvest storage preserves horticultural products, including tea, until they can be processed. However, few studies have focused on the physiology of ripening and senescence during postharvest storage, which affects the flavor and quality of tea. In this study, physiological and biochemical indexes of the leaves of tea cultivar 'Yinghong 9 ' preserved at a low temperature and high relative humidity (15-18 degrees C and 85-95%, PTL) were compared to those of leaves stored at ambient conditions (24 +/- 2 degrees C and relative humidity of 65% +/- 5%, UTL). Water content, chromatism, chlorophyll fluorescence, and key metabolites (caffeine, theanine, and catechins) were analyzed over a period of 24 h, and volatilized compounds were determined after 24 h. In addition, the expression of key biosynthesis genes for catechin, caffeine, theanine, and terpene were quantified. The results showed that water content, chromatism, and chlorophyll fluorescence of preserved leaves were more similar to fresh tea leaves than unpreserved tea leaves. After 24 h, the content of aroma volatiles and caffeine significantly increased, while theanine decreased in both groups. Multiple catechin monomers showed distinct changes within 24 h, and EGCG was significantly higher in preserved tea. The expression levels of CsFAS and CsTSI were consistent with the content of farnesene and theanine, respectively, but TCS1 and TCS2 expression did not correlate with caffeine content. Principal component analysis considered results from multiple indexes and suggested that the freshness of PTL was superior to that of UTL. Taken together, preservation conditions in postharvest storage caused a series of physiological and metabolic variations of tea leaves, which were different from those of unpreserved tea leaves. Comprehensive evaluation showed that the preservation conditions used in this study were effective at maintaining the freshness of tea leaves for 2-6 h. This study illustrates the metabolic changes that occur in postharvest tea leaves, which will provide a foundation for improvements to postharvest practices for tea leaves.

AB  - Plant-predator mutualisms have been widely described in nature.1,2 How plants fine-tune their mutualistic interactions with the predators they recruit remains poorly understood. In the wild potato (Solanum kurtzianum), predatory mites, Neoseiulus californicus, are recruited to flowers of undamaged plants but rapidly move downward when the herbivorous mites, Tetranychus urticae, damage leaves. This "up-down"movement within the plant corresponds to the shift of N. californicus from palynivory to carnivory, as they change from feeding on pollen to herbivores when moving between different plant organs. This up-down movement of N. californicus is mediated by the organ-specific emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in flowers and herbivory-elicited leaves. Experiments with exogenous applications, biosynthetic inhibitors, and transient RNAi revealed that salicylic acid and jasmonic acid signaling in flowers and leaves mediates both the changes in VOC emissions and the up-down movement of N. californicus. This alternating communication between flowers and leaves mediated by organ-specific VOC emissions was also found in a cultivated variety of potato, suggesting the agronomic potential of using flowers as reservoirs of natural enemies in the control of potato pests.

AB  - The medial septum (MS) is involved in arousal-based behaviors and modulates general anesthesia response. However, the role of MS in wakefulness control remains unknown. Here, combining double fluorescence in situ hybridization and optrode recording, we showed that MS glutamatergic neurons exhibited higher activities preferentially during wakefulness. Activating these neurons, either optogenetically or chemogenetically, strongly promoted wakefulness, mainly through the transition from non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep to wakefulness. In contrast, inactivation of these neurons reduced wakefulness by the transition from wakefulness to NREM sleep. Furthermore, both rabies-mediated monosynaptic retrograde and anterograde tracing showed that MS glutamatergic neurons monosynaptically innervated lateral hypothalamus (LH) glutamatergic neurons, which were also wake-active as well as wake-promoting. Activating MS-derived glutamatergic terminals in LH enhanced wakefulness, whereas silencing MS glutamatergic neurons destabilized the wake-active preference of LH glutamatergic neurons. These results reveal a vital role of MS glutamatergic neurons in wakefulness control and depict a novel septo-hypothalamic circuit for wakefulness.

AB  - The consumption of cold-pressed oils (CPOs) has continuously increased due to their health-promoting compounds, such as polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), tocopherols, sterols, and polyphenols. This study focused on the estimation and comparison of the physicochemical properties and sensory quality of six CPOs: linseed oil (CPLO), pumpkin oil (CPPO), milk thistle oil (CPMTO), rapeseed oil (CPRO), camelina oil (CPCO), and sunflower oil (CPSO), which are the most popular in the Polish market. These oils were analysed for their fatty acid composition (FAC), their tocopherol, sterol, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs), water, and volatile matter (WVM) contents, as well as their antioxidant activity (AA) and oxidative stability parameters. Moreover, quantitative descriptive analysis (QDA) was performed to obtain detailed information on the sensory profiles and quantitative data on the CPOs' attributes that affected consumer acceptability and purchase intent. All of the analysed CPOs were rich in PUFA (27.94-68.42%). They were characterised by the different total amounts of health-beneficial compounds, such as tocopherols (TTC = 44.04-76.98 mg/100 g), sterols (TSC = 300-684 mg/100 g), and polyphenols (TPC = 2.93-8.32 mg GA/100 g). Additionally, their AA was determined using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2 & PRIME;-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) methods, with results ranging between 185.36-396.63, 958.59-1638.58, and 61.93-119.21 & mu;mol TE/100 g, respectively. However, the deterioration parameters of CPOs, such as peroxide values (PV = 0.24-4.61 meq O-2/kg), p-anisidine values (pAnV = 0.39-4.77), acid values (AV = 0.31-2.82 mg KOH/g), and impurity amounts (& sigma;4PAHs = 1.16-8.76 & mu;g/kg and WVM = 0.020-0.090%), did not exceed the level recommended by the Codex Alimentarius Commission. The obtained results indicated that all of the investigated CPOs are valuable sources of health-promoting bioactive compounds.

AB  - Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has extremely poor prognosis, with a 5-year survival rate of approximately 11 %. Yes-associated protein (YAP) is a major downstream effector of the Hippo-YAP pathway and plays a pivotal role in regulation of cell proliferation and organ regeneration and tumorigenesis. Activation of YAP signaling has been associated with PDAC progression and drug resistance. Verteporfin (VP) is a photosensitizer used for photodynamic therapy and previous work showed that it can function as a YAP inhibitor. The efficacy of VP on human cancer are being tested in several trials. In this study, we examined the effect of VP on reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation in pancreatic cancer cells, by using fluorescent molecular probes and by measuring the levels of malondialdehyde, a metabolic byproduct and marker of lipid peroxidation. We found that VP causes rapid increase of both overall ROS and lipid peroxide levels, independent of light activation. These effects were not dependent on YAP, as knockdown of YAP did not cause ROS or lipid peroxidation or enhance VP-induced ROS production. Temoporfin, another photodynamic drug, did not show similar activities. In addition, VP treatment led to loss of cell membrane integrity and reduction of viability. Notably, the activity of VP to induce lipid peroxidation was neutralized by ferroptosis inhibitors ferrostatin-1 or liproxstatin-1. VP treatment also reduced the levels of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), an enzyme that protects against lipid peroxidation. These results indicate that VP can induce lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis in the absence of light activation. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism by which VP inhibits tumor growth and provide insights into development of new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.

AB  - Vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) is the second most common form of dementia after Alzheimer's disease (AD). Currently, the mechanistic insights into the evolution and progression of VCID remain elusive. White matter change represents an invariant feature. Compelling clinical neuroimaging and pathological evidence suggest a link between white matter changes and neurodegeneration. Our prior study detected hypoperfused lesions in mice with partial deficiency of endothelial nitric oxide (eNOS) at very young age, precisely matching to those hypoperfused areas identified in preclinical AD patients. White matter tracts are particularly susceptible to the vascular damage induced by chronic hypoperfusion. Using immunohistochemistry, we detected severe demyelination in the middle-aged eNOS-deficient mice. The demyelinated areas were confined to cortical and subcortical areas including the corpus callosum and hippocampus. The intensity of demyelination correlated with behavioral deficits of gait and associative recognition memory performances. By Evans blue angiography, we detected blood-brain barrier (BBB) leakage as another early pathological change affecting frontal and parietal cortex in eNOS-deficient mice. Sodium nitrate fortified drinking water provided to young and middle-aged eNOS-deficient mice completely prevented non-perfusion, BBB leakage, and white matter pathology, indicating that impaired endothelium-derived NO signaling may have caused these pathological events. Furthermore, genome-wide transcriptomic analysis revealed altered gene clusters most related to mitochondrial respiratory pathways selectively in the white matter of young eNOS-deficient mice. Using eNOS-deficient mice, we identified BBB breakdown and hypoperfusion as the two earliest pathological events, resulting from insufficient vascular NO signaling. We speculate that the compromised BBB and mild chronic hypoperfusion trigger vascular damage, along with oxidative stress and astrogliosis, accounting for the white matter pathological changes in the eNOS-deficient mouse model. We conclude that eNOS-deficient mice represent an ideal spontaneous evolving model for studying the earliest events leading to white matter changes, which will be instrumental to future therapeutic testing of drug candidates and for targeting novel/specific vascular mechanisms contributing to VCID and AD.

AB  - Neural stem cells (NSCs) persist in the subgranular zone (SGZ) throughout the lifespan and hold immense potential for the repair and regeneration of the central nervous system, including hippocampal-related diseases. Several studies have demonstrated that cellular communication network protein 3 (CCN3) regulates multiple types of stem cells. However, the role of CCN3 in NSCs remains unknown. In this study, we identified CCN3 expression in mouse hippocampal NSCs and observed that supplementing CCN3 improved cell viability in a concentration-dependent manner. Additionally, in vivo results showed that the injection of CCN3 in the dentate gyrus (DG) increased Ki-67- and SOX2-positive cells while decreasing neuron-specific class III beta-tubulin (Tuj1) and doublecortin (DCX)-positive cells. Consistently with the in vivo results, supplementing CCN3 in the medium increased the number of BrdU and Ki-67 cells and the proliferation index but decreased the number of Tuj1 and DCX cells. Conversely, both the in vivo and in vitro knockdown of the Ccn3 gene in NSCs had opposite effects. Further investigations revealed that CCN3 promoted cleaved Notch1 (NICD) expression, leading to the suppression of PTEN expression and eventual promotion of AKT activation. In contrast, Ccn3 knockdown inhibited the activation of the Notch/PTEN/AKT pathway. Finally, the effects of changes in CCN3 protein expression on NSC proliferation and differentiation were eliminated by FLI-06 (a Notch inhibitor) and VO-OH (a PTEN inhibitor). Our findings imply that while promoting proliferation, CCN3 inhibits the neuronal differentiation of mouse hippocampal NSCs and that the Notch/PTEN/AKT pathway may be a potential intracellular target of CCN3. Our findings may help develop strategies to enhance the intrinsic potential for brain regeneration after injuries, particularly stem cell treatment for hippocampal-related diseases.

AB  - Elucidating the molecular mechanism underlying the hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis during chronic stress is critical for understanding depression and treating depression. The secretion of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) from neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus is controlled by salt-inducible kinases (SIKs) and CREB-regulated transcription co-activators (CRTCs). We hypothesised that the SIK-CRTC system in the PVN might contribute to the pathogenesis of depression. Thus, the present study employed chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) and chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) models of depression, various behavioural tests, virus-mediated gene transfer, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, western blotting, co-immunoprecipitation, quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and immunofluorescence to investigate this connection. Our results revealed that both CSDS and CUMS induced significant changes in SIK1-CRTC1 signalling in PVN neurons. Both genetic knockdown of SIK1 and genetic overexpression of CRTC1 in the PVN simulated chronic stress, producing a depression-like phenotype in naive mice, and the CRTC1-CREB-CRH pathway mediates the pro-depressant actions induced by SIK1 knockdown in the PVN. In contrast, both genetic overexpression of SIK1 and genetic knockdown of CRTC1 in the PVN protected against CSDS and CUMS, leading to antidepressant-like effects in mice. Moreover, stereotactic infusion of TAT-SIK1 into the PVN also produced beneficial effects against chronic stress. Furthermore, the SIK1-CRTC1 system in the PVN played a role in the antidepressant actions of fluoxetine, paroxetine, venlafaxine, and duloxetine. Collectively, SIK1 and CRTC1 in PVN neurons are closely involved in depression neurobiology, and they could be viable targets for novel antidepressants.

AB  - Left ventricular (LV) heart failure (HF) is a significant and increasing cause of death worldwide. HF is characterized by myocardial remodeling and excessive fibrosis. Transcriptional co-activator Yes-associated protein (Yap), the downstream effector of HIPPO signaling pathway, is an essential factor in cardiomyocyte survival; however, its status in human LV HF is not entirely elucidated. Here, we report that Yap is elevated in LV tissue of patients with HF, and is associated with down-regulation of its upstream inhibitor HIPPO component large tumor suppressor 1 (LATS1) activation as well as upregulation of the fibrosis marker connective tissue growth factor (CTGF). Applying the established profibrotic combined stress of TGF beta and hypoxia to human ventricular cardiac fibroblasts in vitro increased Yap protein levels, down-regulated LATS1 activation, increased cell proliferation and collagen I production, and decreased ribosomal protein S6 and S6 kinase phosphorylation, a hallmark of mTOR activation, without any significant effect on mTOR and raptor protein expression or phosphorylation of mTOR or 4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP1), a downstream effector of mTOR pathway. As previously reported in various cell types, TGF beta/hypoxia also enhanced cardiac fibroblast Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, which was similar to our observation in LV tissues from HF patients. Further, depletion of Yap reduced TGF beta/hypoxia-induced cardiac fibroblast proliferation and Akt phosphorylation at Ser 473 and Thr308, without any significant effect on TGF beta/hypoxia-induced ERK1/2 activation or reduction in S6 and S6 kinase activities. Taken together, these data demonstrate that Yap is a mediator that promotes human cardiac fibroblast proliferation and suggest its possible contribution to remodeling of the LV, opening the door to further studies to decipher the cell-specific roles of Yap signaling in human HF.

AB  - Hippocampal-dependent memory is known to emerge late in ontogeny, and its full development is protracted. Yet the changes in hippocampal neuronal function that underlie this delayed and gradual maturation remain relatively unexplored. To address this gap, we recorded ensembles of CA1 neurons while charting the development of hippocampal-dependent spatial working memory (WM) in rat pups ('2-4 weeks of age). We found a sharp transition in WM development, with age of inflection varying considerably between individual animals. In parallel with the sudden emergence of WM, hippocampal spatial representations became abruptly task specific, remapping between encoding and retrieval phases of the task. Further, we show how the development of task-phase remapping could partly be explained by changes in place-field size during this developmental period as well as the onset of precise temporal coordination of CA1 excitatory input. Together, these results suggest that a hallmark of hippocampal memory development may be the emergence of contextually specific CA1 representations driven by the maturation of CA1 micro-circuits.

AB  - Ischemic stroke is known to cause the accumulation of misfolded proteins and loss of calcium homeostasis, leading to impairment of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) function and activating the unfolded protein response (UPR). PARP16 is an active (ADP-ribosyl)transferase known tail-anchored ER transmembrane protein with a cytosolic catalytic domain. Here, we find PARP16 is highly expressed in ischemic cerebral hemisphere and oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R)-treated immortalized hippocampal neuronal cell HT22. Using an adeno-associated virus-mediated PARP16 knockdown approach in mice, we find PARP16 knockdown decreases infarct demarcations and has a better neurological outcome after ischemic stroke. Our data indicate PARP16 knockdown decreases ER stress and neuronal death caused by OGD/R, whereas PARP16 overexpression promotes ER stress-mediated cell damage in primary cortical neurons. Furthermore, PARP16 functions mechanistically as ADP-ribosyltransferase to modulate the level of ADP-ribosylation of the corresponding PERK and IRE1 alpha arm of the UPR, and such modifications mediate activation of PERK and IRE1 alpha. Indeed, pharmacological stimulation of the UPR using Brefeldin A partly counteracts PARP16 knockdown-mediated neuronal protection upon OGD/R treatment. In conclusion, PARP16 plays a crucial role in post-ischemic UPR and PARP16 knockdown alleviates brain injury after ischemic stroke. This study demonstrates the potential of the PARP16-PERK/IRE1 alpha axis as a target for neuronal survival in ischemic stroke.

Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) have been suggested to play a major role in liver fibrosis. However, the molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Sirtuin 6 (SIRT6), an NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase, has been previously implicated in the regulation of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta)-SMAD3 pathway that plays a significant role in liver fibrosis. In this work, we aimed to identify other important players during hepatic fibrogenesis, which are modulated by SIRT6. Yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ or WWTR1), key players in the Hippo pathway, have been implicated in the promotion of hepatic fibrosis. Our data show that HSC-specific Sirt6 knockout mice are more susceptible to high-fat-cholesterol-cholate diet-induced hepatic fibrosis than their wildtype counterparts. Our signaling analyses suggest that in addition to the TGF beta-SMAD3 pathway, YAP and TAZ are also highly activated in the SIRT6-deficient HSCs. As it is not clear how SIRT6 might regulate YAP and TAZ, we have decided to elucidate the mechanism underlying the regulation of YAP and TAZ by SIRT6 in HSCs. Overexpression or knockdown of SIRT6 corroborates the role of SIRT6 in the negative regulation of YAP and TAZ. Further biochemical analyses reveal that SIRT6 deacetylates YAP and TAZ and reprograms the composition of the TEA domain transcription factor complex to suppress their downstream target genes, particularly those involved in hepatic fibrosis. In conclusion, our data suggest that SIRT6 plays a critical role in the regulation of the Hippo pathway to protect against hepatic fibrosis.

AB  - Volatile flavor of edible oils is an important quality index and factor affecting consumer choice. The purpose of this investigation was to characterize virgin Camellia oleifera seed oil (VCO) samples from different locations in southern China in terms of their volatile compounds to show the classification of VCO with respect to geography. Different samples from 20 producing VCO regions were collected in 2020 growing season, at almost the same maturity stage, and processed under the same conditions. Headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) with a gas chromatography-mass spectrometer system (GC-MS) was used to analyze volatile compounds. A total of 348 volatiles were characterized, including aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, acids, esters, alkenes, alkanes, furans, phenols, and benzene; the relative contents ranged from 7.80-58.68%, 1.73-12.52%, 2.91-37.07%, 2.73-46.50%, 0.99-12.01%, 0.40-14.95%, 0.00-27.23%, 0.00-3.75%, 0.00-7.34%, and 0.00-1.55%, respectively. The VCO geographical origins with the largest number of volatile compounds was Xixiangtang of Guangxi (L17), and the least was Beireng of Hainan (L19). A total of 23 common and 98 unique volatile compounds were detected that reflected the basic and characteristic flavor of VCO, respectively. After PCA, heatmap and PLS-DA analysis, Longchuan of Guangdong (L8), Qingshanhu of Jiangxi (L16), and Panlong of Yunnan (L20) were in one group where the annual average temperatures are relatively low, where annual rainfalls are also low. Guangning of Guangdong (L6), Yunan of Guangdong (L7), Xingning of Guangdong (L9), Tianhe of Guangdong (L10), Xuwen of Guangdong (L11), and Xiuying of Hainan (L18) were in another group where the annual average temperatures are relatively high, and the altitudes are low. Hence, volatile compound distributions confirmed the differences among the VCO samples from these geographical areas, and the provenance difference evaluation can be carried out by flavor.

AB  - How animals use tactile sensation to detect important objects and remember their location in a world-based coordinate system is unclear. Here, we hypothesized that the retrosplenial cortex (RSC), a key network for contextual memory and spatial navigation, represents the location of objects based on tactile sensation. We studied mice palpating objects with their whiskers while navigating in a tactile virtual reality in darkness. Using two-photon Ca2+ imaging, we discovered that a population of neurons in the agranular RSC signal the location of objects. Responses to objects do not simply reflect the sensory stimulus. Instead, they are highly position, task, and context dependent and often predict the upcoming object before it is within reach. In addition, a large fraction of neurons encoding object location maintain a memory trace of the object's location. These data show that the RSC encodes the location and arrangement of tactile objects in a spatial reference frame.

AB  - Short-term memory enables incorporation of recent experience into subsequent decision-making. This pro-cessing recruits both the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, where neurons encode task cues, rules, and outcomes. However, precisely which information is carried when, and by which neurons, remains unclear. Using population decoding of activity in rat medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and dorsal hippocampal CA1, we confirm that mPFC populations lead in maintaining sample information across delays of an operant non-match to sample task, despite individual neurons firing only transiently. During sample encoding, distinct mPFC subpopulations joined distributed CA1-mPFC cell assemblies hallmarked by 4-5 Hz rhythmic modulation; CA1-mPFC assemblies re-emerged during choice episodes but were not 4-5 Hz modulated. Delay-dependent errors arose when attenuated rhythmic assembly activity heralded collapse of sustained mPFC encoding. Our results map component processes of memory-guided decisions onto heterogeneous CA1-mPFC subpopulations and the dynamics of physiologically distinct, distributed cell assemblies.

AB  - Episodic memory is the memory for experienced events. A peak competence of episodic memory is the mental combination of events to infer commonalities. Inferring commonalities may proceed with and without consciousness of events. Yet what distinguishes conscious from unconscious inference? This question inspired nine experiments that featured strongly and weakly masked cartoon clips presented for unconscious and conscious inference. Each clip featured a scene with a visually impenetrable hiding place. Five animals crossed the scene one-by-one consecutively. One animal trajectory represented one event. The animals moved through the hiding place, where they might linger or not. The participants' task was to observe the animals' entrances and exits to maintain a mental record of which animals hid simultaneously. We manipulated information load to explore capacity limits. Memory of inferences was tested immediately, 3.5 or 6 min following encoding. The participants retrieved inferences well when encoding was conscious. When encoding was unconscious, the participants needed to respond intuitively. Only habitually intuitive decision makers exhibited a significant delayed retrieval of inferences drawn unconsciously. Their unconscious retrieval performance did not drop significantly with increasing information load, while conscious retrieval performance dropped significantly. A working memory network, including hippocampus, was activated during both conscious and unconscious inference and correlated with retrieval success. An episodic retrieval network, including hippocampus, was activated during both conscious and unconscious retrieval of inferences and correlated with retrieval success. Only conscious encoding/retrieval recruited additional brain regions outside these networks. Hence, levels of consciousness influenced the memories' behavioral impact, memory capacity, and the neural representational code.

AB  - Recent reports suggest that the Hippo signaling pathway regulates testis development, though its exact roles in Sertoli cell differentiation remain unknown. Here, we examined the functions of the main Hippo pathway kinases, large tumor suppressor homolog kinases 1 and 2 (Lats1 and Lats2) in developing mouse Sertoli cells. Conditional inactivation of Lats1/2 in Sertoli cells resulted in the disorganization and overgrowth of the testis cords, the induction of a testicular inflammatory response and germ cell apoptosis. Stimulated by retinoic acid 8 (STRA8) expression in germ cells additionally suggested that germ cells may have been preparing to enter meiosis prior to their loss. Gene expression analyses of the developing testes of conditional knockout animals further suggested impaired Sertoli cell differentiation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and the induction of a specific set of genes associated with Yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ)-mediated integrin signaling. Finally, the involvement of YAP/TAZ in Sertoli cell differentiation was confirmed by concomitantly inactivating Yap/Taz in Lats1/2 conditional knockout model, which resulted in a partial rescue of the testicular phenotypic changes. Taken together, these results identify Hippo signaling as a crucial pathway for Sertoli cell development and provide novel insight into Sertoli cell fate maintenance.

AB  - Macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy) is a conserved process that promotes cellular homeostasis through the degradation of cytosolic components, also known as cargo. During autophagy, cargo is sequestered into double-membrane vesicles called autophagosomes, which are predominantly transported in the retrograde direction to the perinuclear region to fuse with lysosomes, thus ensuring cargo degradation.(1) The mechanisms regulating directional autophagosomal transport remain unclear. The ATG8 family of proteins associates with autophagosome membranes(2) and plays key roles in autophagy, including the movement of autophagosomes. This is achieved via the association of ATG8 with adaptor proteins like FYCO1, involved in the anterograde transport of autophagosomes toward the cell periphery.(1,3-5) We previously reported that phosphorylation of LC3B/ATG8 on threonine 50 (LC3B-T50) by the Hippo kinase STK4/MST1 is required for autophagy through unknown mechanisms.(6) Here, we show that STK4-mediated phosphorylation of LC3BT50 reduces the binding of FYCO1 to LC3B. In turn, impairment of LC3B-T50 phosphorylation decreases starvation-induced perinuclear positioning of autophagosomes as well as their colocalization with lysosomes. Moreover, a significantly higher number of LC3B-T50A-positive autophagosomes undergo aberrant anterograde movement to axonal tips in mammalian neurons and toward the periphery of mammalian cells. Our data support a role of a nutrient-sensitive STK4-LC3B-FYCO1 axis in the regulation of the directional transport of autophagosomes, a key step of the autophagy process, via the post-translational modification of LC3B.

AB  - The interplay between olfaction and higher cognitive processing has been documented in the adult brain; however, its development is poorly understood. In mice, shortly after birth, endogenous and stimulus-evoked activity in the olfactory bulb (OB) boosts the oscillatory entrainment of downstream lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) and hippocampus (HP). However, it is unclear whether early OB activity has a long-lasting impact on entorhinal-hippocampal function and cognitive processing. Here, we chemogenetically silenced the synaptic outputs of mitral/tufted cells, the main projection neurons in the OB, during postnatal days 8-10. The transient manipulation leads to a long-lasting reduction of oscillatory coupling and weaker responsiveness to stimuli within developing entorhinal-hippocampal circuits accompanied by dendritic sparsification of LEC pyramidal neurons. Moreover, the transient silencing reduces the performance in behavioral tests involving entorhinal-hippocampal circuits later in life. Thus, neonatal OB activity is critical for the functional LEC-HP development and maturation of cognitive abilities.

AB  - Animals need to detect threats, initiate defensive responses, and, in parallel, remember where the threat occurred to avoid the possibility of re -encountering it. By probing animals capable of detecting and avoiding a shock -related threatening location, we were able to reveal a septo-hippocampal-hypothalamic circuit that is also engaged in ethological threats, including predatory and social threats. Photometry analysis focusing on the dorsal premammillary nucleus (PMd), a critical interface of this circuit, showed that in freely tested animals, the nucleus appears ideal to work as a threat detector to sense dynamic changes under threatening conditions as the animal approaches and avoids the threatening source. We also found that PMd chemogenetic silencing impaired defensive responses by causing a failure of threat detection rather than a direct influence on any behavioral responses and, at the same time, updated fear memory to a lowthreat condition. Optogenetic silencing of the main PMd targets, namely the periaqueductal gray and anterior medial thalamus, showed that the projection to the periaqueductal gray influences both defensive responses and, to a lesser degree, contextual memory, whereas the projection to the anterior medial thalamus has a stronger influence on memory processes. Our results are important for understanding how animals deal with the threat imminence continuum, revealing a circuit that is engaged in threat detection and that, at the same time, serves to update the memory process to accommodate changes under threatening conditions.

AB  - Most new infectious diseases emerge when pathogens transfer from animals to humans.(1,2) The suspected origin of the COVID pandemic in a wildlife wet market has resurfaced debates on the role of wildlife trade as a potential source of emerging zoonotic diseases. Yet there are no studies quantitatively assessing zoonotic disease risk associated with wildlife trade. Combining data on mammal species hosting zoonotic viruses and mammals known to be in current and future wildlife trade,(6) we found that one-quarter (26.5%) of the mammals in wildlife trade harbor 75% of known zoonotic viruses, a level much higher than domesticated and non-traded mammals. The traded mammals also harbor distinct compositions of zoonotic viruses and different host reservoirs from non-traded and domesticated mammals. Furthermore, we highlight that primates, ungulates, carnivores, and bats represent significant zoonotic disease risks as they host 132 (58%) of 226 known zoonotic viruses in present wildlife trade, whereas species of bats, rodents, and marsupials represent significant zoonotic disease risks in future wildlife trade. Thus, the risk of carrying zoonotic diseases is not equal for all mammal species in wildlife trade. Overall, our findings strengthen the evidence that wildlife trade and zoonotic disease risks are strongly associated, and that mitigation measures should prioritize species with the highest risk of carrying zoonotic viruses. Curbing the sales of wildlife products and developing principles that support the sustainable and healthy trade of wildlife could be cost-effective investments given the potential risk and consequences of zoonotic outbreaks.

AB  - Recurrent connectivity between excitatory neurons and the strength of feedback from inhibitory neurons are critical determinants of the dynamics and computational properties of neuronal circuits. Toward a better un-derstanding of these circuit properties in regions CA1 and CA3 of the hippocampus, we performed optoge-netic manipulations combined with large-scale unit recordings in rats under anesthesia and in quiet waking, using photoinhibition and photoexcitation with different light-sensitive opsins. In both regions, we saw strik-ing paradoxical responses: subsets of cells increased firing during photoinhibition, while other cells decreased firing during photoexcitation. These paradoxical responses were more prominent in CA3 than in CA1, but, notably, CA1 interneurons showed increased firing in response to photoinhibition of CA3. These observations were recapitulated in simulations where we modeled both CA1 and CA3 as inhibition-stabilized networks in which strong recurrent excitation is balanced by feedback inhibition. To directly test the inhibi-tion-stabilized model, we performed large-scale photoinhibition directed at (GAD-Cre) inhibitory cells and found that interneurons in both regions increased firing when photoinhibited, as predicted. Our results highlight the often-paradoxical circuit dynamics that are evidenced during optogenetic manipulations and indicate that, contrary to long-standing dogma, both CA1 and CA3 hippocampal regions display strongly recurrent excitation, which is stabilized through inhibition.

AB  - Episodic-like memory in non-human animals represents the behavioral characteristics of human episodic memory-the ability to mentally travel backward in time to "re-live"past experiences. A focus on traditional model species of episodic-like memory may overlook taxa possessing this cognitive ability and consequently its evolution across species. Experiments conducted in the wild have the potential to broaden the scope of episodic-like memory research under the natural conditions in which they evolved. We combine two distinct yet complementary episodic-like memory tasks (the what-where-when memory and incidental encoding paradigms), each targeting a different aspect of human episodic memory, namely the content (what-where- when) and process (incidental encoding), to comprehensively test the memory abilities of wild, free-living, non-caching blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) and great tits (Parus major). Automated feeders with custom-built programs allowed for experimental manipulation of spatiotemporal experiences on an individual-level basis. In the what-where-when memory experiment, after learning individualized temporal feeder rules, the birds demonstrated their ability to recall the "what"(food type), "where"(feeder location), and "when"(time since their initial visit of the day) of previous foraging experiences. In the incidental encoding experiment, the birds showed that they were able to encode and recall incidental spatial information regarding previous foraging experiences ("where"test), and juveniles, but not adults, were also able to recall incidentally encoded visual information ("which"test). Consequently, this study presents multiple lines of converging evidence for episodic-like memory in a wild population of generalist foragers, suggesting that episodic-like memory may be more taxonomically widespread than previously assumed.

AB  - Current studies indicate that pathological modifications of tau are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, synaptic failure, and cognitive decline in neurological disorders and aging. We previously showed that caspase-3 cleaved tau, a relevant tau form in Alzheimer's disease (AD), affects mitochondrial bioenergetics, dynamics and synaptic plasticity by the opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP). Also, genetic ablation of tau promotes mitochondrial function boost and increased cognitive capacities in aging mice. However, the mechanisms and relevance of these alterations for the cognitive and mitochondrial abnormalities during aging, which is the primary risk factor for AD, has not been explored. Therefore, in this study we used aging C57BL/6 mice (2-15 and 28-month-old) to evaluate hippocampus-dependent cognitive performance and mitochondrial function. Behavioral tests revealed that aged mice (15 and 28-month-old) showed a reduced cognitive performance compared to young mice (2 month). Concomitantly, isolated hippocampal mitochondria of aged mice showed a significant decrease in bioenergetic-related functions including increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial depolarization, ATP decreases, and calcium handling defects. Importantly, full-length and caspase-3 cleaved tau were preferentially present in mitochondrial fractions of 15 and 28-month-old mice. Also, aged mice (15 and 28-month-old) showed an increase in cyclophilin D (CypD), the principal regulator of mPTP opening, and a decrease in Opa-1 mitochondrial localization, indicating a possible defect in mitochondrial dynamics. Importantly, we corroborated these findings in immortalized cortical neurons expressing mitochondrial targeted full-length (GFP-T4-OMP25) and caspase-3 cleaved tau (GFP-T4C3-OMP25) which resulted in increased ROS levels and mitochondrial fragmentation, along with a decrease in Opa-1 protein expression. These results suggest that tau associates with mitochondria and this binding increases during aging. This connection may contribute to defects in mitochondrial bioenergetics and dynamics which later may conduce to cognitive decline present during aging.

AB  - The wide array of cognitive functions associated with the hippocampus is supported through interactions with the cerebral cortex. However, most of the direct cortical input to the hippocampus originates in the entorhinal cortex, forming the hippocampal-entorhinal system. In humans, the role of the entorhinal cortex in mediating hippocampal-cortical interactions remains unknown. In this study, we used precision neuroimaging to examine the distributed cortical anatomy associated with the human hippocampal-entorhinal system. Consistent with animal anatomy, our results associate different subregions of the entorhinal cortex with different parts of the hippocampus long axis. Furthermore, we find that the entorhinal cortex comprises three band-like zones that are associated with functionally distinct cortical networks. Importantly, the entorhinal cortex bands traverse the proposed human homologs of rodent lateral and medial entorhinal cortices. Finally, we show that the entorhinal cortex is a major convergence area of distributed cortical processing and that the topography of cortical networks associated with the anterior medial temporal lobe mirrors the macroscale structure of high-order cortical processing.

AB  - Here, we describe a polymorphic population of Aquilegia coerulea with a naturally occurring floral homeotic mutant, A. coerulea var. daileyae, where the characteristic petals with nectar spurs are replaced with a second set of sepals. Although it would be expected that this loss of pollinator reward would be disadvantageous to the mutant, we find that it has reached relatively high frequency (-25%) and is under strong, positive selection across multiple seasons (s = 0.17-0.3) primarily due to reduced floral herbivory. We identify the underlying locus (APETALA3-3) and multiple causal loss-of-function mutations indicating an ongoing soft sweep. Elevated linkage disequilibrium around the two most common causal alleles indicates that positive selection has been occurring for many generations. Lastly, genotypic frequencies at AqAP3-3 indicate a degree of positive assortative mating by morphology. Together, these data provide both a compelling example that large-scale discontinuous morphological changes differentiating taxa can occur due to single mutations and a particularly clear example of linking genotype, phenotype, and fitness.

AB  - We previously described that excessive consumption of sucrose during youth produces fear memory and anxiety-like behavior in adulthood. Here, we evaluated whether high cognitive function is also affected by studying early sucrose consumption in object recognition memory (NOR). Male Sprague Dawley rats were tested for short-term, long-term, and consolidated NOR after 25 days of unlimited sucrose access in juvenile (PD 25-50) or adult age (PD 75-100). All rats spent equal time exploring the two objects during the sample phase T1. When animals were exposed for 2,24 h or 7 days later to a copy of the objects presented in T1 and a novel object, the sucrose-exposed juvenile group failed to distinguish between the familiar and the novel objects in contrast with the rest of the groups. Sucrose-exposed animals developed hypertriglyceridemia and glucose intolerance, but juvenile animals showed increased fasting glycemia and sustained the glucose intolerance longer. Moreover, sucrose decreased hippocampal proBDNF expression in juveniles while it was increased in adults, and sucrose also increased RAGE expression in adults. The NOR exploration ratio correlated negatively with basal glycemia and positively with proBDNF. Taken together, these data suggest that sucrose-induced alterations in glucose metabolism may contribute to a long-term decline in proBDNF and impaired recognition memory.

AB  - Computational models and in vivo studies in rodents suggest that the emergence of gamma activity (40-140 Hz) during memory encoding and retrieval is coupled to opposed-phase states of the underlying hip-pocampal theta rhythm (4-9 Hz).1-10 However, direct evidence for whether human hippocampal gamma -modulated oscillatory activity in memory processes is coupled to opposed-phase states of the ongoing theta rhythm remains elusive. Here, we recorded local field potentials (LFPs) directly from the hippocampus of 10 patients with epilepsy, using depth electrodes. We used a memory encoding and retrieval task whereby trial unique sequences of pictures depicting real-life episodes were presented, and 24 h later, participants were asked to recall them upon the appearance of the first picture of the encoded episodic sequence. We found theta-to-gamma cross-frequency coupling that was specific to the hippocampus during both the encoding and retrieval of episodic memories. We also revealed that gamma was coupled to opposing theta phases during both encoding and recall processes. Additionally, we observed that the degree of theta-gamma phase opposition between encoding and recall was associated with participants' memory per-formance, so gamma power was modulated by theta phase for both remembered and forgotten trials, although only for remembered trials the dominant theta phase was different for encoding and recall trials. The current results offer direct empirical evidence in support of hippocampal theta-gamma phase opposition models in human long-term memory and provide fundamental insights into mechanistic predictions derived from computational and animal work, thereby contributing to establishing similarities and differences across species.

AB  - Microtubules (MTs) in the axon are nearly all oriented with plus-end-out, and this pattern of organization is important for regulating the morphology and cytoplasmic composition of the axon, and for defining the cargoes transported in the anterograde and retrograde directions in the axon. Over the past several years, studies on vertebrate neurons (and also insect neurons) have been conducted by many investigators to understand the mechanisms that establish this pattern and maintain it over the life of the neuron and in the face of potential corruption. Studies on cultured rat sympathetic neurons from superior cervical ganglia (and also insect neurons) have implicated sliding of MTs by cytoplasmic dynein as crucial not only for establishing the plus-end-out orientation of axonal MTs but also for clearing mal-oriented MTs from the axon. Studies on cultured rat hippocampal neurons have implicated TRIM46 and augmin, proteins that regulate the crosslinking and nucleation of MTs, respectively. Here we show that the axons of hippocampal neurons also require dynein-based mechanisms for regulating their MT polarity pattern; however, the axons of sympathetic neurons do not require either TRIM46 or augmin. We also show that, in hippocampal neurons but not sympathetic neurons, the axon's MT polarity pattern is corrupted when a portion of the available Kinesin-1 is pharmacologically shifted from organelle transport to MT sliding. Collectively these results indicate that the mechanisms that regulate the MT polarity pattern of the axon are not entirely the same for different kinds of neurons, even in the same animal.

AB  - Mitochondrial form and function are regulated by the opposing forces of mitochondrial dynamics: fission and fusion. Mitochondrial dynamics are highly active and consequential during neuronal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Mitochondrial fusion is executed at the mitochondrial inner membrane by Opa1. The balance of long (L-Opa1) and proteolytically cleaved short (S-Opa1) isoforms is critical for efficient fusion. Oma1 is the predominant stress-responsive protease for Opa1 processing. In neuronal cell models, we assessed Oma1 and Opa1 regulation during mitochondrial stress. In an immortalized mouse hippocampal neuron line (HT22), Oma1 was sensitive to mitochondrial membrane potential depolarization (rotenone, FCCP) and hyperpolarization (oligomycin). Further, oxidative stress was sufficient to increase Oma1 activity and necessary for depolarization-induced proteolysis. We generated Oma1 knockout (KO) HT22 cells that displayed normal mitochondrial morphology and fusion capabilities. FCCP-induced mitochondrial fragmentation was exacerbated in Oma1 KO cells. However, Oma1 KO cells were better equipped to perform restorative fusion after fragmentation, presumably due to preserved L-Opa1. We extended our investigations to a combinatorial stress of neuronal oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R), where we found that Opa1 processing and Oma1 activation were initiated during OGD in an ROS-dependent manner. These findings highlight a novel dependence of Oma1 on oxidative stress in response to depolarization. Further, we demonstrate contrasting fission/fusion roles for Oma1 in the acute response and recovery stages of mitochondrial stress. Collectively, our results add intersectionality and nuance to the previously proposed models of Oma1 activity.
   The mitochondrial inner membrane protease Oma1 acts to proteolytically cleave the inner membrane fusion protein Opa1 from long (L-Opa1) to short (S-Opa1) isoforms, with downstream consequences on mitochondrial dynamics. Oma1 is activated by depolarization and hyperpolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta Psi). This activation is demonstrated to be dependent on the production of reactive oxygen species during depolarization and neuron ischemia/reperfusion injury (I/R).image

AB  - The mammalian entorhinal cortex routes inputs from diverse sources into the hippocampus. This information is mixed and expressed in the activity of many specialized entorhinal cell types, which are considered indispensable for hippocampal function. However, functionally similar hippocampi exist even in non-mammals that lack an obvious entorhinal cortex or, generally, any layered cortex. To address this dilemma, we mapped extrinsic hippocampal connections in chickadees, whose hippocampi are used for remembering numerous food caches. We found a well-delineated structure in these birds that is topologically similar to the entorhinal cortex and interfaces between the hippocampus and other pallial regions. Recordings of this structure revealed entorhinal-like activity, including border and multi-field grid-like cells. These cells were localized to the subregion predicted by anatomical mapping to match the dorsomedial entorhinal cortex. Our findings uncover an anatomical and physiological equivalence of vastly different brains, suggesting a fundamental nature of entorhinal-like computations for hippocampal function.

AB  - Two new triterpenoid saponins, namely camsinsaponins A and B (1, 2), along with two known congeners (3, 4) were isolated from Camellia sinensis flowers. Their structures were determined by extensive spectroscopic data. All compounds were assessed for antifungal bioactivity against Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, and Candida tropicalis. Compounds 1-4 showed excellent inhibitory effects. Notably, in regard to compounds 1 and 2, their MIC values against C. albicans were close to those of the positive control, fluconazole. Furthermore, the inhibitory elements of compounds 1-4 on C. glabrata were better than those of fluconazole. The aforementioned findings offer valuable insights for future development of novel therapeutic strategies against drug-resistant infections.

AB  - Visual plasticity declines sharply after the critical period, yet we easily learn to recognize new faces and places, even as adults. Such learning is often characterized by a "moment of insight,'' an abrupt and dramatic improvement in recognition. The mechanisms that support abrupt learning are unknown, but one hypothesis is that they involve changes in synchronization between brain regions. To test this hypothesis, we used a behavioral task in which non-human primates rapidly learned to recognize novel images and to associate them with specific responses. Simultaneous recordings from inferotemporal and prefrontal cortices revealed a transient synchronization of neural activity between these areas that peaked around the moment of insight. Synchronization was strongest between inferotemporal sites that encoded images and reward-sensitive prefrontal sites. Moreover, its magnitude intensified gradually over image exposures, suggesting that abrupt learning is the culmination of a search for informative signals within a circuit linking sensory information to task demands.

AB  - The downregulation of glutathione peroxidase-1 (GPx1) plays a role in clasmatodendrosis (an autophagic astroglial death) in the hippocampus of chronic epilepsy rats. Furthermore, N-acetylcysteine (NAC, a GSH precursor) restores GPx1 expression in clasmatodendritic astrocytes and alleviates this autophagic astroglial death, independent of nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) activity. However, the regulatory signal pathways of these phenomena have not been fully explored. In the present study, NAC attenuated clasmatodendrosis by alleviating GPx1 downregulation, casein kinase 2 (CK2)-mediated nuclear factor-?B (NF-?B) serine (S) 529 and AKT-mediated NF-?B S536 phosphorylations. 2-[4,5,6,7-Tetrabromo-2-(dimethylamino)-1H-benzo[d]imidazole-1-yl]acetic acid (TMCB; a selective CK2 inhibitor) relieved clasmatodendritic degeneration and GPx1 downregulation concomitant with the decreased NF-?B S529 and AKT S473 phosphorylations. In contrast, AKT inhibition by 3-chloroacetyl-indole (3CAI) ameliorated clasmatodendrosis and NF-?B S536 phosphorylation, while it did not affect GPx1 downregulation and CK2 tyrosine (Y) 255 and NF-?B S529 phosphorylations. Therefore, these findings suggest that seizure-induced oxidative stress may diminish GPx1 expression by increasing CK2-mediated NF-?B S529 phosphorylation, which would subsequently enhance AKT-mediated NF-?B S536 phosphorylation leading to autophagic astroglial degeneration.

AB  - Mood disorders are more prevalent and often reported to be more severe in women; however, little is known about the underlying mechanisms of this sexual prevalence. To gain insight into the functional differences in female brains in response to stress, we systemically compared brain activation in male and female C57BL/6N mice after acute stress exposure. We measured c-Fos expression levels in 18 brain areas related to stress responses after a 3-h long restraint stress and found that activation was sexually dimorphic in several brain areas, including the nucleus accumbens, ventral tegmental area, nucleus reuniens, and medial part of the lateral habenula. Moreover, stress-activated a substantial number of cells in the medial prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and lateral part of the lateral habenula; however, the levels of activation were comparable in males and females, suggesting that the core stress responding machineries are largely shared. Pearson correlation analysis revealed several interesting connections between the analyzed areas that are implicated in stress responses and depression. Overall, stress strengthened intra-circuitries in the hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex in female mice, whereas more longer-range connections were highlighted in stressed male mice. Our study provides a highly valuable neuroanatomical framework for investigating the circuit mechanism underlying the higher vulnerability to depression in women.

AB  - Simple Summary The antioxidant, antimicrobial, and immunomodulatory activities of the Cleome droserifolia (Forssk.) Del. (Cd) shrub were investigated considering the biological activity of its phytogenic compounds. Cd shrub encompasses several phenolic compounds, mainly phenolic acids, such as benzoic acid. The methanolic extract of Cd exhibited strong in vitro antioxidant and antimicrobial activities. Anin vivo study using rabbits as an animal model confirmed the ability of a powder of Cd aerial parts to improve humoral and innate immunity, as well as gastrointestinal microbiota homeostasis. In conclusion, Cd shrub represents a novel source of secondary active metabolites that can be employed as antibiotic alternative in the livestock production field and/or in human pharmaceutical applications. This study aimed to investigate the antioxidant, antimicrobial, and immunomodulatory activities of a Cleome droserifolia (Forssk.) Del. (Cd) shoot methanolic extracts considering the biological activity of its phytogenic compounds. For this purpose, the Cd phenolic compounds were detected, and an in vitro evaluation of the antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of the Cd extract was performed. For a biological evaluation, 30 v-line rabbits were randomly distributed into three groups with treatments including: a basal diet without Cd shoots powder supplement (C group) or supplemented with 1.25- (Cdl group) or 2.5 (Cdh group)-mg Cd/kg dry matter (DM). The Cd extract showed a linear scavenging activity for 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl and 2,2 '-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid), with the maximal activity observed at a concentration of 1 mg/mL. A total of 16 phenolic compounds were identified by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) in the Cd methanolic extract, among which benzoic acid, rutin, ellagic acid, naringenin, and o-coumaric acid were the major compounds. The methanolic extract of Cd showed inhibitory actions against microbial pathogen species. The in vivo study showed that the two concentrations of Cd significantly improved the redox status of the blood plasma and lysozyme activity. Treatment with Cdh significantly decreased the levels of interleukin-beta 1 in the blood plasma compared with the control. Moreover, the two concentrations of Cd significantly increased the counts of intestinal and cecal yeast and Lactobacillus species and decreased the Salmonella and Coliform species compared with the control. The aerial parts of the Cd shrub had strong antioxidant, antimicrobial, and immunomodulatory activities, which can improve the overall health status and seem to be related to its impressive range of biologically active phenolic compounds.

AB  - Neuroinflammation is a key factor in age-related cognitive decline and memory impairment. UAS03, a potent synthetic analogue of Urolithin-A, has demonstrated anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. This investigation examined the neuroprotective effect of UAS03 on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced neuroinflammation, and its associated cognitive impairments, memory deficits, and depression-like behaviors. Intracerebroventricular administration of LPS (12 mu g/kg) was performed to induce neuroinflammation in mice, followed by a 7 day treatment with UAS03 at 10 and 30 mg/kg doses. Mice were evaluated for depressive and anxiety-like behavior, spatial memory, and learning functions using a series of neurobehavioral test paradigms. Histopathological and molecular analyses were conducted using hematoxylin-eosin and cresyl violet staining, immunohistochemistry, ELISA, and Western blotting techniques. We have found that, UAS03 significantly enhanced cognitive and memory functions impaired by LPS while concurrently reducing depressive symptoms. Furthermore, the compound attenuated neuronal damage and decreased the expression of IBA-1 and GFAP in hippocampal region. Through the activation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathway, UAS03 effectively mitigated markers of oxidative stress and reduced levels of pro-inflammatory factors, including IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, and COX-2. Cumulatively, this study provides compelling evidence that UAS03 exerts neuroprotective effects by regulating essential pathways involved in anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective mechanisms, suggesting its potential as a preventative measure against age-related cognitive decline and memory impairments associated with neuroinflammation.

AB  - : Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common devastating neurodegenerative disorder. Presently used therapies for PD have severe side effects and are limited to only temporary improvement. Therefore, a new therapeutic approach to treat PD urgently needs to be developed. alpha-Lactalbumin, the most abundant milk protein in camel milk, has been attributed to various medicinal properties. This study intended to investigate the neuroprotective efficacy of the camel alpha-lactalbumin and oleic acid (CLOA) complex. One mechanism postulated to underlie neuroprotection by the CLOA complex is the induction of silent information regulatory protein (SIRT1). SIRT1 is known to be involved in several pathological and physiological processes, and it has been suggested that SIRT1 plays a protective role in PD. Oxidative stress, inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptosis are involved in PD pathogenesis. Our results revealed that SIRT1 inhibits oxidative stress by maintaining HIF-1 alpha in a deacetylated state. SIRT1 upregulates the expression of FOXO3a and HSF-1, thus inhibiting apoptosis and maintaining the homeostasis of cellular proteins. Increased SIRT1 expression reduces the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-8, which in turn inhibits neuroinflammation. In addition to SIRT1, the CLOA complex also enhances the expression of survivin and leptin and promotes the survival of neuroblastoma cells. Altogether, our results suggest that the CLOA complex might be a novel therapeutic molecule that could ameliorate neuronal cell damage in PD

AB  - The hippocampus and neocortex are theorized to be crucial partners in the formation of long-term memories. Here, we assess hippocampal involvement in two related forms of experience-dependent plasticity in the primary visual cortex (V1) of mice. Like control animals, those with hippocampal lesions exhibit potentiation of visually evoked potentials after passive daily exposure to a phase-reversing oriented grating stimulus, which is accompanied by long-term habituation of a reflexive behavioral response. Thus, low-level recognition memory is formed independently of the hippocampus. However, response potentiation resulting from daily exposure to a fixed sequence of four oriented gratings is severely impaired in mice with hippocampal damage. A feature of sequence plasticity in V1 of controls, which is absent in lesioned mice, is the generation of predictive responses to an anticipated stimulus element when it is withheld or delayed. Thus, the hippocampus is involved in encoding temporally structured experience, even within the primary sensory cortex.

AB  - Unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) visualization is valuable for early bilirubin encephalopathy (BE) diagnosis and management. UCB neurotoxicity is a challenge, necessitating improved imaging modalities for precise localization and characterization. This study developed a noninvasive method for UCB imaging in the brain using chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) magnetic resonance imaging, which visualizes UCB distribution through amide-bulk water proton exchange, a process termed bilirubin CEST (Bil-CEST) imaging. Bil-CEST imaging parameters were initially optimized; the exchange rate of the amide protons of UCB was calculated. Bil-CEST imaging characteristics and specificity were assessed using in vitro images of UCB solutions under different conditions and images of other brain metabolites. Bil-CEST maps of the rat brain were collected at the baseline and dynamically, postinjection of the UCB solution or vehicle into lateral ventricles of Sprague-Dawley rats. The model was validated using a water maze and pathological staining. In vitro, the Bil-CEST effect was observed at approximately 5.5 ppm downfield from bulk water. This effect was proportional to the UCB concentration and B1 amplitude. In vivo, Bil-CEST imaging revealed a progressive enhancement following a lateral ventricular UCB injection. Conversely, no significant imaging changes were observed in the vehicle group. Compared with the vehicle group, the UCB group had more hippocampal neuronal apoptosis and worse cognitive function. These findings highlight the utility of Bil-CEST in direct UCB imaging, indicating its potential as a clinically valuable biomarker for BE diagnosis and management.

AB  - Amyloid-beta (A beta) aggregation is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), characterized by cognitive impairment, and there remains a lack of effective functional compound with A beta clearance activity. To elucidate the effect of exopolysaccharide (EPS) extracted from Agaricus sinodeliciosus var. Chaidam on A beta 1-42- induced AD rat and uncover the underlying mechanism, the neuroprotective activity of EPS was evaluated using immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, western blot, RT-qPCR, microbiomics and metabolomics. The results demonstrated that EPS exhibited significant anti-AD efficacy, as evidenced by improved cognitive function and spatial memory, balanced brain redox status, suppressed neuroinflammatory responses. EPS substantially reduced A beta 1-42 accumulation in the hippocampus by activating A beta-phagocytic microglia through the mTOR-HIF-1 alpha pathway. Importantly, EPS reconstructed gut microbiota composition by increasing the relative abundance of Ruminococcaceae and reduced Erysipelotrichaceae. The reshaped gut microbiome and the formation of the metabolite serotonin were associated with behavioral alterations, neuroinflammation, and brain oxidative status. Thus, EPS significantly alleviated cognitive deficit and neuroinflammation in A beta 1-42-induced AD rats, potentially by enhancing microglial phagocytosis of A beta 1-42 and modulating the gut microbiome and serotonin production. Collectively, EPS from A. sinodeliciosus var. Chaidam polysaccharide may serve as a novel A beta 1-42-targeted approach for anti-AD therapy.

AB  - Cadmium (Cd) produces cognition decline following single and repeated treatment, although the complete mechanisms are still unrevealed. Basal forebrain (BF) cholinergic neurons innervate the cortex and hippocampus, regulating cognition. Cd single and repeated exposure induced BF cholinergic neuronal loss, partly through thyroid hormones (THs) disruption, which may cause the cognition decline observed following Cd exposure. However, the mechanisms through which THs disruption mediate this effect remain unknown. To research the possible mechanisms through which Cd-induced THs deficiency may mediate BF neurodegeneration, Wistar male rats were treated with Cd for 1-(1 mg/kg) or 28-days (0.1 mg/kg) with or without triiodothyronine (T3, 40 mu g/ kg/day). Cd exposure promoted neurodegeneration, spongiosis, gliosis and several mechanisms related to these alterations (increased H202, malondialdehyde, TNF-alpha, IL-10, IL-6, BACE1, A0 and phosphorylated-Tau levels, and decreased phosphorylated-AKT and phosphorylated-GSK-30 levels). T3 supplementation partially reversed the effects observed. Our results show that Cd induces several mechanisms that may be responsible for the neuro-degeneration, spongiosis and gliosis observed in the rats' BF, which are partially mediated by a reduction in THs levels. These data may help to explain the mechanisms through which Cd induces BF neurodegeneration, possibly leading to the cognitive decline observed, providing new therapeutic tools to prevent and treat these damages.

AB  - This study aimed to examine the protective effects of catalpa on ultrastructure of hippocampal neuron and limb motor function in rats with cerebral ischemia. 90 healthy Sprague-Dawley male rats were randomly divided into control (n = 30) and model (n = 60) groups. Cerebral ischemia and hippocampal neurons were induced by occluding the internal carotid artery and injection of high blood glucose, respectively. Model rats were randomly divided into routine (n = 30) and observational (n = 30) groups. Animals in the routine group received edaravone injection (7 mg/kg/day) for 14 days, while rats in the observation group were treated with catalpol (30 mg/kg/day) for 14 days. Limb motor function score, fine motion execution capability, number of hippocampal neurons retained, and the ultrastructure of hippocampal nerve cells were considered at 3, 7, and 14 days after treatments. A significant difference was observed in the mean scores of limb motor function, fine motor execution ability, and the number of hippocampal neurons retained between groups (p < 0.001). Repetitive treatments with catalpol significantly improved the mean number of hippocampal neurons retained (p < 0.01), limb motor function (p < 0.001), and fine motor execution ability scores (p < 0.01) at 3, 7, and 14 days compared to edaravone. Catalpol treatments also improved the ultrastructure morphology of neuronal cells. Catalpa can effectively improve limb motor function and protect hippocampal neuron function in rats with cerebral ischemia.

AB  - BackgroundTherapy in the latent period is favorable for retarding the process of epileptogenesis. Recently, we have discovered that the activated sigma-1 receptor (Sig-1R) attenuates the hippocampus pathological injury and memory impairment in the latent period of epileptogenesis. But the molecular mechanism needs further investigation. MethodsPRE-084 was utilized as a research tool to highly selectively activate Sig-1R in epileptic mice. After the treatment of PRE-084, the pro-inflammatory cytokines, neuropathological traits, and the level of mitochondrial translocator assembly and maintenance 41 homolog (TAMM41) in the hippocampus were examined. The mode in which the Sig-1R interacts with TAMM41 was explored. The role of TAMM41 in the protecting effect of PRE-084 was established. ResultsPRE-084 inhibited the growth of pro-inflammatory cytokines, reduced the formation of gliosis, alleviated neuronal damage in the hippocampus, and attenuated memory impairment in the latent period of epileptogenesis. The protein level of TAMM41 decreased in the hippocampi of epileptic mice and increased in the PRE-084-treated mice. The Sig-1R bound with TAMM41 directly, maintaining the stability of TAMM41. Knockdown of TAMM41 reversed the protective effect of PRE-084, and overexpression of TAMM41 exhibited a similar protective action to that of PRE-084. ConclusionWe presented the concept of the "sigma-1 receptor-TAMM41 axis" and proposed that augmenting this axis can attenuate neuroinflammation and memory impairment in the process of epileptogenesis.

AB  - Several studies indicated that autophagy activation participates in brain ischemic tolerance (BIT) induced by cerebral ischemic preconditioning (CIP). However, the mechanism of autophagy activation during the process still remains unclear. The present study aimed to evaluate the role of p38 MAPK-peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) signaling cascade in autophagy during the CIP-induced BIT. The results shown that, initially, autophagy activation was observed after CIP in the model of global cerebral ischemia in rats, as was indicated by the upregulation of Beclin 1 expression, an increase in LC3-II/LC3-I ratio, the enhanced LC3 immunofluorescence, and a rise in the number of autophagosomes in the neurons of the hippocampal CA1 area. Besides, the inhibitor of autophagy 3-methyladenine obliterated the neuroprotection induced by CIP. Furthermore, the upregulation of p-p38 MAPK and PPAR gamma expressions was earlier than autophagy activation after CIP. In addition, pretreatment with SB203580 (the inhibitor of p38 MAPK) reversed CIP-induced PPAR gamma upregulation, autophagy activation, and neuroprotection. Pretreatment with GW9662 (the inhibitor of PPAR gamma) reversed autophagy activation and neuroprotection, while it had no effect on p-p38 MAPK upregulation induced by CIP. These data suggested that the p38 MAPK-PPAR gamma signaling pathway participates in autophagy activation during the induction of BIT by CIP.

AB  - This study has explored the potential of plant-derived oil bodies (OBs)-based oleogels as novel drug delivery systems for in vitro release under simulated physiological conditions. To obtain stable OBs-based oleogels, gum arabic (GA) and chitosan (CH) were coated onto the curcumin-loaded OBs using an electrostatic deposition technique, followed by 2,3,4-trihydroxybenzaldehyde (TB) induced Schiff-base cross-linking. Microstructural analyses indicated successful encapsulation of curcumin into the hydrophobic domain of the OBs through a pHdriven method combined with ultrasound treatment. The curcumin encapsulation efficiency of OBs increased up to 83.65 % and 92.18 % when GA and GA-CH coatings were applied, respectively, compared to uncoated OBs (63.47 %). In addition, GA-CH coatings retained the structural integrity of oleogel droplets with superior oilholding capacity (99.07 %), while TB addition induced interconnected 3D-network structures with excellent gel strength (>= 4.8 x 105 Pa) and thermal stability (>= 80 degrees C). GA-CH coated oleogels appeared to provide the best protection for loaded bioactive against UV irradiation and high temperature-induced degradation during longterm storage. The combination of biopolymer coatings and TB-induced Schiff-base cross-linking synergistically hindered the simulated gastric degradability of oleogels, releasing only 23.35 %, 12.46 % and 7.19 % of curcumin by GA, GA-CH and GA-CH-TB stabilized oleogels, respectively, while also resulting in sustained release effects during intestinal conditions.

AB  - Erythroid differentiation regulator 1 (Erdr1) is a cytokine known to play important roles in cell survival under stressful conditions, maintenance of cellular growth homeostasis, and activation of the immune system. However, the impact of Erdr1 on neurons remains undefined. In this study, we present novel evidence that Erdr1 plays a role in regulating glutathione (GSH) synthesis via glutamate transporter-associated protein 3-18 (GTRAP3-18), an anchor protein in the endoplasmic reticulum that holds excitatory amino acid carrier 1 (EAAC1) in neurons. Both DNA microarray and quantitative real-time PCR analyses revealed an approximately 2-fold increase in Erdr1 levels in the hippocampus of GTRAP3-18-deficient mice compared to those of wild-type mice. Knockdown of Erdr1 in vitro resulted in a decrease in GTRAP3-18 levels, leading to an increase in EAAC1 expression and intracellular GSH levels, and subsequently, cytoprotective effects against oxidative stress. Our findings shed light on the regulatory mechanisms involving Erdr1, GTRAP3-18, EAAC1, and GSH in the context of neuronal defense against oxidative stress. Understanding the intricate interplay among these molecules may pave the way for the development of promising therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative disorders.

   This study aimed to investigate the influence of using 1% or 2% Citrox alone or in combination with 1% chitosan on the survival of Campylobacter jejuni in camel meat slices vacuum-packed and stored at 4 or 10 degrees C for 30 days. The shelf life of camel meat was 30 days longer using 1% or 2% Citrox in combination with 1% chitosan than when using Citrox alone. The reductions ranged from 4.0 to 3.5 logarithmic cycles during the storage period at both 4 and 10 degrees C. The quality of camel meat treated with Citrox plus chitosan was also better than that of the control meat and of meat treated with 0.85% NaCl.
   Camel meat is one of the most consumed meats in Arab countries. The use of natural antimicrobial agents to extend the shelf life of fresh camel meat, control Campylobacter jejuni contamination, and preserve meat quality is preferred. In this study, we determined the antimicrobial effects of using 1% or 2% Citrox alone or in combination with 1% chitosan on the survival of C. jejuni in vitro and on camel meat samples during storage at 4 or 10 degrees C for 30 days in vacuum packaging. We determined the total viable count (TVC (cfu/g)), total volatile base nitrogen (TVB-N) content, and pH of the treated camel meat samples every three days during storage. The shelf lives of camel meat samples treated with 2% Citrox alone or in combination with 1% chitosan were longer than those of camel meat samples treated with 1% Citrox alone or in combination with 1% chitosan at both the 4 and 10 degrees C storage temperatures, with TVCs of <100 cfu/g after the first ten days and six days of storage at 4 and 10 degrees C, respectively. The addition of Citrox (1% and 2%) and 1% chitosan to camel meat samples and the application of vacuum storage were more effective than using Citrox (1% and 2%) alone and led to a reduction in C. jejuni in approximately 4.0 and 3.5 log cycles at 4 and 10 degrees C, respectively. The experimental results demonstrated that using a Citrox-chitosan combination improved the quality of camel meat and enhanced the long-term preservation of fresh meat for up to or more than 30 days at 4 degrees C.

AB  - Lactoferrin is a multifunctional glycoprotein present in mammalian milk. It possesses antimicrobial, antioxidant, immunomodulatory, and several biological functions. Owing to the current trend of increasing antibiotic resistance, our study was designed to purify lactoferrin from camel milk colostrum using cation exchange chromatography on the SP-Sepharose high-performance column. The purity and molecular weight of lactoferrin were checked by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The chromatogram of the purification procedure illustrated a single peak corresponding to lactoferrin, while the SDS-PAGE revealed 78 kDa molecular weight protein. Furthermore, lactoferrin protein and its hydrolysate form were assessed for its antimicrobial potential. The highest inhibitory effect of whole lactoferrin at the concentration (4 mg/ml) was observed against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and S. aureus, while 10 mg/ml concentration was effective against K. pneumonia, and 27 mg/ml was potent against multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria, P. aeruginosa. Likewise, MRSA was more sensitive toward iron-free lactoferrin (2 mg/ml) and hydrolyzed lactoferrin (6 mg/ml). The tested lactoferrin forms showed variability in minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) among tested bacteria. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis images revealed distortions of the bacterial cells exposed to lactoferrin. The antibiofilm effect differed depending on the concentration and the type of the bacteria; biofilm inhibition ranged from 12.5 to 91.3% in the tested pathogenic bacteria. Moreover, the anticancer activity of lactoferrin forms exhibited a dose-dependent cytotoxicity against human lung cancer cell line (A549).

AB  - The role of hippocampal monoamines and their related genes in the etiology and pathogenesis of depression-like behavior, particularly in impaired sociability traits and the meaning of changes in USVs emitted by pups, remains unknown. We assessed the effects of prenatal administration of S-adenosyl-methionine (SAMe) in Sub mice that exhibit depressive-like behavior on serotonergic, dopaminergic and noradrenergic metabolism and the activity of related genes in the hippocampus (HPC) in adulthood in comparison to saline-treated control Sub mice. During postnatal days 4 and 8, we recorded and analyzed the stress-induced USVs emitted by the pups and tried to understand how the changes in the USVs' calls may be related to the changes in the monoamines and the activity of related genes. The recordings of the USVs showed that SAMe induced a reduction in the emitted flat and one-frequency step-up call numbers in PND4 pups, whereas step-down type calls were significantly increased by SAMe in PND8 pups. The reduction in the number of calls induced by SAMe following separation from the mothers implies a reduction in anxiety, which is an additional sign of decreased depressive-like behavior. Prenatal SAMe increased the concentrations of serotonin in the HPC in both male and female mice without any change in the levels of 5HIAA. It also decreased the level of the dopamine metabolite DOPAC in females. There were no changes in the levels of norepinephrine and metabolites. Several changes in the expression of genes associated with monoamine metabolism were also induced by prenatal SAMe. The molecular and biochemical data obtained from the HPC studies are generally in accordance with our previously obtained data from the prefrontal cortex of similarly treated Sub mice on postnatal day 90. The changes in both monoamines and their gene expression observed 2-3 months after SAMe treatment are associated with the previously recorded behavioral improvement and seem to demonstrate that SAMe is effective via an epigenetic mechanism.

AB  - How to further improve the dexterity of continuum robots so that they can quickly change their structural size like flexible biological organs is a key challenge in the field of robotics. To tackle this dexterity challenge, this paper proposes a soft-rigid coupled bioinspired elephant trunk robot with variable diameter, which is enabled by combining a soft motion mechanism with a novel rigid variable-diameter mechanism (double pyramid deployable mechanism). The integration of these two mechanisms has produced three significant beneficial effects: (i) The coexistence of multi-degree-of-freedom motion capability and variable size function greatly improves the dexterity of the elephant trunk robot. (ii) The motion refinement can be improved by structural amplification, making up for the low resolution of soft actuators. (iii) Its stiffness can be increased by enlarging its diameter, while its reachable workspace can be increased by decreasing its diameter. Thus, the elephant trunk robot can optimize its performance when facing different tasks by opening and closing the rigid variable-diameter mechanism. Further, we established a kinematic model of the elephant trunk robot by the structure discretization method and the principle of mechanism equivalence, and experimentally verified its reasonableness. The demonstration experiments show that the elephant trunk robot has good flexibility. This work provides a new variable diameter configuration for continuum robots, and presents a method of how to analyze the kinematics of continuum mechanisms using rigid mechanism theory.

AB  - Background: SLC30A10 and RAGE are widely recognized as pivotal regulators of A & beta; plaque transport and accumulation. Prior investigations have established a link between early lead exposure and cerebral harm in offspring, attributable to A & beta; buildup and amyloid plaque deposition. However, the impact of lead on the protein expression of SLC30A10 and RAGE has yet to be elucidated. This study seeks to confirm the influence of maternal lead exposure during pregnancy, specifically through lead-containing drinking water, on the protein expression of SLC30A10 and RAGE in mice offspring. Furthermore, this research aims to provide further evidence of lead induced neurotoxicity. Methods: Four cohorts of mice were subjected to lead exposure at concentrations of 0 mM, 0.25 mM, 0.5 mM, and 1 mM over a period of 42 uninterrupted days, spanning from pregnancy to the weaning phase. On postnatal day 21, the offspring mice underwent assessments. The levels of lead in the blood, hippocampus, and cerebral cortex were scrutinized, while the mice's cognitive abilities pertaining to learning and memory were probed through the utilization of the Morris water maze. Furthermore, Western blotting and immunofluorescence techniques were employed to analyze the expression levels of SLC30A10 and RAGE in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. Results: The findings revealed a significant elevation in lead concentration within the brains and bloodstreams of mice, mirroring the increased lead exposure experienced by their mothers during the designated period (P < 0.05). Notably, in the Morris water maze assessment, the lead-exposed group exhibited noticeably diminished spatial memory compared to the control group (P < 0.05). Both immunofluorescence and Western blot analyses effectively demonstrated the concomitant impact of varying lead exposure levels on the hippocampal and cerebral cortex regions of the offspring. The expression levels of SLC30A10 displayed a negative correlation with lead doses (P < 0.05). Surprisingly, under identical circumstances, the expression of RAGE in the hippocampus and cortex of the offspring exhibited a positive correlation with lead doses (P < 0.05). Conclusion: SLC30A10 potentially exerts distinct influence on exacerbated A & beta; accumulation and transportation in contrast to RAGE. Disparities in brain expression of RAGE and SLC30A10 may contribute to the neurotoxic effects induced by lead.

AB  - The increasing mortality rate of pancreatic cancer globally necessitates the urgent identification for novel therapeutic targets. This study investigated the expression, functions, and mechanistic insight of G protein inhibitory subunit 3 (G alpha i3) in pancreatic cancer. Bioinformatics analyses reveal that G alpha i3 is overexpressed in human pancreatic cancer, correlating with poor prognosis, higher tumor grade, and advanced classification. Elevated G alpha i3 levels are also confirmed in human pancreatic cancer tissues and primary/immortalized cancer cells. G alpha i3 shRNA or knockout (KO) significantly reduced cell viability, proliferation, cell cycle progression, and mobility in primary/immortalized pancreatic cancer cells. Conversely, G alpha i3 overexpression enhanced pancreatic cancer cell growth. RNA-sequencing and bioinformatics analyses of G alpha i3-depleted cells indicated G alpha i3's role in modulating the Akt-mTOR and PKA-Hippo-YAP pathways. Akt-S6 phosphorylation was decreased in G alpha i3-depleted cells, but was increased with G alpha i3 overexpression. Additionally, G alpha i3 depletion elevated PKA activity and activated the Hippo pathway kinase LATS1/2, leading to YAP/TAZ inactivation, while G alpha i3 overexpression exerted the opposite effects. There is an increased binding between G alpha i3 promoter and the transcription factor TCF7L2 in pancreatic cancer tissues and cells. G alpha i3 expression was significantly decreased following TCF7L2 silencing, but increased with TCF7L2 overexpression. In vivo, intratumoral injection of G alpha i3 shRNA-expressing adeno-associated virus significantly inhibited subcutaneous pancreatic cancer xenografts growth in nude mice. A significant growth reduction was also observed in xenografts from G alpha i3 knockout pancreatic cancer cells. Akt-mTOR inactivation and increased PKA activity coupled with YAP/TAZ inactivation were also detected in xenograft tumors upon G alpha i3 depletion. Furthermore, bioinformatic analysis and multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) staining on pancreatic cancer tissue microarrays showed a reduced proportion of M1-type macrophages and an increase in PD-L1 positive cells in G alpha i3-high pancreatic cancer tissues. Collectively, these findings highlight G alpha i3's critical role in promoting pancreatic cancer cell growth, potentially through the modulation of the Akt-mTOR and PKA-Hippo-YAP pathways and its influence on the immune landscape.

AB  - Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common complication of diabetes and is often observed alongside diabetic neuropathic pain (DNP) as a comorbidity in diabetic patients. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) plays an important role in various pathophysiological processes. The P2X7 receptor is responsible for triggering inflammatory responses, such as pyroptosis, linked to pain and depression. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of lncRNA MSTRG.81401 on hippocampal pyroptosis induced by the P2X7 receptor in diabetic rats with DNP combined with MDD (DNP + MDD). Our results showed that the expression of lncRNA MSTRG.81401 was significantly elevated in the hippocampus of DNP + MDD rats compared with the control group. Following the administration of shRNA targeting lncRNA MSTRG.81401, a notable elevation in mechanical and thermal pain thresholds was observed in rats with comorbid DNP and MDD. Additionally, significant improvements in depression-like behaviors were evident in the open-field test (OFT), sucrose preference test (SPT), and forced swim test (FST). In the DNP + MDD rats, elevated levels in hippocampal P2X7 receptor mRNA and protein were observed, along with increased co-expression of P2X7 and the astrocytic marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Meanwhile, in DNP + MDD rats, the heightened mRNA expression of NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3), apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC), pyroptosis-related protein Gasdermin D (GSDMD), caspase-1, IL-1 beta, IL-18, and TNF-alpha was detected, in addition to increased serum levels of IL-1 beta, IL-18 and TNF-alpha. After shRNA treatment with lncRNA MSTRG.81401, the above abnormal changes in indicators for pyroptosis and inflammation were improved. Therefore, our study demonstrates that shRNA of lncRNA MSTRG.81401 can alleviate the pain and depression-like behaviors in diabetic rats associated with the comorbidity of DNP and MDD by inhibiting the hippocampal P2X7 receptor-mediated pyroptosis pathway and pro-inflammatory responses. This suggests that the P2X7R/NLRP3/caspase-1 implicated pyroptosis and inflammatory scenario may serve as a potential target for the management of comorbid DNP and MDD in diabetes.

AB  - Recent evidence suggests that P-glycoprotein (P-gp) overexpression mediates hyperexcitability and is associated with epileptogenesis. Transcranial focal electrical stimulation (TFS) delays epileptogenesis and inhibits P-gp overexpression after a generalized seizure. Here, first we measured P-gp expression during epileptogenesis and second, we assessed if TFS antiepileptogenic effect was related with P-gp overexpression avoidance. Male Wistar rats were implanted in right basolateral amygdala and stimulated daily for electrical amygdala kindling (EAK), P-gp expression was assessed during epileptogenesis in relevant brain areas. Stage I group showed 85% increase in P-gp in ipsilateral hippocampus (p < 0.001). Stage III group presented 58% and 57% increase in P-gp in both hippocampi (p < 0.05). Kindled group had 92% and 90% increase in P-gp in both hippocampi (p < 0.01), and 93% and 143% increase in both neocortices (p < 0.01). For the second experiment, TFS was administrated daily after each EAK stimulation for 20 days and P-gp concentration was assessed. No changes were found in the TFS group (p > 0.05). Kindled group showed 132% and 138% increase in P-gp in both hippocampi (p < 0.001) and 51% and 92% increase in both cortices (p < 0.001). Kindled + TFS group presented no changes (p > 0.05). Our experiments revealed that progression of EAK is associated with increased P-gp expression. These changes are structure-specific and dependent on seizure severity. EAK-induced P-gp overexpression would be associated with neuronal hyperexcitability and thus, epileptogenesis. P-gp could be a novel therapeutical target to avoid epileptogenesis. In accordance with this, TFS inhibited P-gp overexpression and interfered with EAK. An important limitation of the present study is that P-gp neuronal expression was not evaluated under the different experimental conditions. Future studies should be carried out to determine P-gp neuronal overexpression in hyperexcitable networks during epileptogenesis. The TFS-induced lessening of P-gp overexpression could be a novel therapeutical strategy to avoid epileptogenesis in high-risk patients.

AB  - Lacosamide (Vimpat(R), LCS) is widely known as a functionalized amino acid with promising anti-convulsant properties; however, adverse events during its use have gradually appeared. Despite its inhibitory effect on voltage-gated Na+ current (I-Na), the modifications on varying types of ionic currents caused by this drug remain largely unexplored. In pituitary tumor (GH(3)) cells, we found that the presence of LCS concentration-dependently decreased the amplitude of A-type K+ current (I-K(A)) elicited in response to membrane depolarization. The I-K(A) amplitude in these cells was sensitive to attenuation by the application of 4-aminopyridine, 4-aminopyridine-3-methanol, or capsaicin but not by that of tetraethylammonium chloride. The effective IC50 value required for its reduction in peak or sustained I-K(A) was calculated to be 102 or 42 mu M, respectively, while the value of the dissociation constant (K-D) estimated from the slow component in I-K(A) inactivation at varying LCS concentrations was 52 mu M. By use of two-step voltage protocol, the presence of this drug resulted in a rightward shift in the steady-state inactivation curve of I-K(A) as well as in a slowing in the recovery time course of the current block; however, no change in the gating charge of the inactivation curve was detected in its presence. Moreover, the LCS addition led to an attenuation in the degree of voltage-dependent hysteresis for I-K(A) elicitation by long-duration triangular ramp voltage commands. Likewise, the I-K(A) identified in mouse mHippoE-14 neurons was also sensitive to block by LCS, coincident with an elevation in the current inactivation rate. Collectively, apart from its canonical action on I-Na inhibition, LCS was effective at altering the amplitude, gating, and hysteresis of I-K(A) in excitable cells. The modulatory actions on I-K(A), caused by LCS, could interfere with the functional activities of electrically excitable cells (e.g., pituitary tumor cells or hippocampal neurons).

AB  - Simple Summary Enteroviruses are essential human pathogens worldwide which cause a wide variety of diseases with neurologic, respiratory, skin, and gastrointestinal findings. Despite the fact that most people who become infected with non-polio enteroviruses suffer only mild illness, the enteroviruses D68 and A71 (EV-D68 and EV-A71), as well as the coxsackie viruses, can cause severe pathological conditions, including viral meningitis and acute flaccid myelitis. For example, patients with asthma are at high risk of suffering severe effects from an EV-D68 or rhinovirus infection. A vaccination option for non-polio enteroviruses is available only for EV-A71 in China. Currently, there is no specific antiviral treatment for non-polio enterovirus infections, but it is known that targeting viral capsids (capsid binders) offers a promising antiviral therapeutic approach. Recently, 4-(4-(1,3-dioxoisoindolin-2-yl)phenylsulfonamido)benzoic acid (compound 2a in this study) was identified as a new capsid binder. In the present study, we synthesized 15 novel derivatives of 2a and compared their antiviral properties in vitro. Two compounds were found to have higher antiviral activity against coxsackievirus than the reference capsid binder molecule. The current results indicate that our new capsid-binding molecules for targeting enteroviruses are of great importance for the development of antiviral therapy. A series of novel 4-substituted sulfonamidobenzoic acid derivatives was synthesized as the structural evolution of 4-(4-(1,3-dioxoisoindolin-2-yl)phenylsulfonamido)benzoic acid, which is the known inhibitor of the enterovirus life cycle. Antiviral properties of prepared compounds were evaluated in vitro using phenotypic screening and viral yield reduction assay. Their capsid binding properties were verified in thermostability assay. We identified two new hit-compounds (4 and 7a) with high activity against the coxsackievirus B3 (Nancy, CVB3) strain with potencies (IC50 values of 4.29 and 4.22 mu M, respectively) which are slightly superior to the reference compound 2a (IC50 5.54 mu M). Both hits changed the heat inactivation of CVB3 in vitro to higher temperatures, suggesting that they are capsid binders, as 2a is. The results obtained can serve as a basis for further development of the lead compounds for novel drug design to combat enterovirus infection.

AB  - In recent years, extensive research has been done on the prediction, treatment, and recognition of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The study of AD emerging and progression in the first years is valuable due to the nature of AD. Among scientific works, mathematical modeling of AD is an efficient way of studying the influence of various parameters on AD emerging. This paper proposes a novel model based on Cellular Automata (CA) for the study of AD's progress. In our model, the synapses of each neuron have been considered as square cells located around the central cell. The key parameter for AD progression in our model is amyloid-beta (A beta), which is calculated by differential rate equations of the Puri-Li model. Based on the proposed model in this article, we introduce a new definition of AD Rate for an M x L-neuron network, which can expand to the whole hippocampus space. To better illustrate the mechanism of this model, we simulate a 3 x 3 neuron network and discuss the obtained results. Our numerical results show that the variations of some parameters have a great effect on AD progress. For instance, it is obtained that AD Rate is sensitive to astroglia variations compared to microglia variations. The presented model can improve the scientist's insight into the prediction of AD, which will assist them in effectively considering the influence of various parameters on AD.

AB  - Intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) results from dysregulated metabolism of the extracellular matrix of the nucleus pulposus (NP) and involves the participation of inflammatory factors such as TNF-alpha. Bromodomaincontaining protein 7 (BRD7) shows considerable potential for anti-inflammatory applications. Herein, we investigated the role of BRD7 in IDD. The immunohistochemistry results demonstrated decreased BRD7 expression in severely degenerated human NP tissues compared to those showing mild degeneration. Lentiviruses and adenoviruses were used to knock down or overexpress BRD7 and YAP1, respectively. Our results revealed that BRD7 knockdown promoted matrix degradation and suppressed PI3K and YAP1 expression, while BRD7 overexpression alleviated matrix degradation and promoted YAP1 and PI3K expression. In addition, PI3K inhibition augmented matrix degradation, enhanced apoptosis, and reduced YAP1 expression, whereas YAP1 overexpression promoted matrix synthesis, suppressed apoptosis and promoted PI3K expression. Besides, BRD7 overexpression reversed the reductions in sulfated glycosaminoglycan levels induced by TNF-alpha, but this effect was blocked by PI3K or YAP1 inhibitors. Moreover, YAP1 and PI3K were shown to interact through coimmunoprecipitation analysis. In summary, our results demonstrate that BRD7 can regulate matrix metabolism and apoptosis in human NP cells through the BRD7-PI3K-YAP1 signaling axis. This study might provide new insights into the prevention and treatment of IDD.

AB  - Inherited and acquired defects in neurogenesis contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders, dysfunctional neural plasticity, and may underlie pathology in a range of neurodegenerative conditions. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) regulate the proliferation, survival, and differentiation of neural stem cells. While the balance between MAPKs and the family of MAPK dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) regulates axon branching and synaptic plasticity, the specific role that DUSPs play in neurogenesis remains unexplored. In the current study, we asked whether the canonical DUSP, MAP Kinase Phosphatase-1 (MKP-1), influences neural stem cell differentiation and the extent to which DUSP-dependent autophagy is operational in this context. Under basal conditions, Mkp-1 knockout mice generated fewer doublecortin (DCX) positive neurons within the dentate gyrus (DG) characterized by the accumulation of LC3 puncta. Analyses of wild-type neural stem cell (NSC) differentiation in vitro revealed increased Mkp-1 mRNA expression during the initial 24-h period. Notably, Mkp-1 KO NSC differentiation produced fewer Tuj1-positive neurons and was associated with increased expression of the BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19-kD protein-interacting protein 3 (BNIP3) and levels of autophagy. Conversely, Bnip3 knockdown in differentiated Mkp-1 KO NSCs reduced levels of autophagy and increased neuronal yields. These results indicate that MKP-1 exerts a pro-neurogenic bias during a critical window in NSC differentiation by regulating BNIP3 and basal autophagy levels.

AB  - ObjectiveCognitive dysfunction is a common comorbidity in patients with chronic pain. Activation of Liver X receptors (LXRs) plays a potential role in improving cognitive disorders in central nervous diseases. In this study, we investigated the role of LXRs in cognitive deficits induced by neuropathic pain.MethodsWe established the spared nerve injury (SNI) model to investigate pain-induced memory dysfunction. Pharmacological activation of LXRs with T0901317 or inhibition with GSK2033 was applied. PI3K inhibitor LY294002 was administered to explore the underlying mechanism of LXRs. Changes in neuroinflammation, microglia polarization, and synaptic plasticity were assessed using biochemical technologies.ResultsWe found that SNI-induced cognitive impairment was associated with reduced LXR beta expression, increased M1-phenotype microglia, decreased synaptic proteins, and inhibition of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in the hippocampus. Activation of LXRs using T0901317 effectively alleviated SNI-induced cognitive impairment. Additionally, T0901317 promoted the polarization of microglia from M1 to M2, reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines, and upregulated synaptic proteins in the hippocampus. However, administration of GSK2033 or LY294002 abolished these protective effects of T0901317 in SNI mice.ConclusionsLXRs activation alleviates neuropathic pain-induced cognitive impairment by modulating microglia polarization, neuroinflammation, and synaptic plasticity, at least partly via activation of PI3K/AKT signaling in the hippocampus. LXRs may be promising targets for addressing pain-related cognitive deficits.

AB  - Synaptic plasticity is believed to be the cellular basis for experience-dependent learning and memory. Although longterm depression (LTD), a form of synaptic plasticity, is caused by the activity-dependent reduction of cell surface alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA)-type glutamate receptors (AMPA receptors) at postsynaptic sites, its regulation by neuronal activity is not completely understood. In this study, we showed that the inhibition of toll-like receptor-9 (TLR9), an innate immune rereduction of cell surface AMPA receptors in cultured hippocampal neurons. We found that inhibition of TLR9 also blocked NMDA-induced activation of caspase-3, which plays an essential role in the induction of LTD. siRNA-based knockdown of TLR9 also suppressed the NMDA-induced reduction of cell surface AMPA receptors, although the scrambled RNA had no effect on the NMDA-induced trafficking of AMPA receptors. Overexpression of the siRNAresistant form of TLR9 rescued the AMPA receptor trafficking abolished by siRNA. Furthermore, NMDA stimulation induced rapid mitochondrial morphological changes, mitophagy, and the binding of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to TLR9. Treatment with dideoxycytidine and mitochondrial division inhibitor-1, which block mtDNA replication and mitophagy, respectively, inhibited NMDA-dependent AMPA receptor internalization. These results suggest that mitophagy induced by NMDA receptor activation releases mtDNA and activates TLR9, which plays an essential role in the trafficking of AMPA receptors during the induction of LTD.

AB  - To investigate the mechanism of Silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) regulation of DNA methylation and thus the expression of synaptic plasticity-related genes induced by lead (Pb) exposure, the early-life Sprague-Dawley rats and PC12 cells were used to establish Pb exposure models and treated with SIRT1 agonists (resveratrol and SRT1720). In vivo results demonstrated that Pb exposure increased the expression of DNMTs, MeCP2, PP1 and cleaved caspase3, decreased the expression of SIRT1, BDNF and RELIN and altered DNA methylation levels of synaptic plasticity genes. Moreover, we observed marked pathological damage in the hippocampal CA1 region of the 0.2 % Pb-exposure group. After treatment with resveratrol, the effects of Pb exposure on the expression of the above molecules and pathological features were significantly ameliorated in the hippocampus of rats. In vitro results showed that after the treatment with SRT1720, the expression of SIRT1 was activated and thus reversed the effect on DNMTs, MeCP2, apoptosis and synaptic plasticity-related genes and their DNA methylation levels induced by Pb exposure. In conclusion, we validated the important protective role of SIRT1 in neurotoxicity induced by Pb exposure through in vivo and in vitro experiments, providing potential therapeutic targets for the treatment and prevention of brain damage.

AB  - Camel alpha-Lactalbumin (alpha-LACc) has been shown to exert bioactivities for Reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging and anti-inflammation, showing the ability to treat obesity-related metabolic disorders. Herein, we present a novel process to purify alpha-LACcin a single chromatographic step from camel whey in a flow-through format. We also demonstrate the role of alpha-LACc modulation strategies for the treatment of obesity. An in-vivo study was systematically carried-out, in which an intragastric administration of alpha-LACcin rats experiencing obesity showed ameliorating effect on hepatic steatosis and dyslipidemia. In addition, we demonstrated that the reduction of inflammation and oxidative stress by alpha-LACcwas effective, and importantly, the enhancement of antioxidant defenses was achieved. Furthermore, we found that the peroxynitrite scavenging ability of alpha-LACc could help restore the hepatorenal function. Finally, we showed that alpha-LACccould improve insulin resistance- associated glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity disorders caused by obesity. This work has developed a novel one-step purification process of alpha-LACcfrom camel whey without the use of organic solvents. Our purified alpha-LACcmay serve as a promising therapeutic agent in the treatment of obesity-related metabolic disorders by synergistically alleviating lipid accumulation, inflammation, oxidative stress and insulin sensitivity.

AB  - Background: Diabetic cognitive dysfunction (DCD) has attracted increased attention, but its precise mechanism remains to be explored. Oligodendrocytes form myelin sheaths that wrap around axons. Granzyme B (GZMB) can cause axonal degeneration of the central nervous system. However, the role of GZMB in diabetic cognitive dysfunction (DCD) has not been reported. This study aimed to investigate whether GZMB promotes demyelination and participates in DCD by regulating the endoplasmic reticulum stress function of oligodendrocytes. Methods: Streptozotocin was injected intraperitoneally to establish a diabetic model in C57BL/6 mice. The mice were randomly divided into four groups: control group, diabetic group, diabetic + SerpinA3N group, and diabetic + saline treatment group. We performed the Morris water maze test to assess the learning and memory abilities of the mice. An immunofluorescence assay was performed to detect the expression sites of GZMB and OLIG2 in the hippocampal CA1 region. Luxol Fast Blue staining and electron microscopy were performed to detect the myelin number and myelin plate densities. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the expression levels of MBP and CNPase. Protein blotting was used to assess the expression levels of GZMB, PERK, p-PERK, eIF2 alpha, p-eIF2 alpha, NLRP3, Caspase-1, GSDMD-N, IL-1 beta, and IL-18 as well as MBP and CNPase. Results: The GZMB inhibitor SerpinA3N reduces escape latency and increases the traversing platforms and residence time in the target area, improving DCD in mice. It also reduces endoplasmic reticulum stress in hippocampal oligodendrocytes and focal prolapse, further promoting MBP and CNPase expression and reducing demyelination. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that inhibition of GZMB activity modulates oligodendrocyte endoplasmic reticulum stress and pyroptosis, reduces demyelination, and ameliorates diabetes-related cognitive impairment.

AB  - BackgroundMitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) plays pleiotropic roles in cellular physiology and pathology that contributes to a variety of diseases, but the role and potential mechanism of MCU in the pathogenesis of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) remain poorly understood.Methods and resultsHere, hepatic knockdown of MCU in C57BL/6J mice was achieved by tail vein injection of AAV8-mediated the CRISPR/Cas9. Mice were fed a Choline-deficient, L-amino acid-defined high-fat diet (CDAHFD) for 8 weeks to induce MASH and fibrosis. We find that expression of MCU enhanced in MASH livers of humans and mice. MCU knockdown robustly limits lipid droplet accumulation, steatosis, inflammation, and hepatocyte apoptotic death during MASH development both in vivo in mice and in vitro in cellular models. MCU-deficient mice strikingly mitigate MASH-related fibrosis. Moreover, the protective effects of MCU knockdown against MASH progression are accompanied by a reduced level of mitochondrial calcium, limiting hepatic oxidative stress, and attenuating mitochondrial dysfunction. Mechanically, RNA sequencing analysis and protein immunoblotting indicate that knockdown MCU inhibited the Hippo/YAP pathway activation and restored the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity during MASH development both in vitro and in vivo.ConclusionsMCU is up-regulated in MASH livers in humans and mice; and hepatic MCU knockdown protects against diet-induced MASH and fibrosis in mice. Thus, targeting MCU may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for MASH and fibrosis.

AB  - Shiga toxin 2 (Stx2) from enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) produces hemorrhagic colitis, hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), and acute encephalopathy. The mortality rate in HUS increases significantly when the central nervous system (CNS) is involved. Besides, EHEC also releases lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Many reports have described cognitive dysfunctions in HUS patients, the hippocampus being one of the brain areas targeted by EHEC infection. In this context, a translational murine model of encephalopathy was employed to establish the deleterious effects of Stx2 and the contribution of LPS in the hippocampus. The purpose of this work is to elucidate the signaling pathways that may activate the inflammatory processes triggered by Stx2, which produces cognitive alterations at the level of the hippocampus. Results demonstrate that Stx2 produced depression-like behavior, pro-inflammatory cytokine release, and NF-kB activation independent of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway, while co-administration of Stx2 and LPS reduced memory index. On the other hand, LPS activated NF-kB dependent on ERK1/2 signaling pathway. Cotreatment of Stx2 with LPS aggravated the pathologic state, while dexamethasone treatment succeeded in preventing behavioral alterations. Our present work suggests that the use of drugs such as corticosteroids or NF-kB signaling inhibitors may serve as neuroprotectors from EHEC infection.

AB  - Oxidative stress is currently considered to be the main cause of brain aging. Astaxanthin can improve oxidative stress under multiple pathological conditions. It is therefore hypothesized that astaxanthin might have therapeutic effects on brain aging. To validate this hypothesis and investigate the underlying mechanisms, a mouse model of brain aging was established by injecting amyloid beta (A beta)25-35 (5 mu M, 3 mu L/injection, six injections given every other day) into the right lateral ventricle. After 3 days of A beta(25)(-)(35 )injections, the mouse models were intragastrically administered astaxanthin (0.1 mL/d, 10 mg/kg) for 30 successive days. Astaxanthin greatly reduced the latency to find the platform in the Morris water maze, increased the number of crossings of the target platform, and increased the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, synaptophysin, sirtuin 1, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1 alpha. Intraperitoneal injection of the sirtuin 1 inhibitor nicotinamide (500 mu M/d) for 7 successive days after astaxanthin intervention inhibited these phenomena. These findings suggest that astaxanthin can regulate the expression of synaptic proteins in mouse hippocampus through the sirtuin 1/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1 alpha signaling pathway, which leads to improvements in the learning, cognitive, and memory abilities of mice.

AB  - Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is characterized by cycles of abuse, withdrawal, and relapse. Neuroadaptations in the basal ganglia are observed in AUD; specifically in the putamen, globus pallidus (GP), and ventral pallidum (VP). These regions are associated with habit formation, drug-seeking behaviors, and reward processing. While previous studies have shown the crucial role of glial cells in drug seeking, it remains unknown whether glial cells in the basal ganglia are altered in AUD. Glial cells in the putamen, GP, and VP were examined in human post-mortem tissue of AUD and alcohol remission cases. Immunohistochemistry was performed to analyze cell count, staining intensity, and morphology of microglia and astrocytes, using markers Iba-1 and GFAP. Morphological analysis revealed a significant decrease in microglia cell size and process retraction, indicating activation or a dystrophic microglia phenotype in individuals with AUD compared to controls. Microglia staining intensity was also higher in the GP and VP in AUD cases, whereas microglia staining intensity and cell size in remission cases were not different to control cases. In contrast, no astrocyte changes were observed in examined brain regions for both AUD and remission cases compared to controls. These results suggest alcohol exposure alters microglia, potentially contributing to dysfunctions in the basal ganglia that maintain addiction, and abstinence from alcohol may reverse microglia changes and associated dysfunctions. Overall, this study further characterizes AUD neuropathology and implicates microglia in the putamen, GP, and VP as a potential target for therapy.

AB  - BackgroundMicroglia are brain-resident macrophages that play a crucial role in synapse pruning during the development and progression of various neuropsychiatric disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Mechanistically, CD47 protein acts as a potent 'do not eat me' signal, protecting synapses from phagocytosis by microglia. However, the functional role of the upregulated neuronal CD47 signal under both physiological and pathological conditions remains unclear.ResultsWe utilized an adeno-associated virus gene expression system to induce neuron-specific overexpression of CD47 in wild-type and 5xFAD mice, assessing its effects on microglial synaptic phagocytosis and mouse behaviors. Our results indicate that neuronal CD47 induces ASD-like behaviors and synaptic pruning defects, while promoting behavioral disinhibition and improving memory in wild-type mice. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing was employed to profile gene expression patterns in subpopulations of neurons and microglia. Notably, neuronal CD47 enhances synaptic pathways in neurons and particularly shifts microglial subpopulations from a disease-associated state to a homeostatic state. Additionally, neuronal CD47 reduces excessive microglial synaptic phagocytosis induced by A beta pathology in 5xFAD mice.ConclusionOur study provides evidence that neuronal CD47 overexpression results in synaptic pruning defects and is involved in the pathogenesis of ASD, while also playing a beneficial role in mitigating excessive synaptic loss in Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Sigma-1 receptor (S1R) is a multimodal chaperone protein that is implicated in various pathophysiological conditions including drug addiction, Alzheimer's disease, and trophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). S1R interacts with various channels and receptors on the endoplasmic reticulum plasma membrane (PM). It has been reported that S1R alizes with the M2-muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M2R) the soma of motoneurons, although a functional interaction between these two proteins has not been established. Here, investigated the regulation of M2R signaling by S1R electrophysiological recordings of GIRK currents in HEK293T cells. We observed that S1R strongly inhibited M2R-mediated activation of GIRK1/2, but the disease mutant linked to S1R E102Q, did not. The inhibitory effect of S1R was selective for M2R and wasn't seen when S1R was co-expressed other G i/o coupled receptors including M4R. Chimeric mutant receptors of M2R and M4R were generated analyzed, and this highlighted Ala401 in the transmembrane domain (TM6) of M2R and Glu172 as well as Glu175 extracellular loop 2 regions of M2R, as essential for the bition by S1R. Co-immunoprecipitation confirmed the physical interaction between M2R and S1R. Immunocytochemical beling of M2R and S1R expressed in HeLa cells, HEK293T and cultured hippocampal neurons, showed clear PM expression of M2R throughout the cell which was decreased coexpression with S1R but was still apparent. Taken together, our results show that S1R interacts with M2R to reduce both PM expression and function, and this involves TM6 and extracellular loop 2.

AB  - Geraniol (GE), an acyclic monoterpene, is a chief constituent of essential oils of herbs and fruits. It possesses diverse pharmacological actions like antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and anti-parkinson. However, its neuroprotective potential in stroke is yet to be explored at large. The present study evaluated the neuroprotective potential of GE against the global model of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-injury in rats. Bilateral common carotid artery (BCCA) occlusion for 30 min followed by 7 days of reperfusion caused varied biochemical/enzymatic alterations viz. increase in levels of lipid peroxidation (LPO), nitric oxide (NO), xanthine oxidase (XO), and decrease in the levels of cerebroprotectives like superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), total thiols, and glutathione (GSH). GE-pretreatment markedly reversed these changes and restored the levels of protective enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants near to normal compared to I/R group. Besides, GE treatment showed marked improvement in anxiety-related behavior and neuronal deficits in animals subjected to I/R injury. Moreover, 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC)-stained rat brain coronal sections and histopathological studies revealed neuronal protection against I/R-injury, as evidenced by a reduction in infarct area (%) and an increase in hippocampal CA1 neuronal density in the GE-treated groups. The results of this study revealed that GE exhibited potential neuroprotective activity by reducing oxidative stress and infarction area, and protecting hippocampal CA1 neurons against I/R-injury in the global stroke model in rats.

AB  - Aging is a physiological process that generates progressive decline in many cellular functions. There are many theories of aging, and one of great importance in recent years is the mitochondrial theory of aging, in which mitochondrial dysfunction that occurs at advanced age could be responsible for the aged phenotype. In this context, there is diverse information about mitochondrial dysfunction in aging, in different models and different organs. Specifically, in the brain, different studies have shown mitochondrial dysfunction mainly in the cortex; however, until now, no study has shown all the defects in hippocampal mitochondria in aged female C57BL/6J mice. We performed a complete analysis of mitochondrial function in 3-month-old and 20-month-old (mo) female C57BL/6J mice, specifically in the hippocampus of these animals. We observed an impairment in bioenergetic function, indicated by a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, O-2 consumption, and mitochondrial ATP production. Additionally, there was an increase in ROS production in the aged hippocampus, leading to the activation of antioxidant signaling, specifically the Nrf2 pathway. It was also observed that aged animals had deregulation of calcium homeostasis, with more sensitive mitochondria to calcium overload and deregulation of proteins related to mitochondrial dynamics and quality control processes. Finally, we observed a decrease in mitochondrial biogenesis with a decrease in mitochondrial mass and deregulation of mitophagy. These results show that during the aging process, damaged mitochondria accumulate, which could contribute to or be responsible for the aging phenotype and age-related disabilities.

AB  - Delay eyeblink conditioning has been extensively used to study associative learning and the cerebellar circuits underlying this task have been largely identified. However, there is a little knowledge on how factors such as strain, sex and innate behaviour influence performance during this type of learning. In this study, we used male and female mice of C57BL/6J (B6) and B6CBAF1 strains to investigate the effect of sex, strain and locomotion in delay eyeblink conditioning. We performed a short and a long delay eyeblink conditioning paradigm and used a c-Fos immunostaining approach to explore the involvement of different brain areas in this task. We found that both B6 and B6CBAF1 females reach higher learning scores compared to males in the initial stages of learning. This sex-dependent difference was no longer present as the learning progressed. Moreover, we found a strong positive correlation between learning scores and voluntary locomotion irrespective of the training duration. c-Fos immunostainings after the short paradigm showed positive correlations between c-Fos expression and learning scores in the cerebellar cortex and brainstem, as well as previously unreported areas. By contrast, after the long paradigm, c-Fos expression was only significantly elevated in the brainstem. Taken together, we show that differences in voluntary locomotion and activity across brain areas correlate with performance in delay eyeblink conditioning across strains and sexes.

AB  - Cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) deficiency disorder (CDD) is a severe X-linked neurodevelopmental condition characterized by early-onset, intractable epilepsy, motor and cognitive impairment, and autistic-like features. Although constitutive Cdkl5 knockout (KO) models have established the importance of CDKL5 during early brain development, CDKL5's role in the mature brain remains poorly defined. Here, we employed an inducible, conditional KO model in which Cdkl5 is selectively deleted from forebrain glutamatergic neurons in adult mice to investigate the postdevelopmental functions of CDKL5. Using a total of 48 adult male mice, including Cdkl5flox/Y(Cre+) (n = 30) and Cdkl5flox/Y(Cre-) littermate controls (n = 18), we found that tamoxifen-induced Cdkl5 deletion led to prominent behavioral impairments, including deficits in motor coordination, reduced sociability, and impaired hippocampus-dependent spatial memory, while behavioral features such as hyperactivity and stereotypic jumping, typically present in germline KOs, were absent. Sensory functions, including olfaction and pain perception, were also preserved. At the cellular level, the loss of Cdkl5 resulted in a marked reduction in excitatory synapse density in the cortex and hippocampus, accompanied by increased numbers of immature dendritic spines and decreased mature spines. Neuronal loss in the hippocampal CA1 region and selective microglial activation in the cortex were also observed. These alterations closely resemble those seen in constitutive KO models, underscoring the ongoing requirement for CDKL5 expression in excitatory neurons for maintaining synaptic integrity and neuronal homeostasis in the adult brain. This study underscores the importance of temporally controlled models for investigating the mechanisms underlying CDD pathophysiology in the adult brain.

AB  - Rett Syndrome is an X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder (RTT; OMIM#312750) associated to MECP2 mutations. MeCP2 dysfunction is seen as one cause for the deficiencies found in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling, since BDNF is one of the genes under MeCP2 jurisdiction. BDNF signaling is also dependent on the proper function of the adenosinergic system. Indeed, both BDNF signaling and the adenosinergic system are altered in Mecp2-null mice (Mecp2(-/y)), a representative model of severe manifestation of RTT. Considering that symptoms severity largely differs among RTT patients, we set out to investigate the BDNF and ADO signaling modifications in Mecp2 heterozygous female mice (Mecp2(+/-)) presenting a less severe phenotype. Symptomatic Mecp2(+/-) mice have lower BDNF levels in the cortex and hippocampus. This is accompanied by a loss of BDNF-induced facilitation of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), which could be restored upon selective activation of adenosine A(2A) receptors (A(2A)R). While no differences were observed in the amount of adenosine in the cortex and hippocampus of Mecp2(+/-) mice compared with healthy littermates, the density of the A(1)R and A(2A)R subtype receptors was, respectively, upregulated and downregulated in the hippocampus. Data suggest that significant changes in BDNF and adenosine signaling pathways are present in an RTT model with a milder disease phenotype: Mecp2(+/-) female animals. These features strengthen the theory that boosting adenosinergic activity may be a valid therapeutic strategy for RTT patients, regardless of their genetic penetrance.

AB  - A mouse model containing a GFP-tagged ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2) has shed light on the precise subcellular localization of hippocampal RyR2 and mechanisms underlying neuronal excitability, learning, and memory.
   Ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2) is abundantly expressed in the heart and brain. Mutations in RyR2 are associated with both cardiac arrhythmias and intellectual disability. While the mechanisms of RyR2-linked arrhythmias are well characterized, little is known about the mechanism underlying RyR2-associated intellectual disability. Here, we employed a mouse model expressing a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged RyR2 and a specific GFP probe to determine the subcellular localization of RyR2 in hippocampus. GFP-RyR2 was predominantly detected in the soma and dendrites, but not the dendritic spines of CA1 pyramidal neurons or dentate gyrus granular neurons. GFP-RyR2 was also detected within the mossy fibers in the stratum lucidum of CA3, but not in the presynaptic terminals of CA1 neurons. An arrhythmogenic RyR2-R4496C(+/-) mutation downregulated the A-type K+ current and increased membrane excitability, but had little effect on the afterhyperpolarization current or presynaptic facilitation of CA1 neurons. The RyR2-R4496C(+/-) mutation also impaired hippocampal long-term potentiation, learning, and memory. These data reveal the precise subcellular distribution of hippocampal RyR2 and its important role in neuronal excitability, learning, and memory.

AB  - During placentation, placental cytotrophoblast (CT) cells differentiate into syncytiotrophoblast (ST) cells and extravillous trophoblast (EVT) cells. In the placenta, the expression of various genes is regulated by the Hippo pathway through a transcription complex, Yes-associated protein (YAP)/transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ)-TEA domain transcription factor (TEAD) (YAP/TAZ-TEAD) activity. YAP/TAZ-TEAD activity is controlled by multiple factors and signaling, such as cAMP signaling. cAMP signaling is believed to be involved in the regulation of trophoblast function but is not yet fully understood. Here we showed that YAP/TAZ-TEAD expressions and their activities were altered by cAMP stimulation in BeWo cells, a human choriocarcinoma cell line. The repression of YAP/TAZ-TEAD activity induced the expression of ST-specific genes without cAMP stimulation, and transduction of constitutively active YAP, i.e. YAP-5SA, resulted in the repression of 8Br-cAMP-induced expressions of ST-specific genes in a TEAD-dependent manner. We also investigated the role of YAP/TAZ-TEAD in maintaining CT cells and their differentiation into ST and EVT cells using human trophoblast stem (TS) cells. YAP/TAZ-TEAD activity was involved in maintaining the stemness of TS cells. Induction or repression of YAP/TAZ-TEAD activity resulted in marked changes in the expression of ST-specific genes. Using primary CT cells, which spontaneously differentiate into ST-like cells, the effects of YAP-5SA transduction were investigated, and the expression of ST-specific genes was found to be repressed. These results indicate that the inhibition of YAP/TAZ-TEAD activity, with or without cAMP stimulation, is essential for the differentiation of CT cells into ST cells.

AB  - Early and progressive dysfunctions of the dopaminergic system from the Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA) have been described in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). During the long pre-symptomatic phase, alterations in the function of Parvalbumin interneurons (PV-INs) are also observed, resulting in cortical hyperexcitability represented by subclinical epilepsy and aberrant gamma-oscillations. However, it is unknown whether the dopaminergic deficits contribute to brain hyperexcitability in AD. Here, using the Tg2576 mouse model of AD, we prove that reduced hippocampal dopaminergic innervation, due to VTA dopamine neuron degeneration, impairs PV-IN firing and gamma-waves, weakens the inhibition of pyramidal neurons and induces hippocampal hyperexcitability via lower D2-receptor-mediated activation of the CREB-pathway. These alterations coincide with reduced PV-IN numbers and Perineuronal Net density. Importantly, L-DOPA and the selective D2-receptor agonist quinpirole rescue p-CREB levels and improve the PV-IN-mediated inhibition, thus reducing hyperexcitability. Moreover, similarly to quinpirole, sumanirole - another D2-receptor agonist and a known anticonvulsant - not only increases p-CREB levels in PV-INs but also restores gamma-oscillations in Tg2576 mice. Conversely, blocking the dopaminergic transmission with sulpiride (a D2-like receptor antagonist) in WT mice reduces p-CREB levels in PV-INs, mimicking what occurs in Tg2576. Overall, these findings support the hypothesis that the VTA dopaminergic system integrity plays a key role in hippocampal PV-IN function and survival, disclosing a relevant contribution of the reduced dopaminergic tone to aberrant gamma-waves, hippocampal hyperexcitability and epileptiform activity in early AD.

AB  - Neural stem cells in the human subependymal zone (SEZ) generate neuronal progenitor cells that can differentiate and integrate as inhibitory interneurons into cortical and subcortical brain regions; yet the extent of adult neurogenesis remains unexplored in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. We verified the existence of neurogenesis across the lifespan by chartering transcriptional alterations (2 days-103 years, n = 70) and identifying cells indicative of different stages of neurogenesis in the human SEZ. Expression of most neural stem and neuronal progenitor cell markers decreased during the first postnatal years and remained stable from childhood into ageing. We next discovered reduced neural stem and neuronal progenitor cell marker expression in the adult SEZ in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder compared to controls (n = 29-32 per group). RNA sequencing identified increased expression of the macrophage marker CD163 as the most significant molecular change in schizophrenia. CD163(+) macrophages, which were localised along blood vessels and in the parenchyma within 10 mu m of neural stem and progenitor cells, had increased density in schizophrenia but not in bipolar disorder. Macrophage marker expression negatively correlated with neuronal progenitor marker expression in schizophrenia but not in controls or bipolar disorder. Reduced neurogenesis and increased macrophage marker expression were also associated with polygenic risk for schizophrenia. Our results support that the human SEZ retains the capacity to generate neuronal progenitor cells throughout life, although this capacity is limited in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. The increase in macrophages in schizophrenia but not in bipolar disorder indicates that immune cells may impair neurogenesis in the adult SEZ in a disease-specific manner.

AB  - BackgroundNeuronal ferroptosis plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of cognitive deficits. The present study explored whether artemisinin protected type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) mice from cognitive impairments by attenuating neuronal ferroptosis in the hippocampal CA1 region.MethodsSTZ-induced T2DM mice were treated with artemisinin (40 mg/kg, i.p.), or cotreated with artemisinin and Nrf2 inhibitor MEL385 or ferroptosis inducer erastin for 4 weeks. Cognitive performance was determined by the Morris water maze and Y maze tests. Hippocampal ROS, MDA, GSH, and Fe2+ contents were detected by assay kits. Nrf2, p-Nrf2, HO-1, and GPX4 proteins in hippocampal CA1 were assessed by Western blotting. Hippocampal neuron injury and mitochondrial morphology were observed using H&E staining and a transmission electron microscope, respectively.ResultsArtemisinin reversed diabetic cognitive impairments, decreased the concentrations of ROS, MDA and Fe2+, and increased the levels of p-Nr2, HO-1, GPX4 and GSH. Moreover, artemisinin alleviated neuronal loss and ferroptosis in the hippocampal CA1 region. However, these neuroprotective effects of artemisinin were abolished by Nrf2 inhibitor ML385 and ferroptosis inducer erastin.ConclusionArtemisinin effectively ameliorates neuropathological changes and learning and memory decline in T2DM mice; the underlying mechanism involves the activation of Nrf2 to inhibit neuronal ferroptosis in the hippocampus.

AB  - Objective and designPostoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a common complication following surgery among elderly patients. Emerging evidence demonstrates that neuroinflammation plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of POCD. This study tested the hypothesis that fluoxetine can protect against POCD by suppressing hippocampal neuroinflammation through attenuating TLR4/MyD88/NF-kappa B signaling pathway activation.SubjectsAged C57BL/6 J male mice (18 months old) were studied.TreatmentAged mice were intraperitoneally injected with fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) or saline for seven days before splenectomy. In addition, aged mice received an intracerebroventricular injection of a TLR4 agonist or saline seven days before splenectomy in the rescue experiment.MethodsOn postoperative days 1, 3, and 7, we assessed hippocampus-dependent memory, microglial activation status, proinflammatory cytokine levels, protein levels related to the TLR4/MyD88/NF-kappa B signaling pathway, and hippocampal neural apoptosis in our aged mouse model.ResultsSplenectomy induced a decline in spatial cognition, paralleled by parameters indicating exacerbation of hippocampal neuroinflammation. Fluoxetine pretreatment partially restored the deteriorated cognitive function, downregulated proinflammatory cytokine levels, restrained microglial activation, alleviated neural apoptosis, and suppressed the increase in TLR4, MyD88, and p-NF-kappa B p65 in microglia. Intracerebroventricular injection of LPS (1 mu g, 0.5 mu g/mu L) before surgery weakened the effect of fluoxetine.ConclusionFluoxetine pretreatment suppressed hippocampal neuroinflammation and mitigated POCD by inhibiting microglial TLR4/MyD88/NF-kappa B pathway activation in aged mice.

AB  - This study investigated the effect of atmospheric pressure pin-to-plate cold plasma on physicochemical and functional properties of elephant foot yam starch (EFYS). The isolated EFYS was subjected to the plasma treatment at varying voltages (190 V, 210, V and 230 V) for 5, 10 and 15 min of exposure. The control and treated starches were analysed for pH, amylose content, carboxyl group, paste clarity, water and oil binding property, pasting property, DSC, FTIR, XRD and SEM. There has been a significant reduction (p < 0.05) in pH values of starch from 7.22 to 4.92 and also reduction in turbidity values by 32.48 %. Plasma treatment improved paste clarity and storage stability. However, a significant increase was observed in the oil (1.26-3.80 g/g) and water binding capacity (1.47-1.91 g/g) of the starch. The structural modification, including surface etching, has been confirmed by FTIR and SEM analysis. Plasma treatment significantly increased starch crystallinity, which correlated with higher gelatinization enthalpy, indicating enhanced thermal stability due to plasma induced crosslinking. FTIR data confirmed that cross-linking takes place in samples treated at lower voltages (190Vand 210 V) followed by depolymerization occurring in harshly treated plasma samples (230 V for 15 min).

AB  - In utero gene editing with mRNA-based therapeutics has the potential to revolutionize the treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders. However, a critical bottleneck in clinical application has been the lack of mRNA delivery vehicles that can efficiently transfect cells in the brain. In this report, we demonstrate that in utero intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of densely PEGylated lipid nanoparticles (ADP-LNPs) containing an acid-degradable PEG-lipid can safely and effectively deliver mRNA for gene editing enzymes to the fetal mouse brain, resulting in successful transfection and editing of brain cells. ADP-LNPs containing Cre mRNA transfected 30% of the fetal brain cells in Ai9 mice and had no detectable adverse effects on fetal development and postnatal growth. In addition, ADP-LNPs efficiently transfected neural stem and progenitor cells in Ai9 mice with Cre mRNA, which subsequently proliferated and caused over 40% of the cortical neurons and 60% of the hippocampal neurons to be edited in treated mice 10 weeks after birth. Furthermore, using Angelman syndrome, a paradigmatic neurodevelopmental disorder, as a disease model, we demonstrate that ADP-LNPs carrying Cas9 mRNA and gRNA induced indels in 21% of brain cells within 7 days postpartum, underscoring the precision and potential of this approach. These findings demonstrate that LNP/mRNA complexes have the potential to be a transformative tool for in utero treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders and set the stage for a frontier in treating neurodevelopmental disorders that focuses on curing genetic diseases before birth.

AB  - Cocaine and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) mRNA and peptide are vastly expressed in both cortical and subcortical brain areas and are involved in critical cognitive functions. CART peptide (CARTp), described in reward-related brain structures, regulates drug-induced learning and memory, and its role appears specific to psychostimulants. However, many other drugs of abuse, such as alcohol, opiates, nicotine, and caffeine, have been shown to alter the expression levels of CART mRNA and peptides in brain structures directly or indirectly associated with learning and memory processes. However, the number of studies demonstrating the contribution of CARTp in learning and memory is still minimal. Notably, the exact cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying CARTp effects are still unknown. The discoveries that CARTp effects are mediated through a putative Gprotein coupled receptor and activation of cellular signaling cascades via NMDA receptor-coupled ERK have enhanced our knowledge about the action of this neuropeptide and allowed us to comprehend better CARTp exact cellular/molecular mechanisms that could mediate drug-induced changes in learning and memory functions. Unfortunately, these efforts have been impeded by the lack of suitable and specific CARTp receptor antagonists.

AB  - Both diabetes and cancer pose significant threats to public health. To overcome these challenges, nanobiotechnology offers innovative solutions for the treatment of these diseases. However, the synthesis of nanoparticles can be complex, costly and environmentally toxic. Therefore, in this study, we successfully synthesized Camellia sinensis silver nanoparticles (CS-AgNPs) biologically from methanolic leaf extract of C. sinensis and as confirmed by the visual appearance which exhibited strong absorption at 456 nm in UV-visible spectroscopy. The fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis revealed that phytochemicals of C. sinensis were coated with AgNPs. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis showed the spherical shape of CS-AgNPs, with a size of 15.954 nm, while X-ray diffraction spectrometry (XRD) analysis detected a size of 20.32 nm. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) indicated the thermal stability of CS-AgNPs. The synthesized CS-AgNPs significantly inhibited the ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) cell growth with 53.42 +/- 1.101 %. The EAC cell line induced mice exhibited increased level of the serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), however this elevated serum parameter significantly reduced and controlled by the treatment with CS-AgNPs. Moreover, in a streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice model, CS-AgNPs greatly reduced blood glucose, total cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and creatinine levels. These findings highlight that the synthesized CS-AgNPs have significant anticancer and antidiabetic activities that could be used as promising particles for the treatment of these major diseases. However, pre-clinical and clinical trial should be addressed before use this particles as therapeutics agents.

AB  - Prematurely-born infants cared for in the neonatal units suffer from memory and learning deficits. Prematurity diminishes neurogenesis and synaptogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG). This dysmaturation of neurons is attributed to elevated PSD95, NMDR2A, and IGF1 levels. Since oestrogen treatment plays key roles in the development and plasticity of DG, we hypothesized that 17 ss-estradiol (E2) treatment would ameliorate neurogenesis and synaptogenesis in the DG, reversing cognitive deficits in premature newborns. Additionally, E2-induced recovery would be mediated by IGF1 signalling. These hypotheses were tested in a rabbit model of prematurity and nonmaternal care, in which premature kits were gavage-fed and reared by laboratory personnel. We compared E2-and vehicle-treated preterm kits for morphological, molecular, and behavioural parameters. We also treated kits with oestrogen degrader, RAD1901, and assessed IGF1 signalling. We found that E2 treatment increased the number of Tbr(2+) and DCX+ neuronal progenitors and increased the density of glutamatergic synapses in the DG. E2 treatment restored PSD95 and NMDAR2A levels and cognitive function in preterm kits. Transcriptomic analyses showed that E2 treatment contributed to recovery by influencing interactions between IGF1R and neurodegenerative, as well as glutamatergic genes. ER alpha expression was reduced on completion of E2 treatment at D7, followed by D30 elevation. E2-induced fluctuation in ER alpha levels was associated with a reciprocal elevation in IGF1/2 expression at D7 and reduction at D30. ER alpha degradation by RAD1901 treatment enhanced IGF1 levels, suggesting ER alpha inhibits IGF1 expression. E2 treatment alleviates the prematurity-induced maldevelopment of DG and cognitive dysfunctions by regulating ER alpha and IGF1 levels.

AB  - PurposeEsophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is an aggressive disease with a poor prognosis, caused by the inactivation of critical cell growth regulators that lead to uncontrolled proliferation and increased malignancy. Although Serine/Threonine Kinase 3 (STK3), also known as Mammalian STE20-like protein kinase 2 (MST2), is a highly conserved kinase of the Hippo pathway, plays a critical role in immunomodulation, organ development, cellular differentiation, and cancer suppression, its phenotype and function in ESCC require further investigation. In this study, we report for the first time on the role of STK3 kinase and its activation condition in ESCC, as well as the mechanism and mediators of kinase activation.MethodsIn this study, we investigated the expression and clinical significance of STK3 in ESCC. We first used bioinformatics databases and immunohistochemistry to analyze STK3 expression in the ESCC patient cohort and conducted survival analysis. In vivo, we conducted a tumorigenicity assay using nude mouse models to demonstrate the phenotypes of STK3 kinase. In vitro, we conducted Western blot analysis, qPCR analysis, CO-IP, and immunofluorescence (IF) staining analysis to detect molecule expression, interaction, and distribution. We measured proliferation, migration, and apoptosis abilities in ESCC cells in the experimental groups using CCK-8 and transwell assays, flow cytometry, and EdU staining. We used RNA-seq to identify genes that were differentially expressed in ESCC cells with silenced STK3 or FOXO1. We demonstrated the regulatory relationship of the TP53INP1/P21 gene medicated by the STK3-FOXO1 axis using Western blotting and ChIP in vitro.ResultsWe demonstrate high STK3 expression in ESCC tissue and cell lines compared to esophageal epithelium. Cellular ROS induces STK3 autophosphorylation in ESCC cells, resulting in upregulated p-STK3/4. STK3 activation inhibits ESCC cell proliferation and migration by triggering apoptosis and suppressing the cell cycle. STK3 kinase activation phosphorylates FOXO1Ser212, promoting nuclear translocation, enhancing transcriptional activity, and upregulating TP53INP1 and P21. We also investigated TP53INP1 and P21's phenotypic effects in ESCC, finding that their knockdown significantly increases tumor proliferation, highlighting their crucial role in ESCC tumorigenesis.ConclusionSTK3 kinase has a high expression level in ESCC and can be activated by cellular ROS, inhibiting cell proliferation and migration. Additionally, STK3 activation-mediated FOXO1 regulates ESCC cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest by targeting TP53INP1/P21. Our research underscores the anti-tumor function of STK3 in ESCC and elucidates the mechanism underlying its anti-tumor effect on ESCC.

AB  - Neurons in sensory areas encode/represent stimuli. Surprisingly, recent studies have suggested that, even during persistent performance, these representations are not stable and change over the course of days and weeks. We examine stimulus representations from fluorescence recordings across hundreds of neurons in the visual cortex using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging and we corroborate previous studies finding that such representations change as experimental trials are repeated across days. This phenomenon has been termed "representational drift". In this study we geometrically characterize the properties of representational drift in the primary visual cortex of mice in two open datasets from the Allen Institute and propose a potential mechanism behind such drift. We observe representational drift both for passively presented stimuli, as well as for stimuli which are behaviorally relevant. Across experiments, the drift differs from in-session variance and most often occurs along directions that have the most in-class variance, leading to a significant turnover in the neurons used for a given representation. Interestingly, despite this significant change due to drift, linear classifiers trained to distinguish neuronal representations show little to no degradation in performance across days. The features we observe in the neural data are similar to properties of artificial neural networks where representations are updated by continual learning in the presence of dropout, i.e. a random masking of nodes/weights, but not other types of noise. Therefore, we conclude that a potential reason for the representational drift in biological networks is driven by an underlying dropout-like noise while continuously learning and that such a mechanism may be computational advantageous for the brain in the same way it is for artificial neural networks, e.g. preventing overfitting.
   Author summary
   Recently, it has been shown that the neuronal representations of sensory information in the brain can vary, even during seemingly stable performance. Why such "representational drift'' occurs in the brain is currently unknown. In this work, using experimental data that images thousands of neurons across many mice, we precisely quantify how certain representations change over time with geometric tools used to understand high-dimensional data. Across two datasets where mice are either passively viewing a movie or actively performing a task, we find the representational changes have strikingly similar geometric properties. We then induce representational changes in an artificial neural network by injecting it with several distinct types of noise while it continues to adjust its components to maintain stable performance. Comparing the properties of its representational drift to what we observed in experiment, only a specific category of noise, known as "dropout'', matches the geometry we observed in experiments. This hints at a potential biological mechanism underlying representational drift: a random suppression of certain neuronal components and a subsequent compensating change in other components. Additionally, dropout is well-known for helping artificial neural networks learn better, potentially hinting at a computational advantage to drift in the brain.

AB  - Dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDLPS) accounts for 15-20% of liposarcoma (LPS) and has high rates of local recurrence and distant metastasis. Hyperactivation of yes-associated protein (YAP) has been implicated in DDLPS development. However, the mechanisms that drive aberrant YAP signaling remain largely unknown. Here, we show that tumor protein p53 inducible nuclear protein 2 (TP53INP2) is a potential negative modulator of the malignant progression of DDLPS. The TP53INP2 protein expression level in tumor tissues from 79 patients with DDLPS decreased progressively. Compared with primary tumors, recurrent tumors also exhibited reduced TP53INP2 expression. More importantly, low TP53INP2 expression is correlated with poor prognosis. TP53INP2 gain- or loss-of-function experiments in DDLPS cell lines showed profound inhibitory effects on processes and properties linked with cancer malignancy, such as proliferation, migration, stemness and dedifferentiation. Mechanistically, TP53INP2 is located mainly in mitochondria and promotes mitophagic degradation of YAP in a VDAC1-dependent manner. The WW domain in YAP and the PPTY motif in VDAC1 are required for their interaction. Taken together, these data demonstrate that TP53INP2 represses the malignant progression of DDLPS by inactivating YAP via a mitophagy-dependent mechanism and that TP53INP2 may constitute a novel prognostic biomarker for advanced DDLPS.

AB  - Social stress and unhealthy diets lead to memory impairment, triggering health problems. This study aimed to determine the mitigating effect and regulation mechanism of sea cucumber peptides (SCP) against memory impairment. Here, scopolamine-induced memory impairment in mouse and rat models was used based on behavioral tests, a histological staining technique, Fourier transform infrared microscopy, and gas-chromatographic analysis as well as a Western blotting method. SCP improved the behavioral performance and regulated the disorder of the cholinergic system in mouse models in a dose-dependent manner. Therefore, the underlying mechanism was explored in high-dose SCP using mouse and rat models. SCP repaired damaged neuronal cells, enhanced the Nissl body number, increased the unsaturated lipid level, and activated the long-term potentiation (LTP) pathway (p-CaMKII, p-CREB, and BDNF), both in the mouse and rat hippocampus. The results indicated that SCP upregulated the LTP pathway and unsaturated lipid level to combat scopolamine-induced memory impairment, suggesting that SCP was a potential candidate for neurological recovery.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of Lactobacillus brevis-fermented gamma-aminobutyric acid (LB-GABA) on depressive and anxiety-like behaviors with the underlying molecular mechanism in a chronic stress model of BALB/c mice. LB-GABA attenuates both neuronal cell death and the increase of monoamine oxidase activity induced by hydrogen peroxide. Behavioral tests revealed that GABA significantly increased sucrose preference and reduced immobility time in both tail suspension and forced swimming tests. LB-GABA increased exploration of the open arms in the elevated plus maze and restored activity in the open field. Moreover, LB-GABA lowered stress hormone and inflammatory mediator levels. Mechanistically, LB-GABA increased protein levels of BDNF and TrkB, activating downstream targets (AKT, ERK, and CREB), crucial for neuronal survival and plasticity. Furthermore, LB-GABA protected hippocampal neurons from stress-induced cell death and increased serotonin and dopamine levels. Overall, LB-GABA has the potential to alleviate stress-induced depression and anxiety-like symptoms and neuroinflammation by activating the BDNF-TrkB signaling pathway.

AB  - There are numerous cultivars of tea (Camellia sinensis L.), but the differences in their anti-hyperglycemic-related effects are largely unknown. The inhibition of the dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-IV enzyme plays an essential role in controlling hyperglycemia in diabetes by blocking the degradation of incretin hormones, which is necessary for insulin secretion. In this study, we examined the DPP-IV inhibitory activity of leaf extracts from diverse Japanese green tea cultivars. The inhibitory rates differed among tea extracts. Metabolic profiling (MP), using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, of all cultivars revealed compositional differences among cultivars according to their DPP-IV inhibitory capacity. Epigallocatechin-3-O-(3-O-methyl)gallate, kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside, myricetin-3-O-glucoside/galactoside, and theogallin were newly identified as DPP-IV inhibitors. The bioactivity of a tea extract was potentiated by adding these ingredients in combination. Our results show that MP is a useful approach for evaluating the DPP-IV inhibitory potency of green tea and for determining bioactivity-related ingredients and combinations.

AB  - Previous studies have shown that abnormal aggregation of alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) protein is a major trigger of neurodegenerative diseases. The expression level of alpha-syn in different brain regions and the disease-susceptible regions varies with the development of the disease. The expression pattern of the alpha-syn protein in mouse brain has been precisely described in the literature. Some studies have also reported the ubiquitous expression of the alpha-syn protein in the central and peripheral in nonhuman primates (NHPs). However, little is known about the expression pattern of alpha-syn in the brain or in the primary organs of NHPs. Here, we investigated the expression profile of alpha-syn in different brain regions and the primary organs of NHPs. The alpha-syn protein was mainly distributed in layers III and V of the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus. In addition, strong immunofluorescent signals were detected in the striatum and the substantia nigra, especially in the globus pallidus and the substantia nigra pars compacta, where the expression was significantly and particularly strong, compared with that in the cerebellum or the cortex. In the cerebellum, intense alpha-syn signal was observed in the molecular layer, where it was significantly higher than in the nucleus or the medulla. In the brain, the alpha-syn was always detected both in the cytoplasm and the synapses. Additionally, the alpha-syn was widely expressed in primary organs. The alpha-syn signal was higher in the liver and small intestine than in the spleen. Thus, the regions displaying the highest alpha-syn expression are also those affected during the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. These results may provide basic reference data for the study of multi-systemic mechanism of neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - We investigated the protective effect of walnut peptides and YVPFPLP (YP-7) on scopolamine-induced memory impairment in mice and beta-amyloid (A beta)-induced excitotoxic injury in primary hippocampal neurons, respectively. Additionally, the protective mechanism of YP-7 on neuronal excitotoxicity was explored. Mouse behavioral and hippocampal slice morphology experiments indicate that YP-7 improves the learning and memory abilities of cognitively impaired mice and protects synaptic integrity. Immunofluorescence, western blotting, and electrophysiological experiments on primary hippocampal neurons indicate that YP-7 inhibits neuronal damage caused by excessive excitation of neurons induced by A beta. HT-22 cell treatment with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) activators and inhibitors showed that YP-7 activates PPAR gamma expression and maintains normal neuronal function by forming stable complexes with PPAR gamma to inhibit the extracellular regulated protein kinase pathway. Therefore, YP-7 can ameliorate glutamate-induced excitotoxicity and maintain neuronal signaling. This provides a theoretical basis for active peptides to ameliorate excitotoxicity and the development of functional foods.

AB  - Radioprotective agents hold clinical promises to counteract off-target adverse effects of radiation and benefit radiotherapeutic outcomes, yet the inability to control drug transport in human organs poses a leading limitation. Based upon a validated rank-based multigene signature model, radiosensitivity indices are evaluated of diverse normal organs as a genomic predictor of radiation susceptibility. Selective ORgan-Targeting (SORT) hafnium oxide nanoparticles (HfO2 NPs) are rationally designed via modulated synthesis by alpha-lactalbumin, homing to top vulnerable organs. HfO2 NPs like Hensify are commonly radioenhancers, but SORT HfO2 NPs exhibit surprising radioprotective effects dictated by unfolded ligands and Hf(0)/Hf(IV) redox couples. Still, the X-ray attenuation patterns allow radiological confirmation in target organs by dual-beam spectral computed tomography. SORT HfO2 NPs present potent antioxidant activities, catalytically scavenge reactive oxygen species, and mimic multienzyme catalytic activities. Consequently, SORT NPs rescue radiation-induced DNA damage in mouse and rabbit models and provide survival benefits upon lethal exposures. In addition to inhibiting radiation-induced mitochondrial apoptosis, SORT NPs impede DNA damage and inflammation by attenuating activated FoxO, Hippo, TNF, and MAPK interactive cascades. A universal methodology is proposed to reverse radioenhancers into radioprotectors. SORT radioprotective agents with image guidance are envisioned as compelling in personalized shielding from radiation deposition.
   Commonly known as radioenhancers, HfO2 nanoparticles reported in the study present surprising radioprotection in mice and rabbits, along with selective organ-targeting through fine-tuned synthesis. These multienzyme-mimicking agents can be visualized by spectral computed tomography with improved half-life and stability over amifostine. The protective mechanisms involve inhibiting DNA damage and inflammation and attenuating activated FoxO, Hippo, TNF, and MAPK interactive cascades.image

AB  - Herein, cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) from Camellia oleifera Abel seed shell (COASS) were prepared to strengthen starch-based films for extending shrimp shelf life. The morphology, crystal structure and thermal properties of CNCs were characterised. The rheological properties, moisture distribution and micro-morphology of the filmforming solution were analysed. The mechanical properties, water vapour/oxygen permeability, formation mechanism and shrimp preservation of the CNC-starch films were investigated. COASS-CNCs had a type I cellulose structure. The crystal granules were rod-shaped, with an average length of 135.91 nm and a width of 11.55 nm. The rheological properties, moisture distribution and micro-morphology suggested that the addition of COASS-CNCs improved the matrix network structure and stabilised the moisture of the film-forming solution. When COASS-CNCs were added at 8 %, the tensile strength, water vapour permeability and oxygen barrier ability of the composite film increased by 71.96 %, 16.20 % and 34.29 %, respectively. Molecular docking technology shows that the number of hydrogen bonds in the system increases with the increase of COASS-CNCs, accompanied by a phase transition behavior, the binding free energy reaches the maximum with 6 % COASS-CNCs addition. The composite film has potential applications in shrimp preservation. This study provides another reference for the practical application of COASS-CNCs in biodegradable films.

AB  - In this study, we investigated the mechanisms through which astrocyte-derived exosomes (AS-Exos) alleviate traumatic brain injury (TBI)-induced neuronal defects in TBI model rats and mice. Treatment with AS-Exos alleviated neurobehavioral deficits, cognitive impairment, and brain edema in TBI rats. AS-Exos also significantly reduced neuronal cell loss and atrophy in the TBI rats. AS-Exos significantly reduced oxidative stress and mitochondrial H2O2 levels by increasing the activity of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) in the hippocampal neurons of TBI rats. TUNEL-staining assays showed that AS-Exos significantly reduced TBI-induced neuronal apoptosis. Mechanistically, AS-Exos ameliorated oxidative stress by activating Nrf2/HO-1 signaling in the hippocampus of TBI rats. In addition, the neuroprotective effects of AS-Exos were abrogated in brain-specific Nrf2-knockout mice subjected to TBI. These findings demonstrate that AS-Exos protects against TBI-induced oxidative stress and neuronal apoptosis by activating Nrf2 signaling in both rat and mouse models.

AB  - Background Cerebral apoplexy is currently the main cause of mortality and disability globally. LncRNAs play important roles in the pathophysiological process of cerebral apoplexy and the effect of LncRNA SNHG14 on cerebral apoplexy remain unclear.
   Objective Here, we investigated the biological function of LncRNA SNHG14 in cerebral apoplexy and underlying molecular mechanisms.
   Results Patients with cerebral apoplexy and normal volunteers were collected. Mouse hippocampal (HT-22) cells were then placed into a hypoxic incubator with 1% O-2, 5% CO2, and 94% N-2 for cerebral apoplexy. LncRNA SNHG14 was overexpressed in patients with cerebral apoplexy. LncRNA SNHG14 was found to induce inflammation in vitro model of cerebral apoplexy via the inhibition of miR-124-3p/TRAF6 axis. In addition, the down-regulation of LncRNA SNHG14 reduced inflammation in vitro model of cerebral apoplexy via the induction of miR-124-3p/TRAF6 axis.
   Conclusion LncRNA SNHG14 plays a crucial role in inflammation of cerebral apoplexy by miR-124-3p/TRAF6 axis, thereby it may be a promising therapeutic target for cerebral apoplexy.

AB  - Flavonol glycosides, contributing to the health benefits and distinctive flavors of tea (Camellia sinensis), accumulate predominantly as diglycosides and triglycosides in tea leaves. However, the UDP-glycosyltransferases (UGTs) mediating flavonol multiglycosylation remain largely uncharacterized. In this study, we employed an integrated proteomic and metabolomic strategy to identify and characterize key UGTs involved in flavonol triglycoside biosynthesis. The recombinant rCsUGT75AJ1 exhibited flavonoid 4 '-O-glucosyltransferase activity, while rCsUGT75L72 preferentially catalyzed 3-OH glucosylation. Notably, rCsUGT73AC15 displayed substrate promiscuity and regioselectivity, enabling glucosylation of rutin at multiple sites and kaempferol 3-O-rutinoside (K3R) at the 7-OH position. Kinetic analysis revealed rCsUGT73AC15's high affinity for rutin (K-m = 9.64 mu M). Across cultivars, CsUGT73AC15 expression inversely correlated with rutin levels. Moreover, transient CsUGT73AC15 silencing increased rutin and K3R accumulation while decreasing their respective triglycosides in tea plants. This study offers new mechanistic insights into the key roles of UGTs in regulating flavonol triglycosylation in tea plants.

AB  - Epigenetic mechanisms that dysregulate gene expressions may play a significant role in the development of neurological disorders. However, whether peptides can modulate epigenetic mechanisms remains elusive. This work aimed to investigate the impact of pretreatment with walnut-derived peptides-WHP and YVLLPSPK-on DNA methylation in a low-grade neuroinflammation model. The enriched KEGG pathways included oxidative phosphorylation, riboflavin metabolism, ribosome, and pyrimidine metabolism, which are associated with methylation modification by oral administration of YVLLPSPK in mice with scopolamine-induced cognitive deficits. Furthermore, when THP-1 cells (human acute monocytic leukemia cell line) were exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation responses, both WHP and YVLLPSPK markedly inhibited the level of Il-6 to 2.05 +/- 0.76 and 1.29 +/- 0.19 (p < 0.05) and also declined the mRNA expression of Mcp-1 to 1.64 +/- 0.02 and 3.29 +/- 1.21 (p < 0.01), respectively. Meanwhile, YVLLPSPK decreased the activities of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) to 1.03 +/- 0.02 and 1.20 +/- 0.31 (p < 0.05) based on Dnmt3b and Tet2, respectively. The results indicated that YVLLPSPK modulated DNA methylation in embryonic and neural precursor cells in creating new methylation patterns. Further trials are needed to assess the mechanisms underlying DNA methylation changes through peptides in the pathophysiology of neurological disorders.

AB  - In plant-insect coevolution, xanthotoxin serves as a widespread phytochemical defense against herbivores. This study aims to elucidate xanthotoxin detoxification mechanisms in the polyphagous pest Spodoptera litura. Genomic analyses revealed an expanded carboxylesterase (COE) cluster on chromosome 2, exhibiting xanthotoxin-inducible expression in detoxification tissues. Knockdown of ten COEs significantly increased larval sensitivity to xanthotoxin, while molecular docking confirmed stable xanthotoxin-COE binding. Heterologous expression of four COEs in Escherichia coli conferred bacterial tolerance to xanthotoxin, with three isoforms demonstrating direct metabolic clearance of xanthotoxin in vitro. Mechanistic exploration identified the transcription factors CncC and MafK as critical regulators in modulating larval xanthotoxin tolerance through the coordinated activation of COE expression. Functional validation via dual-luciferase reporter assays established direct transcriptional regulation of three COE promoters through CncC/Maf binding element interactions. Our findings systematically decode both enzymatic detoxification and upstream regulatory networks, revealing how lepidopteran pests adapt to plant chemical defenses through COE pathway specialization.

AB  - Tea (Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze) is a highly selenium enrichment capacity plant; high selenium concentration contributes to the occurrence of oxidative stress and protein misfolding in tea plants, whereas flavonoids can chelate heavy metals to protect plants from oxidative stress caused by metal exposure. Nevertheless, the role of catechins in flavonoid synthesis and nutrient metabolism under selenium stress remains unidentified. Combining Word2vec and HNSW utilizing UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap HRMS-MS/MS to implement rapid matching annotation of the structural information on metabolites in Fu tea, we found that selenium-mediated changes in catechins in Fu tea were mainly associated with flavonoid biosynthesis pathways. The results demonstrated that selenium treatment increased benign selenol analogues (glutathioselenol) in tea and identified the novel selenopeptide PRSeMW (m/z 636.22571, Pro-Arg-SeMet-Trp) in selenium-enriched Fu tea samples to enhance the health benefits of tea. The selenium levels were negatively correlated with N-5-ethyl-l-glutamine (11.63 to 4.26 mg kg(-1)) and (-)-epigallocatechin (13.26 to 11.19 mg kg(-1)), increasing the accumulation of tea polyphenols ((-)-catechin gallate, (-)-epigallocatechin 3-gallate, and (+)-gallocatechin), and decreasing the level of caffeine. These discoveries provide new insights into the mechanism of tea polyphenol-mediated transformation of selenium in Fu tea and theoretical support for the quality assessment of selenium-enriched tea.

AB  - Plant secondary metabolites are critical quality-conferring compositions of plant-derived beverages, medicines, and industrial materials. The accumulations of secondary metabolites are highly variable among seasons; however, the underlying regulatory mechanism remains unclear, especially in epigenetic regulation. Here, we used tea plants to explore an important epigenetic mark DNA methylation (5mC)-mediated regulation of plant secondary metabolism in different seasons. Multiple omics analyses were performed on spring and summer new shoots. The results showed that flavonoids and theanine metabolism dominated in the metabolic response to seasons in the new shoots. In summer new shoots, the genes encoding DNA methyltransferases and demethylases were up-regulated, and the global CG and CHG methylation reduced and CHH methylation increased. 5mC methylation in promoter and gene body regions influenced the seasonal response of gene expression; the amplitude of 5mC methylation was highly correlated with that of gene transcriptions. These differentially methylated genes included those encoding enzymes and transcription factors which play important roles in flavonoid and theanine metabolic pathways. The regulatory role of 5mC methylation was further verified by applying a DNA methylation inhibitor. These findings highlight that dynamic DNA methylation plays an important role in seasonal-dependent secondary metabolism and provide new insights for improving tea quality.

AB  - BACKGROUND Water-soluble fluoride (WS-F) can be absorbed directly by tea plants from soil and comprises a major source of dietary F in tea consumers. To reveal the WS-F accumulation in tea leaves and assess WS-F health risks, 70 sets of samples including tea leaves at three maturity stages and corresponding topsoil were collected from Xinyang, China. The WS-F contents in tea samples and pH values in soil samples were determined. RESULTS The contents of WS-F in tea leaves exhibited a positive correlation with leaf maturity. The contents of WS-F in tea leaves showed a positive correlation with WS-F contents in the soil as the soil pH value exceeds 5. All the bud with two leaves samples, 84.29% of the third to sixth leaves samples, and 78.57% mature leaves samples in 5-min infusion tend to be no health threat. The leaching characteristics of WS-F from tea leaves were influenced by the leaf maturity and soaking time. CONCLUSION Taking measures to control pH and WS-F concentration of plantations soil, as well as drinking tea infusion made from young leaves or reducing soaking time could decrease the WS-F health risk.

AB  - As the major contributors to the floral odors of tea products, terpenoid volatiles play critical roles in the defense response of plants to multiple stresses. Until now, only a few TPS genes in tea plants (Camellia sinensis) have been functionally validated. In this study, by comparative studies conducted at gene, protein, and metabolite levels during oolong tea processing, we isolated an ocimene synthase gene, CsOCS, which displays a low similarity to previously characterized tea ocimene synthases. Further prokaryotic expression and subcellular localization analysis showed that it is plastid-located and could produce (E)-beta-ocimene and (Z)-beta-ocimene using GPP as the substrate. The optimum temperature and pH of the enzyme were 30 degrees C and 7.5, respectively. Treatment with exogenous methyl jasmonate elevated the transcript level of CsOCS and enhanced the emission of ocimene from tea leaves. Collectively, CsOCS is implicated as a key enzyme for beta-ocimene synthesis during oolong tea processing.

AB  - Basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors play crucial roles in various biological processes and responses to environmental stresses. However, the functions of the bZIP family in tea plants remain largely unexplored. Here, we identified 74 bZIP genes in tea plants (Camellia sinensis) and classified them into 12 phylogenetic groups, supported by analyses of conserved motifs and gene structures. Cis-element analysis provided insights into the potential roles of CsbZIP genes in phytohormone signaling and stress responses. Tissue-specific expression analysis demonstrated differential expression profiles of CsbZIP genes, suggesting their tissue- and stage-specific functions. Additionally, varying expression levels under different abiotic stresses indicated functional divergence of the CsbZIP family during the long-term evolution. Notably, CsbZIP3/42/6 were identified as positive regulators of drought and salt stress responses but negative regulators in response to pathogen infection, and CsbZIP42 could interact with CsbZIP3 and CsbZIP6 in regulating these environmental stresses. This study provides valuable information on potential applications for improving stress tolerance and overall plant health of tea plants.

AB  - Plants have evolved a series of defensive mechanisms against pathogens and herbivores, but the defense response always leads to decreases in growth or reproduction, which has serious implications for agricultural production. Growth and defense are negatively regulated not only through metabolic consumption but also through the antagonism of different phytohormones, such as jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA). Meanwhile, plants can limit the expression of defensive metabolites to reduce the costs of defense by producing constitutive defenses such as glandular trichomes or latex and accumulating specific metabolites, determining the activation of plant defense or the maintenance of plant growth. Interestingly, plant defense pathways might be prepared in advance which may be transmitted to descendants. Plants can also use external organisms to protect themselves, thus minimizing the costs of defense. In addition, plant relatives exhibit cooperation to deal with pathogens and herbivores, which is also a way to regulate growth and defense.

AB  - Interplant interactions mediated by plant-emitted volatile organic compounds (VOCs) occur with heterospecific neighboring plants, making VOC-emitting companion plants a practical tool for pest management. In this study, we investigated the cocultivation of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) with bush basil (Ocimum basilicum L. var. minimum), which induced the expression of defense-related genes, such as pathogenesis-related protein 1, via salicylate signaling in the leaves. This coculture enhanced the defense capacity of P. vulgaris against spider mites (Tetranychus urticae) and field herbivores. Eugenol, one of the major VOCs emitted by bush basil plants, was likely responsible for conferring the antiherbivore activity on the receiver plants. Furthermore, bush basil VOCs were able to prime P. vulgaris plants to attract Phytoseiulus persimilis, a predatory mite of T. urticae, in response to T. urticae attack. Our results suggest a practical use of bush basil as companion plants in organic crop production.

AB  - Using a combination of biochemical, transcriptomic, and physiological analyses, we elucidated the mechanisms of physical and chemical withering of tea shoots subjected to UV-C and ethylene treatments. UV-C irradiation (15 kJ m(-2)) initiated oxidation of catechins into theaflavins, increasing theaflavin-3-monogallate and theaflavin digallate by 5-and 13.2-4.4-fold, respectively, at the end of withering. Concomitantly, a rapid change to brown/red, an increase in electrolyte leakage, and the upregulation of peroxidases (viz. Px2, Px4, and Px6) and polyphenol oxidases (PPO-1) occurred. Exogenous ethylene significantly increased the metabolic rate (40%) and moisture loss (30%) compared to control during simulated withering (12 h at 25 degrees C) and upregulated transcripts associated with responses to dehydration and abiotic stress, such as those in the ethylene signaling pathway (viz. EIN4-like, EIN3-FBox1, and ERFs). Incorporating ethylene during withering could shorten the tea manufacturing process, while UV-C could enhance the accumulation of flavor-related compounds.

AB  - Drought stress severely limits growth and causes losses in the yield of tea plants. Exogenous application of 24-epibrassinolide (EBR) positively regulates drought responses in various plants. However, whether EBR could contribute to drought resistance in tea plants and the underlying mechanisms has not been investigated. Here, we found that EBR application is beneficial for the drought tolerance of tea plants. The transcriptome results revealed that EBR could contribute to tea plant drought resistance by promoting galactinol and abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis gene expression. The content of galactinol was elevated by EBR and EBR-responsive CsDof1.1 positively regulated the expression of the galactinol synthase genes CsGolS2-1 and CsGolS2-2 to contribute to the accumulation of galactinol by directly binding to their promoters. Moreover, exogenous EBR was found to elevate the expression of genes related to ABA signal transduction and stomatal closure regulation, which resulted in the promotion of stomatal closure. In addition, EBR-responsive CsMYC2-2 is involved in ABA accumulation by binding to the promoters CsNCED1 and CsNCED2 to activate their expression. In summary, findings in this study provide knowledge into the transcriptional regulatory mechanism of EBR-induced drought resistance in tea plants.

AB  - Leptinotarsa decemlineata, the Colorado potato beetle (CPB), is a herbivore that primarily feeds on Solanum foliage and is a global pest of the potato agricultural industry. Potato breeding through cross-hybridization with CPB-resistant wild relatives is used for genetic improvement. The wild species Solanum okadae was demonstrated to deter CPB feeding in choice and no choice feeding assays. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used for comparative metabolite profiling between S. okadae and CPB-susceptible domesticated potato variety, Solanum tuberosum cv. Shepody. Major foliar metabolites detected were steroidal glycoalkaloids (SGAs) with tomatine and dehydrotomatine produced in S. okadae and solanine and chaconine in S. tuberosum cv. Shepody. Cardiac glycosides were also detected in the foliar metabolite profile of S. okadae but not S. tuberosum cv. Shepody. This class of plant compounds have known insecticidal activity through inhibition of animal Na+/K+ ATPase. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) separation of foliar extracts also provided evidence for cardiac glycosides in S. okadae. Cardiac glycosides are known inhibitors of Na+/K+ ATPase, and foliar extracts from S. okadae (OKA15), but not S. tuberosum cv. Shepody, were able to inhibit the Na+/K+ ATPase of CPB. These findings suggest a novel mechanism of plant resistance against CPB involving production of cardiac glycosides in S. okadae.

AB  - The aluminum in acid soils is very rhizotoxic to most plant species, but it is essential for root growth and development in Camellia sinensis. However, the molecular basis of Al-mediated signaling pathways in root regeneration of tea plants is largely unclear. In this study, we profiled the physiological phenotype, transcriptome, and phytohormones in the process using stems treated with Al (0.3 mM) and control (0.02 mM). The anatomical analysis showed that the 0.3 mM Al-treated stem began to develop adventitious root (AR) primordia within 7 days, ARs occurred after 21 days, while the control showed a significant delay. We further found that the expression patterns of many genes involved in the biosynthesis of ZT, ACC, and JA were stimulated by Al on day 3; also, the expression profiles of auxin transporter-related genes were markedly increased under Al during the whole rooting process. Moreover, the expression of these genes was strongly correlated with the accumulation of ZT, ACC, JA, and IAA. CsERFs, CsMYBs, and CsWRKYs transcription factor genes with possible crucial roles in regulating AR regeneration were also uncovered. Our findings suggest that multiple phytohormones and genes related to their biosynthesis form a hierarchical transcriptional cascade during Al-induced de novo root regeneration in tea nodal cuttings.

AB  - In the 1820s, five large egos personified by four scholars and an amateur from outside academia made significant contributions to, and reputations from, the study of five large fossil reptiles. The outsider, Gideon Mantell (1790-1852) rose through the class system and overcame scientific prejudices to make his name by describing Iguanodon. It was his wife Mary Ann Mantell (1795-1869), however, who truly discovered the first wedgeshaped teeth which enabled the creature's herbivorous nature to be determined. Her famous country walk is verified by a credible newspaper account which gives further details regarding the site and probable date of the find. The Mantells did not discover Megalosaurus; however, they obtained undiagnostic pieces of saurians that were much later to be identified as completely unrelated theropod dinosaurs. The general similarity of these fossils to the 'Stonesfield Animal' prompted William Buckland (1784-1856) to publish what is regarded in retrospect as the first scientific description of a dinosaur. Evidence is provided which shows that the 'fossilist' Richard Anning (1766-1810) of Lyme Regis had an apprentice, and was amore serious vendor of fossils than has hitherto been realised. William Conybeare (1787-1857) was directly involved in the naming of most of these reptiles, excelling in his description of Plesiosaurus and, with fellow savant Henry De la Beche (1796-1855), elucidating the detailed anatomical characters of Ichthyosaurus. Working in Paris, Georges Cuvier (1769-1832) can be seen as a highly influential and generous collaborator who offered his opinions freely to the English geologists. He correctly interpreted the general taxonomic identity of the enigmatic animals ultimately named as Iguanodon and Megalosaurus. This paper presents new data regarding these pioneers in 'saurian' research, with a personal and retrospective overview of the politics in palaeontology, a competitive science.

AB  - Natural food preservatives are being sought extensively as a safe alternative to chemical food preservatives. This study aimed to identify potential natural preservatives from herbs using single-photon ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SPI-TOF-MS). Five Artemisia species and four other herbs were analyzed, and the random forest (RF) algorithm was used to simulate olfaction and distinguish the Artemisia species by identifying the characteristic peaks of volatile terpenoids (VTPs). Results showed that the terpenoid synthase (TPS) gene family was expanded in Artemisia species, potentially contributing to the increased production of VTPs, which have potential as natural preservatives and specifically identify these species. The limits of detections (LODs) for principle VTPs in Artemisia species were as low as 22-39 parts-per-trillion-by-volume (pptv) using SPI-TOF-MS. This study highlights the potential for headspace mass spectrometry to be used in the development of natural preservatives and the identification of plant species.

AB  - The neurotoxicity of bisphenol A (BPA) exposure has been confirmed in vitro and in vivo, and inflammatory response is considered the main pathway. Green tea is a healthy life habit as it is rich in various anti-inflammatory components. To confirm that green tea diet is an effective measure to antagonize BPA-induced neurotoxicity, mice were treated with 0.5 and 5000 mu g/kg/day of BPA from postnatal days (PNDs) 10-50 and supplemented with green tea on PND 21. From PND 51, behavioral tests were conducted on mice to assess their emotional, cognitive, and spatial learning memory capabilities. The open field test and elevated plus maze test indicated anxiety-like behaviors induced by BPA. Interestingly, green tea diet significantly alleviated BPA-induced anxiety-like behaviors. Meanwhile, the green tea diet effectively reversed BPA-induced microglia activation and morphological changes in the hippocampus of mice. Molecularly, green tea inhibited hippocampal neuroinflammation of mice by reducing BPA-induced expressions of NLRP3, ASC, cleaved-caspase-1, GSDMD-N, IL-6, and IL-1 beta, as well as significantly reducing the expression of Bak1, Bax, caspase-9, and Cytc c genes (p < 0.05). Molecular docking suggests that various anti-inflammatory components of green tea can competitively bind to the estrogen receptors with BPA. In general, a green tea diet alleviates BPA-induced emotional disorders by inhibiting microglial polarization and hippocampal pyroptosis, indicating its effective antagonistic ability against the neurotoxicity induced by environmental BPA exposure.

AB  - Indirect defense is an important strategy employed by sessile plants to defend against herbivorous insects by recruiting the natural enemies of herbivores mediated by herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs). We aimed to determine whether indirect defense occurs in Compositae with Chrysanthemum morifolium as the model and elucidate the mechanisms underlying the biosynthesis of HIPVs. Using two-choice olfactometer bioassays, we showed that C. morifolium plants following infestation by larvae of the tobacco cutworm (Spodoptera litura, TCW) were significantly more attractive to two natural enemies of TCW larvae than control plants, indicating that indirect defense is an active defense strategy of C. morifolium. The chemical cue responsible for indirect defense in C. morifolium was identified as a complex blend of volatiles predominated by sesquiterpenes and monoterpenes. A total of 11 candidate terpene synthase (TPS) genes were identified by comparing the transcriptomes of healthy and TCW-infested plants. Gene expression analysis confirmed that up-regulated CmjTPS genes are consistent with the elevated emission of terpenes after herbivory treatment. Our study showed that the herbivore-induced emission of JA-dependent volatile terpenes attracted both predatory and parasitic enemies of herbivores. Generally, our findings indicate that indirect defense might be an important defense mechanism against insects in C. morifolium.

AB  - Pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) have been detected in tea and can threaten human health. However, the specific source of PAs in tea is still unclear. Here, 88 dried tea products collected from six major tea-producing areas in Anhui Province, China, were analyzed. The detection frequency was 76%. The content of total PAs in dried tea was between 1.1 and 90.5 mu g/kg, which was all below the MRL recommended by the European Union (150 mu g/kg). In the Shexian tea garden, PAs in the weeds and weed rhizospheric soil around tea plants and the fresh tea leaves were analyzed. Intermedine (Im), intermedine-N-oxide (ImNO), and jacobine-N-oxide (JbNO) were transferred through the weed-to-soil-to-tea route into the fresh tea leaves; only Im and ImNO were detected in dried tea samples. Potential risk of the total PAs in the tea infusion was assessed according to the margin of exposure method, and it might be a low concern for public health.

AB  - Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) contain unique information about infection of plants; thus, they can be used as reliable biomarkers for plant diseases. Among various VOCs, methyl salicylate (MeSA) is released abundantly during pathogenic infections because MeSA is emitted not only at the infected site but also throughout the whole plant as a systemic response. In this work, 4-mercaptophenylboronic acid (MPBA) functionalized Au nanoparticles were employed as a probe for MeSA vapor sensing via surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectroscopy. The SERS sensors can detect MeSA as low as 0.608 ppb (S/N of 3) with excellent intra- and interassay reproducibility. The origin of Raman signal change was attributed to the weak, reversible intermolecular interaction between MPBA and MeSA. This study demonstrates that the SERS sensing platform holds great promise in noninvasive and fast monitoring of volatile biomarkers for crop health.

AB  - Insect adaptation to toxic cardenolides has been a model system to study convergent evolution between plants and herbivores. It was hypothesized that Organic anion-transporting polypeptides (Oatps) and multidrug transporters (Mdrs) provide basal resistance against cardenolides in a nonadapted insect. However, there is still little evidence to support this hypothesis. A noncardenolide feeder and an important rice pest, Nilaparvata lugens, were used to test this hypothesis. Bioassays revealed that two representative cardenolides, ouabain, and digoxin, demonstrated significant toxicity against N. lugens. The suppression of the expression levels of six Oatp genes and three Mdr genes by the RNAi did not result in any significant lethal phenotype in N. lugens. However, the knockdown of certain Oatp and Mdr genes significantly enhances the oral toxicity of ouabain and digoxin to N. lugens. The findings of our study support that Oatps and Mdrs are key transporters in N. lugens protection against dietary cardenolides.

AB  - A total of 12 OBPs were identified in the antennae of ladybird Hippodamia variegata. HvarOBP1/2/5/6/10/11 were highly expressed in adults, whereas HvarOBP3/4/7/8/9/12 had higher expression levels in larvae. In adults, HvarOBP1/2/4/5/6/7/ 8/11/12 were highly expressed in antennae. Among these, recombinant HvarOBP5 strong bound with (E)-beta-farnesene (E beta F), (R)-(+)-limonene, (E,E)-4,8,12-trimethyltrideca-l,3,7,11-tetraene (TMTT), (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene (DMNT), hexyl hexanoate, and geranyl acetate. Molecular docking indicated that Leu42, Lys43, and His64 were the key binding sites of HvarOBP5. All six ligands evoked electroantennography (EAG) responses in ladybirds. Moreover, (R)-(+)-limonene and hexyl hexanoate were attractive to both sexes. After RNA interference for 72 h, the EAGs of dsRNA-injected ladybirds to DMNT and hexyl hexanoate were significantly decreased by 73.8 and 78.6%, respectively. Both dsRNA-injected males and females showed significantly lower behavioral preferences for DMNT and hexyl hexanoate. These findings suggest that HvarOBP5 in H. variegata plays an important role in the perception of semiochemical cues from preys and habitat plants.

AB  - Tea (Camellia sinensis) flowers emit a large amount of volatiles that attract pollinators. However, few studies have characterized temporal and spatial variation in tea floral volatiles. To investigate the distribution of volatiles within tea flowers and their variation among opening stages, volatile components from different parts of tea flowers and different opening stages were collected by headspace solid-phase microextraction and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. A total of 51 volatile compounds of eight chemical classes were identified in the tea flowers. Volatile compounds were most abundant in tea flowers of the Shuchazao cultivar. Acetophenone, 1-phenylethanol, 2-phenylethanol, and benzyl alcohol were the most abundant volatiles. Terpenes were common in the sepals, and benzoids were common in the stamens. The fatty acid derivatives were mainly distributed in the pistils and receptacles and were less abundant in the petals, sepals, and stamens. During the opening phase of tea flowers, the volatile content increased 12-fold, which mainly stemmed from the increase in benzoids. These results enhance our understanding of the formation of volatiles in tea flowers.

AB  - Herbivorousinsects are well known for detoxifying abroad rangeof the defense compounds produced by the plants that they feed on,but knowledge of the mechanisms of detoxification is still very limited.Here, we describe a system in which two species of lepidopteran caterpillarsmetabolize an abietane diterpene from the plants of Nepeta stewartiana Diels to an oxygenated derivativethat is less active biologically. We found that this transformationcould be catalyzed by a cytochrome P450 enzyme in caterpillars, whichare associated with molting. Most interestingly, abietane diterpenetargets the molting-associated gene CYP306A1 to alterthe content of molting hormones in the insect at specific developmentalstages and competitively inhibit molting hormone metabolism. Thesefindings identify the mechanism by which caterpillars are able todetoxify abietane diterpenoid through hydroxylation at the C-19 position,which may be opening up exciting research questions into the mechanismsof interaction between plants and insects.

AB  - Insecticides tolerance in herbivorous arthropods is associated with preadaptation to host plant allelochemicals. However, how plant secondary metabolites activate detoxifying metabolic genes to develop tolerance remains unclear. Herein, the tolerance of Spodoptera litura larvae to cyantraniliprole was increased after nicotine exposure. An S. litura alpha esterase, SlCOE030, was predominantly expressed in the midgut and induced after exposure to cyantraniliprole, nicotine, and cyantraniliprole plus nicotine. Drosophila melanogaster with ectopically overexpressed SlCOE030 enhanced cyantraniliprole and nicotine tolerance by 4.91-and 2.12-fold, respectively. Compared to UAS-SlCOE030 and Esg-GAL4 lines, the Esg > SlCOE030 line laid more eggs after nicotine exposure. SlCOE030 knockdown decreased the sensitivity of nicotine-treated S. litura larvae to cyantraniliprole. Metabolism assays indicated that recombinant SlCOE030 protein metabolizes cyantraniliprole. Homology modeling and molecular docking analysis demonstrated that SlCOE030 exhibits effective affinities for cyantraniliprole and nicotine. Thus, insect CarEs may result in the development of cross-tolerance between synthetic insecticides and plant secondary metabolites.

AB  - Aneuploidy, having an aberrant genome, is gaining increasing attention in neurodegenerative diseases. It gives rise to proteotoxic stress as well as a stereotypical oxidative shift which makes these cells sensitive to internal and environmental stresses. A growing body of research from numerous laboratories suggests that many neurodegenerative disorders, especially Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia, are characterised by neuronal aneuploidy and the ensuing apoptosis, which may contribute to neuronal loss. Using Drosophila as a model, we investigated the effect of induced aneuploidy in GABAergic neurons. We found an increased proportion of aneuploidy due to Mad2 depletion in the third-instar larval brain and increased cell death. Depletion of Mad2 in GABAergic neurons also gave a defective climbing and seizure phenotype. Feeding animals an antioxidant rescued the climbing and seizure phenotype. These findings suggest that increased aneuploidy leads to higher oxidative stress in GABAergic neurons which causes cell death, climbing defects, and seizure phenotype. Antioxidant feeding represents a potential therapy to reduce the aneuploidy-driven neurological phenotype.

AB  - Noisy tinnitus is a common auditory system disease characterized by persistent tinnitus symptoms. The TLR4/NF- kappa B/NLRP3 signaling pathway plays an important role in neuroinflammatory response. Select 6 control and 6 noise exposed mice for transcriptome sequencing analysis in the hippocampus, conduct high-throughput data analysis, identify differentially expressed genes, and screen for pathways. Auditory brainstem response (ABR) detection was performed to understand the hearing changes, and the modeling effect was evaluated using the GPIAS% inhibition experiment of auditory startle reflex. Morphological observation of the basement membrane was performed to determine whether the inner hair cells were damaged. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence were used to determine the activation of microglia in the hippocampus of noise induced tinnitus mice. Finally, qPCR and Western Blot were used to detect the expression of TLR4, NF kB, NLRP3, caspase-1, and IL-1 (3 in the hippocampus of each group of mice. Through high-throughput data analysis, it was found that there was no significant difference in the auditory threshold of the three groups of mice; After 2 h of exposure to 100 dB SPL noise, the GPIAS% of mice decreased significantly compared to before exposure, and membrane construction was successful. After 7 days, the GPIAS% of the drug intervention group increased. After noise exposure, mice developed tinnitus, and hippocampus neuroinflammation. Roflupram can inhibit neuroinflammation and improve tinnitus through the TLR4/NF kB/NLRP3/caspase-1/IL-1 (3 signaling pathway.

AB  - The identity of the mechanism that controls aggressive behavior in rodents is unclear. Serotonin (5-HT) and GABA are associated with aggressive behavior in rodents. However, the regulatory relationship between these chemicals in the different brain regions of rats has not been fully defined. This study aimed to clarify the role of GABABR1 in DRN-mediated GABA to regulate 5-HT expression in multiple brain regions in male rats with high and low aggressive behavior. Rat models of highly and less aggressive behavior were established through social isolation plus resident intruder. On this basis, GABA content in the DRN and 5-HT contents in the PFC, hypothalamus, hippocampus and DRN were detected using ELISA. Co-expression of 5-HT and GB1 in the DRN was detected by immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy at the tissue and subcellular levels, respectively. GB1-specific agonist baclofen and GB1-specific inhibitor CGP35348 were injected into the DRN by stereotaxic injection. Changes in 5-HT levels in the PFC, hypothalamus and hippocampus were detected afterward. After modeling, rats with highly aggressive behavior exhibited higher aggressive behavior scores, shorter latencies of aggression, and higher total distances in the open field test than rats with less aggressive behavior. The contents of 5-HT in the PFC, hypothalamus and hippocampus of rats with high and low aggressive behavior (no difference between the two groups) were significantly decreased, but the change in GABA content in the DRN was the opposite. GB1 granules could be found on synaptic membranes containing 5-HT granules, which indicated that 5-HT neurons in the DRN co-expressed with GB1, which also occurred in double immunofluorescence results. At the same time, we found that the expression of GB1 in the DRN of rats with high and low aggressive behavior was significantly increased, and the expression of GB1 in the DRN of rats with low aggressive behavior was significantly higher than that in rats with high aggressive behavior. Nevertheless, the expression of 5-HT in DRN was opposite in these two groups. After microinjection of baclofen into the DRN, the 5-HT contents in the PFC, hypothalamus and hippocampus of rats in each group decreased significantly. In contrast, the 5-HT contents in the PFC, hypothalamus and hippocampus of rats in each group increased significantly after injection with CGP35348. The significant increase in GABA in the DRN combined with the significant increase in GB1 in the DRN further mediated the synaptic inhibition effect, which reduced the 5-HT level of 5-HT neurons in the DRN, resulting in a significant decrease in 5-HT levels in the PFC, hypothalamus and hippocampus. Therefore, GB1mediated GABA regulation of 5-HT levels in the PFC, hypothalamus and hippocampus is one of the mechanisms of highly and less aggressive behavior originating in the DRN. The increased GB1 level in the DRN of LAbehavior rats exhibited a greater degree of change than in the HA-group rats, which indicated that differently decreased 5-HT levels in the DRN may be the internal mechanisms of high and low aggression behaviors.

AB  - Simple Summary: To investigate the relationship between some infectious diseases (Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis, Chlamydiophila abortus, Neospora caninum, bovine viral diarrhea virus, and the bovine herpesvirus) and the dairy farms' welfare scores, 36 dairy farms were monitored using the Italian National Animal Welfare Reference Center (CreNBA) checklist. Farms and their animals were scored in five different areas, namely: Area A, "Farm management and personnel "; Area B, "Facilities and equipment "; Area C, "Animal-based measures "; Area D, "Inspection of microclimatic environmental conditions and alarm systems "; and Area E, "Biosecurity ". The recorded scores were compared between two farming conditions (access to pasture and indoor housing) and correlated with the serum data. Our results indicated that an accurate application of the checklist could be an instrument to prevent and control the spread of infections in dairy farms. The present study assessed dairy cow welfare through the application of the Italian National Animal Welfare Reference Center (CReNBA) checklist in 36 dairy farms located in Ragusa (Italy) subjected to two different management conditions, housing with free access to pasture (Group 1, farms n = 17) and indoor housing (Group 2, farms n = 19). Five areas of investigation were considered: Area A, "Farm management and personnel "; Area B, "Facilities and equipment "; Area C, "Animal-based measures "; Area D, "Inspection of microclimatic environmental conditions and alarm systems "; and Area E, "Biosecurity ". Blood samples were collected by coccygeal venipuncture from all animals (4081 cows). The specific antibodies against Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis, Chlamydiophila abortus, Neospora caninum, bovine viral diarrhea virus, and the bovine herpesvirus were assessed by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) serological test. Group 1 (access to pasture) showed a lower value of percentage score recorded in Area A (p = 0.02) and E (p = 0.01) than Group 2 (indoor housing). Herpesvirus (Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis - IBR - detection of gB antibodies/IBR-gB) blood concentrations were higher in the cows housed indoor versus those with access to pasture (p = 0.01). Farm management and personnel (score A) was correlated with the level of bovine viral diarrhea virus (tau = 0.3754) and bovine-herpesvirus-specific antibodies (IBR-gB) (tau = 0.4159). "Biosecurity " percentage score showed a significant correlation with Chlamydiophila abortus (tau = -0.4621) in the cows with access to pasture and IBR-gB (tau = 0.3435) in the cows housed fully indoors. Group 2 showed a significantly reduced level of antibodies against Neospora caninum. In conclusion, differences in the welfare assessment score were observed in the "Farm management and personnel " and "Biosecurity " between the two management conditions. It had an effect on the prevalence of herpesvirus, which occurred more in cattle with access to pasture. Therefore, an accurate application of the checklist could be an instrument to prevent and control the spread of infections in farms.

AB  - Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the most common psychiatric disorder. It has a complex and heterogeneous etiology. Most treatments take weeks to show effects and work well only for a fraction of the patients. Thus, new concepts are needed to understand MDD and its dynamics. One of the strong correlates of MDD is increased activity and dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis which produces the stress hormone cortisol. Existing mathematical models of the HPA axis describe its operation on the scale of hours, and thus are unable to explore the dynamic on the scale of weeks that characterizes many aspects of MDD. Here, we propose a mathematical model of MDD on the scale of weeks, a timescale provided by the growth of the HPA hormone glands under control of HPA hormones. We add to this the mutual inhibition of the HPA axis and the hippocampus and other regions of the central nervous system (CNS) that forms a toggle switch. The model shows bistability between euthymic and depressed states, with a slow timescale of weeks in its dynamics. It explains why prolonged but not acute stress can trigger a self-sustaining depressive episode that persists even after the stress is removed. The model explains the weeks timescale for drugs to take effect, as well as the dysregulation of the HPA axis in MDD, based on gland mass changes. This understanding of MDD dynamics may help to guide strategies for treatment.
   Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent psychiatric condition whose mechanisms are not fully understood. Existing treatments often take weeks to be effective and only benefit a portion of patients, necessitating a fresh perspective on understanding MDD. Research has shown a strong association between MDD and the dysregulation of the human stress hormone pathway. However, previous mathematical models of the stress hormone pathway have only explored its dynamics over a few hours or days, not capturing the weeks-long timescale relevant to MDD. To address this, we present a new mathematical model that incorporates the growth of the stress hormone glands, and their mutually inhibitory interactions with the brain. This model reveals how the brain and the stress axis toggle between normal and depressed states, with slow dynamics over weeks. It also explains why prolonged stress-but not brief stress-can trigger a sustained depressive episode. The model further sheds light on why antidepressant drugs take weeks to take effect. By comprehending the dynamics of depression, this model may provide valuable insights for guiding treatment strategies in the future.

KW  - MICROGLIA
AB  - Neuroinflammation, which occurs due to microglia, is related to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. Recently, the development of functional foods that down-regulate over-activated microglial cells to prevent the progression of neurodegenerative disorders has been proposed, since over-activated microglia induce a chronic source of neurotoxic factors and reduce neuronal survival. Thus, the anti-neuroinflammatory effects of a functional food mixture (CCL01) including Cuscuta seeds and Lactobacillus paracasei NK112 on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced experimental models were investigated. In LPS-induced in vitro models, the expression levels of inflammatory mediators (e.g., inducible nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase-2, nitric oxide, and prostaglandin E2) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1 beta, and IL-6) were decreased upon CCL01 treatment. CCL01 showed an anti-neuroinflammatory effect in LPS-induced microglial cells via the inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappa B) pathway and the activation of the nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) pathway. In the LPS-treated in vivo mouse models, the increased expression of ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba-1), which indicates microglial activity, was markedly decreased upon treatment with CCL01 (50 and 200 mg kg(-1)) in the hippocampus and cortex areas of the mouse brains in comparison with the LPS-injected group. In addition, the groups to which CCL01 was administered had significantly decreased plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1 beta, and IL-6 in the LPS-injected mouse models. Our data suggest that CCL01 may be a potential anti-neuroinflammatory agent that can prevent microglia overactivation, and it could be useful for developing functional foods.

AB  - Dysregulation of microRNAs has been implicated in diverse diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). MiR-191-5p in plasma/serum has been identified as a novel and promising noninvasive diagnostic biomarker for AD. However, whether miR-191-5p is involved in AD pathogenesis is largely unknown, and its levels in human AD brains are undetermined. Herein, we demonstrated that miR-191-5p downregulated tau phosphorylation at multiple AD-related sites and promoted neurite outgrowth using immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, and neurite outgrowth assays. Moreover, immunoblotting and enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assays indicated that miR-191-5p decreased amyloid precursor protein phosphorylation levels and beta-amyloid (A beta) generation. Furthermore, miR-191-5p reduced ceramide-induced neuronal cell death analyzed by trypan blue staining, the in situ cell death detection kit, and Annexin V-FITC/PI flow cytometry. Next, we verified that death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1) was a direct target of miR-191-5p through the dual luciferase reporter assay and confirmed that the effects of miR-191-5p were antagonized by restoration of DAPK1 expression. Finally, the hippocampal miR-191-5p level was found to be decreased in humans with AD compared with controls and was inversely correlated with the DAPK1 expression level. Collectively, these findings suggest that miR-191-5p might exert inhibitory effects on tau phosphorylation, A beta secretion, and neuronal cell death by directly targeting DAPK1, providing an attractive therapeutic option for AD.

AB  - Objectives: The aim of the present study was to study the potential therapeutic effects of quercetin in protection against repeated intranasal exposure of an amyloid-beta-induced mouse model. Methods: Mice received intranasal A beta 1-42 (5 mu g/10 mu L) exposure once daily for seven consecutive days. Quercetin was orally administered to them at 30 mg kg-1 and 100 mg kg-1 doses for one week starting from day five following A beta 1-42 peptide administration. Following this, the animals were evaluated for neurobehavioral parameters using a Morris water maze test and a novel object recognition test. Further to this, the biomarkers for neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration were evaluated in the hippocampus and cortex regions of the brain in these animals. Results: Multiple exposures to intranasal A beta led to a significant decline in the learning and cognitive memory of the animals, whereas oral treatment with quercetin at dosages of 30 and 100 mg kg-1 alleviated A beta-induced effects. Quercetin treatment significantly reduced A beta accumulation, oxidative stress and proinflammatory cytokine biomarkers in the brain. In addition, it also alleviated the activation of astrocytic biomarkers, amyloid precursor protein and phosphorylated-tau proteins in the brain. Conclusion: Quercetin was found to be a potent antioxidant, anti-inflammatory compound with protection against neurodegenerative damage and improved learning and cognitive memory in a repeated A beta-exposure model of AD.
   Quercetin exerted antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties to protect brain neuronal health. It also ameliorated A beta deposition, and regulated APP, BACE-1 and tau hyperphosphorylation in brain, and improved neurobehavioral cognitive parameters.

AB  - Simple Summary: Understanding the genetic makeup of microorganisms provides information on their evolutionary relationship with other similar organisms. It also sheds light on their ability to cause disease in susceptible individuals and to resist the hosts' defense mechanisms, including the effects of antimicrobial therapy. In this study, we performed complete genome sequencing and characterization of bacteria called Arcanobacterium hippocoleae, which were isolated from the reproductive tract of infected mares. These bacteria displayed small and large phenotypes when grown on artificial media. The whole genome sequences between the large phenotypes were closely related, while the small and large types were distant from each other in terms of sequence size and identity. Putative genetic elements that might be associated with disease conditions were identified in both bacterial phenotypes. Several genes that express hypothetical proteins with unknown functions were also detected. This study provides the complete genetic structure and analysis of different phenotypes of Arcanobacterium hippocoleae and will serve as a benchmark for future studies to identify the potential function and role of the bacterial proteins in the ability of the bacterium to produce reproductive tract diseases in mares.
   Arcanobacterium hippocoleae is a Gram-positive fastidious bacterium and is occasionally isolated from the reproductive tract of apparently healthy mares (Equus caballus) or from mares with reproductive tract abnormalities. Apart from a few 16S rRNA gene-based GenBank sequences and one recent report on complete genome assembly, detailed genomic sequence and clinical experimental data are not available on the bacterium. Recently, we observed an unusual increase in the detection of the organism from samples associated with mare reproductive failures in Atlantic Canada. Two colony morphotypes (i.e., small, and large) were detected in culture media, which were identified as A. hippocoleae by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Here, we report the whole genome sequencing and characterization of the morphotype variants. The genome length of the large phenotypes was between 2.42 and 2.43, and the small phenotype was 1.99 Mbs. The orthologous nucleotide identity between the large colony phenotypes was similar to 99%, and the large and small colony phenotypes was between 77.86 and 78.52%, which may warrant the classification of the two morphotypes into different species. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA genes or concatenated housekeeping genes grouped the small and large colony variants into two different genotypic clusters. The UvrA protein, which is part of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) system, and 3-isopropoylmalate dehydratase small subunit protein expressed by the leuD gene were identified as potential virulence factors in the large and small colony morphotypes, respectively. However, detailed functional studies will be required to determine the exact roles of these and other identified hypothetical proteins in the cellular metabolism and potential pathogenicity of A. hippocoleae in mares.

AB  - Major depressive disorder (MDD) is considered a major cause of suicide worldwide. As previous studies revealed that neuroinflammation is a significant factor in the etiology of MDD, this study proposed to unravel the possible antidepressant effect of Empagliflozin (EMPA) through targeting miRNA-134 (miR-134)/brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and liver kinase B1 (LKB1)/adenosine 5 '-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) axes in ovariectomized (OVX) female rats. Rats were assigned randomly to four groups: Sham operation (SO), OVX, OVX + EMPA (10 mg/kg/day, p.o.), and OVX + EMPA + Dorsomorphin (DORSO) (25 mu g/day/rat, i.v.). Drugs were administered for 28 days after 2 weeks of surgery. EMPA debilitated OVX-induced depressive-like behavior by mitigating the immobility time in the tail suspension test and forced swimming test. Moreover, EMPA curtailed OVX-induced alterations of serum estradiol, hippocampal serotonin, miR-134 expression, as well as BDNF. EMPA also dwindled OVX-induced changes of hippocampal p-LKB1/LKB1, p-AMPK/AMPK, SIRT1, and inflammatory markers (nuclear factor-kappa-B, interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha). Additionally, the EMPA-treated group exhibited marked improvement in different brain regions' histopathology. However, DORSO coadministration reversed most of EMPA's beneficial effects. The current study displayed the modulatory role of EMPA on miR-134/BDNF and LKB1/AMPK/SIRT1 axes, thus offering a partial explanation of its antidepressant efficacy and proposing EMPA as a novel therapeutic avenue for MDD.

AB  - Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) plays a critical role in neuronal apoptosis along with the aggravation of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that is involved in regulating ER stress in Alzheimer's disease (AD), therefore, this protein could be a promising therapeutic target for AD. Vanadium compounds, such as vanadyl acetylacetonate, sodium metavanadate and bis(maltolato)oxovanadium, are well-known as puissant PPAR gamma modulators. Thus, we are curious whether bis(ethylmaltolato)oxidovanadium (IV) (BEOV) can ameliorate ER stress and subsequent neuronal apoptosis by regulating PPAR gamma in AD models. To this end, we determined the effect of BEOV on behavioral performance, ER stress and neuronal apoptosis in the triple transgenic mouse AD model (3xTg-AD). Our results showed that BEOV improved cognitive abilities and reduced the ER stress- and apoptosis-associated proteins in the brains of 3xTg-AD mice. In vitro administration of BEOV in primary hippocampal neurons and N2asw cells achieved similar results in repressing ER stress. In addition, cotreatment with GW9662 (an antagonist of PPAR gamma) effectively blocked these neuroprotective effects of BEOV, which provided strong evidence that PPAR gamma-dependent signaling plays a key role in protecting against ER stress and neuronal apoptosis in AD. In conclusion, our data demonstrated that BEOV alleviated neuronal apoptosis triggered by ER stress by regulating PPAR gamma in a 3xTg-AD model.

KW  - OXIDATIVE STRESS
AB  - As the population ages, functional dietary supplements are increasingly used to reduce age-related diseases, especially in the field of cognitive impairment. In this study, a thyroxine (Th)-induced aging model was established, and the effect of proanthocyanidins (Pc) on cognitive impairment of aging mice was evaluated based on cognitive ability, neuroinflammation and immune level. The results showed that Pc significantly reduced AchE activity compared to the Model group, improving learning deficits and spatial memory in aged mice (P < 0.01). Further study showed that Pc could maintain the organism's redox balance, markedly increasing T-AOC, GSH, and SOD levels (P < 0.01) while reducing MPO and MDA levels (P < 0.01). Pc also improved systemic inflammation, raising the levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine PF4 and significantly lowering pro-inflammatory factors in the blood (P < 0.01). In the DG region of the hippocampus, Pc effectively repaired nerve damage, inhibited the over-activation of microglia and astrocytes, down-regulated GFAP and IBA-1 proteins (P < 0.01), and then reduced neuroinflammation. Additionally, Pc supplementation also significantly increased the levels of WBC, Lymph, Mid, and Gran in aged mice (P < 0.01), aiding in the recovery of leukocyte counts. At the same time, the CD3(+) level and CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratio were significantly increased (P < 0.01) to maintain the dynamic balance of lymphocyte subsets in aging mice and enhance the immune capacity of aging mice. The study revealed that Pc, as a dietary supplement, can effectively alleviate cognitive impairment in the elderly population. This provides a new dietary nutrition supplement strategy for the health of the aging population.

AB  - The consumption of sweeteners is high around the world. Sweet beverages are one of the most important and popular sources of sweeteners. Previous studies have reported that excessive sweeteners might cause health hazards, including cognitive impairment. Nicotinamide riboside (NR), a precursor of NAD+, has been found to alleviate several cognitive impairments. However, the protective effects of NR against sweetener-induced cognitive impairment remain unclear. Hence, we evaluated the effects of sweeteners and NR (400 mg kg-1 d-1) on the brain and cognition of mice by simulating an extreme lifestyle of completely replacing water with sugar-sweetened beverage (simulated with 10% sucrose solution) or sugar-free sweet beverage (simulated with 0.05% aspartame solution) from weaning to adulthood. The results revealed that continuous exposure to sucrose or aspartame for eight weeks did not significantly cause differences in body weight but significantly induced cognitive impairments, including anxiety- and depressive-like behaviours, impairments in learning, memory and sociability. Moreover, sucrose or aspartame exposure induced neuronal injury, reduction of Nissl bodies, overactivation of the TLR4/NF-kappa B/NLRP3/ASC/Caspase-1 pathway and increased downstream inflammatory cytokines in mouse hippocampus, and also induced an imbalance of oxidative stress, apoptosis and autophagy, large consumptions of intracellular antioxidant factors, and overactivation of the PI3K/Akt/FOXO1 and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways in mouse brain. NR treatment increased NAD+ in the brain, and prevented and alleviated these impairments effectively. In summary, we found that NR supplementation protected against cognitive impairment caused by sucrose or aspartame in immature mice, which might be related to increased brain NAD+ level, relieved neuroinflammation and pyroptosis in the hippocampus, and maintained a balance of oxidative stress, apoptosis and autophagy in the brain.

AB  - Synaptic and cognitive deficits mediated by a severe reduction in excitatory neurotransmission caused by a disproportionate accumulation of the neuronal protein tau in dendritic spines is a fundamental mechanism that has been found repeatedly in models of tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease, Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal dementia, and traumatic brain injury. Synapses thus damaged may contribute to dementia, among the most feared cause of debilitation in the elderly, and currently there are no treatments to repair them. Caspase-2 (Casp2) is an essential component of this pathological cascade. Although it is believed that Casp2 exerts its effects by hydrolyzing tau at aspartate-314, forming Delta tau314, it is also possible that a noncatalytic mechanism is involved because catalytically dead Casp2 is biologically active in at least one relevant cellular pathway, that is, autophagy. To decipher whether the pathological effects of Casp2 on synaptic function are due to its catalytic or noncatalytic properties, we discovered and characterized a new Casp2 inhibitor, compound 1 [pKi (Casp2) = 8.12], which is 123-fold selective versus Casp3 and >2000-fold selective versus Casp1, Casp6, Casp7, and Casp9. In an in vitro assay based on Casp2-mediated cleavage of tau, compound 1 blocked the production of Delta tau314. Importantly, compound 1 prevented tau from accumulating excessively in dendritic spines and rescued excitatory neurotransmission in cultured primary rat hippocampal neurons expressing the P301S tau variant linked to FTDP-17, a familial tauopathy. These results support the further development of small-molecule Casp2 inhibitors to treat synaptic deficits in tauopathies.

AB  - Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors have been considered as incretin-based agents that signal through GLP-1R. Our high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and bioinformatics methods indicated that GLP-1R, downregulated in diabetes mellitus (DM), was a potential target of DPP-4 inhibitors, which was further confirmed in DM rats. Thus, this study illuminated the alleviatory mechanism of DPP-4 on cognitive dysfunction in diabetes mellitus (DM), which may be associated with GLP-1R signaling. DM rats were administered with DPP-4 inhibitors, Chloroquine (an autophagy inhibitor), Exendin 9-39 (a GLP-1R antagonist), or Compound C (a specific inhibitor of AMPK). An in vitro model of DM was induced in rat hippocampal neuronal cell line H19-7 by exposure to high glucose (HG) and high fat (HF), followed by treatment with the above inhibitors and antagonists. It was found that cognitive dysfunction was promoted, and LC3 expression was lowered in DM rats by an autophagy inhibitor. The DPP-4 inhibitors decreased cognitive dysfunction, repressed Tau phosphorylation, and enhanced GLP-1R protein level, LC3 expression, and AMPK and mTOR phosphorylation in DM rats, while GLP-1R antagonist, an autophagy inhibitor, or AMPK inhibitor counteracted these effects. Such effects were also observed in HG/HF-induced neurons. In conclusion, our data elucidated the alleviatory mechanism of DPP-4 inhibitors in the cognitive dysfunction of DM rats via the AMPK/mTOR pathway.

AB  - Anxiety disorders (AD) are associated with altered connectivity in large-scale intrinsic brain networks. It remains uncertain how much these signatures overlap across different phenotypes due to a lack of well-powered cross-disorder comparisons. We used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) to investigate differences in functional connectivity (FC) in a cross-disorder sample of AD patients and healthy controls (HC). Before treatment, 439 patients from two German multicenter clinical trials at eight different sites fulfilling a primary diagnosis of panic disorder and/or agoraphobia (PD/AG, N = 154), social anxiety disorder (SAD, N = 95), or specific phobia (SP, N = 190) and 105 HC underwent an 8 min rsfMRI assessment. We performed categorical and dimensional regions of interest (ROI)-to-ROI analyses focusing on connectivity between regions of the defensive system and prefrontal regulation areas. AD patients showed increased connectivity between the insula and the thalamus compared to controls. This was mainly driven by PD/AG patients who showed increased (insula/hippocampus/amygdala-thalamus) and decreased (dorsomedial prefrontal cortex/periaqueductal gray-anterior cingulate cortex) positive connectivity between subcortical and cortical areas. In contrast, SAD patients showed decreased negative connectivity exclusively in cortical areas (insula-orbitofrontal cortex), whereas no differences were found in SP patients. State anxiety associated with the scanner environment did not explain the FC between these regions. Only PD/AG patients showed pronounced connectivity changes along a widespread subcortical-cortical network, including the midbrain. Dimensional analyses yielded no significant results. The results highlighting categorical differences between ADs at a systems neuroscience level are discussed within the context of personalized neuroscience-informed treatments.

AB  - Introduction Recent work on bats flying over long distances has revealed that single hippocampal cells have multiple place fields of different sizes. At the network level, a multi-scale, multi-field place cell code outperforms classical single-scale, single-field place codes, yet the performance boundaries of such a code remain an open question. In particular, it is unknown how general multi-field codes compare to a highly regular grid code, in which cells form distinct modules with different scales.Methods In this work, we address the coding properties of theoretical spatial coding models with rigorous analyses of comprehensive simulations. Starting from a multi-scale, multi-field network, we performed evolutionary optimization. The resulting multi-field networks sometimes retained the multi-scale property at the single-cell level but most often converged to a single scale, with all place fields in a given cell having the same size. We compared the results against a single-scale single-field code and a one-dimensional grid code, focusing on two main characteristics: the performance of the code itself and the dynamics of the network generating it.Results Our simulation experiments revealed that, under normal conditions, a regular grid code outperforms all other codes with respect to decoding accuracy, achieving a given precision with fewer neurons and fields. In contrast, multi-field codes are more robust against noise and lesions, such as random drop-out of neurons, given that the significantly higher number of fields provides redundancy. Contrary to our expectations, the network dynamics of all models, from the original multi-scale models before optimization to the multi-field models that resulted from optimization, did not maintain activity bumps at their original locations when a position-specific external input was removed.Discussion Optimized multi-field codes appear to strike a compromise between a place code and a grid code that reflects a trade-off between accurate positional encoding and robustness. Surprisingly, the recurrent neural network models we implemented and optimized for either multi- or single-scale, multi-field codes did not intrinsically produce a persistent "memory" of attractor states. These models, therefore, were not continuous attractor networks.

AB  - Mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles with coordinated cycles of fission and fusion occurring continuously to satisfy the energy demands in the complex architecture of neurons. How mitochondria contribute to addicted drug-induced adaptable mitochondrial networks and neuroplasticity remains largely unknown. Through liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry based lipidomics, we first analyzed the alteration of the mitochondrial lipidome of three mouse brain areas in methamphetamine (METH)-induced locomotor activity and conditioned place preference. The results showed that METH remodeled the mitochondrial lipidome of the hippocampus, nucleus accumbens (NAc), and striatum in both models. Notably, mitochondrial hallmark lipid cardiolipin (CL) was specifically increased in the NAc in METH-induced hyperlocomotor activity, which was accompanied by an elongated giant mitochondrial morphology. Moreover, METH significantly boosted mitochondrial respiration and ATP generation as well as the copy number of mitochondrial genome DNA in the NAc. By screening the expressions of mitochondrial dynamin-related proteins, we found that repeated METH significantly upregulated the expression of long-form optic atrophy type 1 (L-OPA1) and enhanced the interaction of L-OPA1 with CL, which may promote mitochondrial fusion in the NAc. On the contrary, neuronal OPA1 depletion in the NAc not only recovered the dysregulated mitochondrial morphology and synaptic vesicle distribution induced by METH but also attenuated the psychomotor effect of METH. Collectively, upregulated CL and OPA1 cooperate to mediate METH-induced adaptation of neuronal mitochondrial dynamics in the NAc, which correlates with the psychomotor effect of METH. These findings propose a potential therapeutic approach for METH addiction by inhibiting neuronal mitochondrial fusion.

AB  - The relationship between oxidative stress and glycine receptors is complex, involving multiple mechanisms through which reactive oxygen species can modify glycine receptor function. Understanding these interactions is essential for developing therapeutic strategies to mitigate the effects of oxidative stress on inhibitory neurotransmission in various neurological disorders. Inhibitory glycine receptors play a critical role in regulating the final grand postsynaptic potential by attenuating excitatory postsynaptic potentials through inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in postsynaptic neurons. This is particularly important in rapid signal transmission systems, where it determines whether the grand postsynaptic potential exceeds the activation threshold. Glycine receptors are known to be expressed not only in the spinal cord and brainstem but also in the hippocampus, as evidenced by studies conducted over the past decade. Interestingly, these regions share a common cellular architecture, predominantly composed of pyramidal neurons. In hippocampal pyramidal neurons, glycine receptors contribute to the regulation of synapse formation and plasticity, and they are crucial in motor neuron control within the pyramidal tract. However, there is limited research on glycine receptor antagonism, which is necessary to fully understand their biological functions in these regions. We conducted a comprehensive molecular-level analysis of the pharmacological properties of glycine receptors, examined their interaction mechanisms through electrophysiological studies, and identified binding sites using structural modeling and site-directed mutagenesis. Our findings suggest that ergotamine may serve as a promising antioxidant candidate to address issues associated with excessive or prolonged inhibitory postsynaptic potentials, offering a potential new therapeutic pathway.

AB  - Background/Objectives: Previous studies have shown that adiponectin deficiency or blocking adiponectin receptors (AdipoRs) in the brain can lead to an Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like neuropathology. While AdipoRs are abundantly expressed in peripheral tissues, the effects of blocking these receptors in the peripheral tissues on the brain are unclear. This study investigates the impacts of blocking AdipoRs with a peripheral administration of ADP400, an antagonist peptide that targets AdipoRs on cognitive performance, hippocampal adult neurogenesis, and AD-like neuropathology in mice. Methods: Adult mice were intraperitoneally administered with ADP400 peptide that blocks peripheral AdipoRs continuously for 21 days, followed by a battery of behavioral test for mood and memory performance. Results: ADP400-treated mice exhibited impaired memory performance and increased anxiety-like behaviors. Molecular analyses revealed heightened hyperphosphorylation of tau and increased beta-amyloid levels, alongside decreased expression of AdipoRs and PP2A in the hippocampus, suggesting a critical role of AdipoRs in AD-like neuropathology. Furthermore, ADP400 treatment significantly reduced hippocampal adult neurogenesis, as indicated by decreased BrdU, Ki67, and DCX staining. Inhibiting peripheral adiponectin receptors could lead to tau hyperphosphorylation and accumulated beta-amyloid levels. Conclusions: These findings highlight the critical role of peripheral manipulation of adiponectin receptors in modulating cognitive function and adult neurogenesis, offering insights into potential therapeutic strategies for AD and related cognitive disorders.

AB  - Eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis (ECRS), which is a subgroup of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, is characterized by eosinophilic airway inflammation extending across both the upper and lower airways. Some severe cases are refractory even after endoscopic sinus surgery, likely because of local steroid insensitivity. Although real-life studies indicate that treatment with omalizumab for severe allergic asthma improves the outcome of coexistent ECRS, the underlying mechanisms of omalizumab in eosinophilic airway inflammation have not been fully elucidated. Twenty-five patients with ECRS and severe asthma who were refractory to conventional treatments and who received omalizumab were evaluated. Nineteen of twenty-five patients were responsive to omalizumab according to physician-assessed global evaluation of treatment effectiveness. In the responders, the levels of peripheral blood eosinophils and fractionated exhaled nitric oxide (a marker of eosinophilic inflammation) and of CCL4 and soluble CD69 (markers of eosinophil activation) were reduced concomitantly with the restoration of corticosteroid sensitivity. Omalizumab restored the eosinophil-peroxidase-mediated PP2A inactivation and steroid insensitivity in BEAS-2B. In addition, the local inflammation simulant model using BEAS-2B cells incubated with diluted serum from each patient confirmed omalizumab's effects on restoration of corticosteroid sensitivity via PP2A activation; thus, omalizumab could be a promising therapeutic option for refractory eosinophilic airway inflammation with corticosteroid resistance.

AB  - Extracellular purine nucleotides, such as adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP), are important modulators of hippocampal function and plasticity. In the extracellular space, ATP is inherently short-lived molecule, which undergoes rapid enzymatic degradation to adenosine by ectonucleotidases. Given that ectonucleotidases have distinct and overlapping distribution in the hippocampus, and as ovarian hormones participate in a formation, maturation, and a refinement of synaptic contacts, both during development and in adulthood, the present chapter summarizes known data about spatial distribution of selected ecto-enzymes and estradiol-induced effects on ectonucleotidases in the rat hippocampus.

AB  - Background: Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are the leading cause of upper respiratory tract infections, responsible for over half of all such infections. Infection rates among young children can reach as high as 8-12 episodes per year. While HRV infections typically resultin mild common colds, they canalso lead to more severe respiratory conditions, often in conjunction with bacterial coinfections. In addition, HRVs are implicated in the exacerbation of obstructive respiratory diseases, including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). T-cell responses play a crucial role in the immune defense against HRV. However, in patients with obstructive respiratory diseases, altered or dysregulated T-cell responses to HRV may not only fail to efficiently eliminate the virus but can also exacerbate inflammation and airway remodeling. Therefore, a deeper understanding of T-cell-mediated responses in the context of HRV infection, especially in vulnerable populations like those with COPD, is critical. It can provide new insights into mechanismsof both protection and disease exacerbation, potentially guiding the development of targeted therapies or vaccines that enhance protective immunity while minimizing harmful inflammation. Objective: This study aims to (1) determine the population-wide coverage of HRV-specific T-cellresponses, (2) characterize HRV-specific T-cell recall responses in disease cohorts compared to age-match healthy controls, and (3) identify biomarkers of protection and susceptibility within disease cohorts through a comparative analysis. Methods: Participants with asthma and those with COPD, aged 5-15 and 40-70 years, respectively, will be recruited alongside healthy age-matched controls. Peripheral blood samples will be collected following informed consent from adult participants and from parents or guardians of minors, as applicable. Clinical, demographic, immunological, and genetic responses will be assessed both prior to and following in vitro stimulation with a pool of HRV-specific T-cell epitopes. Flow cytometry and functional assays will be used to analyze T-cell responses to HRV epitopes in the context of obstructive respiratory diseases. Results: This study was funded in January 2023 by the Ministry of Science and Innovation of Spain. The primary aim of the study was achieved within the same year. Recruitment for the secondary and tertiary aims is currently ongoing. Preliminary findings highlight the potential significance of HRV-specific T-cell responses in individuals with asthma and those with COPD. A detailed characterization of these immune responses will provide critical insights into host-pathogen interactions and may serve as a foundation for the development of effective T-cell-based vaccines or immunotherapies targeting HRV. Conclusions: Here, we present an ethically approved study protocol for an observational and exploratory study investigating a novel epitope-based vaccine targeting HRV, with a focus on pediatric asthma and adult COPD cohort populations.

AB  - Background: Postoperative delirium (POD) is a common complication after anesthesia and surgery, especially in the elderly. RNF146 has neuroprotective effects in cerebral ischemia, hypoxia, and chronic neurological diseases. However, whether RNF146 expression is related to the occurrence and development of POD remains unclear. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to determine whether RNF146 is involved in the occurrence of POD. Methods: (Sprague-Dawley) male rats (18 months old) were splenectomized under sevoflurane anesthesia. The cognitive function of rats at 1, 3, and 7 d after anesthesia and surgery was evaluated. Changes in the expression of neuroinflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and IL10, and RNF146 were measured in the hippocampus in both control group (con) and anesthesia (AS) group. We examined cognitive outcomes and expression of inflammatory factors and RNF146 in con and AS mice using cluster analysis. Results: The cognitive ability and mobility of rats after anesthesia and surgery at day 1, 3, and 7 decreased, especially at day 3. Similarly, the expression of neuroinflammatory factors and RNF146 increased after anesthesia and surgery at day 1, 3, and 7, and the increase was highest at day 3. The clustering and correlation analysis of RNF146 expression in the hippocampi of elderly rats revealed a correlation between POD and neuroinflammation resulting from anesthesia and surgery. Conclusion: Anesthesia and surgery can lead to POD and neuroinflammation. The expression of RNF146 correlates with delirium and neuroinflammation caused by anesthesia and surgery.

AB  - CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), a zinc finger protein, is a transcription factor and regulator of chromatin structure. Forebrain excitatory neuron-specific CTCF deficiency contributes to inflammation via enhanced transcription of inflammation-related genes in the cortex and hippocampus. However, little is known about the long-term effect of CTCF deficiency on postnatal neurons, astrocytes, or microglia in the hippocampus of adult mice. To address this, we knocked out the Ctcf gene in forebrain glutamatergic neurons (Ctcf cKO) by crossing Ctcf-floxed mice with Camk2a-Cre mice and examined the hippocampi of 7.5-10-month-old male mice using immunofluorescence microscopy. We found obvious neuronal cell death and reactive gliosis in the hippocampal cornu ammonis (CA)1 in 7.5-10-month-old cKO mice. Prominent rod-shaped microglia that participate in immune surveillance were observed in the stratum pyramidale and radiatum layer, indicating a potential increase in inflammatory mediators released by hippocampal neurons. Although neuronal loss was not observed in CA3, and dentate gyrus (DG) CTCF depletion induced a significant increase in the number of microglia in the stratum oriens of CA3 and reactive microgliosis and astrogliosis in the molecular layer and hilus of the DG in 7.5-10-month-old cKO mice. These results suggest that long-term Ctcf deletion from forebrain excitatory neurons may contribute to reactive gliosis induced by neuronal damage and consequent neuronal loss in the hippocampal CA1, DG, and CA3 in sequence over 7 months of age.

AB  - Genome-wide association studies identified variants around the BIN1 (bridging integrator 1) gene locus as prominent risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer disease. In the present study, we decreased the expression of BIN1 in mouse hippocampal neurons to investigate its neuronal function. Bin1 knockdown via RNAi reduced the dendritic arbor size in primary cultured hippocampal neurons as well as in mature Cornu Ammonis 1 excitatory neurons. The AAV-mediated Bin1 RNAi knockdown also generated a significant regional volume loss around the injection sites at the organ level, as revealed by 7-Tesla structural magnetic resonance imaging, and an impaired spatial reference memory performance in the Barnes maze test. Unexpectedly, Bin1 knockdown led to concurrent activation of both macroautophagy/autophagy and MTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase) complex 1 (MTORC1). Autophagy inhibition with the lysosome inhibitor chloroquine effectively mitigated the Bin1 knockdown-induced dendritic regression. The subsequent molecular studydemonstrated that increased expression of ULK3 (unc-51 like kinase 3), which is MTOR-insensitive, supported autophagosome formation in BIN1 deficiency. Reducing ULK3 activity with SU6668, a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, or decreasing neuronal ULK3 expression through AAV-mediated RNAi, significantly attenuated Bin1 knockdown-induced hippocampal volume loss and spatial memory decline. In Alzheimer disease patients, the major neuronal isoform of BIN1 is specifically reduced. Our work suggests this reduction is probably an important molecular event that increases the autophagy level, which might subsequently promote brain atrophy and cognitive impairment through reducing dendritic structures, and ULK3 is a potential interventional target for relieving these detrimental effects.Abbreviations: AV: adeno-associated virus; A beta: amyloid-beta; ACTB: actin, beta; AD: Alzheimer disease; Aduk: Another Drosophila Unc-51-like kinase; AKT1: thymoma viral proto-oncogene 1; AMPK: AMP-activated protein kinase; AP: autophagosome; BafA1: bafilomycin A1; BDNF: brain derived neurotrophic factor; BIN1: bridging integrator 1; BIN1-iso1: BIN1, isoform 1; CA1: cornu Ammonis 1; CA3: cornu Ammonis 3; CLAP: clathrin and adapter binding; CQ: chloroquine; DMEM: Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium; EGFP: enhanced green fluorescent protein; GWAS: genome-wide association study; MAP1LC3B/LC3B: microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta; MRI: magnetic resonance imaging; MTOR; mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase; MTORC1: MTOR complex 1; PET: positron emission tomography; qRT-PCR: real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR; ROS: reactive oxygen species; RPS6KB1: ribosomal protein S6 kinase B1; TFEB: transcription factor EB; ULK1: unc-51 like kinase 1; ULK3: unc-51 like kinase 3.

AB  - Background Donor cell-derived exosomes regulate recipient cell functions. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of human normal bladder stromal cell (hBSC) derived exosomal miR-217 on bladder cell cancer proliferation and migration. Methods Human BSCs were transfected with miR-217 mimic or inhibitor and hBSC-derived exosomes were isolated. Human bladder cancer cell lines (T24 and 5367) were co-cultured with hBSC-derived exosomal miR-217 mimic or inhibitor. Proliferation, migration, and apoptosis of the bladder cancer cells were assessed by Edu assay, Transwell migration assay, and Annexin V assay. Results Expression of miR-217 was significantly higher in the T24 and 5367 cell lines (P < 0.01). Exosomal miR-217 mimic enhanced proliferation and migration of T24 and 5367 cells, but inhibited apoptosis of the cells (P < 0.01); in contrast, exosomal miR-217 inhibitor suppressed proliferation and migration but stimulated apoptosis of the two cancer cell lines (P < 0.01). Moreover, exosomal miR-217 mimic stimulated YAP and its target proteins including Cyr61, CTGF, and ANKRD1 (P < 0.01), and in contrast, exosomal miR-217 inhibitor suppressed YAP and its target proteins (P < 0.01). Conclusion These findings suggested that hBSC-derived exosomal miR-217 may act as oncogene in bladder cancer cells, and that Hippo-YAP signaling pathway maybe the target for miR-217 in the bladder cancer cell lines.

AB  - Background Mucormycosis is a deadly invasive fungal infection recently included in the WHO priority pathogen list. Here we sought to describe epidemiological trends of mucormycosis in France, and to evaluate factors associated with mortality. Methods From 2012 to 2022, we implemented a nationwide prospective surveillance programme for mucormycosis in France, focusing on epidemiology, species, seasonal variations. Factors associated with 3-month mortality were studied by univariable and multivariable logistic regression. Findings Among 550 cases of mucormycosis, the main underlying conditions were haematological malignancy (HM, 65.1%, 358/550), trauma (8%, 44/550), diabetes (7.5%, 41/550) and solid-organ transplants (6.5%, 36/550). Site of infection was pulmonary in 52.4% (288/550), rhinocerebral in 14.5% (80/550), and cutaneo-articular in 17.1% (94/550). Main species identified fi ed were Rhizopus arrhizus (21%, 67/316), Rhizopus microsporus (13.6%, 43/316), Lichtheimia corymbifera and Mucor circinelloides (13.3%, 42/316 each), Rhizomucor pusillus (12%, 38/316), and Lichtheimia ramosa (10.8%, 34/316). We found associations between underlying condition, site of infection, and infecting species, including a previously undescribed triad of trauma, cutaneo-articular localisations, and L. ramosa/M. / M. circinelloides. . Diagnostic contribution of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) increased from 16% (4/25) in 2012 to 91% (61/67) in 2022, with more than 50% of diagnoses relying solely on PCR in 2022. We also found seasonal variations with relatively more cases in autumn. Ninety-day mortality was 55.8% (276/495). Independent prognostic factors were age, diagnosis in Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and HM while diagnosis after 2015 (i.e. large implementation of PCR) and surgery were associated with reduced mortality. Interpretation This study reveals major mucormycosis epidemiological changes in France, with a large predominance of HM patients, and a parallel between PCR multicentre implementation and improved prognosis. We also evidence new associations between species, localisations and risk factors, as well as seasonal variations.

AB  - Salsolinol (1-methyl-6,7-dihydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline, Sal) is a catechol isoquinoline that causes neurotoxicity and shares structural similarity with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine, an environmental toxin that causes Parkinson's disease. However, the mechanism by which Sal mediates dopaminergic neuronal death remains unclear. In this study, we found that Sal significantly enhanced the global level of N-6-methyladenosine (m(6)A) RNA methylation in PC12 cells, mainly by inducing the downregulation of the expression of m(6)A demethylases fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) and alkB homolog 5 (ALKBH5). RNA sequencing analysis showed that Sal downregulated the Hippo signaling pathway. The m(6)A reader YTH domain-containing family protein 2 (YTHDF2) promoted the degradation of m(6)A-containing Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) mRNA, which is a downstream key effector in the Hippo signaling pathway. Additionally, downregulation of YAP1 promoted autophagy, indicating that the mutual regulation between YAP1 and autophagy can lead to neurotoxicity. These findings reveal the role of Sal on m(6)A RNA methylation and suggest that Sal may act as an RNA methylation inducer mediating dopaminergic neuronal death through YAP1 and autophagy. Our results provide greater insights into the neurotoxic effects of catechol isoquinolines compared with other studies and may be a reference for assessing the involvement of RNA methylation in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease.

AB  - Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) represents a stroke subtype that can lead to prolonged cognitive deficits as well as death or disability. Prior investigation has suggested that CoQ10 analogs can mitigate oxidative stress and inflammation and promote mitochondrial biogenesis in the context of brain injury and neurodegenerative disorders. However, the precise mechanisms underlying early brain injury (EBI) following SAH remain incompletely understood, and the detailed molecular processes have yet to be completely clarified. This investigation examined the neuroprotective properties of a CoQ10 analog concerning EBI post-SAH and identified potential mechanistic pathways. Our findings indicate that SAH led to alterations in innate and learned behaviors in aged C57BL/6J mice while also triggering ferroptosis and neuroinflammation within hippocampal neurons. Additionally, SAH was associated with reduced ferroptosis-related proteins, exacerbation of iron accumulation, elevation of lipid ROS, and decreased FSP1, HO-1, and NQO1 levels. The CoQ10 analog idebenone (IDB) demonstrated a capacity to alleviate EBI, as evidenced by improvements in both innate and learned behaviors, alongside a reduction in ferroptosis-related gene/protein expression. Silencing of FSP1 exacerbated EBI, ferroptosis, and neuroinflammation, and partially counteracted the neuroprotective effects of the CoQ10 analog. These results suggest that IDB may enhance the recovery from SAH-induced EBI in aged mice by modulating FSP1 protein stability via NMT-mediated N-myristoylation, thereby inhibiting both ferroptosis and neuroinflammation. The potential therapeutic application of IDB as a clinical intervention for EBI following SAH is also highlighted.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease, characterized by memory loss, speech and motor defects, personality changes, and psychological disorders. The exact cause of AD remains unclear. Current treatments focus on maintaining neurotransmitter levels or targeting n-amyloid (An) protein, but these only alleviate symptoms and do not reverse the disease. Developing new drugs is time-consuming, costly, and has a high failure rate. Utilizing multi-omics for drug repositioning has emerged as a new strategy. Based on transcriptomic perturbation data of over 40,000 drugs in human cells from the LINCS-L1000 database, our study employed the Jaccard index and hypergeometric distribution test for reverse transcriptional feature matching analysis, identifying Givinostat as a potential treatment for AD. Our research found that Givinostat improved cognitive behavior and brain pathology in models and enhanced hippocampal synaptic plasticity. Transcriptome sequencing revealed increased expression of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex proteins in the brains of APP/PS1 mice after Givinostat treatment. Functionally, Givinostat restored mitochondrial membrane potential, reduced reactive oxygen species, and increased ATP content in An-induced HT22 cells. Additionally, it improved mitochondrial morphology and quantity in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice and enhanced brain glucose metabolic activity. These effects are linked to Givinostat promoting mitochondrial biogenesis and improving mitochondrial function. In summary, Givinostat offers a promising new strategy for AD treatment by targeting mitochondrial dysfunction.

AB  - Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a highly aggressive form of liver cancer and is an increasing cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Despite its increasing incidence globally and alarming mortality, treatment options for CCA have largely remained unchanged, stressing the importance of developing new effective therapies. YAP activation is common in CCA, and its major transcriptional signaling partners are the TEAD proteins. CA3 is a small-molecule YAP-TEAD disrupter discovered utilizing a TEAD reporter assay. Utilizing CCA, gastric cancer cell lines, and patient-derived xenograft models (PDX), we demonstrate that CA3 is effective in inducing cell death and delaying tumor growth in both FGFR2 fusion and wild-type models. CA3 was associated with on-target decreases in YAP-TEAD target gene expression, TEAD reporter activity, and overall TEAD levels. Hippo pathway signaling was not altered as there was no change in YAP phosphorylation status in the cells exposed to CA3. RNA sequencing of gastric cancer and CCA models demonstrated upregulation of an androgen receptor-mediated transcriptional program following exposure to CA3 in five unique models tested. Consistent with this upstream regulator analysis, CA3 exposure in CCA cells was associated with increased AR protein levels, and combinatorial therapy with CA3 and androgen receptor blockade was associated with increased cancer cell death. CA3 behaves functionally as a YAP-TEAD disrupter in the models tested and demonstrated therapeutic efficacy. Exposure to CA3 was associated with compensatory androgen receptor signaling and dual inhibition improved the therapeutic effect.

AB  - Voltage imaging is an important complement to traditional methods for probing cellular physiology, such as electrode-based patch clamp techniques. Unlike the related Ca2+ imaging, voltage imaging provides a direct visualization of bioelectricity changes. We have been exploring the use of sulfonated silicon rhodamine dyes (Berkeley Red Sensor of Transmembrane potential, BeRST) for voltage imaging. In this study, we explore the effect of converting BeRST to diEt BeRST, by replacing the dimethyl aniline of BeRST with a diethyl aniline group. The new dye, diEt BeRST, has a voltage sensitivity of 40% Delta F/F per 100 mV, a 33% increase compared to the original BeRST dye, which has a sensitivity of 30% Delta F/F per 100 mV. In neurons, the cellular brightness of diEt BeRST is about 20% as bright as that of BeRST, which may be due to the lower solubility of diEt BeRST (300 mu M) compared to that of BeRST (800 mu M). Despite this lower cellular brightness, diEt BeRST is able to record spontaneous and evoked action potentials from multiple neurons simultaneously and in single trials. Far-red excitation and emission profiles enable diEt BeRST to be used alongside existing fluorescent indicators of cellular physiology, like Ca2+-sensitive Oregon Green BAPTA. In hippocampal neurons, simultaneous voltage and Ca2+ imaging reveals neuronal spiking patterns and frequencies that cannot be resolved with traditional Ca2+ imaging methods. This study represents a first step toward describing the structural features that define voltage sensitivity and brightness in silicon rhodamine-based BeRST indicators.

AB  - Activating mutations in G alpha(q/11) are a major driver of uveal melanoma (UM), the most common intraocular cancer in adults. While progress has recently been made in targeting G alpha(q/11) for UM therapy, the crucial role for these proteins in normal physiology and their high structural similarity with many other important GTPase proteins renders this approach challenging. The aim of the current study was to validate whether a key regulator of Gq signaling, regulator of G protein signaling 2 (RGS2), can inhibit G alpha(q)-mediated UM cell growth. We used two UM cell lines, 92.1 and Mel-202, which both contain the most common activating mutation G alpha(Q209L)(q) and developed stable cell lines with doxycycline-inducible RGS2 protein expression. Using cell viability assays, we showed that RGS2 could inhibit cell growth in both of these UM cell lines. We also found that this effect was independent of the canonical GTPase-activating protein activity of RGS2 but was dependent on the association between RGS2 and G alpha(q). Furthermore, RGS2 induction resulted in only partial reduction in cell growth as compared to siRNA-mediated Gaq knockdown, perhaps because RGS2 was only able to reduce mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling downstream of phospholipase C beta, while leaving activation of the Hippo signaling mediators yes-associated protein 1/TAZ, the other major pathway downstream of Gaq, unaffected. Taken together, our data indicate that RGS2 can inhibit UM cancer cell growth by associating with G alpha(Q209L)(q) as a partial effector antagonist.

AB  - Sex differences in navigation have often been attributed to the use of different navigation strategies in men and women. However, no study so far has investigated sex differences in the brain networks supporting different navigation strategies. To address this issue, we employed a 3D-navigation task during functional MRI in 36 men and 36 women, all scanned thrice, and modeled navigation strategies by instructions requiring an allocentric vs. egocentric reference frame on the one hand, as well as landmark-based vs. Euclidian strategies on the other hand. We found distinct brain networks supporting different perspectives/strategies. Men showed stronger activation of frontal areas, whereas women showed stronger activation of posterior brain regions. The left inferior frontal gyrus was more strongly recruited during landmark-based navigation in men. The hippocampus showed stronger connectivity with left-lateralized frontal areas in women and stronger connectivity with superior parietal areas in men. We discuss these findings in the light of a stronger recruitment of verbal networks supporting a more verbal strategy in women compared to a stronger recruitment of spatial networks supporting a more spatial strategy use in men. In summary, this study provides evidence that different navigation strategies activate different brain areas in men and women.
   Noachtar et al. report that the pattern of brain activation supporting 3D navigation differs between men and women. On average, men would rely more on a spatial network and women on a verbal strategy.

AB  - Petunidin-3-O-(trans-p-coumaroylrutinoside)-5-O-glucoside (PtCG), the primary anthocyanin ingredient in Lycium ruthenicum Murr., possesses a range of biological activities, including antioxidative properties and melanin inhibition. This study aimed to investigate the protective effect of PtCG on D-galactose (D-gal)-induced aging in female mice and elucidate the underlying molecular pathways. Behavioral experiments, including the MWW and Y-maze tests, revealed that PtCG significantly ameliorated cognitive decline and enhanced learning and memory abilities in aging mice. Regarding biochemical indicators, PtCG considerably improved superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH) activity while reducing malondialdehyde (MDA) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) levels in the hippocampus and serum. Furthermore, PtCG ingestion alleviated liver injury by decreasing alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (AKP) levels, and attenuated renal damage by reducing blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and uric acid (UA) levels. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results demonstrated that PtCG restored the function and quantity of synapses in the hippocampus. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), Masson's trichrome, and Nissl staining revealed that PtCG significantly improved the relevant pathological characteristics of liver and hippocampal tissues in aging mice. The molecular mechanism investigation showed that PtCG downregulated the protein expression of microglial marker ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1), astrocytic marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), beta-secretase 1 (BACE-1), and amyloid-beta1-42 (A beta 1-42) in the hippocampus of aging mice. The protein expression of inflammatory pathway components, including nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), was also suppressed. These findings suggest that PtCG may possess anti-aging properties, with its mechanism of action potentially linked to the attenuation of neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and liver and kidney damage. PtCG may have future applications as a functional food for the treatment of aging-related disorders.

TI  - LncRNA-MIAT activates hepatic stellate cells via regulating Hippo pathway and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY
LA  - English
KW  - LIVER FIBROSIS
AB  - Long non-coding RNA-myocardial infarction-associated transcript (lncRNA-MIAT) has been reported to play an important role in the development of multiple cancers. However, the biological roles of MIAT in liver fibrosis are still unknown. In this study, the expression of MIAT is up-regulated during liver fibrosis. Silencing MIAT leads to the suppression of hepatic stellate cell (HSC) proliferation and collagen expression. Double immunofluorescence analysis additionally demonstrates that MIAT inhibition leads to the suppression of type I collagen and alpha-SMA in vitro. In vivo, MIAT knockdown contributes to the inhibition of fibrosis progression and collagen accumulation. MIAT is confirmed as a target of miR-3085-5p, and the co-location of MIAT and miR-3085-5p is found in HSC cytoplasm. Interestingly, there is a negative correlation between MIAT expression and miR-3085-5p level in cirrhotic patients as well as activated HSCs. In addition, the effects of MIAT inhibition on HSC inactivation are blocked down by miR-3085-5p inhibitor. YAP is a target of miR-3085-5p. Reduced YAP caused by loss of MIAT is reversed by miR-3085-5p inhibitor. Notably, YAP knockdown results in the suppression of MIAT-mediated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. In conclusion, we demonstrate that MIAT enhances the activation of HSCs, at least in part, via miR-3085-5p/YAP/EMT signaling pathway.
   LncRNA MIAT is shown to be a potential clinical biomarker for liver fibrosis and enhances hepatic stellate cell activation via miR-30855p/YAP/EMT signalling.

AB  - Recent evidences have shown the therapeutic potential of transcranial photobiomodulation on traumatic brain injury and Alzheimer's disease. Despite the promising benefits in the brain, little is known about the laser's effects in the absence of pathological conditions. We submitted young (4 months old) and aged (20 months old) rats to transcranial low-level laser and evaluated their exploratory activity and habituation in open field, anxiety in elevated plus maze, spatial memory in Barnes maze, and aversive memory in a step-down inhibitory avoidance task. Additionally, the levels of a panel of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were quantified in two different brain regions: the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus. Young and aged rats submitted to transcranial laser exhibited better cognitive performance in Barnes maze than did control rats. Transcranial laser therapy decreased cortical levels of GM-CSF, IL-10, MCP-1, LIX, and TNF alpha in young rats and IL-5 in aged rats. High levels of IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-alpha were found in the cerebral cortex of aged rats submitted to transcranial laser. In the hippocampus, a decrease in IP-10 and fractalkine levels was observed in the aged rats from the laser group when compared to the aged rats from the control group. Our data indicate that transcranial photobiomodulation improves spatial learning and memory and alters the neuroinflammatory profile of young and aged rats' brains.

AB  - Depression is a mental disorder that significantly reduces quality of life, and the discovery of new drug targets is an urgent problem for modern neuroscience. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptors have been found to participate in mechanisms of depression and antidepressant drugs' action. In this study, we focused on a less-studied truncated isoform of receptor TrkB: TrkB.T1. Initially, we noticed that the level of TrkB.T1 is low in the hippocampus of Antidepressant-Sensitive Cataleptics (ASC) mice, which are characterized by genetically determined depressive-like behavior in contrast to "normal" C57BL/6J mice. Next, overexpression of TrkB.T1 receptor in hippocampal neurons of ACS mice was induced to clarify the role of this receptor in mechanisms of depressive-like behavior. TrkB.T1 overexpression lowered BDNF protein concentration in the hippocampus. On the behavioral level, TrkB.T1 overexpression severely decreased aggression and enhanced social behavior. Additionally, this excess of receptor TrkB.T1 slightly promoted anxiety and depressive-like behavioral traits without affecting learning and memory. Our results show that this TrkB isoform participates in the control of aggression, anxiety, and depressive-like behavior and in the regulation of BDNF system functioning in ASC mice (genetically predisposed to depressive-like behavior). Considering our findings, we believe that hippocampal receptor TrkB.T1 can be a drug target for the correction of behavioral pathologies.

AB  - Soluble amyloid beta (A beta) oligomers have been shown to be highly toxic to neurons and are considered to be a major cause of the neurodegeneration underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD). That makes soluble A beta oligomers a promising drug target. In addition to eliminating these toxic species from the patients' brain with antibody-based drugs, a new class of drugs is emerging, namely A beta aggregation inhibitors or modulators, which aim to stop the formation of toxic A beta oligomers at the source. Here, pharmacological data of the novel A beta aggregation modulator GAL-201 are presented. This small molecule (288.34 g/mol) exhibits high binding affinity to misfolded A beta(1-42) monomers (K-D = 2.5 +/- 0.6 nM). Pharmacokinetic studies in rats using brain microdialysis are supportive of its oral bioavailability. The A beta oligomer detoxifying potential of GAL-201 has been demonstrated by means of single cell recordings in isolated hippocampal neurons (perforated patch experiments) as well as in vitro and in vivo extracellular monitoring of long-term potentiation (LTP, in rat transverse hippocampal slices), a cellular correlate for synaptic plasticity. Upon preincubation, GAL-201 efficiently prevented the detrimental effect on LTP mediated by A beta(1-42) oligomers. Furthermore, the potential to completely reverse an already established neurotoxic process could also be demonstrated. Of particular note in this context is the self-propagating detoxification potential of GAL-201, leading to a neutralization of A beta oligomer toxicity even if GAL-201 has been stepwise removed from the medium (serial dilution), likely due to prion-like conformational changes in A beta(1-42) monomer aggregates (trigger effect). The authors conclude that the data presented strongly support the further development of GAL-201 as a novel, orally available AD treatment with potentially superior clinical profile.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by a progressive loss of cognitive functions at a higher level than normal aging. Although the apolipoprotein (APOE) gene is a major risk factor in developing AD, other genes have also been reported to be linked with complex phenotypes. Therefore, this genome-wide expression study explored differentially expressed genes as possible novel biomarkers involved in AD. The mRNA expression dataset, GSE28146, containing 15 sample data composed of 7 AD cases from the hippocampus region with age-matched control (n = 8, >80 years), was analyzed. Using "affy" R-package, mRNA expression was calculated, while pathway enrichment analysis was performed to determine related biological processes. Of 58 differentially expressed genes, 44 downregulated and 14 upregulated genes were found to be significantly (p < 0.001) altered. The pathway enrichment analysis revealed two altered genes, i.e., dynein light chain 1 (DYNLL1) and kalirin (KLRN), associated with AD in the elderly population. The majority of genes were associated with retrograde endocannabinoid as well as vascular endothelial growth factors affecting the complex phenotypes. The DYNLL1 and KLRN genes may be involved with AD and Huntington's disease (HD) phenotypes and represent a common genetic basis of these diseases. However, the hallmark of AD is dementia, while the classic motor sign of HD includes chorea. Our data warrant further investigation to identify the role of these genes in disease pathogenesis.

AB  - Microdialysis assays demonstrated a possible role of orexin in the regulation of amyloid beta peptide (A beta) levels in the hippocampal interstitial fluid in the APP transgenic model. CB2R is overexpressed in activated microglia, showing a neuroprotective effect. These two receptors may interact, forming CB2-OX1-Hets and becoming a new target to combat Alzheimer's disease. Aims: Demonstrate the potential role of CB2-OX1-Hets expression and function in microglia from animal models of Alzheimer's disease. Receptor heteromer expression was detected by immunocytochemistry, bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) and proximity ligation assay (PLA) in transfected HEK-293T cells and microglia primary cultures. Quantitation of signal transduction events in a heterologous system and in microglia cells was performed using the AlphaScreen (R) SureFire (R) kit, western blot, the GCaMP6 calcium sensor and the Lance Ultra cAMP kit (PerkinElmer). The formation of CB2-OX1 receptor complexes in transfected HEK-293T cells has been demonstrated. The tetrameric complex is constituted by one CB2R homodimer, one OX1R homodimer and two G proteins, a G(i) and a G(q). The use of TAT interfering peptides showed that the CB2-OX1 receptor complex interface is TM4-TM5. At the functional level it has been observed that the OX1R antagonist, SB334867, potentiates the action induced by CB2R agonist JWH133. This effect is observed in transfected HEK-293T cells and microglia, and it is stronger in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) animal model APPSw/Ind where the expression of the complex assessed by the proximity ligation assay indicates an increase in the number of complexes compared to resting microglia. The CB2-OX1 receptor complex is overexpressed in microglia from AD animal models where OX1R antagonists potentiate the neuroprotective actions of CB2R activation. Taken together, these results point to OX1R antagonists as drugs with therapeutic potential to combat AD.

AB  - Epidermal growth factor (EGF) plays a crucial role in maintaining male reproductive capacity in mammals, however, its protective effects on cryopreserved dromedary camel epididymal spermatozoa have not been thoroughly investigated. This study aims to investigate the potential protective role of EGF on cryopreserved camel epididymal spermatozoa, supported by evidence from a molecular docking study. We assessed sperm motility, kinematics parameters, oxidative stress, ultrastructural changes, apoptosis, and molecular docking markers in camel epididymal spermatozoa following cryopreservation. Camel epididymal spermatozoa (n = 30 pairs of testes) were collected from local slaughterhouses. The epididymal spermatozoa were diluted with a freezing medium (SHOTOR extender) supplemented with different concentrations of EGF; 0 (EGF0), 50 (EGF50), 100 (EGF100), 200 (EGF200), and 400 (EGF400) ng/mL in SHOTOR extender and cryopreserved using a standard protocol. All EGF groups showed significant improvements in sperm progressive motility, viability, and sperm membrane function after equilibration at 5 degrees C for 24 hours. Regarding frozen-thawed samples, sperm progressive motility and some kinematic parameters (DAP, VSL, VCL and AHL) were significantly higher in the EFG400 group compared to the other groups (P < 0.01). A significant increase in the percentage of live/ acrosome-intact sperm was observed, accompanied by a significant decrease in malondialdehyde levels in all EGF groups (P < 0.05). Both the EGF200 and EGF400 groups showed significantly higher sperm viability and significantly lower percentages of apoptotic and necrotic sperm compared to the other groups (P < 0.05). EGF supplementation preserved the ultrastructural integrity and cryotolerance of epididymal camel spermatozoa. The docking analysis indicated that EGF exhibited higher binding affinity with apoptosis sperm markers, including caspase-3 and bcl-2-associated X (Bax) proteins, with binding energies of -502.0 and -621.0 kcal/mol, respectively. In conclusion, the addition of EGF to SHOTOR extender was found to have beneficial effects on sperm motility, kinematics parameters, sperm viability, acrosome integrity, sperm trastructural features, and reduced oxidative stress and apoptosis-like changes in cryopreserved epididymal camel spermatozoa.

AB  - Perineuronal nets (PNNs) are specialized extracellular matrix structures that surround certain neurons and play a critical role in protecting neurons from oxidative stress and maintaining synaptic stability in the central nervous system. They have roles in memory formation, and their loss has been linked to various mental alterations, such as anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia. While immune activation is known to degrade PNNs, it remains unclear whether inflammasomes are involved in PNN formation dynamics during neuronal development, where cases of sepsis are particularly high. In this study, we investigated how activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in neonatal mouse brains influences PNNs. To explore this, neonatal wild-type and Nlrp3 knockout mice were injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) on postnatal day (PND) 9, and PNNs were visualized at early adulthood (PND60). In addition, NLRP3 inflammasome activation was confirmed on PND10, and behavioral tests were performed on PND60. LPS treatment in wild-type mice reduced PNN-positive neurons in the hippocampus and cortex compared to the PBS group, whereas Nlrp3 knockout mice showed no differences between treatment groups. Moreover, behavioral tests revealed that neonatal LPS injection resulted in anxiety- and depressive-like behavior and that NLRP3 deficiency restrained this effect. These results highlight the key role of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in inflammation-driven PNN reduction during neuronal development. NLRP3 inhibitors could thus serve as potential therapeutic agents to protect the neuronal extracellular matrix from inflammatory damage in early life.

AB  - The aim of the current study was to determine protective effects of betaine on depressive-like behaviors in zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) exposed mice. Forty male mice randomly allocated into four experimental groups. Group 1 kept as control and groups 2-4 received oral administration of betaine (30 mg/kg), ZnO NPs (600 mg/kg), and ZnO NPs (600 mg/kg) 1 h after pre-administration of betaine (30 mg/kg) for 7 days, respectively. Then, forced swimming test (FST), tail suspension test (TST), open field test (OFT), and rotarod tests were done. Furthermore, serum malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) levels were determined. Hippocampal tissue samples were collected for histopathological assessment. According to the results, treatment with ZnO NPs significantly increased immobility time in the FST and TST (P<0.05). Betaine significantly decreased immobility time in the FST and TST (P<0.05). Pretreatment with betaine significantly decreased ZnO NPs-induced alterations in the FST and TST (P<0.05). The duration of staying on the rotarod and the numbers of crossings in the OFT significantly decreased in the mice that received ZnO NPs (P<0.05). These results were significantly improved in betaine+ZnO NPs treated mice as compared to the ZnO NPs group (P<0.05). Treatment with ZnO NPs significantly increased serum MDA level while decreased SOD and GPx compared to the control group (P<0.05). These changes were effectively ameliorated by pretreatment with betaine compared to the ZnO NPs group (P<0.05). No significant effect on serum TAC level was observed in all groups (P>0.05). Administration of ZnO NPs decreased the thickness of hippocampus and pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) and CA1 regions were sparsely arranged. Pretreatment with betaine caused an improvement in the histological features of the hippocampus when compared with ZnO NPs-treated mice. Taken together, these results suggest that betaine has protective role against ZnO NPs-induced toxicity in mice.

Converging studies have shown separate involvements of the perirhinal cortex (PRC) and parahippocampal cortex (PHC) in item and spatial processes, whereas HPC relates the item to a spatial context. These 2 strands of literature raise the following question; which brain region is involved in the recall process of item-location associative memory? To solve this question, this study applied an item-location associative (ILA) paradigm in a single-unit study of nonhuman primates. We trained 2 macaques to associate 4 visual item pairs with 4 locations on a background map in an allocentric manner before the recording sessions. In each trial, 1 visual item and the map image at a tilt (-90 degrees to 90 degrees) were sequentially presented as the item-cue and the context-cue, respectively. The macaques chose the item-cue location relative to the context-cue by positioning their gaze. Neurons in the PRC, PHC, and HPC, but not area TE, exhibited item-cue responses which signaled retrieval of item-location associative memory. This retrieval signal first appeared in the PRC, followed by the HPC and PHC. We examined whether neural representations of the retrieved locations were related to the external space that the macaques viewed. A positive representation similarity was found in the HPC and PHC, but not in the PRC, thus suggesting a contribution of the HPC to relate the retrieved location from the PRC with a first-person perspective of the subjects and provide the self-referenced retrieved location to the PHC. These results imply distinct but complementary contributions of the PRC and HPC to recall of item-location associative memory that can be used across multiple spatial contexts.

AB  - The whole world is suffering from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Neurological manifestations in COVID-19 patients suggested the invasion of SARS-CoV-2 into the central nervous system. The present study mapped the expression level of ACE2 in 12 brain regions through immunohistochemistry and detected ACE2 in endothelial cells and non-vascular cells. The comparison among brain regions found that pons, visual cortex, and amygdala presented a relatively high level of ACE2. In addition, this study demonstrates that the protein level of ACE2 was downregulated in the basal nucleus, hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, middle frontal gyrus, visual cortex, and amygdala of the brain with Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Collectively, our results suggested that ACE2 was expressed discriminatorily at different human brain regions, which was downregulated in the brain with AD pathology. This may contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the neurological symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-2 and provide clues for further research on the relationship between COVID-19 and AD.

AB  - Metabolic reprogramming is a vital factor in the development of many types of cancer, including colon cancer. Serine metabolic reprogramming is a major feature of tumor metabolism. Yes-associated protein (YAP) participates in organ size control and tumorigenesis. However, the relationship between YAP and serine metabolism in colon cancer is unclear. In this study, RNA sequencing and metabolomics analyses indicated significant enrichment of the glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism pathways in serine starvation-resistant cells. Short-term serine deficiency inhibited YAP activation, whereas a prolonged response dephosphorylated YAP and promoted its activity. Mechanistically, USP7 increases YAP stability under increased serine conditions by regulating deubiquitination. Verteporfin (VP) effectively inhibited the proliferation of colon cancer cells and organoids and could even modulate serine metabolism by inhibiting USP7 expression. Clinically, YAP was significantly activated in colon tumor tissues and positively correlated with the expression of phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) and USP7. Generally, our study uncovered the mechanism by which serine metabolism regulates YAP via USP7 and identified the crucial role of YAP in the regulation of cell proliferation and tumor growth; thus, VP may be a new treatment for colon cancer.

AB  - Mice with constitutive disruption of the Selenop gene have been key to delineate the importance of selenoproteins in neurobiology. However, the phenotype of this mouse model is exquisitely dependent on selenium supply and timing of selenium supplementation. Combining biochemical, histological, and behavioral methods, we tested the hypothesis that parvalbumin-expressing interneurons in the primary somatosensory cortex and hippocampus depend on dietary selenium availability in Selenop-/- mice. Selenop-deficient mice kept on adequate selenium diet (0.15 mg/kg, i.e. the recommended dietary allowance, RDA) developed ataxia, tremor, and hyperexcitability between the age of 4-5 weeks. Video-electroencephalography demonstrated epileptic seizures in Selenop-/- mice fed the RDA diet, while Selenop +/- heterozygous mice behaved normally. Both neurological phenotypes, hyper-excitability/seizures and ataxia/dystonia were successfully prevented by selenium supplementation from birth or transgenic expression of human SELENOP under a hepatocyte-specific promoter. Selenium supplementation with 10 mu M selenite in the drinking water on top of the RDA diet increased the activity of glutathione peroxidase in the brains of Selenop-/- mice to control levels. The effects of selenium supplementation on the neurological phe-notypes were dose-and time-dependent. Selenium supplementation after weaning was apparently too late to prevent ataxia/dystonia, while selenium withdrawal from rescued Selenop-/- mice eventually resulted in ataxia. We conclude that SELENOP expression is essential for preserving interneuron survival under limiting Se supply, while SELENOP appears dispensable under sufficiently high Se status.

AB  - Growing body of evidence points to dysregulation of redox status in the brain as an important factor in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effects of l-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine (BSO), a glutathione (GSH) synthesis inhibitor, and 1-[2-Bis(4-fluorophenyl)methoxy]ethyl]-4-(3-phenylpropyl)piperazine dihydrochloride (GBR 12909), a dopamine reuptake inhibitor, given alone or in combination, to Sprague-Dawley pups during early postnatal development (p5-p16), on the time course of the onset of schizophrenia-like behaviors, and on the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA and its protein in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HIP) during adulthood. BSO administered alone decreased the levels of BDNF mRNA and its protein both in the PFC and HIP. Treatment with the combination of BSO + GBR 12909 also decreased BDNF mRNA and its protein in the PFC, but in the HIP, only the level of BDNF protein was decreased. Schizophrenia-like behaviors in rats were assessed at three time points of adolescence (p30, p42-p44, p60-p62) and in early adulthood (p90-p92) using the social interaction test, novel object recognition test, and open field test. Social and cognitive deficits first appeared in the middle adolescence stage and continued to occur into adulthood, both in rats treated with BSO alone or with the BSO + GBR 12909 combination. Behavior corresponding to positive symptoms in humans occurred in the middle adolescence period, only in rats treated with BSO + GBR 12909. Only in the latter group, amphetamine exacerbated the existing positive symptoms in adulthood. Our data show that rats receiving the BSO + GBR 12909 combination in the early postnatal life reproduced virtually all symptoms observed in patients with schizophrenia and, therefore, can be considered a valuable neurodevelopmental model of this disease.

AB  - The many respiratory viruses that cause influenza-like illness (ILI) are reported and tracked as one entity, defined by the CDC as a group of symptoms that include a fever of 100 degrees Fahrenheit, a cough, and/ or a sore throat. In the United States alone, ILI impacts 9-49 million people every year. While tracking ILI as a single clinical syndrome is informative in many respects, the underlying viruses differ in parameters and outbreak properties. Most existing models treat either a single respiratory virus or ILI as a whole. However, there is a need for models capable of comparing several individual viruses that cause respiratory illness, including ILI. To address this need, here we present a flexible model and simulations of epidemics for influenza, RSV, rhinovirus, seasonal coronavirus, adenovirus, and SARS/MERS, parameterized by a systematic literature review and accompanied by a global sensitivity analysis. We find that for these biological causes of ILI, their parameter values, timing, prevalence, and proportional contributions differ substantially. These results demonstrate that distinguishing the viruses that cause ILI will be an important aspect of future work on diagnostics, mitigation, modeling, and preparation for future pandemics.

AB  - Comparative research suggests that the hypothalamus is critical in switching between survival behaviors, yet it is unclear if this is the case in humans. Here, we investigate the role of the human hypothalamus in survival switching by introducing a paradigm where volunteers switch between hunting and escape in response to encounters with a virtual predator or prey. Given the small size and low tissue contrast of the hypothalamus, we used deep learning-based segmentation to identify the individual-specific hypothalamus and its subnuclei as well as an imaging sequence optimized for hypothalamic signal acquisition. Across 2 experiments, we employed computational models with identical structures to explain internal movement generation processes associated with hunting and escaping. Despite the shared structure, the models exhibited significantly different parameter values where escaping or hunting were accurately decodable just by computing the parameters of internal movement generation processes. In experiment 2, multi-voxel pattern analyses (MVPA) showed that the hypothalamus, hippocampus, and periaqueductal gray encode switching of survival behaviors while not encoding simple motor switching outside of the survival context. Furthermore, multi-voxel connectivity analyses revealed a network including the hypothalamus as encoding survival switching and how the hypothalamus is connected to other regions in this network. Finally, model-based fMRI analyses showed that a strong hypothalamic multi-voxel pattern of switching is predictive of optimal behavioral coordination after switching, especially when this signal was synchronized with the multi-voxel pattern of switching in the amygdala. Our study is the first to identify the role of the human hypothalamus in switching between survival behaviors and action organization after switching.
   Studies in animal models suggest that the hypothalamus is critical for modulating the switch between survival behaviors. In this study, neuroimaging combined with computational modeling shows that the hypothalamus also modulates switching between survival actions in humans.

AB  - Adult neurogenesis could be considered as a homeostatic mechanism that accompanies the continuous growth of teleost fish. As an alternative but not excluding hypothesis, adult neurogenesis would provide a form of plasticity necessary to adapt the brain to environmental challenges. The zebrafish pallium is a brain structure involved in the processing of various cognitive functions and exhibits extended neurogenic niches throughout the periventricular zone. The involvement of neuronal addition as a learning-related plastic mechanism has not been explored in this model, yet. In this work, we trained adult zebrafish in a spatial behavioral paradigm and evaluated the neurogenic dynamics in different pallial niches. We found that adult zebrafish improved their performance in a cue-guided rhomboid maze throughout five daily sessions, being the fish able to relearn the task after a rule change. This cognitive activity increased cell proliferation exclusively in two pallial regions: the caudal lateral pallium (cLP) and the rostral medial pallium (rMP). To assessed whether learning impinges on pallial adult neurogenesis, mitotic cells were labeled by BrdU administration, and then fish were trained at different periods of adult-born neuron maturation. Our results indicate that adult-born neurons are being produced on demand in rMP and cLP during the learning process, but with distinct critical periods among these regions. Next, we evaluated the time course of adult neurogenesis by pulse and chase experiments. We found that labeled cells decreased between 4 and 32 dpl in both learning-sensitive regions, whereas a fraction of them continues proliferating over time. By modeling the population dynamics of neural stem cells (NSC), we propose that learning increases adult neurogenesis by two mechanisms: driving a chained proliferation of labeled NSC and rescuing newborn neurons from death. Our findings highlight adult neurogenesis as a conserved source of brain plasticity and shed light on a rostro-caudal specialization of pallial neurogenic niches in adult zebrafish.

AB  - Acute brain insults trigger diverse cellular and signaling responses and often precipitate epilepsy. The cellular, molecular and signaling events relevant to the emergence of the epileptic brain, however, remain poorly understood. These multiplex structural and functional alterations tend also to be opposing - some homeostatic and reparative while others disruptive; some associated with growth and proliferation while others, with cell death. To differentiate pathological from protective consequences, we compared seizure-induced changes in gene expression hours and days following kainic acid (KA)-induced status epilepticus (SE) in postnatal day (P) 30 and P15 rats by capitalizing on age-dependent differential physiologic responses to KA-SE; only mature rats, not immature rats, have been shown to develop spontaneous recurrent seizures after KA-SE. To correlate gene expression profiles in epileptic rats with epilepsy patients and demonstrate the clinical relevance of our findings, we performed gene analysis on four patient samples obtained from temporal lobectomy and compared to four control brains from NICHD Brain Bank. Pro-inflammatory gene expressions were at higher magnitudes and more sustained in P30. The inflammatory response was driven by the cytokines IL-1 beta, IL-6, and IL-18 in the acute period up to 72 h and by IL-18 in the subacute period through the 10-day time point. In addition, a panoply of other immune system genes was upregulated, including chemokines, glia markers and adhesion molecules. Genes associated with the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways comprised the largest functional group identified. Through the integration of multiple ontological databases, we analyzed genes belonging to 13 separate pathways linked to Classical MAPK ERK, as well as stress activated protein kinases (SAPKs) p38 and JNK. Interestingly, genes belonging to the Classical MAPK pathways were mostly transiently activated within the first 24 h, while genes in the SAPK pathways had divergent time courses of expression, showing sustained activation only in P30. Genes in P30 also had different regulatory functions than in P15: P30 animals showed marked increases in positive regulators of transcription, of signaling pathways as well as of MAPKKK cascades. Many of the same inflammation-related genes as in epileptic rats were significantly upregulated in human hippocampus, higher than in lateral temporal neocortex. They included glia-associated genes, cytokines, chemokines and adhesion molecules and MAPK pathway genes. Uniquely expressed in human hippocampus were adaptive immune system genes including immune receptors CDs and MHC II HLAs. In the brain, many immune molecules have additional roles in synaptic plasticity and the promotion of neurite outgrowth. We propose that persistent changes in inflammatory gene expression after SE leads not only to structural damage but also to aberrant synaptogenesis that may lead to epileptogenesis. Furthermore, the sustained pattern of inflammatory genes upregulated in the epileptic mature brain was distinct from that of the immature brain that show transient changes and are resistant to cell death and neuropathologic changes. Our data suggest that the epileptogenic process may be a result of failed cellular signaling mechanisms, where insults overwhelm the system beyond a homeostatic threshold.

AB  - The Wnt signaling pathway induces various responses underlying the development and maturation of the nervous system. Wnt ligands are highly hydrophobic proteins that limit their diffusion through an aqueous extracellular medium to a target cell. Nevertheless, their attachment to small extracellular vesicles-like exosomes is one of the described mechanisms that allow their transport under this condition. Some Wnt ligands in these vehicles are expected to be dependent on post-translational modifications such as acylation. The mechanisms determining Wnt loading in exosomes and delivery to the target cells are largely unknown. Here, we took advantage of a cell model that secret a highly enriched population of small extracellular vesicles (sEVs), hippocampal HT-22 neurons. First, to establish the cell model, we characterized the morphological and biochemical properties of an enriched fraction of sEVs obtained from hippocampal HT-22 neurons that express NCAM-L1, a specific exosomal neuronal marker. Transmission electron microscopy showed a highly enriched fraction of exosome-like vesicles. Next, the exosomal presence of Wnt3a, Wnt5a, and Wnt7a was confirmed by western blot analysis and electron microscopy combined with immunogold. Also, we studied whether palmitoylation is a necessary post-translational modification for the transport Wnt in these vesicles. We found that proteinase-K treatment of exosomes selectively decreased their Wnt5a and Wnt7a content, suggesting that their expression is delimited to the exterior membrane surface. In contrast, Wnt3a remained attached, suggesting that it is localized within the exosome lumen. On the other hand, Wnt-C59, a specific inhibitor of porcupine O-acyltransferase (PORCN), decreased the association of Wnt with exosomes, suggesting that Wnt ligand acylation is necessary for them to be secreted by exosomes. These findings may help to understand the action of the Wnt ligands in the target cell, which could be defined during the packaging of the ligands in the secretory cell sEVs.</p>

AB  - Severe early life stress has long been associated with neuropsychological disorders in adulthood, including depression, schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder, and memory dysfunction. To some extent, all of these conditions involve dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and reduced negative feedback inhibition of cortisol release in adulthood. However, the time course for mental health and hormonal outcomes across life stages and the attributes of early life stress that direct the behavioral and biological alterations is not fully understood. We designed our studies to compare outcomes of the two most common maternal deprivation schedules on cognitive ability prior to adulthood. We exposed rat pups to daily or randomly spaced maternal separation bouts within the first 3 weeks of life and examined cognitive performance, neurotrophic signaling, and stress and immune system markers during puberty. We found that the daily separation schedule impaired spatial learning while the randomly spaced schedule did not alter maze performance relative to normally reared control animals. Animals that underwent daily separation showed a tendency for reduced body weight compared to the randomly spaced condition, but there were no differences in adrenal weight. Thymus weight normalized by body weight was increased following daily separation compared to random separation and control conditions. Plasma corticosterone levels measured after behavior testing did not differ amongst experimental groups and there was no impact of TrKB receptor inhibition. Combined, the results show that different early life stress schedules produce different behavioral and biological outcomes when measured at puberty. Combined with prior findings from more mature animals, the results presented here suggest that daily neonatal stress produces varied alterations in spatial cognition at different life stages with a transient learning deficit at puberty preceding a more persistent and a progressive memory impairment through adulthood and into aging.

AB  - Recently, the incidences of insulin resistance (IR) and IR-related complications have increased throughout the world, which also associate with poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Numerous studies had been focused on the role of IR in tumorigenesis and prognosis of HCC. The proteomic analysis of IR related hepatocellular carcinoma had not been reported by now. In the present study, 196 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified between insulin resistant HepG2 cells and their parental cells, of which 109 proteins were downregulated and 87 proteins were upregulated. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that these DEPs were highly enriched in process of tumorigenesis and tumor progression. PPI network analysis showed that SOX9, YAP1 and GSK3 beta as the key nodes, were involved in Wnt and Hippo signaling pathways. Survival analysis revealed that high expression of SOX9 and PRKD3 were strongly associated with reduced patient survival rate. parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) and Western blot analysis were applied to verify the protein level of these four key nodes mentioned above, which showed the same trend as quantified by isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) and confirmed the reliability of our Proteome Profiling analysis. Our results indicated that IR related dysregulation of protein expression might participated in tumorigenesis and malignant phenotype of hepatocarcinoma cells.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of alcohol intoxication and withdrawal on hypothalamic neurohormones such as corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and arginine vasopressin (AVP), and extrahypothalamic neurotransmitters such as striatal dopamine (DA), amygdalar gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), and hippocampal glutamate (GLU). In addition, the participation of the two CRF receptors, CRF1 and CRF2, was investigated. For this purpose, male Wistar rats were exposed to repeated intraperitoneal (ip) administration of alcohol every 12 h, for 4 days and then for 1 day of alcohol abstinence. On the fifth or sixth day, intracerebroventricular (icv) administration of selective CRF1 antagonist antalarmin or selective CRF2 antagonist astressin(2)B was performed. After 30 min, the expression and concentration of hypothalamic CRF and AVP, the concentration of plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and corticosterone (CORT), and the release of striatal DA, amygdalar GABA, and hippocampal GLU were measured. Our results indicate that the neuroendocrine changes induced by alcohol intoxication and withdrawal are mediated by CRF1, not CRF2, except for the changes in hypothalamic AVP, which are not mediated by CRF receptors.

AB  - Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), responsible for the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, causes respiratory failure and damage to multiple organ systems. The emergence of viral variants poses a risk of vaccine failures and prolongation of the pandemic. However, our understanding of the molecular basis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and subsequent COVID-19 pathophysiology is limited. In this study, we have uncovered a critical role for the evolutionarily conserved Hippo signaling pathway in COVID-19 pathogenesis. Given the complexity of COVID-19-associated cell injury and immunopathogenesis processes, we investigated Hippo pathway dynamics in SARS-CoV-2 infection by utilizing COVID-19 lung samples and human cell models based on pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (PSC-CMs) and human primary lung air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures. SARS-CoV-2 infection caused activation of the Hippo signaling pathway in COVID-19 lung and in vitro cultures. Both parental and Delta variant of concern (VOC) strains induced Hippo pathway. The chemical inhibition and gene knockdown of upstream kinases MST1/2 and LATS1 resulted in significantly enhanced SARS-CoV-2 replication, indicating antiviral roles. Verteporfin, a pharmacological inhibitor of the Hippo pathway downstream transactivator, YAP, significantly reduced virus replication. These results delineate a direct antiviral role for Hippo signaling in SARS-CoV-2 infection and the potential for this pathway to be pharmacologically targeted to treat COVID-19.

AB  - Crushing and eating hard prey (durophagy) is mechanically demanding. The cartilage jaws of durophagous stingrays are known to be reinforced relative to non-durophagous relatives, with a thickened external cortex of mineralized blocks (tesserae), reinforcing struts inside the jaw (trabeculae), and pavement-like dentition. These strategies for skeletal strengthening against durophagy, however, are largely understood only from myliobatiform stingrays, although a hard prey diet has evolved multiple times in batoid fishes (rays, skates, guitarfishes). We perform a quantitative analysis of micro-CT data, describing jaw strengthening mechanisms in Rhina ancylostoma (Bowmouth Guitarfish) and Rhynchobatus australiae (White-spotted Wedgefish), durophagous members of the Rhinopristiformes, the sister taxon to Myliobatiformes. Both species possess trabeculae, more numerous and densely packed in Rhina, albeit simpler structurally than those in stingrays like Aetobatus and Rhinoptera. Rhina and Rhynchobatus exhibit impressively thickened jaw cortices, often involving > 10 tesseral layers, most pronounced in regions where dentition is thickest, particularly in Rhynchobatus. Age series of both species illustrate that tesserae increase in size during growth, with enlarged and irregular tesserae associated with the jaws' oral surface in larger (older) individuals of both species, perhaps a feature of ageing. Unlike the flattened teeth of durophagous myliobatiform stingrays, both rhinopristiform species have oddly undulating dentitions, comprised of pebble-like teeth interlocked to form compound "meta-teeth " (large spheroidal structures involving multiple teeth). This is particularly striking in Rhina, where the upper/lower occlusal surfaces are mirrored undulations, fitting together like rounded woodworking finger-joints. Trabeculae were previously thought to have arisen twice independently in Batoidea; our results show they are more widespread among batoid groups than previously appreciated, albeit apparently absent in the phylogenetically basal Rajiformes. Comparisons with several other durophagous and non-durophagous species illustrate that batoid skeletal reinforcement architectures are modular: trabeculae can be variously oriented and are dominant in some species (e.g. Rhina, Aetobatus), whereas cortical thickening is more significant in others (e.g. Rhynchobatus), or both reinforcing features can be lacking (e.g. Raja, Urobatis). We discuss interactions and implications of character states, framing a classification scheme for exploring cartilage structure evolution in the cartilaginous fishes.

AB  - Computational models of brain regions are crucial for understanding neuronal network dynamics and the emergence of cognitive functions. However, current supercomputing limitations hinder the implementation of large networks with millions of morphological and biophysical accurate neurons. Consequently, research has focused on simplified spiking neuron models, ranging from the computationally fast Leaky Integrate and Fire (LIF) linear models to more sophisticated non -linear implementations like Adaptive Exponential (AdEX) and Izhikevic models, through Generalized Leaky Integrate and Fire (GLIF) approaches. However, in almost all cases, these models are tuned (and can be validated) only under constant current injections and they may not, in general, also reproduce experimental findings under variable currents. This study introduces an Adaptive GLIF (A-GLIF) approach that addresses this limitation by incorporating a new set of update rules. The extended A-GLIF model successfully reproduces both constant and variable current inputs, and it was validated against the results obtained using a biophysical accurate model neuron. This enhancement provides researchers with a tool to optimize spiking neuron models using classic experimental traces under constant current injections, reliably predicting responses to synaptic inputs, which can be confidently used for large-scale network implementations.

AB  - In birds, male gonads form on both sides whereas most females develop asymmetric gonads. Multiple early lines of evidence suggested that the right gonad fails to develop into a functional ovary, mainly due to differential expression of PITX2 in the gonadal epithelium. Despite some advances in recent years, the molecular mechanisms underlying asymmetric gonadal development remain unclear. Here, using bulk analysis of whole gonads, we established a relatively detailed profile of four representative stages of chicken gonadal development at the transcriptional and chromatin levels. We revealed that many candidate genes were significantly enriched in morphogenesis, meiosis and subcellular structure formation, which may be responsible for asymmetric gonadal development. Further chromatin accessibility analysis suggested that the transcriptional activities of the candidate genes might be regulated by nearby open chromatin regions, which may act as transcription factor (TF) binding sites and potential cis-regulatory elements. We found that LHX9 was a promising TF that bound to the left-biased peaks of many cell cycle-related genes. In summary, this study provides distinctive insights into the potential molecular basis underlying the asymmetric development of chicken gonads.

AB  - Background: S100 Calcium Binding Protein A16 (S100A16), a novel member of S100 protein family, is linked to tumorigenic processes and abundantly expressed in CNS tissues. Our study aimed to explore the biological function and possible mechanism of S100A16 in the progression of glioma.
   Methods: Sequence data of S100A16 and survival prognosis of glioma patients were initially analyzed using public databases. Glioma tissues were collected to examine S100A16 expression levels. Glioma cell lines and nude mice were subjected to in vitro and in vivo functional experiments. Western blot, immunofluorescence (IF), immunoprecipitation (IP) and ubiquitination assays were done to further elucidate the underlying mechanism.
   Results: This study firstly revealed that S100A16 was markedly up-regulated in glioma, and patients with higher S100A16 levels have a shorter survival time. S100A16 overexpression promoted the proliferation, invasion and migration of glioma cells, and the tumor formation of nude mice. Importantly, we identified S100A16 as a negative regulator of the Hippo pathway which could decrease LATS1 expression levels, promote the YAP nuclear import and initiate the downstream target genes CYR61 and CTGF. Moreover, our data showed that S100A16 destabilized LATS1 protein by inducing the CUL4A-mediated LATS1 ubiquitination degradation.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrated a vital biological role of S100A16 in glioma progression mechanism by promoting CUL4A-mediated LATS1 ubiquitination to inhibit Hippo signaling pathway. S100A16 could be a novel biomarker and treatment option for glioma patients.

AB  - In briefThe HIPPO signaling effectors YAP1 and WWTR1 are required for murine pregnancy initiation, and mutation of these factors compromises the decidualization response and overall pregnancy success.AbstractEndometrial stromal cell decidualization is required for pregnancy success. Although this process is integral to fertility, many of the intricate molecular mechanisms contributing to decidualization remain undefined. One pathway that has been implicated in endometrial stromal cell decidualization in humans in vitro is the HIPPO signaling pathway. Two previously conducted studies showed that the effectors of the HIPPO signaling pathway YAP1 and WWTR1 are required for decidualization of primary endometrial stromal cells in vitro. To investigate the in vivo role of YAP1 and WWTR1 in decidualization and pregnancy initiation, we generated progesterone receptor Cre-mediated mutation of a combination of Yap1 and Wwtr1 alleles. Female Yap1 and Wwtr1 triple allele mutants exhibited subfertility, a compromised decidualization response, decreased endometrial receptivity, delayed embryonic development and a unique transcriptional profile at 7.5 days post-coitus (dpc). Bulk mRNA sequencing revealed aberrant maternal remodeling evidenced by significant alterations in extracellular matrix-encoding genes at 7.5 dpc in mutant dams and enrichment for terms associated with fertility-compromising diseases such as pre-eclampsia and endometriosis. In addition, differentially expressed genes overlapped directionally with estrogen receptor- and epidermal growth factor receptor-regulated genes as identified by microarray. Our results indicate that Yap1 and Wwtr1 are necessary for successful mammalian pregnancy initiation.

AB  - Angiogenesis is an essential process during development. Abnormal angiogenesis also contributes to many disease conditions such as tumor and retinal diseases. Previous studies have established the Hippo signaling pathway effector Yes-associated protein (YAP) as a crucial regulator of angiogenesis. In ECs, activated YAP promotes endothelial cell proliferation, migration and sprouting. YAP activity is regulated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and mechanical cues such as extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness. However, it is unclear how VEGF or ECM stiffness signal to YAP, especially how dephosphorylation of YAP occurs in response to VEGF stimulus or ECM stiffening. Here, we show that protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is required for this process. Blocking PP2A activity abolishes VEGF or ECM stiffening mediated YAP activation. Systemic administration of a PP2A inhibitor suppresses YAP activity in blood vessels in developmental and pathological angiogenesis mouse models. Consistently, PP2A inhibitor also inhibits sprouting angiogenesis. Mechanistically, PP2A directly interacts with YAP, and this interaction requires proper cytoskeleton dynamics. These findings identify PP2A as a crucial mediator of YAP activation in ECs and hence as an important regulator of angiogenesis.

Mutations in LZTR1 are associated with cancers and Noonan syndrome, the most common RASopathy. The expression and function of Lztr1 in the developing brain remains poorly understood. Here we show that Lztr1 is expressed in distinct regions of the telencephalon, the most anterior region of the forebrain. Lztr1 expression was robust in the cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, and oligodendrocytes in the white matter. To gain insight into the impact of Lztr1 deficiency, we generated a conditional knockout (cKO) restricted to the telencephalon using Foxg1(IREScre/+). Lztr1 cKOs are viable to postnatal stages and show reduced Lztr1 expression in the telencephalon. Interestingly, Lztr1 cKOs exhibit an increase in MAPK pathway activation in white matter regions and subsequently show an altered expression of stage-specific markers in the oligodendrocyte lineage with increased oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) and decreased markers of oligodendrocyte differentiation. Moreover, Lztr1 cKOs also exhibit an increased expression of the astrocyte marker GFAP. These results highlight the generation of a new mouse model to study Lztr1 deficiency in the brain and reveal a novel role for Lztr1 in normal oligodendrocyte and astrocyte development in the telencephalon.

AB  - Syngnathid embryos (seahorses, pipefishes and seadragons) develop on or in the male in a specialised brooding structure (brood pouch). Seahorse brood pouches supply nutrients, including lipids, to developing embryos (patrotrophy). We tested the hypothesis that proteins, vital for gene regulation and tissue growth during embryogenesis, are also transported from father to embryos, using the Australian pot-bellied seahorse, Hippocampus abdominalis. We used dry masses and total nitrogen content to estimate the total protein content of newly fertilised egg and neonate H. abdominalis. Neonates contained significantly greater protein mass than newly fertilised eggs. This result indicates that paternal protein transport to developing embryos occurs during H. abdominalis pregnancy. This study is the first to show paternal protein transport during pregnancy in seahorses, and furthers our understanding of paternal influence on embryonic development in male pregnant vertebrates.

AB  - Purpose: The LIM (Lin-11, Isl1, MEC-3) domain protein AJUBA is involved in multiple biological functions, and its aberrant expression is related to the occurrence and progression of various cancers. However, there are no analytical studies on AJUBA in pan-cancer.Methods: We performed a comprehensive pan-cancer analysis and explored the potential oncogenic roles of AJUBA, including gene expression, genetic mutation, protein phosphorylation, clinical diagnostic biomarker, prognosis, and AJUBA-related immune infiltration based on The Cancer Genome Atlas and Genotype-Tissue Expression databases.Results: The results revealed that the expression of AJUBA highly correlated with poor clinical outcomes in patients with different types of cancer. Meanwhile, AJUBA expression was positively correlated with cancer-associated fibroblasts in many human cancers, such as breast invasive carcinoma, colon adenocarcinoma, brain lower-grade glioma, lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), and ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma (OV). Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analyses showed that AJUBA is mainly involved in protein serine/threonine kinase activity, cell-cell junction, covalent chromatin modification, and Hippo signaling pathway.Conclusion: The pan-cancer study reveals the oncogenic roles of AJUBA and provides a comprehensive understanding of the molecular biological genetic information of AJUBA in various tumors.

AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver cancer with high incidence and mortality. MiR-597-5p is downregulated in tumor tissues of HCC compared with non-tumor tissues. However, its role in HCC is still unknown. This study aims to assess the function of miR-597-5p in HCC development and investigate the underlying mechanism. To perform gain- and loss-of-function studies, SK-HEP-1 cells and Huh-7 cells were transfected with miR-597-5p mimics and inhibitor, respectively. MiR-597-5p markedly reduced the cell viability and the expression of Ki-67 in HCC cells. MiR-597-5p also repressed the cell cycle progression of HCC cells and the protein levels of cyclin D1 and CDK2. Moreover, miR597-5p inhibited the migration and invasion of HCC cells and decreased MMP2 and MMP9 levels. Transcriptional enhancer associate domain transcription factor 1 (TEAD1) was identified as a target of miR-597-5p by luciferase reporter assay. TEAD1 and its downstream target genes, CTGF and CYR61, were downregulated by miR-597-5p in HCC cells. Furthermore, miR-597-5p was demonstrated to function in HCC progression by targeting TEAD1 via TEAD1 expression gain and loss. Our study demonstrates that miR-597-5p represses the proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCC cells through targeting TEAD1, which provides a therapeutic target for HCC treatment.

AB  - Hypoxia drives aging and promotes age-related cognition and hearing functional decline. Despite the role of erythrocytes in oxygen (O-2) transport, their role in the onset of aging and age-related cognitive decline and hearing loss (HL) remains undetermined. Recent studies revealed that signaling through the erythrocyte adenosine A2B receptor (ADORA2B) promotes O-2 release to counteract hypoxia at high altitude. However, nothing is known about a role for erythrocyte ADORA2B in age-related functional decline. Here, we report that loss of murine erythrocyte-specific ADORA2B (eAdora2b(-/-)) accelerates early onset of age-related impairments in spatial learning, memory, and hearing ability. eAdora2b(-/-) mice display the early aging-like cellular and molecular features including the proliferation and activation of microglia and macrophages, elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and attenuation of hypoxia-induced glycolytic gene expression to counteract hypoxia in the hippocampus (HIP), cortex, or cochlea. Hypoxia sufficiently accelerates early onset of cognitive and cochlear functional decline and inflammatory response in eAdora2b(-/-) mice. Mechanistically, erythrocyte ADORA2B-mediated activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and bisphosphoglycerate mutase (BPGM) promotes hypoxic and metabolic reprogramming to enhance production of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG), an erythrocyte-specific metabolite triggering O-2 delivery. Significantly, this finding led us to further discover that murine erythroblast ADORA2B and BPGM mRNA levels and erythrocyte BPGM activity are reduced during normal aging. Overall, we determined that erythrocyte ADORA2B-BPGM axis is a key component for anti-aging and anti-age-related functional decline.

AB  - The three-dimensional (3D) morphologies of many organs in organisms, such as the curved shapes of leaves and flowers, the branching structure of lungs, and the exoskeletal shape of insects, are formed through surface growth. Although differential growth, a mode of surface growth, has been qualitatively identified as 3D morphogenesis, a quantitative understanding of the mechanical contribution of differential growth is lacking. To address this, we developed a quantitative inference method to analyze the distribution of the area expansion rate, which governs the growth of surfaces into 3D morphology. To validate the accuracy of our method, we tested it on a basic 3D morphology that allowed for the theoretical derivation of the area expansion rate distribution, and then assessed the difference between the predicted outcome and the theoretical solution. We also applied this method to complex 3D shapes and evaluated its accuracy through numerical experiments. The findings of the study revealed a linear decrease in error on a log-log scale with an increase in the number of meshes in both evaluations. This affirmed the reliability of the predictions for meshes that are sufficiently refined. Moreover, we employed our methodology to analyze the developmental process of the Japanese rhinoceros beetle Trypoxylus dichotomus, which is characterized by differential growth regulating 3D morphogenesis. The results indicated a notably high rate of area expansion on the left and right edges of the horn primordium, which is consistent with the experimental evidence of a higher rate of cell division in these regions. Hence, these findings confirm the efficacy of the proposed method in analyzing biological systems.

AB  - Throughout adulthood neural stem cells divide in neurogenic niches-the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and the subventricular zone-producing progenitor cells and new neurons. Stem cells self-renew, thus preserving their pool. Furthermore, the number of stem/progenitor cells in the neurogenic niches decreases with age. We have previously demonstrated that the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16Ink4a maintains, in aged mice, the pool of dentate gyrus stem cells by preventing their activation after a neurogenic stimulus such as exercise (running). We showed that, although p16Ink4a ablation by itself does not activate stem/progenitor cells, exercise strongly induced stem cell proliferation in p16Ink4a knockout dentate gyrus, but not in wild-type. As p16Ink4a regulates stem cell self-renewal during aging, we sought to profile the dentate gyrus transcriptome from p16Ink4a wild-type and knockout aged mice, either sedentary or running for 12 days. By pairwise comparisons of differentially expressed genes and by correlative analyses through the DESeq2 software, we identified genes regulated by p16Ink4a deletion, either without stimulus (running) added, or following running. The p16Ink4a knockout basic gene signature, i.e., in sedentary mice, involves upregulation of apoptotic, neuroinflammation- and synaptic activity-associated genes, suggesting a reactive cellular state. Conversely, another set of 106 genes we identified, whose differential expression specifically reflects the pattern of proliferative response of p16 knockout stem cells to running, are involved in processes that regulate stem cell activation, such as synaptic function, neurotransmitter metabolism, stem cell proliferation control, and reactive oxygen species level regulation. Moreover, we analyzed the regulation of these stem cell-specific genes after a second running stimulus. Surprisingly, the second running neither activated stem cell proliferation in the p16Ink4a knockout dentate gyrus nor changed the expression of these genes, confirming that they are correlated to the stem cell reactivity to stimulus, a process where they may play a role regulating stem cell activation.

AB  - Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common mesenchymal tumors of the gastrointestinal tract. As the main GIST drivers, gain-of-function mutations in KIT or PDGFRA are closely associated with not only tumor development and progression but also therapeutic response. In addition to the status of KIT and PDGFRA, little is known about other potential GIST-related genes. In this study, we identified the mutation profiles in 49 KIT-mutated GIST tumors using the whole exome sequencing (WES) method. Furthermore, some representative mutations were further validated in an independent GIST cohort using the SNaPshot SNP assay. We identified extensive and diverse mutations of KIT in GIST, including many undescribed variants. In addition, we revealed some new tumor-related gene mutations with unknown pathogenicity. By enrichment analyses of gene function and protein-protein interaction network construction, we showed that these genes were enriched in several important cancer- or metabolism-related signaling pathways, including PI3K-AKT,RTK-RAS, Notch, Wnt, Hippo, mTOR, AMPK, and insulin signaling. In particular, DNA repair-related genes, including MLH1, MSH6, BRCA1, BRCA2, and POLE, are frequently mutated in GISTs, suggesting that immune checkpoint blockade may have promising clinical applications for these GIST subpopulations. In conclusion, in addition to extensive and diverse mutations of KIT, some genes related to DNA-repair and cell metabolism may play important roles in the development, progression and therapeutic response of GIST.

AB  - Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease characterized by airway inflammation. Lignosus rhinocerotis (LR), a medicinal mushroom rich in polysaccharide, has been traditionally used to treat various diseases, including asthma. This study aimed to fractionate, characterize and evaluate the anti-asthmatic effects of polysaccharides from LR (LRP). LRP was isolated and characterized using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), x-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. In an OVA-induced asthma model, BALB/c mice were sensitized, challenged, and intranasally treated with LRP. Experimental findings demonstrated that LRP exhibits a semi-crystalline nature with predicted structure of -> 4)-alpha-D-Glcp-(1 -> and -> 3)-beta-D-Glcp-(1 ->. LRP significantly reduced eosinophilia, Th2 cytokines, and IgE levels. Histological analysis revealed LRP's ability to decrease epithelial damage and epithelial and smooth muscle thickness in lung. Reductions in inflammatory cell infiltration, mucus production, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 1 expression were observed, although not statistically significant. Gene expression analysis indicated that LRP significantly downregulated the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression. This study highlights a detailed structural analysis of LRP and its potential as an alternative for the management of asthma. Further research is needed to elucidate the precise mechanisms of action and optimize its therapeutic application.

AB  - Collective cell migration (CCM) is involved in multiple biological processes, including embryonic morphogenesis, angiogenesis, and cancer invasion. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying CCM, especially leader cell formation, are poorly understood. Here, we show that a signaling pathway regulating angiomotin (AMOT) cleavage plays a role in CCM, using mammalian epithelial cells and mouse models. In a confluent epithelial monolayer, full-length AMOT localizes at cell-cell junctions and limits cell motility. After cleavage, the C-terminal fragment of AMOT (AMOT-CT) translocates to the cell-matrix interface to promote the maturation of focal adhesions (FAs), generate traction force, and induce leader cell formation. Meanwhile, decreased full-length AMOT at cell-cell junctions leads to tissue fluidization and coherent migration of cell collectives. Hence, the cleavage of AMOT serves as a molecular switch to generate polarized contraction, promoting leader cell formation and CCM.

AB  - Epithelial homeostasis is an emergent property of both physical and biochemical signals emanating from neighboring cells and across tissue. A recent study reveals that Scribble, an apico-basal polarity determinant, cooperates with alpha-Catenin, an adherens junction component, to regulate tissue homeostasis in the Drosophila wing imaginal disc. However, it remains to be addressed whether similar mechanisms are utilized in vertebrates. In this study, we first address how alpha-Catenin cooperates with Scribble to regulate epithelial homeostasis and growth in mammalian cells. Our data show that alpha-Catenin and Scribble interact physically in mammalian cells. We then found that both alpha-Catenin and Scribble are required for regulating nuclear translocation of YAP, an effector of the Hippo signaling pathway. Furthermore, ectopic Scribble suffices to suppress YAP in an alpha-Catenin-dependent manner. Then, to test our hypothesis that Scribble amounts impact epithelial growth, we use the Drosophila wing imaginal disc. We show that Scribble expression is complementary to Yorkie signal, the Drosophila ortholog of YAP. Ectopic expression of full-length Scribble or Scribble Leucine Rich Region (LRR):alpha-Catenin chimera sufficiently down-regulates Yorkie signal, leading to smaller wing size. Moreover, Scribble LRR:alpha-Catenin chimera rescues scribble mutant clones in the wing imaginal disc to maintain tissue homeostasis. Taken together, our studies suggest that the association of cell polarity component Scribble with alpha-Catenin plays a conserved role in epithelial homeostasis and growth.

AB  - Understanding how individual memories are reactivated during sleep is essential in theorizing memory consolidation. Here, we employed the targeted memory reactivation (TMR) paradigm to unobtrusively replaying auditory memory cues during human participants' slow-wave sleep (SWS). Using representational similarity analysis (RSA) on cue-elicited electroencephalogram (EEG), we found temporally segregated and functionally distinct item-specific neural representations: the early post-cue EEG activity (within 0 to 2,000 ms) contained comparable item-specific representations for memory cues and control cues, signifying effective processing of auditory cues. Critically, the later EEG activity (2,500 to 2,960 ms) showed greater item-specific representations for post-sleep remembered items than for forgotten and control cues, indicating memory reprocessing. Moreover, these later item-specific neural representations were supported by concurrently increased spindles, particularly for items that had not been tested prior to sleep. These findings elucidated how external memory cues triggered item-specific neural representations during SWS and how such representations were linked to successful long-term memory. These results will benefit future research aiming to perturb specific memory episodes during sleep.
   Understanding how individual memories are reactivated during sleep is essential in understanding memory consolidation. This study shows that during human slow-wave sleep, unobtrusively re-presenting memory reminders elicits fine-grained item-specific neural representations that support the formation of long-term memories.

AB  - Recruitment of stem cells is crucial for tissue repair. Although stem cell niches can provide important signals, little is known about mechanisms that coordinate the engagement of disseminated stem cells across an injured tissue. In Drosophila, adult brain lesions trigger local recruitment of scattered dormant neural stem cells suggesting a mechanism for creating a transient stem cell activation zone. Here, we find that injury trig-gers a coordinated response in neuro-glial clusters that promotes the spread of a neuron-derived stem cell factor via glial secretion of the lipocalin-like transporter Swim. Strikingly, swim is induced in a Hif1-a-depen-dent manner in response to brain hypoxia. Mammalian Swim (Lcn7) is also upregulated in glia of the mouse hippocampus upon brain injury. Our results identify a central role of neuro-glial clusters in promoting neural stem cell activation at a distance, suggesting a conserved function of the HIF1-a/Swim/Wnt module in con-necting injury-sensing and regenerative outcomes.

AB  - Scrophularia ningpoensis Hemsl. is a traditional Chinese medicine used to regulate blood sugar levels, immunity, etc. We previously isolated polysaccharides from S. ningpoensis Hemsl. (SNPS) and innovatively observed that SNPS exhibit antidepressant properties; however, the underlying mechanism is still unclear. Here, we employed network pharmacology to predict the potential targets and antidepressant mechanism of SNPS. Accordingly, we detected the effects of SNPS on monoamine neurotransmitter synthesis, metabolism, receptor expression and signal transduction in reserpine (RES)-treated mice using ELISA, HPLC-electrochemistry, metabonomics, GolgiCox staining and Western blotting. Finally, the mechanism of SNPS on key targets (HTR2A and HTR2C) was verified in vivo and in vitro. Results showed that SNPS ameliorated depression by restoring monoamine neurotransmitter homeostasis and hippocampal neurogenesis. SNPS reversed the depletion of 5-HT, NE and DA by activating the tryptophan (Trp)/5-HT and tyrosine (Tyr)/DA/NE metabolic pathways. SNPS decreased HTR2A and HTR2C contents, leading to the phosphorylation of AKT and GSK3(3, followed by increases in (3-catenin, CBP and BDNF levels. Mechanistically, SNPS reduced the levels of HTR2A and HTR2C proteins by inhibiting their mRNA transcription, rather than inducing protein degradation. In conclusion, by inhibiting the transcription of HTR2A and HTR2C, SNPS activated the AKT/GSK3(3/(3-catenin/CBP/BDNF pathway, thereby exerting dosedependent antidepressant effects.

AB  - Full-scale morphologically and biophysically realistic model networks, aiming at modeling multiple brain areas, provide an invaluable tool to make significant scientific advances from in-silico experiments on cognitive functions to digital twin implementations. Due to the current technical limitations of supercomputer systems in terms of computational power and memory requirements, these networks must be implemented using (at least) simplified neurons. A class of models which achieve a reasonable compromise between accuracy and computational efficiency is given by generalized leaky integrate-and fire models complemented by suitable initial and update conditions. However, we found that these models cannot reproduce the complex and highly variable firing dynamics exhibited by neurons in several brain regions, such as the hippocampus. In this work, we propose an adaptive generalized leaky integrate-and-fire model for hippocampal CA1 neurons and interneurons, in which the nonlinear nature of the firing dynamics is successfully reproduced by linear ordinary differential equations equipped with nonlinear and more realistic initial and update conditions after each spike event, which strictly depends on the external stimulation current. A mathematical analysis of the equilibria stability as well as the monotonicity properties of the analytical solution for the membrane potential allowed (i) to determine general constraints on model parameters, reducing the computational cost of an optimization procedure based on spike times in response to a set of constant currents injections; (ii) to identify additional constraints to quantitatively reproduce and predict the experimental traces from 85 neurons and interneurons in response to any stimulation protocol using constant and piecewise constant current injections. Finally, this approach allows to easily implement a procedure to create infinite copies of neurons with mathematically controlled firing properties, statistically indistinguishable from experiments, to better reproduce the full range and variability of the firing scenarios observed in a real network.

AB  - Early forebrain patterning entails the correct regional designation of the neuroepithelium, and appropriate specification, generation, and distribution of neural cells during brain development. Specific signaling and transcription factors are known to tightly regulate patterning of the dorsal telencephalon to afford proper structural/functional cortical arealization and morphogenesis. Nevertheless, whether and how changes of the chromatin structure link to the transcriptional program(s) that control cortical patterning remains elusive. Here, we report that the BAF chromatin remodeling complex regulates the spatiotemporal patterning of the mouse dorsal telencephalon. To determine whether and how the BAF complex regulates cortical patterning, we conditionally deleted the BAF complex scaffolding subunits BAF155 and BAF170 in the mouse dorsal telencephalic neuroepithelium. Morphological and cellular changes in the BAF mutant forebrain were examined using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. RNA sequencing, Co-immunoprecipitation, and mass spectrometry were used to investigate the molecular basis of BAF complex involvement in forebrain patterning. We found that conditional ablation of BAF complex in the dorsal telencephalon neuroepithelium caused expansion of the cortical hem and medial cortex beyond their developmental boundaries. Consequently, the hippocampal primordium is not specified, the mediolateral cortical patterning is compromised, and the cortical identity is disturbed in the absence of BAF complex. The BAF complex was found to interact with the cortical hem suppressor LHX2. The BAF complex suppresses cortical hem fate to permit proper forebrain patterning. We provide evidence that BAF complex modulates mediolateral cortical patterning possibly by interacting with the transcription factor LHX2 to drive the LHX2-dependent transcriptional program essential for dorsal telencephalon patterning. Our data suggest a putative mechanistic synergy between BAF chromatin remodeling complex and LHX2 in regulating forebrain patterning and ontogeny.

AB  - The prevalent itching condition associated with aging, historically referred to as senile pruritus, diminishes quality of life. Despite its impact, effective treatments remain elusive, largely due to an incomplete understanding of its pathological cause. In this study, we reveal a subset of dorsal root ganglion neurons enriched with Zn2+ that express the vesicular Zn2+ transporter TMEM163. These neurons form direct synapses with and modulate the activity of spinal NPY+ inhibitory interneurons. In aged mice, both the expression of TMEM163 and the concentration of vesicular Zn2+ within the central terminals of TMEM163+ primary afferents show marked elevation. Importantly, the excessive release of vesicular Zn2+ significantly dampens the activity of NPY+ neurons, triggering the disinhibition of itch-transmitting neural circuits and resulting in chronic itch. Intriguingly, chelating Zn2+ within the spinal dorsal horn effectively relieves itch in aged mice. Our study thus unveils a novel molecular mechanism underlying senile pruritus.

AB  - Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) that can participate in biological processes such as gene expression, growth, and development. However, little has been explored about the function of circRNAs in the development of Apis cerana larval guts. By using our previously gained deep sequencing data from the guts of A. cerana worker larvae at 4-, 5-, and 6-day-old (Ac4, Ac5, and Ac6 groups), the expression pattern and regulatory role of circular RNAs (circRNAs) during the development process was comprehensively investigated, with a focus on differentially expressed circRNAs (DEcircRNAs) relevant to immunity pathways and developmental signaling pathways, followed by validation of the binding relationships among a key competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) axis. Here, 224 (158) DEcircRNAs were detected in the Ac4 vs. Ac5 (Ac5 vs. Ac6) comparison group. It's suggested that 172 (123) parental genes of DEcircRNAs were involved in 26 (20) GO terms such as developmental process and metabolic process and 138 (136) KEGG pathways like Hippo and Wnt signaling pathways. Additionally, ceRNA network analysis indicated that 21 (11) DEcircRNAs could target seven (three) DEmiRNAs, further targeting 324 (198) DEmRNAs. These DEmRNAs can be annotated to 33 (26) GO terms and 168 (200) KEGG pathways, including 12 (16) cellular and humoral immune pathways (endocytosis, lysosome, Jak-STAT, etc.) and 10 (nine) developmental signaling pathways (Hippo, mTOR, Hedgehog, etc.). Interestingly, DEcircRNAs in these two comparison groups could target the same ace-miR-6001-y, forming complex sub-networks. The results of PCR and Sanger sequencing confirmed the back-splicing sites within four randomly selected DEcircRNAs. RT-qPCR detection of these four DEcircRNAs verified the reliability of the used transcriptome data. The results of dual-luciferase reporter assay verified the binding relationships between novel_circ_001627 and ace-miR-6001-y and between ace-miR-6001-y and apterous-like. Our data demonstrated that DEcircRNAs were likely to modulate the developmental process of the A. cerana worker larval guts via regulation of parental gene transcription and ceRNA network, and novel_circ_001627/ace-miR-6001-y/apterous-like was a potential regulatory axis in the larval gut development. Findings from this work offer a basis and a candidate ceRNA axis for illustrating the circRNA-modulated mechanisms underlying the A. cerana larval guts.

AB  - The importance of the Hippo-Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) pathway in gastric carcinogenesis and metastasis has attracted considerable research attention; however, the regulatory network of YAP1 in gastric cancer (GC) is not completely understood. In this study, ubiquitin-specific peptidase 49 (USP49) was identified as a novel deubiquitinase of YAP1, knockdown of USP49 inhibited the proliferation, metastasis, chemoresistance, and peritoneal metastasis of GC cells. Overexpression of USP49 showed opposing biological effects. Moreover, USP49 was transcriptionally activated by the YAP1/TEAD4 complex, which formed a positive feedback loop with YAP1 to promote the malignant progression of GC cells. Finally, we collected tissue samples and clinical follow-up information from 482 GC patients. The results showed that USP49 expression was high in GC cells and positively correlated with the expression of YAP1 and its target genes, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and cysteine-rich angiogenic inducer 61 (CYR61). Survival and Cox regression analysis showed that high USP49 expression was associated with poor prognosis and was an independent prognostic factor. Moreover, patients with high USP49 and YAP1 expression had extremely short overall survival. The findings of this study reveal that the aberrant activation of the USP49/YAP1 positive feedback loop plays a critical role in the malignant progression of GC, thus providing potential novel prognostic factors and therapeutic targets for GC.

AB  - Exosomes, nanometer-sized membranous vesicles in body fluids, have emerged as promising non-invasive biomarkers for cancer diagnosis. However, the function of exosomes in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) remains elusive. This study aimed to investigate the role of exosomal miR-107 in lymphomagenesis and explore its clinical significance. In this study, decreased exosomal miR-107, miR-375-3p, and upregulated exosomal miR-485-3p were detected in the plasma of DLBCL patients and showed potential diagnostic value. Downregulated miR-107 expression was associated with advanced Ann Arbor stage, high IPI score, LDH, and beta(2)-MG level in DLBCL patients. Overexpression of miR-107 by miR-107 Agomir significantly abrogated cell proliferation, induced apoptosis, and inhibited cell invasion in vitro, and repressed tumor growth in vivo. Moreover, the downregulation of miR-107 went in the opposite direction. The target genes of miR-107 were mainly enriched in the PI3K-Akt, Hippo, and AMPK signaling pathways. Notably, upregulated 14-3-3 eta (YWHAH) was suppressed by miR-107 in DLBCL, suggesting that miR-107 may restrain tumorigenesis by targeting 14-3-3 eta. In summary, this study unveils the function of miR-107 in lymphomagenesis, highlighting its potential as a diagnostic and prognostic indicator and as a new therapeutic target in the management of DLBCL.

AB  - The chemical substances responsible for the kokumi taste of green tea infusion are still unclear. Here, we isolated the kokumi compound-containing fractions from green tea infusion through ultrafiltration, and the major kokumi compounds were characterized as gamma-Glu-Gln and gamma-Glu-Cys-Gly (GSH) through ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS). The results indicated that peptides and amino acids were essential compounds in the kokumi-enriched fractions for conducting the sense of kokumi. L-theanine had an enhancing effect on the kokumi taste of green tea infusion, which was confirmed in the sensory reconstitution study. Thus, peptides, especially gamma-Glu-Gln and GSH, are the major kokumi compounds in green tea infusion, which has the potential of improving the flavor of tea beverages.

AB  - Intermediate host species provide a crucial link in the emergence of zoonotic infectious diseases, serving as a population where an emerging pathogen can mutate to become human-transmissible. Identifying such species is thus a key component of predicting and possibly mitigating future epidemics. Despite this importance, intermediate host species have not been investigated in much detail, and have generally only been identified by testing for the presence of pathogens in multiple candidate species. In this paper, we present a mathematical model able to identify likely intermediate host species for emerging zoonoses based on ecological data for the candidates and epidemiological data for the pathogen. Since coronaviruses frequently emerge through intermediate host species and, at the time of writing, pose an urgent pandemic threat, we apply the model to the three emerging coronaviruses of the twenty-first century, accurately predicting palm civets as intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-1 and dromedary camels as intermediate hosts for MERS. Further, we suggest mink, pangolins, and ferrets as intermediate host species for SARS-CoV-2. With the capacity to evaluate intermediate host likelihood among different species, researchers can focus testing for possible infection sources and interventions more effectively.

AB  - Development of the Drosophila wing-a paradigm of organ development-is governed by 2 morphogens, Decapentaplegic (Dpp, a BMP) and Wingless (Wg, a Wnt). Both proteins are produced by defined subpopulations of cells and spread outwards, forming gradients that control gene expression and cell pattern as a function of concentration. They also control growth, but how is unknown. Most studies have focused on Dpp and yielded disparate models in which cells throughout the wing grow at similar rates in response to the grade or temporal change in Dpp concentration or to the different amounts of Dpp "equalized" by molecular or mechanical feedbacks. In contrast, a model for Wg posits that growth is governed by a progressive expansion in morphogen range, via a mechanism in which a minimum threshold of Wg sustains the growth of cells within the wing and recruits surrounding "pre-wing" cells to grow and enter the wing. This mechanism depends on the capacity of Wg to fuel the autoregulation of vestigial (vg)-the selector gene that specifies the wing state-both to sustain vg expression in wing cells and by a feed-forward (FF) circuit of Fat (Ft)/Dachsous (Ds) protocadherin signaling to induce vg expression in neighboring pre-wing cells. Here, we have subjected Dpp to the same experimental tests used to elucidate the Wg model and find that it behaves indistinguishably. Hence, we posit that both morphogens act together, via a common mechanism, to control wing growth as a function of morphogen range.

AB  - Subterranean termites build complex underground tunnel networks to efficiently gather food. Empirical observations indicate specific individuals are dedicated to tunneling, rarely interchanging tasks. However, considering the limited tunneling energy of termite populations, it is reasonable to expect regular task shifts between fatigued and rested individuals to maintain continuous tunneling and optimize foraging. To explore this disparity, we developed a sophisticated individual-based model simulating the termite tunneling process in two scenarios: one with task shifting and one without. In the task shift scenario, the initial group of termites excavates the tunnel, expends all their energy, and returns to the nest. A new group is then deployed to the tunnel tip to continue the excavation, collectively creating the final tunnel pattern. In the no task shift scenario, the initial group completes the tunneling without transitioning to subsequent groups. We compared the tunnel patterns of these two scenarios, focusing on tunnel directionality and size. The comparison revealed statistically no significant difference in tunnel directionality between the scenarios. However, the tunnel size was notably larger in the absence of task shift, suggesting that continuous tunneling without task shift may enhance food searching efficiency. In the discussion section, we briefly address the limitations of the model arising from differences between the simulations and actual termite systems. Additionally, we touch on the idea to explain the fact that only a fixed proportion of workers in a termite colony participate in tunneling activities.

AB  - It is widely believed that information storage in neuronal circuits involves nanoscopic structural changes at synapses, resulting in the formation of synaptic engrams. However, direct evidence for this hypothesis is lacking. To test this conjecture, we combined chemical potentiation, functional analysis by paired pre-postsynaptic recordings, and structural analysis by electron microscopy (EM) and freeze-fracture replica labeling (FRL) at the rodent hippocampal mossy fiber synapse, a key synapse in the trisynaptic circuit of the hippocampus. Biophysical analysis of synaptic transmission revealed that forskolin-induced chemical potentiation increased the readily releasable vesicle pool size and vesicular release probability by 146% and 49%, respectively. Structural analysis of mossy fiber synapses by EM and FRL demonstrated an increase in the number of vesicles close to the plasma membrane and the number of clusters of the priming protein Munc13-1, indicating an increase in the number of both docked and primed vesicles. Furthermore, FRL analysis revealed a significant reduction of the distance between Munc13-1 and CaV2.1 Ca2+ channels, suggesting reconfiguration of the channel-vesicle coupling nanotopography. Our results indicate that presynaptic plasticity is associated with structural reorganization of active zones. We propose that changes in potential nanoscopic organization at synaptic vesicle release sites may be correlates of learning and memory at a plastic central synapse.

AB  - Background: Chronic neuropathic pain is commonly associated with memory loss, which increases the risk of dementia, lowers life quality and spending. On the other hand, the molecular processes are unknown, and effective therapies have yet to be discovered. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging potential therapeutic targets for chronic pain, but their role in chronic pain-induced memory impairment is unknown.Methods: We established a CCI-induced memory impairment rat model. To investigate and validate the gene expression alterations in the hippocampus of CCI-induced memory impairment, we used RNA-Seq, bioinformatics analysis, qRT-PCR, western blot, immunostaining, Nissl staining, and Diaminobenzidine-enhanced Perls' stain.Results: CCI rats displayed long-term memory deficits in the Y maze and novel objective recognition tests, and chronic mechanical and thermal pain hypersensitivity in the hind paws. We found a total of 179 differentially expressed mRNAs (DEmRNAs) (81 downregulated and 98 upregulated) and 191 differentially expressed long noncoding RNAs (DElncRNAs) (87 downregulated and 105 upregulated) between the hippocampus CA1 of CCI-induced memory impairment model and the sham control, using RNA-Seq expression profiles. The most enriched pathways involving oxidation and iron metabolism were explored using a route and function pathway analysis of DEmRNAs and DElncRNAs. We also discovered that ATF3 was considerably overexpressed in the hippocampal CA1 area, and gene markers of ferroptosis, such as GPX4, SLC7A11, SLC1A5, and PTGS2, were dysregulated in the CCI-induced memory impairment paradigm. Furthermore, in the hippocampus CA1 of CCI-induced memory impairment, lipid peroxidation and iron overload were considerably enhanced. Fer-1 treatment reversed ferroptosis damage of CCI with memory impairment model. Finally, in CCI-induced memory impairment, a competing RNA network analysis of DElncRNAs and DEmRNAs was performed to investigate the putative regulatory link of DElncRNAs on DEmRNAs via miRNA sponging.Conclusion: Using RNA-Seq, we created a genome-wide profile of the whole hippocampus of a rat model of CCI-induced memory impairment. In the hippocampus, pathways and function analyses revealed numerous intriguing genes and pathways involved in ferroptosis and memory impairment in response to chronic pain stress. As a result, our research may aid in the identification of potential and effective treatments for CCI-induced memory impairment.

AB  - Vertebrates such as zebrafish have the outstanding ability to fully regenerate their retina upon injury, while mammals, including humans, do not. In zebrafish, upon light-induced injury, photoreceptor regeneration is achieved through reprogramming of Muller glia cells, which proliferate and give rise to a self-renewing population of progenitors that migrate to the lesion site to differentiate into the new photoreceptors. The Hippo pathway effector YAP was recently implicated in the response to damage in the retina, but how this transcription coactivator is integrated into the signaling network regulating Muller glia reprogramming has not yet been explored. Here, we show that Yap is required in Muller glia to engage their response to a lesion by regulating their cell cycle reentry and progenitor cell formation, contributing to the differentiation of new photoreceptors. We propose that this regulation is accomplished through a lin28a-ascl1a-dependent mechanism, bona fide Muller glia-reprogramming factors. Overall, this study presents Yap as a key regulator of zebrafish Muller glia reprogramming and consequently retina regeneration upon injury.

AB  - Interactions among brain rhythms play a crucial role in organizing neuronal firing sequences during specific cognitive functions. In memory formation, the coupling between the phase of the theta rhythm and the amplitude of gamma oscillations has been extensively studied in the hippocampus. Prevailing perspectives suggest that the phase of the slower oscillation modulates the fast activity. However, recent metrics, such as Cross-Frequency Directionality (CFD), indicate that these electrophysiological interactions can be bidirectional. Using a computational model, we demonstrate that feedforward inhibition modeled by a theta-modulated ING (Interneuron Network Gamma) mechanism induces fast-to-slow interactions, while feedback inhibition through a theta-modulated PING (Pyramidal Interneuron Network Gamma) model drives slow-to-fast interactions. Importantly, in circuits combining both feedforward and feedback motifs, as commonly found experimentally, directionality is flexibly modulated by synaptic strength within biologically realistic ranges. A signature of this interaction is that fast-to-slow dominance in feedforward motifs is associated with gamma oscillations of higher frequency, and vice versa. Using previously acquired electrophysiological data from the hippocampus of rats freely navigating in a familiar environment or in a novel one, we show that CFD is dynamically regulated and linked to the frequency of the gamma band, as predicted by the model. Finally, the model attributes each theta-gamma interaction scheme, determined by the balance between feedforward and feedback inhibition, to distinct modes of information transmission and integration, adding computational flexibility. Our results offer a plausible neurobiological interpretation for cross-frequency directionality measurements associated with the activation of different underlying motifs that serve distinct computational needs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Yellow leaf green tea (YLGT) is a new variety of Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Ktze, which has yellow leaves and the unique qualities of 'three green through three yellow'. The present study aimed to investigate the anti-obesity effect of YLGT in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) and to explore the potential mechanisms by regulating the AMPK/ACC/SREBP1c signaling pathways and gut microbiota. RESULTS: The results showed that YLGT aqueous extract reduced body weight, hepatic inflammation, fat accumulation and hyperlipidemia in HFD-induced C57BL/6J mice, and also accelerated energy metabolism, reduced fat synthesis and suppressed obesity by activating the AMPK/CPT-1 alpha signaling pathway and inhibiting the FAS/ACC/SREBP-1c signaling pathway. Fecal microbiota transplantation experiment further confirmed that the alteration of gut microbiota (e.g. increasing unclassified_Muribaculaceae and decreasing Colidextribacter) might be an important cause of YLGT water extract inhibiting obesity. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, YLGT has a broad application prospect in the treatment of obesity and the development of anti-obesity function beverages. (c) 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - The search for strategies for strengthening the synaptic efficiency in A beta(25-35)-treated slices is a challenge for the compensation of amyloidosis-related pathologies. Here, we used the recording of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs), nitric oxide (NO) imaging, measurements of serine/threonine protein phosphatase (STPP) activity, and the detection of the functional mitochondrial parameters in suspension of brain mitochondria to study the A beta(25-35)-associated signaling in the hippocampus. A beta(25-35) aggregates shifted the kinase-phosphatase balance during the long-term potentiation (LTP) induction in the enhancement of STPP activity. The PP1/PP2A inhibitor, okadaic acid, but not the PP2B blocker, cyclosporin A, prevented A beta(25-35)-dependent LTP suppression for both simultaneous and delayed enzyme blockade protocols. STPP activity in the A beta(25-35)-treated slices was upregulated, which is reverted relative to the control values in the presence of PP1/PP2A but not in the presence of the PP2B blocker. A selective inhibitor of stress-induced PP1 alpha, sephin1, but not of the PP2A blocker, cantharidin, is crucial for A beta(25-35)-mediated LTP suppression prevention. A mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (mNCX) blocker, CGP37157, also attenuated the A beta(25-35)-induced LTP decline. A beta(25-35) aggregates did not change the mitochondrial transmembrane potential or reactive oxygen species (ROS) production but affected the ion transport and Ca2+-dependent swelling of organelles. The staining of hippocampal slices with NO-sensitive fluorescence dye, DAF-FM, showed stimulation of the NO production in the A beta(25-35)-pretreated slices at the dendrite-containing regions of CA1 and CA3, in the dentate gyrus (DG), and in the CA1/DG somata. NO scavenger, PTIO, or nNOS blockade by selective inhibitor 3Br-7NI partly restored the A beta(25-35)-induced LTP decline. Thus, hippocampal NO production could be another marker for the impairment of synaptic plasticity in amyloidosis-related states, and kinase-phosphatase balance management could be a promising strategy for the compensation of A beta(25-35)-driven deteriorations.

AB  - Transient ischemic attacks (TIA) result from a temporary blockage in blood circulation in the brain. As TIAs cause disabilities and often precede full-scale strokes, the effects of TIA are investigated to develop neuroprotective therapies. We analyzed changes in mitochondrial network dynamics, mitophagy and biogenesis in sections of gerbil hippocampus characterized by a different neuronal survival rate after 5-minute ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) insult. Our research revealed a significantly greater mtDNA/nDNA ratio in CA2-3, DG hippocampal regions (5.8 +/- 1.4 vs 3.6 +/- 0.8 in CA1) that corresponded to a neuronal resistance to I/R. During reperfusion, an increase of profission (phospho-Ser616-Drp1/Drp1) and pro-fusion proteins (1.6 +/- 0.5 and 1.4 +/- 0.3 for Mfn2 and Opa1, respectively) was observed in CA2-3, DG. Selective autophagy markers, PINK1 and SQSTM1/p62, were elevated 24-96 h after I/R and accompanied by significant elevation of transcription factors proteins PGC-1 alpha and Nrf1 (1.2 +/- 0.4, 1.78 +/- 0.6, respectively) and increased respiratory chain proteins (e.g., 1.5 +/- 0.3 for complex IV at I/R 96 h). Contrastingly, decreased enzymatic activity of citrate synthase, reduced Hsp60 protein level and electron transport chain subunits (0.88 +/- 0.03, 0.74 +/- 0.1 and 0.71 +/- 0.1 for complex IV at I/R 96 h, respectively) were observed in I/R-vulnerable CA1. The phospho-Ser616-Drp1/Drp1 was increased while Mfn2 and total Opa1 reduced to 0.88 +/- 0.1 and 0.77 +/- 0.17, respectively. General autophagy, measured as LC3-II/I ratio, was activated 3 h after reperfusion reaching 2.37 +/- 0.9 of control. This study demonstrated that enhanced mitochondrial fusion, followed by late and selective mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis might together contribute to reduced susceptibility to TIA.

AB  - Endogenous opioid peptides serve as potent analgesics through the opioid receptor (OR) activation. However, they often suffer from poor metabolic stability, low lipophilicity, and low blood-brain barrier permeability. Researchers have developed many strategies to overcome the drawbacks of current pain medications and unwanted biological effects produced by the interaction with opioid receptors. Here, we tested multifunctional enkephalin analogs LYS739 (MOR/DOR agonist and KOR partial antagonist) and LYS744 (MOR/DOR agonist and KOR full antagonist) under in vivo conditions in comparison with MOR agonist, morphine. We applied 2D electrophoretic resolution to investigate differences in proteome profiles of crude membrane (CM) fractions isolated from the rat brain cortex and hippocampus exposed to the drugs (10 mg/kg, seven days). Our results have shown that treatment with analog LYS739 induced the most protein changes in cortical and hippocampal samples. The identified proteins were mainly associated with energy metabolism, cell shape and movement, apoptosis, protein folding, regulation of redox homeostasis, and signal transduction. Among these, the isoform of mitochondrial ATP synthase subunit beta (ATP5F1B) was the only protein upregulation in the hippocampus but not in the brain cortex. Contrarily, the administration of analog LYS744 caused a small number of protein alterations in both brain parts. Our results indicate that the KOR full antagonism, together with MOR/DOR agonism of multifunctional opioid ligands, can be beneficial in treating chronic pain states by reducing changes in protein expression levels but retaining analgesic efficacy.

AB  - Many biological systems are made to operate more quickly, efficiently, and with more power by storing elastic energy. This work introduces a straightforward bioinspired design for the quick manufacture of pre-stressed soft magnetic actuators. The actuator requires a lower magnetic field strength to be activated and can regain its original shape without the need for external stimuli. These characteristics are demonstrated in this work through the creation of actuators with round and helical shape structures inspired by the tendril plant and chameleon's tongue. Both the final form of the actuator and its actuation sequence may be programmed by controlling the direction and strength of the force utilised to pre-stress the elastomeric layer. Analytical models are presented to trace the actuators' energy storage, radius, and pitch. High-speed shape recovery after releasing the magnetic force and a strong grasping force are achieved due to the stored mechanical elastic energy. Experiments are conducted to analyse the shape changes, grasping action, and determine the actuation force. The manufacture of the grippers with zero-magnetic field strength holding capacities of up to 20 times their weight is made possible by the elastic energy that actuators store in their pre-stressed elastomeric layer. The outcomes of our research show that a unique magnetic field-controlled soft actuator can be created in different shapes and designs based on requirements.

AB  - The Hippo signal transduction network regulates transcription through Yap/Taz-Tead1-4 in many tissues including skeletal muscle. Whilst transgenic mice have been generated for many Hippo genes, the resultant skeletal muscle phenotypes were not always characterized. Here, we aimed to phenotype the hindlimb muscles of Hippo gene-mutated Lats1(-/-), Mst2(-/-), Vgll3(-/-), and Vgll4(+/-) mice. This analysis revealed that Lats1(-/-) mice have 11% more slow type I fibers than age and sex-matched wild-type controls. Moreover, the mRNA expression of slow Myh7 increased by 50%, and the concentration of type I myosin heavy chain is 80% higher in Lats1(-/-) mice than in age and sex-matched wild-type controls. Second, to find out whether exercise-related stimuli affect Lats1, we stimulated C2C12 myotubes with the hypertrophy agent clenbuterol or the energy stress agent AICAR. We found that both stimulated Lats1 expression by 1.2 and 1.3 fold respectively. Third, we re-analyzed published datasets and found that Lats1 mRNA in muscle is 63% higher in muscular dystrophy, increases by 17-77% after cardiotoxin-induced muscle injury, by 41-71% in muscles during overload-induced hypertrophy, and by 19-21% after endurance exercise when compared to respective controls. To conclude, Lats1 contributes to the regulation of muscle fiber type proportions, and its expression is regulated by physiological and pathological situations in skeletal muscle.

AB  - The interplay of type-2 inflammation and antiviral immunity underpins asthma exacerbation pathogenesis. Virus infection induces type-2 inflammation-promoting chemokines CCL17 and CCL22 in asthma; however, mechanisms regulating induction are poorly understood. By using a human rhinovirus (RV) challenge model in human airway epithelial cells in vitro and mice in vivo, we assessed mechanisms regulating CCL17 and CCL22 expression. Subjects with mild to moderate asthma and healthy volunteers were experimentally infected with RV and airway CCL17 and CCL22 protein quantified. In vitro airway epithelial cell- and mouse-RV infection models were then used to define STAT6- and NF-kBmediated regulation of CCL17 and CCL22 expression. Following RV infection, CCL17 and CCL22 expression was higher in asthma, which differentially correlated with clinical and immunological parameters. Air-liquid interface-differentiated primary epithelial cells from donors with asthma also expressed higher levels of RV-induced CCL22. RV infection boosted type-2 cytokine-induced STAT6 activation. In epithelial cells, type-2 cytokines and STAT6 activation had differential effects on chemokine expression, increasing CCL17 and suppressing CCL22, whereas NF-kappa B promoted expression of both chemokines. In mice, RV infection activated pulmonary STAT6, which was required for CCL17 but not CCL22 expression. STAT6-knockout mice infected with RV expressed increased levels of NF-kappa B-regulated chemokines, which was associated with rapid viral clearance. Therefore, RV-induced upregulation of CCL17 and CCL22 was mediated by NF-kappa B activation, whereas expression was differentially regulated by STAT6. Together, these findings suggest that therapeutic targeting of type-2 STAT6 activation alone will not block all inflammatory pathways during RV infection in asthma.

AB  - Growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43), a key regulator of synaptic plasticity, neuronal growth, and memory, has recently been identified as a crucial biomarker for synaptic dysfunction in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. This study aimed to explore the mechanisms underlying GAP-43's role in cognitive impairment by examining the relationship between CSF GAP-43 levels and amyloid-beta (A beta) accumulation in brain regions like the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes. This study included 332 participants sourced from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), categorized into three groups: 93 cognitively normal (CN), 218 with MCI, and 21 with AD dementia. Cognitive status was assessed with ADAS-Cog 13, CSF GAP-43 levels via ELISA, and A beta accumulation using florbetapir PET imaging and Syngo.PET for SUVr values in key brain regions. The results revealed that CSF GAP-43 levels were highest in the AD dementia group, followed by the MCI group, and lowest in the CN group, with a significant difference (p < 0.001), indicating a link between elevated CSF GAP-43 and cognitive impairment. In MCI group, CSF GAP-43 positively correlated with A beta accumulation in all regions: Globally (beta = 0.362, p < 0.001), frontal (beta = 0.388, p < 0.001), temporal (beta = 0.382, p < 0.001), and parietal lobes (beta = 0.344, p < 0.001). In contrast, the AD dementia group exhibited negative correlations between CSF GAP-43 levels and A beta accumulation, significantly in the frontal (beta = - 0.513, p = 0.035) and parietal lobes (beta = - 0.513, p = 0.035), suggesting a shift in the CSF GAP-43-A beta relationship in AD dementia. Mediation analysis, adjusted for age, gender, education, and ApoE epsilon 4 status, revealed that elevated CSF GAP-43 is linked to increased cognitive impairment via increasing A beta accumulation solely in MCI, with significant effects in global (beta = 0.0894, CI: [0.0427, 0.1457]), frontal (beta = 0.0895, CI: [0.0422, 0.1443]), temporal (beta = 0.0941, CI: [0.0466, 0.1522]), and parietal (beta = 0.0499, CI: [0.0100, 0.0945]) regions. Thus, elevated CSF GAP-43 may contribute to cognitive impairment by promoting A beta accumulation in individuals with MCI, while in AD dementia, it may be associated with reduced A beta accumulation, potentially reflecting a compensatory or disease-stage-dependent effect. This dynamic relationship suggests that GAP-43 could play a dual role in neurodegeneration, influencing A beta pathology differently across disease stages.

AB  - The effects of general anesthetics on the developing brain have aroused much attention in recent years. Sevoflurane, a commonly used inhalation anesthetic especially in pediatric anesthesia, can induce developmental neurotoxicity. In this study, the differentially expressed mRNAs in the hippocampus of newborn rats exposed to 3% sevoflurane for 6 h were detected by RNA-Sequencing. Those data indicated that the mRNA of Klotho was increased after exposure to sevoflurane. Moreover, the protein expression of Klotho was assayed by Western Blot. Besides over-expression and under-expression of Klotho protein, we also detected changes of cell proliferation, ROS, JC-1, and Bcl-2/Bax ratio in PC12 cells exposed to sevoflurane. After exposure to 3% sevoflurane, the expression of Klotho protein increased in the hippocampus of neonatal rats. In PC12 cells, exposure to sevoflurane could increase cellular ROS level, reduce mitochondrial membrane potential and Bcl-2/Bax ratio. While overexpression of Klotho alleviated the above changes, knockdown of Klotho aggravated the injury of sevoflurane. Klotho protein could reduce oxidative stress and mitochondrial injury induced by sevoflurane in the neuron.

AB  - Paradoxical sleep deprivation (PSD) is prevalent in modern society, and impaired memory is one of its serious consequences. The pathogenic mechanism is still unclear, and the therapeutic strategies for PSD are limited. Here, we found that quercetin treatment ameliorated memory impairments caused by PSD in a dose-dependent manner in an animal model. Quercetin could restore the dynamic changes of the gamma band while the animals performed novel object recognition (NOR) tasks as determined by electroencephalogram analysis. Morphological analysis showed that quercetin, by targeting the hippo-campal CA1 region, strikingly ameliorated the overactivation of microglia induced by PSD. Mechanisti-cally, quercetin inhibited the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), and nuclear factor kappa-b (NF -KB) cascade, which is critical for abnormal microglial activation following PSD stress. Our results provided experimental evidence for the therapeutic effects of quercetin on PSD-related memory impairments by suppressing TLR4/MyD88/NF-KB signaling that mediated abnormal microglia activation in the hippocampus.

AB  - This study explores the influence of calcination temperature on the structural, morphological, and antibacterial properties of copper oxide nanoparticles (CuO NPs) synthesized using Camellia sinensis extract. XRD confirmed the monoclinic crystal structure of the CuO NPs, while UV-Vis and FTIR analyses verified the successful formation of nanoparticles and the presence of phytochemicals from the extract. Among the samples, CuO NPs calcined at 300 degrees C (CT2) exhibited superior antibacterial activity, with the highest inhibition zone of 29 mm recorded against Escherichia coli. Enhanced performance was also observed against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. This improved efficacy is attributed to preserving key functional groups, such as C--C bonds, at moderate calcination temperatures, along with favourable surface morphology and increased pore size, as confirmed by FE-SEM and BET analyses. In contrast, higher calcination temperatures led to diminished antibacterial performance, likely due to the loss of surface-active functional groups and reduced porosity. Overall, the findings emphasize the critical role of temperature control in optimizing the antibacterial potential of green-synthesized CuO NPs.

AB  - Diabetes is associated with higher prevalence of cognitive dysfunction, while the underlying mechanism is still elusive. In this study, we aim to explore the potential mechanism of diabetes-induced cognitive dysfunction and assess the therapeutic effects of Gastrodin on cognitive dysfunction. Diabetes was induced by a single injection of streptozotocin. The Morris Water Maze Test was employed to assess the functions of spatial learning and memory. Transcriptome was used to identify the potential factors involved. Western blot and immunofluorescence were applied to detect the protein expression. Our results have shown that spatial learning was impaired in diabetic rats, coupled with damaged hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Gastrodin intervention ameliorated the spatial learning impairments and neuronal damages. Transcriptomics analysis identified differential expression genes critical for diabetes-induced hippocampal damage and Gastrodin treatment, which were further confirmed by qPCR and western blot. Moreover, p21 activated kinase 2 (PAK2) was found to be important for diabetes-induced hippocampal injury and its inhibitor could promote the survival of primary hippocampal neurons. It suggested that PAK2 pathway may be involved in cognitive dysfunction in diabetes and could be a therapeutic target for Gastrodin intervention.

AB  - In Alzheimer's disease (AD), platelets become dysfunctional and might contribute to amyloid beta deposition. Here, we depleted platelets in one-year-old APP Swedish PS1 dE9 (APP-PS1) transgenic mice for five days, using intraperitoneal injections of an anti-CD42b antibody, and assessed changes in cerebral amyloidosis, plaqueassociated neuritic dystrophy and gliosis. In APP-PS1 female mice, platelet depletion shifted amyloid plaque size distribution towards bigger plaques and increased neuritic dystrophy in the hippocampus. In plateletdepleted females, plaque-associated Iba1+ microglia had lower amounts of fibrillar amyloid beta cargo and GFAP+ astrocytic processes showed a higher overlap with thioflavin S+ amyloid plaques. In contrast to the popular hypothesis that platelets foster plaque pathology, our data suggest that platelets might limit plaque growth and attenuate plaque-related neuritic dystrophy at advanced stages of amyloid plaque pathology in APP-PS1 female mice. Whether the changes in amyloid plaque pathology are due to a direct effect on amyloid beta deposition or are a consequence of altered glial function needs to be further elucidated.

AB  - To deeply explore the intervention effects of ischelium on the cognitive memory decline in naturally aging mice and its potential mechanisms, we randomly divided mice into four groups: young control group (C), elderly group (M), ischelium low-dose group (L), and ischelium high-dose group (H). The experiment lasted for 12 weeks. We employed the Y-maze test, open field test, and conditioned fear test to evaluate the memory functions of each group. Through HE staining and electron microscopy, we observed morphological changes in the mouse hippocampus. RT-PCR was used to detect changes in the expression of factors related to cognitive function in the hippocampus of elderly mice. We analyzed the changes in the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway and the inflammatory factors IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha using elisa. Additionally, we examined the enzymatic activities of SOD, CAT, GSH-Px, and MDA in the hippocampus and analyzed the compositional changes of gut microbiota in mice using 16S technology. Our results indicate that ischelium effectively ameliorates cognitive impairments in elderly mice.

AB  - Hyperglycemia, which occurs under the diabetic conditions, induces serious diabetic complications. Diabetic encephalopathy has been defined as one of the major complications of diabetes, and is characterized by neurochemical and neurodegenerative changes. However, little is known about the effect of long-term exposure to high glucose on neuronal cells. In the present study, we showed that exposure to glutamate (100 mM) for 7 days induced toxicity in primary cortical neurons using the MTT assay. Additionally, high glucose increased the sensitivity of AMPA-or NMDA-induced neurotoxicity, and decreased extracellular glutamate levels in primary cortical neurons. In Western blot analyses, the protein levels of the GluA1 and GluA2 subunits of the AMPA receptor as well as synaptophysin in neurons treated with high glucose were significantly increased compared with the control (25 mM glucose). Therefore, long-term exposure to high glucose induced neuronal death through the disruption of glutamate homeostasis. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) on the amount of p53 in neurons of the pyramidal layer of the hippocampus after modeling septoplasty in rats. Materials and methods. Septoplasty was modeled in 48 Wistar rats. PBMT was administered to 24 rats in the early postoperative period for 2 to 6 days. Histological sections of the hippocampus were studied to determine p53-positive neurons on days 2, 4, and 6 after surgery in rats of both groups. Results. Compared with the control group (n = 5 rats), in both experimental groups there was an increase in the number of p53-positive neurons in the hippocampus, however, in the group where PBMT was performed in the early postoperative period after modeling septoplasty, the number of such neurons was lower, and in some subfields of the hippocampus on day 6 it even corresponded to the control group. Conclusions. The use of PBMT in the early postoperative period after modeling septoplasty helps to reduce stress-induced expression of the p53 protein in the pyramidal layer of the hippocampus in rats.

AB  - Background: Surgical implantation of decellularized cadaveric arteries is routinely used to treat right-sided congenital cardiac lesions. These acellular conduits lack the capacity for somatic growth and are prone to stenosis and calcification, necessitating multiple operations throughout childhood. Islet-1+ cardiovascular progenitor cells (CPCs) have demonstrated the capacity for differentiation into all cell types of the heart and outflow tracts. We hypothesize that CPC seeding of decellularized pulmonary arteries and bioreactor culture under physiologic flow conditions will drive vascular differentiation of CPCs and result in a conduit more suitable for implantation and long-term growth.Materials and Methods: We began by decellularizing ovine pulmonary arteries and characterizing the composition of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Hemodynamic testing of decellularized vessels in a custom bioreactor was used to define the scaffold mechanical properties over a range of pressures and flow rates. Next, our expanded ovine CPCs were suspended in growth media and injected intramurally into decellularized pulmonary arteries that were subsequently cultured in either static or pulsatile cultures. A combination of immunohistochemistry, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and tissue bath contraction studies were used to evaluate the bioengineered arteries before transplantation. Pulmonary artery patches from the most favorable culture conditions were then implanted into juvenile sheep to provide proof of concept.Results: Hematoxylin and eosin staining indicated complete removal of cell nuclei (n = 9), whereas double-stranded DNA isolation from tissue homogenates showed 99.1% DNA removal (p < 0.01, n = 4). Furthermore, trichrome and elastin staining verified maintenance of collagen and elastin. Immunohistochemistry and PCR analyses (n = 4 per group) confirmed contractile smooth muscle presence on only our 3-week pulsatile scaffolds via presence of calponin 1 and myosin heavy chain 11. Tissue bath studies demonstrated that smooth muscle contraction generated by our 3-week pulsatile scaffolds (2.23 +/- 0.19 g, n = 4) is comparable with native tissue contraction strength (2.78 +/- 0.06 g, n = 4). Ovine transplantation confirmed that our graft can be safely implanted, retains contractile smooth muscle cells, and recruits native endothelium.Conclusions: Longer duration of physiologic pulsatile culture drives differentiation of CPCs seeded on ECM conduits toward a mature, contractile phenotype that is maintained for several weeks in vivo. Longer term studies to assess somatic growth potential are needed.
   Impact statementThe current field of vascular transplantation relies on cadaveric and synthetic grafts to treat right-sided congenital cardiac lesions. These grafts do not grow somatically with our patients. This results in multiple reoperations throughout childhood to increase the size of the graft. Our bioengineered alternative demonstrates successful implantation, contractile smooth muscle cells, and a native endothelial layer. This research demonstrates a pilot study confirming the viability of a bioengineered alternative to the current standard of care in the field of vascular transplantation.

AB  - Effective preventive measures against postoperative cognitive dysfunction in older adults are urgently needed. In this study, we investigated the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) on anesthesia and surgery-induced cognitive decline in aged rats by RNA-seq analysis, behavioral testing, Golgi-Cox staining, dendritic spine analysis, immunofluorescence assay and western blot analysis. EA ameliorated anesthesia and surgery induced-cognitive decline. RNA-seq analysis identified numerous differentially-expressed genes, including 353 upregulated genes and 563 downregulated genes, after pretreatment with EA in aged rats with postoperative cognitive dysfunction. To examine the role of CREB in EA, we injected adeno-associated virus (AAV) into the CA1 region of the hippocampus bilaterally into the aged rats to downregulate the transcription factor. EA improved synaptic plasticity, structurally and functionally, by activating the MAPK/ERK/CREB signaling pathway in aged rats. Together, our findings suggest that EA protects against anesthesia and surgery-induced cognitive decline in aged rats by activating the MAPK/ERK/CREB signaling pathway and enhancing hippocampal synaptic plasticity.

AB  - Clay mixtures have been added with a palygorskite containing clay at 0 wt% to 50 wt% for brick button firing. Through an effective integration of in-situ temperature controllable XRD, thermogravimetric and dilatometric analyses, the real-time thermal behaviours of clay mixtures were studied. Also, the physical, mechanical and thermal performance of obtained fired brick buttons were investigated. The addition of palygorskite containing clay has increased the content of amorphous phases in fired brick buttons, while quartz, cristobalite, mullite and hematite were suppressed. Cordierite, spinel and magnetite are new minerals developed in obtained brick buttons. From 25 to 1150 degrees C, the brick green bodies underwent five mass loss steps and six dilatometric/contractions. The fibrous morphology of palygorskite no longer existed after 1150 degrees C firing. Instead, larger-sized acicular cordierite particles are developed. Adding palygorskite has resulted in lower porosity, higher drying shrinkage, firing shrinkage and compressive strength in fired buttons due to reinforced liquid-phase sintering. The effect of palygorskite on vitrification tended to be non-linear and non-uniform. In addition, the colours of brick buttons changed from "light camel" to "black olive" with palygorskite content. Since cracks were developed on the brick buttons added with 40 wt% and 50 wt% palygorskite containing clay, the optimum addition dosage was set at 30 wt%. The obtained compressive strength and thermal diffusivity (25 degrees C) at this addition amount are 153.8 MPa (24.5% higher than the control sample) and 0.788 mm2/s, respectively.

AB  - Chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) significantly impacts cancer survivors. Due to unclear mechanisms, effective treatments for cognitive deficits are lacking. Here, we examined if microglia-mediated deficits in synaptic plasticity drive CRCI. Adult male mice were treated with the chemotherapeutic drugs 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin (5-Fu/LV, intraperitoneal injection, I.P.) on Days 1, 8, and 15 at a dosage of 50 mg/kg for 5-Fu and 90 mg/kg for LV for 3 weeks. Cognitive function was assessed using a novel object recognition (NOR) test 4 weeks after completion of 5-Fu/LV treatment. Compared with vehicle treatment, 5-Fu/LV treatment reduced the preference for exploring novel objects in the NOR test. Treatment with 5-Fu/LV increased the numbers of Iba1-positive microglial and CD68-positive/Iba1-positive microglia with shortened process lengths and diminished endpoints but decreased the number of phagocytotic (<= 1 FITC-labeled beads) Iba1-positive microglia. Furthermore, 5-Fu/LV treatment reduced the long-term potentiation (LTP) recorded in the hippocampal CA1 region in response to a theta burst stimulation of the CA3-CA1 pathway and decreased the evoked N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR)-excitatory postsynaptic currents (NMDAR-EPSCs) in CA1 neurons. Cotreatment with the microglial inhibitor minocycline (33 mg/kg, daily for 3 weeks) restored cognitive deficits and microglial ramification, decreased the number of CD68-positive microglia, and reversed the reductions in LTP and the amplitude of NMDAR-EPSCs in 5-Fu/LV-treated mice. Our data suggest that microglial dysfunction and related synaptic dysfunction contribute to 5-Fu/LV-induced cognitive impairment. image

AB  - Assisted reproduction is essential for the conservation of wildlife species. While obtaining oocytes from living individuals can be challenging, the retrieval of post-mortem ovaries provides a valuable alternative for developing reproductive protocols that could enhance preservation efforts. In this study, we aimed, to evaluate the impact of follicular fluid (FF) supplementation during in vitro maturation (IVM) on nuclear maturation and cumulus expansion of common hippo (Hippopotamus amphibius) oocytes. Ovaries were recovered during the postmortem examination of a 33-year-old female hippo, and 44 oocytes were collected and randomly allocated into three groups for IVM. A control group matured in standard media, a Small-FF group with control standard supplemented with 10 % follicular fluid from small follicles, and a Large-FF group with standard media supplemented with 10 % follicular fluid from large follicles. Images were taken at 0, 16, and 24 h of IVM to evaluate cumulus expansion by measuring the diameter of each cumulus-oocyte complex (COC). Following 24 h of IVM, polar body (PB) extrusion was assessed. Results showed a significant increase in cumulus expansion in the FFsupplemented groups compared to the Control (16 h: Control: 13 f 4 %, Small-FF: 43 f 13 %, Large-FF: 44 f 6 %; 24 h: Control: 27 f 7 %, Small-FF: 71 f 15 %, Large-FF: 66 f 9 %). The Small-FF group (46.1 %) and Control group (40 %) exhibited similar percentages of PB extrusion, while PB could be observed in 6.3 % of the Large-FF group.

AB  - Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) has functions in neuroinflammation, beyond its classical role in neurotransmission. Understanding the role of AChE in neuroinflammation is of great significance, as it highlights the potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. In an in vitro study, the expression of AChE was up-regulated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced microglia/macrophage and contrarily potentiated the inflammatory responses via disturbing the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP). However, the regulation of AChE in neuroinflammation has not been revealed in vivo yet. Here, we aim to uncover the inflammatory roles of microglial AChE in LPS-induced neuroinflammation by using the conditional AChE over-expression mouse model. AChE was specifically over-expressed in the myeloid cell linkage of mouse by applying CRISPR/cas9 combined with Cre-LoxP system. LPS was intraperitoneally injected into the mice to induce inflammation. The results showed that the inflammation, induced by LPS, was aggravated in the brain of transgenic mice having over-expression of AChE in microglia. The expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines were robustly up-regulated in the brains of LPS-treated transgenic mice, as compared to the LPS-treated wildtypes. In parallel, the activations of microglia and astrocytes in hippocampus were enhanced significantly in AChE transgenic mice. Transcriptomics analysis further confirmed the severer inflammation in the transgenic mice than the wildtype after LPS administration. These findings shed light on the regulation of microglial AChE in neuroinflammation in vivo for the first time, presenting another angle to understand the role of AChE in neurodegenerative diseases.image

AB  - Background: The environmental oxygen tension has been reported to impact the blastocyst quality and cell numbers in the inner cell mass (ICM) during human and murine embryogenesis. While the molecular mechanisms leading to increased ICM cell numbers and pluripotency gene expression under hypoxia have been deciphered, it remains unknown which regulatory pathways caused the underweight fetal body and overweight placenta after maternal exposure to hyperbaric oxygen (HBO).Results: The blastocysts from the HBO-exposed pregnant mice revealed significantly increased signals of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nuclear Nrf2 staining, decreased Nf2 and Oct4 expression, increased nuclear Tp53bp1 and active caspase-3 staining, and ectopic nuclear signals of Cdx2, Yap, and the Notch1 intracellular domain (N1ICD) in the ICM. In the ICM of the HBO-exposed blastocysts, both Nf2 cDNA microinjection and Nrf2 shRNA microinjection significantly decreased the ectopic nuclear expression of Cdx2, Tp53bp1, and Yap whereas increased Oct4 expression, while Nrf2 shRNA microinjection also significantly decreased Notch1 mRNA levels and nuclear expression of N1ICD and active caspase-3.Conclusion: We show for the first time that maternal exposure to HBO at the preimplantation stage induces apoptosis and impairs ICM cell specification via upregulating Nrf2-Notch1-Cdx2 expression and downregulating Nf2-Oct4 expression.

AB  - Calligonum polygonoides L. is a desertic plant used for the therapeutics of several metabolic disorders and ethnomedicines. Current study was assigned to examine the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibition targeted hypocholesterolemic potential of Calligonum polygonoides L. through in silico, in vitro and in vivo assessments. The LC-MS/MS screening of the aqueous shoot extract showed leading compounds and structural data retrieved from an authentic repository of PubChem. The interactions of HMG-CoA reductase (HMGR) and ligands complex were examined using molecular docking. Significant interaction was shown by dihydrocelastrol with the target enzyme (HMGCR) up to a binding energy of-8.9 Kcal/mol. The assessments of Root Mean Square Deviation, Root Mean Square Fluctuation, radius of gyration, and Solvent Accessible Surface Area along with Molecular Mechanics-Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area and PCA were examined by GROMACS 2020.2 of best-docked complexes at 100 ns with standards. Consequently, the competent HMGCR inhibition performed by the test extracts up to 75.8% (IC50 = 219.5 mu M) through in vitro assessments. Encouragingly, the treatment of test extract showed significant reductions in lipid profile, dyslipidemia indices, and glucose level along with ameliorations in oxidative stress. Subsequently, significant restorations were revealed in the arterial wall of the coronary arteries. Based on the results, it can be concluded that dihydrocelastrol is a potent bioactive phytocompound that can inhibit the HMGCR and significantly reduce hypercholesterolemia.

AB  - Depression, a multifactorial mental disorder, characterized by cognitive slowing, anxiety, and impaired cognitive function, imposes a significant burden on public health. Photobiomodulation (PBM), involving exposure to sunlight or artificial light at a specific intensity and wavelength for a determined duration, influences brain activity, functional connectivity, and plasticity. It is recognized for its therapeutic efficacy in treating depression, yet its molecular and cellular underpinnings remain obscure. Here, we investigated the impact of PBM with 468 nm light on depression-like behavior and neuronal damage in the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) murine model, a commonly employed animal model for studying depression. Our results demonstrate that PBM treatment ameliorated behavioral deficits, inhibited neuroinflammation and apoptosis, and notably rejuvenates the hippocampal synaptic function in depressed mice, which may be mainly attributed to the up-regulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling pathways. In addition, in vitro experiments with a corticosterone-induced hippocampal neuron injury model demonstrate reduced oxidative stress and improved mitochondrial function, further validating the therapeutic potential of PBM. In summary, these findings suggest PBM as a promising, non-invasive treatment for depression, offering insights into its biological mechanisms and potential for clinical application.

AB  - BackgroundSyngnathids are a highly derived and diverse fish clade comprising the pipefishes, pipe-horses, and seahorses. They are characterized by a plethora of iconic traits that increasingly capture the attention of biologists, including geneticists, ecologists, and developmental biologists. The current understanding of the origins of their derived body plan is, however, hampered by incomplete and limited descriptions of the early syngnathid ontogeny. ResultsWe provide a comprehensive description of the development of Nerophis ophidion, Syngnathus typhle, and Hippocampus erectus from early cleavage stages to release from the male brooding organ and beyond, including juvenile development. We comparatively describe skeletogenesis with a particular focus on dermal bony plates, the snout-like jaw morphology, and appendages. ConclusionsThis most comprehensive and detailed account of syngnathid development to date suggests that convergent phenotypes (e.g., reduction and loss of the caudal fins), likely arose by distinct ontogenetic means in pipefishes and seahorses. Comparison of the ontogenetic trajectories of S. typhle and H. erectus provides indications that characteristic features of the seahorse body plan result from developmental truncation. Altogether, this work provides a valuable resource and framework for future research to understand the evolution of the outlandish syngnathid morphology from a developmental perspective.

AB  - Prolactin (PRL) assumes a pivotal role during the postpartum phase, particularly within the hippocampus-a region densely populated with receptors for stress hormones, where stress significantly inhibits adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN). The reduction in neurogenesis is implicated in the pathogenesis of anxiety and depression. Mothers are at an increased risk of developing depression when exposed to chronic stress. Therefore, it is imperative to investigate the potential role of PRL in depression-like behaviors stemming from prolonged postpartum stress, and to explore any underlying mechanisms. Despite pup separation (PS) being a natural postpartum care practice, the impact of various PS methods on lactating dams remains uncertain. Lactating C57BL/6J mice, from postpartum day (PPD) 1 to PPD 21, underwent no PS (NPS), brief PS (15 min per day, PS15), or long PS (180 min per day, PS180), followed by 21 days of chronic restraint stress (CRS). Behavioral tests were conducted, and measurements included serum PRL concentration, PRL-R expression, and AHN in the hippocampus. Dams with CRS exhibited cognitive decline, depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors, and reduced PRL secretion, correlating with lower levels of AHN. PS15 dams displayed lower levels of depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors and cognitive decline compared to NPS and PS180 dams. Significantly, PS15 dams exhibited higher levels of AHN, PRL-R expression in the hippocampus, and serum PRL concentration. This study collectively reveals reduced serum PRL and AHN in dams with cognitive decline and depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors after CRS. Brief PS confers resistance to behavioral deficits after CRS, increasing serum PRL concentration and reversing AHN decrease in dams.

AB  - Neuronal hippocampal Ca2+ dysregulation is a critical component of cognitive decline in brain aging and Alzheimer's disease and is suggested to impact communication and excitability through the activation of a larger after hyperpolarization. However, few studies have tested for the presence of Ca2+ dysregulation in vivo, how it manifests, and whether it impacts network function across hundreds of neurons. Here, we tested for neuronal Ca2+ network dysregulation in vivo in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) of anesthetized young and aged male Fisher 344 rats using single-cell resolution techniques. Because S1 is involved in sensory discrimination and proprioception, we tested for alterations in ambulatory performance in the aged animal and investigated two potential pathways underlying these central aging- and Ca2+-dependent changes. Compared to young, aged animals displayed increased overall activity and connectivity of the network as well as decreased ambulatory speed. In aged animals, intranasal insulin (INI) increased network synchronicity and ambulatory speed. Importantly, in young animals, delivery of the L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channel modifier Bay-K 8644 altered network properties, replicating some of the changes seen in the older animal. These results suggest that hippocampal Ca2+ dysregulation may be generalizable to other areas, such as S1, and might engage modalities that are associated with locomotor stability and motivation to ambulate. Further, given the safety profile of INI in the clinic and the evidence presented here showing that this central dysregulation is sensitive to insulin, we suggest that these processes can be targeted to potentially increase motivation and coordination while also reducing fall frequency with age.

AB  - Cognitive impairment is common in people diagnosed with breast cancer, but the molecular mechanisms that underlie maladaptive changes in the brain are unknown. The psychological stress of a cancer diagnosis is certainly a contributing factor. Here, we investigated alterations in the hippocampal proteome in response to both cancer and psychological stress using label-free quantitative mass spectrometry techniques. An orthotopic syngeneic model of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) was established by injecting Py230 cells into the mammary fat pads of female C57Bl/6 mice. Half of the mice were subjected to a daily restraint stress paradigm. Mice that experienced both cancer and restraint stress lost weight and displayed larger tumours compared to non-stressed mice. Their urinary corticosterone levels were also elevated, as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Non-stressed tumour-bearing mice displayed higher levels of TNF alpha in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) compared to stressed mice with cancer. Flow cytometry results suggested that the CD4(+)/CD8(+) T cell ratios were also raised in non-stressed tumour-bearing mice compared to both controls and stressed mice with TNBC. Bioinformatic analysis of hippocampal proteomes indicated that cancer alone causes reduced mitochondrial respiration and ATP synthesis, as well as impaired glutamate recycling and synaptic plasticity. Moreover, daily stress in TNBC mice caused further mitochondrial dysfunction, increased oxidative phosphorylation, and altered lipid metabolism. Importantly, over half of the mammary tumours that initially developed spontaneously regressed after 7-9 weeks in these young immunocompetent mice. Tumour regression inhibited TNF alpha increases in the PFC. However, the hippocampal proteomes of tumour-bearing mice were largely similar to mice in which tumours regressed, suggesting that spontaneous regression of breast cancer confers lasting physiological dysregulations that impact hippocampal protein expression. This study in mice may help to identify molecular mechanisms responsible for long-term memory impairments in cancer survivors and reveal novel drug targets for cancer-related cognitive impairment.image

AB  - Background: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a significant public health concern globally. Evidence suggests that Salt-inducible kinase 2 (SIK2) is differentially expressed across various cancers and is also implicated in cancer progression. Despite this, the precise function of SIK2 in NSCLC is yet to be elucidated and requires further investigation. Methods: SIK2 expression was evaluated in both HBEC and NSCLC cells, utilizing quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blot (WB) analyses. Furthermore, to identify the influence of SIK2 on cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis, a range of techniques were employed. To evaluate N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification levels of total RNA and SIK2 within cells, RNA m6A colorimetry and methylated RNA immunoprecipitation (MeRIP) techniques were employed. Additionally, to confirm the interaction between SIK2 and insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1), bioinformatics analysis was executed, and the results were validated through RIP. The stability of SIK2 mRNA was determined using actinomycin D experiment. Furthermore, to validate the in vivo functionality of SIK2, a subcutaneous transplantation tumor model was established in nude mice. Results: In this study, upregulation of SIK2 in NSCLC cells was observed. Overexpression of SIK2 was found to lead to promotion of cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and suppression of the Hippo/yes-associated protein (YAP) pathway, while inhibiting apoptosis. RIP analysis showed that IGF2BP1 protein interacted with SIK2 mRNA. Knockdown of IGF2BP1 decreased mRNA stability and m6A modification levels of SIK2. Additionally, knockdown of IGF2BP1 resulted in inhibition of cell proliferation, migration, invasion, suppression of the Hippo/ YAP pathway, and promoting apoptosis. Overexpression of SIK2 overturned the impact of IGF2BP1 on NSCLC cells, which was then confirmed through in vivo experiments. Conclusion: IGF2BP1 stabilized SIK2 mRNA through m6A modification to promote NSCLC progression, potentially offering new diagnostic and therapeutic insights for NSCLC.

AB  - Ageing is a significant risk factor for degeneration of the retina. Muller glia cells (MG) are key for neuronal regeneration, so harnessing the regenerative capacity of MG in the retina offers great promise for the treatment of age-associated blinding conditions. Yet, the impact of ageing on MG regenerative capacity is unclear. Here, we show that the zebrafish retina undergoes telomerase-independent, age-related neurodegeneration but that this is insufficient to stimulate MG proliferation and regeneration. Instead, age-related neurodegeneration is accompanied by MG morphological aberrations and loss of vision. Mechanistically, yes-associated protein (Yap), part of the Hippo signalling, has been shown to be critical for the regenerative response in the damaged retina, and we show that Yap expression levels decline with ageing. Despite this, morphologically and molecularly altered aged MG retain the capacity to regenerate neurons after acute light damage, therefore, highlighting key differences in the MG response to high-intensity acute damage versus chronic neuronal loss in the zebrafish retina.

AB  - Binge alcohol use is increasing among aged adults (>65 yr). Alcohol-related toxicity in aged adults is associated with neurodegeneration; yet, the molecular underpinnings of this age-related sensitivity to alcohol are not well described. Studies utilizing rodent models of neurodegenerative disease reveal heightened activation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappa B) and Nod-like receptor 3 (NLRP3) mediate microglia activation and associated neuronal injury. Our group, and others, have implicated hippocampal-resident microglia as key producers of inflammatory mediators; yet, the link between inflammation and neurodegeneration has not been established in models of binge ethanol exposure and advanced age. Here, we report binge ethanol increased the proportion of NLRP3(+) microglia in the hippocampus of aged (18 to 20 mo) female C57BL/6N mice compared with young (3 to 4 mo). In primary microglia, ethanol-induced expression of reactivity markers and NLRP3 inflammasome activation were more pronounced in microglia from aged mice compared with young. Using a NLRP3-specific inhibitor (OLT1177) and a novel brain-penetrant Nanoligomer that inhibits NF-kappa B and NLRP3 translation (SB_NI_112), we find ethanol-induced microglial reactivity can be attenuated by OLT1177 and SB_NI_112 in microglia from aged mice. In a model of intermittent binge ethanol exposure, SB_NI_112 prevented ethanol-mediated microglia reactivity, IL-1 beta production, and tau hyperphosphorylation in the hippocampus of aged mice. These data suggest early indicators of neurodegeneration occurring with advanced age and binge ethanol exposure are driven by NF-kappa B and NLRP3. Further investigation is warranted to explore the use of targeted immunosuppression via Nanoligomers to attenuate neuroinflammation after alcohol consumption in the aging populations.

AB  - Recent epidemiological and intervention studies have suggested that polyphenol-rich plant food consumption reduced the risk of cognitive decline. However, the findings were tentative and by no means definitive. In the present study, we examined the impact of short-term oral administration of cinnamtannin A2 (A2), an (-)-epicatechin tetramer, on adult hippocampal neurogenesis and cognitive function in mice. Mice received supplementation with vehicle (20% glycerol) or 100 mg/kg A2 for 10 days. Then, we conducted the open field test, the object location test, and the novel object test. In the open field test, the A2-treated group tended to spend more time in the center of the arena, compared to the vehicle-treated group. The A2-treated group spent significantly more time exploring objects placed in different locations, compared to the vehicle-treated group. There were no significant differences between groups in the object preference index or in the novel object test. In addition, A2 administration significantly increased the number of hippocampal bromodeoxyuridine-labeled cells in the dentate gyrus, but not in the CA1 or CA3 regions. These results suggested that short-term administration of A2 may impact spatial memory by enhancing neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of adult mice. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - O-GlcNAcylation is a dynamic and reversible protein posttranslational modification of serine or threonine residues which modulates the activity of transcriptional and signaling pathways and controls cellular responses to metabolic and inflammatory stressors. We and others have shown that O-GlcNAcylation has the potential to regulate autophagy and mitophagy to play a critical role in mitochondrial quality control, but this has not been assessed in vivo in the brain. This is important since mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to the development of neurodegenerative diseases. We used mito-QC reporter mice to assess mitophagy in diverse cells in the dentate gyrus in response to pharmacological inhibition of O-GlcNAcase (OGA) with thiamet G which leads to elevation of protein O-GlcNAcylation. We demonstrate that mitophagy occurs predominantly in the GFAP-positive astrocytes and is significantly decreased in response to elevated O-GlcNAcylation. Furthermore, with increased O-GlcNAcylation, the levels of astrocyte markers GFAP and S100B, and the microglial cell marker IBA1, decreased in the dentate gyrus, while the levels of microglial cell marker TMEM119 were increased, indicating significant changes in glia homeostasis. These results provide strong evidence of the regulation of mitophagy and glia signatures by the O-GlcNAc pathway.image

AB  - Dental implants are considered a superior option for the replacement of missing teeth. However, the invasive nature of the surgical procedure often results in significant postoperative inflammation, and the prolonged healing period of 3-6 months presents a notable disadvantage. High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is a critical mediator of acute inflammation following surgical injury, which can hinder the onset of osseointegration. This study aims to examine whether the inhibition of HMGB1 can mitigate acute inflammation and subsequently enhance osseointegration. The findings indicate that HMGB1 inhibition markedly reduces inflammation and promotes bone repair in murine models. Further in vitro investigations into the regulatory mechanisms of HMGB1 in macrophages reveal its role in increasing Yes-associated protein (YAP) activity, which contributes to pro-inflammatory polarization. Additionally, conditioned media derived from macrophages influenced by HMGB1 significantly impair the migratory and osteogenic capabilities of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, which are essential for bone regeneration. In vivo experiments further validate that the administration of exogenous HMGB1 exacerbates postoperative acute inflammation and obstructs osseointegration. The study concludes that inhibiting HMGB1 fosters an anti-inflammatory polarization of macrophages, leading to diminished postoperative acute inflammation and expedited osseointegration around dental implants in mice.

AB  - Terpenes, one of the secondary metabolites produced by plants, have diverse physiological functions. They are volatile compounds with physiological bioactivities (e.g., insect repellent, attracting enemies, and interacting with other plants). Terpenoids are also essential for flavor and aroma in plant-derived foods. In coffee, its aroma decides the value of coffee beans. Linalool, one of the volatile terpene compounds, is dominant in the coffee aroma. Coffee, with its good flavor and aroma, has high demand worldwide. Because terpenoids generally accumulate as glycosides in plant cells, glycosylation is catalyzed by UDP-glycosyltransferases (UGTs). Two linalyl-diglycosides have been identified: terpenoids reflected as necessary for coffee flavor. However, these UGTs and their action mechanisms are unknown in the Coffea genus. To obtain knowledge of terpene UGTs and elucidate the mechanism of terpene glycosylation in coffee, this study isolated terpene UGT genes and analyzed their functions. In silico screening based on the sequence of UGT85K11, which catalyzes terpene glycosylation from Camellia sinensis, was performed to obtain sequence information on five candidate UGT genes (CaUGT4, CaUGT5, CaUGT10, CaUGT15, and CaUGT20). These genes were isolated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and the recombinant enzymes were produced with the Escherichia coli expression system. In functional analysis using radioisotopes, CaUGT4 showed critical activity against linalool, which had a higher affinity for its substrate than that of UGT85A84 from Osmanthus fragrans. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry also revealed that CaUGT4 mainly produces linalyl glucoside. In this study, the first linalyl UGT was isolated from coffee. These findings can be used to elucidate the fundamental mechanism of the chemical defense in plants and apply aroma precursors for the plant-derived food industry in the future.

AB  - Epidermal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) develops in response to ultraviolet light exposure and is among the most common cancers. The transglutaminase 2 cancer cell survival protein stimulates the activity of the YAP1/TEAD transcription complex to drive the expression of genes that promote aggressive epidermal SCC cell invasion, migration, and tumor formation. Therefore, we are interested in mechanisms that may inhibit these events. Vestigial-like protein-4 (VGLL4) is a transcription cofactor/tumor suppressor that inhibits several pro-cancer pathways including YAP1 signaling. Our present studies show that VGLL4 inhibits YAP1/TEAD-dependent transcription to reduce the expression of YAP1 target genes (CCND1, CYR61, and CTGF) and pro-cancer collagen genes (COL1A2 and COL3A1). We further show that loss of these YAP1 regulated genes is required for VGLL4 suppression of the cancer cell phenotype, as forced CCND1 or COL1A2 expression partially restores the aggressive cancer phenotype in VGLL4 expressing cells. Consistent with these findings, VGLL4 expression reduces tumor formation, and this is associated with reduced CCND1, CYR61, CTGF, COL1A2, and COL1A3 mRNA and protein levels, and reduced EMT marker expression. These findings indicate that VGLL4 suppresses the malignant epidermal SCC cancer phenotype by inhibiting YAP1/TEAD-dependent pro-cancer signaling.

AB  - Social interaction deficit is core symptom of children with autism, owing to interaction of genetic predisposition and environmental toxins. Sevoflurane could induce neurotoxicity in developing brain in rodent models. This study aims to investigate whether sevoflurane anesthesia in neonatal period could impair social behaviors in male and female mice. Twenty-eight male and thirty-one female mice were randomly assigned to receive 3.0% sevoflurane or 60% oxygen on postnatal day 6. They were tested for social interaction behaviors at one- and two-month-old. In addition, the cortex and hippocampus of neonatal mice undergoing sevoflurane anesthesia were harvested for immunoblotting analysis. As a result, both male and female mice undergoing sevoflurane anesthesia showed strong sociability and weak preference for social novelty at juvenile age. In addition, the male mice developed normal preference for social novelty at early-adulthood; However, the female mice remained weak preference for social novelty. Furthurmore, sevoflurane anesthesia could decrease the levels of PSD95 but not Neuroligin-1 in the hippocampus but not cortex of neonatal mice. In conclusion, sevoflurane anesthesia in neonatal period could disturb development of social memory and impair preference for social novelty in female mice at early-adulthood, with the potential mechanism of decreasing PSD95 expression in the hippocampus of C57BL/6 mice.

AB  - Lithium chloride (LiCl) is an important mood-stabilizing therapeutic agent for bipolar disorders, which has also been shown to inhibit cancer cell metastasis. Investigations of LiCl-induced signaling have focused mainly on extracellular signal regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3). However, little is known about the differences in cellular activities resulting from specific signaling via each of these pathways. In this study, we investigated the difference in responses between the Wnt/I3-catenin and ERK pathways by LiCl or epidermal growth factor (EGF) treatment of osteosar-coma cells. In particular, we analyzed the mechanisms responsible for differences in cell mobility and cell proliferation when pERK or I3-catenin is activated. In osteosarcoma cells treated with LiCl or EGF, active I3-catenin and p-ERK protein levels were significantly increased compared to those in the control group. However, in wound healing and transwell invasion assays, U2OS and SaOS2 cell migration was signifi-cantly reduced by LiCl treatment but increased by EGF treatment. In addition, the proliferation of U2OS cells was reduced by LiCl treatment but increased by EGF treatment. Using immunofluorescence mi-croscopy, we observed nuclear accumulation of phosphorylated ERK (pERK) with EGF treatment, but pERK was restricted to the perinuclear area with LiCl treatment. These results were confirmed using immunoblot assays after subcellular fractionation. Together, these data suggest that LiCl interferes with the translocation of pERK from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. (c) 2021 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are stromal cells of the vascular wall and are continually exposed to mechanical signals. The loss of VSMCs is closely related to the occurrence of many vascular diseases, such as aortic aneurysms and aortic dissection. The proliferation and apoptosis of VSMCs are mechanically stimulated. Yes-associated protein (YAP), one of the core components of the Hippo pathway, plays a key role in the response of VSMCs to mechanical signals. In this study, we tested the impact of different intensities of mechanical stretch on the proliferation and apoptosis of VSMCs, as well as YAP. We tested VSMCs' proliferation and apoptosis and YAP reaction via immunocytochemistry, western blotting, CCK-8 and flow cytometric analysis. We found that 10% elongation could increase the phosphorylation of YAP and prevent it from entering the nucleus, as well as inhibit cell proliferation and promote apoptosis. However, 15% elongation reduced YAP phosphorylation and promoted its nuclear entry, thereby promoting cell proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis. Accordingly, YAP knockdown suppressed the phenotype of VMSCs induced by 15% elongation. Taken together, YAP regulates proliferation and apoptosis of VSMCs differently under different intensity of mechanical stretch. Mechanical stretch with appropriate intensity can promote the proliferation and inhibit apoptosis of VSMCs by activating YAP.

AB  - The current investigation focuses on gross anatomy, light, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of the Testudo graeca oropharyngeal floor, with particular reference to the immunofluorescence technique to examine its tongue. The T. graeca oropharyngeal floor showed many anatomical structures: the lower rhamphotheca, paralingual ridge, lower alveolar ridge, tongue, laryngeal mound, and glottis. The lower rhamphotheca appeared as a V-shaped jaw line with a highly serrated edge and a median tomium (beak). SEM observations of the lingual apex and the lingual body showed rectangular and conical filiform papillae with porous surfaces and taste pores. Meanwhile, the lingual root had two wings that carried papillae with different shapes: dagger-shaped, conical, bifurcated, and leaf-like papillae, and these papillae lacked taste pores. The laryngeal mound had openings for the laryngeal mucus gland and its secretions. Light microscopy findings showed mucous glands in the propria submucosa and near the mucosal surface of the lingual apex. The lingual root had lingual papillae and two hyaline cartilaginous skeletons between skeletal muscles, and the lingual papillae were elongated filiform, rectangular filiform papillae, and fungiform papillae. The lamina propria constituted the core of the lingual papillae and the mucous gland, they had a positive reaction with the periodic acid schiff (PAS) reagent. The apical surface of the fungiform papillae had taste pores. Under immunofluorescence, the vimentin was detected in taste bud cells, and synaptophysin reacted to the taste buds and nerve bundles. The current study of the Greek tortoise oropharyngeal floor investigated its herbivorous eating habits using its serrated lower rhamphotheca, a large tongue with differently shaped papillae, and numerous mucous glands.

AB  - FKBP51, also known as FK506-binding protein 51, is a molecular chaperone and scaffolding protein with significant roles in regulating hormone signaling and responding to stress. Genetic variants in FKBP5, which encodes FKBP51, have been implicated in a growing number of neuropsychiatric disorders, which has spurred efforts to target FKBP51 therapeutically. However, the molecular mechanisms and sub-anatomical regions influenced by FKBP51 in these disorders are not fully understood. In this study, we aimed to examine the impact of Fkbp5 ablation using circadian phenotyping and molecular analyses. Our findings revealed that the lack of FKBP51 did not significantly alter circadian rhythms, as detected by wheel-running activity, but did offer protection against stress-mediated disruptions in rhythmicity in a sex-dependent manner. Protein changes in Fkbp5 KO mice, as measured by histology and proteomics, revealed alterations in a brain region- and sex-dependent manner. Notably, regardless of sex, aged Fkbp5 KOs showed elevated MYCBP2, FBXO45, and SPRYD3 levels, which are associated with neuronal-cell adhesion and synaptic integrity. Additionally, pathways such as serotonin receptor signaling and S100 family signaling were differentially regulated in Fkbp5 KO mice. Weighted protein correlation network analysis identified protein networks linked with synaptic transmission and neuroinflammation. The information generated by this work can be used to better understand the molecular changes in the brain during aging and in the absence of Fkbp5, which has implications for the continued development of FKBP51-focused therapeutics for stress-related disorders.

AB  - Author summaryWhen animals are asleep or restfully awake, populations of neurons in their brains recapitulate activity associated with extended behaviorally-relevant experiences. This process is called replay, and it has been established for a long time in rodents, and very recently in humans, to be important for good performance in decision-making tasks. The specific experiences which are replayed during those epochs follow highly ordered patterns, but the mechanisms which establish their priority are still not fully understood. One promising theoretical suggestion is that each replay experience is chosen in such a way that the learning that ensues is most helpful for the subsequent performance of the animal. A very recent study reported a surprising result that humans who achieved high performance in a planning task tended to replay actions they found to be sub-optimal, and that this was associated with a useful deprecation of those actions in subsequent performance. In this study, we examine the nature of this pessimized form of replay and show that it is exactly appropriate for forgetful agents. We analyse the role of forgetting for replay choices of our model, and verify our predictions using human subject data.
   The replay of task-relevant trajectories is known to contribute to memory consolidation and improved task performance. A wide variety of experimental data show that the content of replayed sequences is highly specific and can be modulated by reward as well as other prominent task variables. However, the rules governing the choice of sequences to be replayed still remain poorly understood. One recent theoretical suggestion is that the prioritization of replay experiences in decision-making problems is based on their effect on the choice of action. We show that this implies that subjects should replay sub-optimal actions that they dysfunctionally choose rather than optimal ones, when, by being forgetful, they experience large amounts of uncertainty in their internal models of the world. We use this to account for recent experimental data demonstrating exactly pessimal replay, fitting model parameters to the individual subjects' choices.

AB  - Despite an increase in the coexistence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and psychological disorders, together with their great impact on socio-economic burdens, no protective strategies that focus on these situations are available. Due to the role of oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and psychological disorders, we hypothesized that substances possessing antioxidant activity such as the novel functional ingredients from Anacardium occidentale (AO) could mitigate common psychological disorders in MetS rats. Male Wistar rats, weighing 200-250 g, were induced with MetS through a 12-week high-fat and high-cholesterol diet (HFHC). Then, they were given AO orally via a gastric gavage needle at doses of 1, 10 and 100 mg/kg BW for 14 days. Spatial memory, anxiety, depression, and sleep behaviors, together with changes in oxidative stress status and neurotransmitters, were assessed. All doses of AO significantly improved memory, anxiety, and sleep, together with the suppression of oxidative stress, AChE, and GABA-T in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. These results suggest the protective effect of AO against anxiety, insomnia, and memory impairment that coexist with the MetS condition via an improvement in oxidative stress and the functions of the cholinergic and GABAergic systems. However, this benefit requires clinical confirmation.

AB  - Ischemic episodes are a leading cause of death worldwide with limited therapeutic interventions. The current study explored mitochondrial phosphate-activated glutaminase (GLS1) activity modulation by PKC beta II through GC-MS untargeted metabolomics approach. Mitochondria were used to elucidate the endogenous resistance of hippocampal CA2-4 and dentate gyrus (DG) to transient ischemia and reperfusion in a model of ischemic episode in gerbils. In the present investigation, male gerbils were subjected to bilateral carotids occlusion for 5 min followed by reperfusion (IR). Gerbils were randomly divided into three groups as vehicle-treated sham control, vehicle-treated IR and PKC beta II specific inhibitor peptide beta IIV5-3-treated IR. Vehicle or beta IIV5-3 (3 mg/kg, i.v.) were administered at the moment of reperfusion. The gerbils hippocampal tissue were isolated at various time of reperfusion and cell lysates or mitochondria were isolated from CA1 and CA2-4,DG hippocampal regions. Recombinant proteins PKC beta II and GLS1 were used in in vitro phosphorylation reaction and organotypic hippocampal cultures (OHC) transiently exposed to NMDA (25 mu M) to evaluate the inhibition of GLS1 on neuronal viability. PKC beta II co-precipitates with GAC (GLS1 isoform) in CA2-4,DG mitochondria and phosphorylates GLS1 in vitro. Cell death was dose dependently increased when GLS1 was inhibited by BPTA while inhibition of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) attenuated cell death in NMDA-challenged OHC. Fumarate and malate were increased after IR 1h in CA2-4,DG and this was reversed by beta IIV5-3 what correlated with GLS1 activity increases and earlier showed elevation of neuronal death (Krupska et al., 2017). The present study illustrates that CA2-4,DG resistance to ischemic episode at least partially rely on glutamine and glutamate utilization in mitochondria as a source of carbon to tricarboxylic acid cycle. This phenomenon depends on modulation of GLS1 activity by PKC beta II and remodeling of MPC: all these do not occur in ischemia-vulnerable CA1.

AB  - Physically active lifestyle has huge implications for the health and well-being of people of all ages. However, excessive training can lead to severe cardiovascular events such as heart fibrosis and arrhythmia. In addition, strenuous exercise may impair brain plasticity. Here we investigate the presence of any deleterious effects induced by chronic high-intensity exercise, although not reaching exhaustion. We analyzed cardiovascular, cognitive, and cerebral molecular changes in young adult male mice submitted to treadmill running for eight weeks at moderate or high-intensity regimens compared to sedentary mice. Exercised mice showed decreased weight gain, which was significant for the high-intensity group. Exercised mice showed cardiac hypertrophy but with no signs of hemodynamic overload. No morphological changes in the descending aorta were observed, either. High-intensity training induced a decrease in heart rate and an increase in motor skills. However, it did not impair recognition or spatial memory, and, accordingly, the expression of hippocampal and cerebral cortical neuroplasticity markers was maintained. Interestingly, proteasome enzymatic activity increased in the cerebral cortex of all trained mice, and catalase expression was significantly increased in the high-intensity group; both first-line mechanisms contribute to maintaining redox homeostasis. Therefore, physical exercise at an intensity that induces adaptive cardiovascular changes parallels increases in antioxidant defenses to prevent brain damage.

AB  - Eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (eIF5A)(dagger,double dagger) is an essential protein that requires a unique amino acid, hypusine, for its activity. Hypusine is formed exclusively in eIF5A post-translationally via two enzymes, deoxyhypusine synthase (DHPS) and deoxyhypusine hydroxylase. Each of the genes encoding these proteins, Eif5a, Dhps, and Dohh, is required for mouse embryonic development. Variants in EIF5A or DHPS were recently identified as the genetic basis underlying certain rare neurodevelopmental disorders in humans. To investigate the roles of eIF5A and DHPS in brain development, we generated four conditional KO mouse strains using the Emx1-Cre or Camk2a-Cre strains and examined the effects of temporal-and region-specific deletion of Eif5a or Dhps. The conditional deletion of Dhps or Eif5a by Emx1 promotor-driven Cre expression (E9.5, in the cortex and hippocampus) led to gross defects in forebrain development, reduced growth, and premature death. On the other hand, the conditional deletion of Dhps or Eif5a by Camk2a promoter-driven Cre expression (postnatal, mainly in the CA1 region of the hippocampus) did not lead to global developmental defects; rather, these KO animals exhibited severe impairment in spatial learning, contextual learning, and memory when subjected to the Morris water maze and a contextual learning test. In both models, the Dhps-KO mice displayed more severe impairment than their Eif5a-KO counterparts. The observed defects in the brain, global development, or cognitive functions most likely result from translation errors due to a deficiency in active, hypusinated eIF5A. Our study underscores the important roles of eIF5A and DHPS in neurodevelopment.

AB  - The diabetic cognitive impairments are associated with high-glucose (HG)-induced mitochondrial dysfunctions in the brain. Our previous studies demonstrated that long non-coding RNA (lncRNA)-MEG3 alleviates diabetic cognitive impairments. However, the underlying mechanism has still remained elusive. Therefore, this study was designed to investigate whether the mitochondrial translocation of HSP90A and its phosphorylation are involved in lncRNA-MEG3-mediated neuroprotective effects of mitochondrial functions in HG-treated primary hippo-campal neurons and diabetic rats. The primary hippocampal neurons were exposed to 75 mM glucose for 72 h to establish a HG model in vitro. Firstly, the RNA pull-down and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays clearly indicated that lncRNA-MEG3-associated mitochondrial proteins were Annexin A2, HSP90A, and Plectin. Although HG promoted the mitochondrial translocation of HSP90A and Annexin A2, lncRNA-MEG3 over -expression only enhanced the mitochondrial translocation of HSP90A, rather than Annexin A2, in the primary hippocampal neurons treated with or without HG. Meanwhile, Plectin mediated the mitochondrial localization of lncRNA-MEG3 and HSP90A. Furthermore, HSP90A threonine phosphorylation participated in regulating mito-chondrial translocation of HSP90A, and lncRNA-MEG3 also enhanced mitochondrial translocation of HSP90A through suppressing HSP90A threonine phosphorylation. Finally, the anti-apoptotic role of mitochondrial translocation of HSP90A was found to be associated with inhibiting death receptor 5 (DR5) in HG-treated pri-mary hippocampal neurons and diabetic rats. Taken together, lncRNA-MEG3 could improve mitochondrial functions in HG-exposed primary hippocampal neurons, and the underlying mechanisms were involved in enhanced mitochondrial translocation of HSP90A via suppressing HSP90A threonine phosphorylation, which may reveal a potential therapeutic target for diabetic cognitive impairments.

AB  - Increasing evidence from animal and epidemiological studies indicates that perinatal exposure to pesticides cause developmental neurotoxicity and may increase the risk for psychiatric disorders such as autism and intellectual disability. However, the underlying pathogenic mechanisms remain largely elusive. This work was aimed at testing the hypothesis that developmental exposure to different classes of pesticides hijacks intracellular neuronal signaling contributing to synaptic and behavioral alterations associated with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD). Low concentrations of organochlorine (dieldrin, endosulfan, and chlordane) and organophosphate (chlorpyrifos and its oxon metabolite) pesticides were chronically dosed ex vivo (organotypic rat hippocampal slices) or in vivo (perinatal exposure in rats), and then biochemical, electrophysiological, behavioral, and proteomic studies were performed. All the pesticides tested caused prolonged activation of MAPK/ERK pathway in a concentration-dependent manner. Additionally, some of them impaired metabotropic glutamate receptor-dependent long-term depression (mGluR-LTD). In the case of the pesticide chlordane, the effect was attributed to chronic modulation of MAPK/ERK signaling. These synaptic alterations were reproduced following developmental in vivo exposure to chlordane and chlorpyrifos-oxon, and were also associated with prototypical behavioral phenotypes of NDD, including impaired motor development, increased anxiety, and social and memory deficits. Lastly, proteomic analysis revealed that these pesticides differentially regulate the expression of proteins in the hippocampus with pivotal roles in brain development and synaptic signaling, some of which are associated with NDD. Based on these results, we propose a novel mechanism of synaptic dysfunction, involving chronic overactivation of MAPK and impaired mGluR-LTD, shared by different pesticides which may have important implications for NDD.

AB  - Neonatal hypoxia-ischemia is a major cause of infant death and disability. The only clinically accepted treatment is therapeutic hypothermia; however, cooling is less effective in the most severely encephalopathic infants. Here, we wanted to test the neuroprotective effect of the antioxidant dimethyl fumarate after severe hypoxia-ischemia in neonatal rats. We used a modified Rice-Vannucci model to generate severe hypoxic-ischemic brain damage in day 7 postnatal rats, which were randomized into four experimental groups: Sham, Sham + DMF, non-treated HI, and HI + DMF. We analyzed brain tissue loss, global and regional (cortex and hippocampus) neuropathological scores, white matter injury, and microglial and astroglial reactivity. Compared to non-treated HI animals, HI + DMF pups showed a reduced brain area loss (p = 0.0031), an improved neuropathological score (p = 0.0016), reduced white matter injuries by preserving myelin tracts (p < 0.001), and diminished astroglial (p < 0.001) and microglial (p < 0.01) activation. After severe hypoxia-ischemia in neonatal rats, DMF induced a strong neuroprotective response, reducing cerebral infarction, gray and white matter damage, and astroglial and microglial activation. Although further molecular studies are needed and its translation to human babies would need to evaluate the molecule in piglets or lambs, DMF may be a potential treatment against neonatal encephalopathy.

AB  - (1) Background: Recently, we found that adenosine A(2A) receptor (A(2A)R) stimulation results in an increase in STEP phosphatase activity. In order to delve into the mechanism through which A(2A)R stimulation induced STEP activation, we investigated the involvement of mGlu5R since it is well documented that A(2A)R and mGlu(5)R physically and functionally interact in several brain areas. (2) Methods: In a neuroblastoma cell line (SH-SY5Y) and in mouse hippocampal slices, we evaluated the enzymatic activity of STEP by using a para-nitrophenyl phosphate colorimetric assay. A co-immunoprecipitation assay and a Western blot analysis were used to evaluate STEP/mGlu(5)R binding. (3) Results: We found that the A(2A)R-dependent activation of STEP was mediated by the mGlu5R. Indeed, the A(2A)R agonist CGS 21680 significantly increased STEP activity, and this effect was prevented not only by the A(2A)R antagonist ZM 241385, as expected, but also by the mGlu(5)R antagonist MPEP. In addition, we found that mGlu(5)R agonist DHPG-induced STEP activation was reversed not only by the mGlu(5)R antagonist MPEP but also by ZM 241385. Finally, via co-immunoprecipitation experiments, we found that mGlu(5)R and STEP physically interact when both receptors are activated (4) Conclusions: These results demonstrated a close functional interaction between mGlu(5) and A(2A) receptors in the modulation of STEP activity.

AB  - Hepatic encephalopathy (HE), an outcome of chronic liver disease is characterized by behavioral impairments. The present study investigated the role of HDAC-mediated transcriptional regulation causing behavioral impairments in the bile duct ligation (BDL) model of HE. Post-BDL surgery in rats, dynamic alterations in liver function tests, liver morphology were observed. In BDL rats, histological staining in brain demonstrated reduced neuronal viability and warped neuronal architecture. Additionally, BDL animals showed impaired spatial learning, memory, and increased anxiety in the open field, Barnes maze, and Y maze tests. Further, the Golgi cox staining revealed a significantly altered spine density and spine clustering patterns of granular neuron in dentate gyrus of BDL rats. Concordantly, a significant downregulation of memory encoding genes was also observed in BDL rats that may account for aberrant behavior. Molecular analysis of modifiers, such as HDAC, showed significant changes in the expression of HDAC3 and HDAC6 in both the cortex and hippocampus of BDL rats. Upregulation of HDAC3 promoted its localization on the promoter of genes like c-Fos, NPAS4, Arc, and others, likely causing their decreased expression. Our findings suggest that increased HDAC3 activity downregulates key synaptic plasticity and memory-related genes, potentially driving neurobehavioral changes in BDL rats.

AB  - Background: Cognitive impairment is a prevalent complication of type 2 diabetes, influenced significantly by various dietary patterns. High-carbohydrate diets (HCDs) are commonly consumed nowadays; however, the specific impact of HCDs on cognitive function in diabetes remains unclear. Methods: The objective of this study was to investigate whether an HCD has effects on cognition in diabetes. Eight-week-old diabetic (db/db) mice and wild-type (WT) mice underwent a twelve-week dietary intervention, including a normal diet (ND), an HCD, or a high-fat diet (HFD). Following this, behavioral tests were conducted, and related hippocampal pathology was evaluated. Results: Our results demonstrated that an HCD exacerbated cognitive decline in db/db mice compared to an ND. Additionally, an HCD increased amyloid-beta burden and expression of beta-site APP cleaving enzyme-1. An HCD was also found to promote the phosphorylation of tau protein via the PI3K/Akt/GSK-3 beta pathway. Furthermore, an HCD markedly induced neuroinflammation and increased the quantity of microglia and astrocytes. However, these damages induced by an HCD were less severe than those caused by an HFD. Conclusions: Collectively, our findings indicate that a high intake of carbohydrates can have an adverse impact on cognitive function in diabetes.

AB  - Objective: The role of propionic acid (PPA) in eliciting behaviors analogous to autism in rat models is a documented phenomenon. This study examines the therapeutic implications of pentoxifylline-an agent traditionally used for peripheral vascular diseases-on these autism-like behaviors by modulating brain proteins and reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines like tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in a rat model. Methods: This research involved 30 male Wistar albino rats, which were divided into three distinct groups: a baseline control set, a PPA-treated cluster receiving a 250 mg/kg/day dose of PPA via intraperitoneal injection for a span of five days followed by saline orally, and a PPA group administered an oral dose of pentoxifylline at 300 mg/kg/day over 15 days. Subsequent to the treatment phase, euthanasia was carried out for the extraction of brain and blood samples, which were then analyzed for histopathological and biochemical markers. Results: The pentoxifylline-treated subjects demonstrated a significant mitigation in the manifestation of autistic-like behaviors, as assessed through a triad of social interaction tests. A noteworthy decline in TNF-alpha levels was observed, alongside a significant rise in the concentration of adenosine triphosphate and nerve growth factor in brain tissue (p < 0.05). Histopathological analysis underscored a reduction in oxidative stress and a significant preservation of neuronal cell types, specifically pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 regions and Purkinje cells in the cerebellum (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Pentoxifylline treatment has been found to effectively reduce the behavioral symptoms associated with autism, as well as biochemical and histopathological disruptions induced by PPA in rat models, highlighting its potential as a neurotherapeutic agent.

AB  - Education, occupation, and an active lifestyle, comprising enhanced social, physical, and mental components are associated with improved cognitive functions in aged people and may delay the progression of various neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease. To investigate this protective effect, 3-month-old APPNL-G-F/NL-G-F mice were exposed to repeated single- or multi-domain cognitive training. Cognitive training was given at the age of 3, 6, & 9 months. Single-domain cognitive training was limited to a spatial navigation task. Multi-domain cognitive training consisted of a spatial navigation task, object recognition, and fear conditioning. At the age of 12 months, behavioral tests were completed for all groups. Then, mice were sacrificed, and their brains were assessed for pathology. APPNL-G-F/NL-G-F mice given multi-domain cognitive training compared to APPNL-G-F/NL-G-F control group showed an improvement in cognitive functions, reductions in amyloid load and microgliosis, and a preservation of cholinergic function. Additionally, multi-domain cognitive training improved anxiety in APPNL-G-F/NL-G-F mice as evidenced by measuring thigmotaxis behavior in the Morris water maze. There were mild reductions in microgliosis in the brain of APPNL-G-F/NL-G-F mice with single-domain cognitive training. These findings provide causal evidence for the potential of certain forms of cognitive training to mitigate the cognitive deficits in Alzheimer disease.
   Multi-domain cognitive training is shown to be more effective in preventing disease progression in a mouse model of Alzheimer's Disease than single-domain cognitive training.

AB  - The isoform 2 of sodium-calcium exchanger family (NCX2) is selectively expressed in neuronal and glial cells where it participates in Ca-2+-clearance following neuronal depolarization, synaptic plasticity, hippocampaldependent learning and memory consolidation processes. On the other hand, NCX2 is also involved in a neuroprotective effect following stroke. Despite the relevance of this antiporter under physiological and pathophysiological conditions, no studies have been reported on its genetic/epigenetic regulation. Therefore, we identified, cloned, and characterized a transcriptional regulatory region (R3) of rat Slc8a2 gene encoding for NCX2. In particular, R3 sequence displayed a promoter activity in PC12, SH-SY5Y and U87MG cell lines consistent with their endogenous NCX2 expression levels. On the other hand, R3 failed to induce detectable luciferase activity in BHK cell line that does not express NCX2 under control conditions. These data support the hypothesis that R3 represents the promoter region of NCX2. Moreover, among several conserved binding sequences for transcription factors identified by in-silico analysis, we evaluated the transcriptional regulation and the binding sites of Sp1, Sp4, NFkB1, GATA2 and CREB1 on R3 sequence by using site-direct mutagenesis and ChIP assays. In particular, transfection of Sp1, Sp4, and CREB1 enhanced both R3 promoter activity and NCX2 transcription in PC12 cell line. More important, CREB1 transfection also enhanced NCX2 protein levels and NCX reverse mode activity in PC12 cells. Altogether, these data suggested that: (i) the identified region contained the regulatory promoter of the antiporter; (ii) NCX2 might represent a downstream effector of transcription factors involved in synaptic plasticity and neuronal survival.

AB  - Anxiety disorders and cognitive decline are highly prevalent in rheumatic diseases, including Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA). In this study, we investigated the effect of long-term treatment with infliximab and tocilizumab on anxiety-like behaviour and cognitive performance in a juvenile collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rat model. Forty-nine rats with established moderate arthritis were randomly allocated into 7 equal groups: negative control, vehicle, methotrexate, infliximab, tocilizumab, methotrexate + infliximab and methotrexate + tocilizumab groups. Behavioural tests were performed to evaluate anxiety-like behaviour and cognitive function. Neuropathological changes were investigated by histological examination at the level of the hippocampus, the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex. Also, the expression of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), a biomarker associated with neuronal survival and plasticity, was determined in the hippocampus and the amygdala by RT-qPCR. We found that both infliximab and tocilizumab reduced anxiety-like behaviour in the elevated-plus and elevated-zero maze tests. Tocilizumab, also, improved cognitive function in the olfactory social memory and passive avoidance tests. Anti-cytokine treatment reversed the histopathological changes in the brain induced by CIA. BDNF expression was higher in all treatment groups and especially those receiving monoclonal antibodies combined with methotrexate. Our data provide evidence that chronic infliximab and tocilizumab treatment reduces anxiety-like behaviour, improves cognitive function, reverses neuropathological changes and increases central BDNF expression in a juvenile arthritis rat model. These findings may be translated to humans to address behavioural comorbidities associated with JIA.

AB  - Background Epileptogenesis is a process that results in neurons firing abnormally, causing seizures. Increasing evidence has shown that miRNAs expressed in the epileptic hippocampus are involved in epileptogenesis. We demonstrated the expression changes of miRNAs that may be effective in epileptogenesis in silico analysis in the kindling model created with Pentylenetetrazole (PTZ). Thus, we aimed to identify the target genes responsible for epileptogenesis. Methods and results Fifteen male Wistar-albino rats (200-230 g) were randomly divided into two groups control (n = 6) and PTZ (n = 9). The control group received 0.5 ml saline, and the PTZ group (35 mg/kg i.p.) intraperitoneally (i.p.) (11 times, every other day) to induce tonic-clonic seizures. Seizures were observed and scored 30 min after PTZ injection. After the last dose of PTZ (75 mg/kg) administration, the hippocampus tissues of the rats were removed by anesthesia. Analysis of miRNAs was performed with the Affymetrix gene chip miRNA sequence (728 miRNA) and confirmed by the Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (Real-Time PCR) method (29 miRNAs). We evaluated the expression change of the target gene of miRNA, whose expression change was detected using in silico analysis, by q-RT PCR. Eight miRNAs with changes in expression were detected. Of these miRNAs, miR-342-p was downregulated in the PTZ group and was statistically significant (p < 0.005). Ultimately, we determined that the target gene of miR-342-p is a metabotropic glutamate receptor 2 (GRM2) and that GRM2 expression is upregulated. Conclusions Downregulation of miR-342-3p in the PTZ kindling model may result in the upregulation of GRM2.

AB  - The benefits of senolytic therapy have been known in a series of age-related diseases, whereas its potential roles in global cerebral ischemic (GCI) brain injury remain unexplored. In current study, we aim to investigate the effects of combined senolytics Dasatinib plus Quercetin (D&Q) treatment in GCI and the underlying mechanisms in a mouse model. We firstly report that 12-week post-GCI D&Q treatment effectively eliminated cellular senescence of astrocytes and microglia in the hippocampus of mice brain, followed by decreased release of the potent inflammatory senescence-associated secretory phenotypes (SASP). Further mechanistic analysis suggested that D&Q administration can effectively regulate mitochondrial function as a critical downstream target. D&Q treatment inhibited GCI-induced mitochondrial fragmentation and maintained mitochondrial integrity. Subsequently, D&Q treatment improved the mitochondrial metabolic function by enhancing mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) activity and ATP production. Moreover, D&Q treatment reversed the decline of mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme SOD2 and reduced the ROS accumulation and suppressed oxidative damage to cellular protein structure. Further investigation indicated D&Q treatment protected the hippocampal neurons after GCI by mitigating the dendritic injury and neuronal apoptotic signaling. Extensive behavioral tests assessed the functional outcomes and showed that D&Q treatment effectively preserved hippocampus-dependent spatial reference memory and recognition memory, and mitigated GCI-induced anxiety and depression levels. Taken together, our study provides leading evidence for the neuroprotective roles of the senolytics D&Q in GCI model and identifies regulation of mitochondrial functions could be the key underlying mechanism. These findings offer novel insights into the potential clinical applications of senolytic agents in therapy.

AB  - BackgroundGlucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) (7-36) amide, an endogenous active form of GLP-1, has been shown to modulate oxidative stress and neuronal cell survival in various neurological diseases.ObjectiveThis study investigated the potential effects of GLP-1(7-36) on oxidative stress and apoptosis in neuronal cells following traumatic brain injury (TBI) and explored the underlying mechanisms.MethodsTraumatic brain injury (TBI) models were established in male SD rats for in vivo experiments. The extent of cerebral oedema was assessed using wet-to-dry weight ratios following GLP-1(7-36) intervention. Neurological dysfunction and cognitive impairment were evaluated through behavioural experiments. Histopathological changes in the brain were observed using haematoxylin and eosin staining. Oxidative stress levels in hippocampal tissues were measured. TUNEL staining and Western blotting were employed to examine cell apoptosis. In vitro experiments evaluated the extent of oxidative stress and neural apoptosis following ERK5 phosphorylation activation. Immunofluorescence colocalization of p-ERK5 and NeuN was analysed using immunofluorescence cytochemistry.ResultsRats with TBI exhibited neurological deterioration, increased oxidative stress, and enhanced apoptosis, which were ameliorated by GLP-1(7-36) treatment. Notably, GLP-1(7-36) induced ERK5 phosphorylation in TBI rats. However, upon ERK5 inhibition, oxidative stress and neuronal apoptosis levels were elevated, even in the presence of GLP-1(7-36).ConclusionIn summary, this study suggested that GLP-1(7-36) suppressed oxidative damage and neuronal apoptosis after TBI by activating ERK5/CREB.

AB  - The first-generation antihistamine chlorpheniramine (CPA) is believed to have both anxiolytic and antidepressant properties. The current study sought to assess the mechanisms behind the antidepressant and anxiolytic effects of CPA therapy concerning oxidative stress, inflammation, and nuclear factor p45 for erythroid 2-Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Nrf2-BDNF) signaling pathway in forced swimming-induced depressive-like behavior and anxiety. Eighteen male Wistar rats (180-200 gm) rats were separated into three groups (n = 6): a stressed group (acute stress) that underwent the forced swimming test (FST) and a stressed group that received pretreatment with CPA (10 mg/kg body weight) for 3 weeks (CPA + acute stress). Animals were subsequently put through the following behavioral tests after undergoing a forced swim test (FST) for 5 min: an immobility test, open field test, and elevated plus maze test. Serum cortisol levels were measured when the rats were euthanized at the end of the experiments. Brain neurotransmitters (cortisol, serotonin, and noradrenaline), oxidative stress (SOD and MDA), inflammatory (IL-6 and IL-1) biomarkers, and the Nrf2-BDNF signaling pathway in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex tissues was determined. CPA prevented stress-induced increases in cortisol levels (p < 0.0001), decreased brain neurotransmitters, and increased oxidative stress and inflammation. CPA also upregulated the Nrf2-BDNF signaling pathway. Thus, CPA mitigates depressive-like behavior and anxiety by inhibiting oxidative stress and inflammation and upregulating the Nrf2-BDNF signaling pathway in the brain tissues.

AB  - Memory loss and dementia are major public health concerns with a substantial economic burden. Oxidative stress has been shown to play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of hippocampal damage-induced memory impairment. To investigate whether the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compound vanillylacetone (zingerone) can protect against hippocampal damage and memory loss induced by cadmium chloride (CdCl2) administration in rats, we explored the potential involvement of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathway, which is known to modulate oxidative stress and inflammation. Sixty healthy male Wistar rats were divided into five groups: vehicle-treated (control), vanillylacetone, CdCl2, vanillylacetone + CdCl2, vanillylacetone + CdCl2 + brusatol (a selective pharmacological Nrf2 inhibitor) groups. Vanillylacetone effectively attenuated CdCl2-induced damage in the dental gyrus of the hippocampus and improved the memory function assessed by the Morris Water Maze test. Additionally, vanillylacetone markedly decreased the hippocampal tissue levels of inflammatory biomarkers (interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, intracellular cell adhesive molecules) and apoptosis biomarkers (Bax and cleaved caspase-3). The control and CdCl2-treated groups treated with vanillylacetone showed reduced generation of reactive oxygen species, decreased malondialdehyde levels, and increased superoxide dismutase and glutathione activities, along with significant elevation of nuclear Nrf2 mRNA and protein expression in hippocampal tissue. All the protective effects of vanillylacetone were substantially blocked by the co-administration of brusatol (a selective Nrf2 inhibitor). Vanillylacetone mitigated hippocampal damage and memory loss induced by CdCl2, at least in part, by activating the nuclear transcription factor Nrf2. Additionally, vanillylacetone exerted its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by core symptoms including impairment in social communication and restrictive and repetitive behaviors and interests. Music has emerged in the past decade as an intervention therapy for children with ASD. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of music on cognition impairments in the valproic acid (VPA) rat model of autism. The VPA was administered for animal modeling of autism on embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5) (600 mg/kg). Male and female pups were sub divided into four main groups (Saline.Non-music, VPA.Non-music, Saline.Music, and VPA.Music). The rats in the music groups were exposed to Mozart's piano sonata K.448 for 30 days (4 h/day), from postnatal day (PND) 21 to 50. Autistic-like behaviors were tested using a social interaction, the Morris water maze (MWM), and a passive avoidance tasks at the end of the PND 50. Our results demonstrated that VPA-exposed rat pups had significantly lower sociability and social memory performance compared with the saline-exposed rats in both sexes. VPA-exposed rat pups exhibited learning and memory impairments in the MWM and passive avoidance tasks. Our results demonstrated that music improved sociability in VPA-exposed rats, especially in males. Furthermore, our findings revealed that music improved learning impairments in VPA-exposed male rats in MWM task. In addition, music improved spatial memory impairments in VPA-exposed rats of both sexes. We also found that music improved passive avoidance memory impairments in VPA-exposed rats of both sexes, especially in females. More investigation in future studies are needed.

AB  - Objective. Our research is designed to explore the function of sodium houttuyfonate (SH) on Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its potential molecular mechanisms. Methods. In our study, the Morris water maze (MWM) test was used to assess the role of SH on spatial learning and memory deficiency in amyloid-beta peptide (A beta)(1-42)-induced AD mice. We explored the functions of SH on proinflammatory cytokines, neuron apoptosis, and damage in vivo and in vitro by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), flow cytometry, western blot, and Nissl staining. Moreover, the effect of SH on oxidative stress in vivo and in vitro was also detected. To explore the underlying molecular mechanisms of SH on AD, the expressions of proteins and mRNA involved in the NOD-like receptor pyrin domain containing-3/gasdermin D (NLRP3/GSDMD) pathway were determined using western blot, immunofluorescence staining, and qRT-PCR. Results. Our data demonstrated that SH ameliorated spatial learning and memory deficiency in 01.42-induced AD mice. Moreover, SH significantly improved hippocampal neuron damage and inhibited oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and neuron apoptosis in A beta(1-42)-induced AD mice and PC12 cells. The results also revealed that SH protected A beta(1-42)-induced AD through inhibiting the NLRP3/GSDMD pathway. Conclusion. The present study demonstrated that SH could ameliorate A beta(1-42-)induced memory impairment neuroinflammation and pyroptosis through inhibiting the NLRP3/GSDMD pathway in AD, suggesting that SH may be a potential candidate for AD treatment.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a decline in cognitive function. The beta-amyloid (A beta) hypothesis suggests that A beta peptides can spontaneously aggregate into beta-fragment-containing oligomers and protofibrils, and this activation of the amyloid pathway alters Ca2+ signaling in neurons, leading to neurotoxicity and thus apoptosis of neuronal cells. In our study, a blood-brain barrier crossing flavonol glycoside hyperoside was identified with anti-A beta aggregation, BACE inhibitory, and neuroprotective effect in cellular or APP/PSEN1 double transgenic Alzheimer's disease mice model. While our pharmacokinetic data confirmed that intranasal administration of hyperoside resulted in a higher bio-availability in mice brain, further in vivo studies revealed that it improved motor deficit, spatial memory and learning ability of APP/PSEN1 mice with reducing level of A beta plaques and GFAP in the cortex and hippocampus. Bioinformatics, computational docking and in vitro assay results suggested that hyperoside bind to A beta and interacted with ryanodine receptors, then regulated cellular apoptosis via endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondrial calcium (Ca2+) signaling pathway. Consistently, it was confirmed that hyperoside increased Bcl2, decreased Bax and cyto-c protein levels, and ameliorated neuronal cell death in both in vitro and in vivo model. By regulating A beta-induced cell death via regulation on Ca2+ signaling cascade and mitochondrial membrane potential, our study suggested that hyperoside may work as a potential therapeutic agent or preventive remedy for Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - The camelid single domain antibody, referred to VHH or Nanobody, is considered a versatile tool for various biotechnological and clinical applications because of its favorable biophysical properties. To take advantage of these characteristics and for its application in biotechnology and therapy, research on VHH engineering is currently vigorously conducted. To humanize a camelid VHH, we performed complementarity determining region (CDR) grafting using a humanized VHH currently in clinical trials, and investigated the effects of these changes on the biophysical properties of the resulting VHH. The chimeric VHH exhibited a significant decrease in affinity and thermal stability and a large conformational change in the CDR3. To elucidate the molecular basis for these changes, we performed mutational analyses on the framework regions revealing the contribution of individual residues within the framework region. It is demonstrated that the mutations resulted in the loss of affinity and lower thermal stability, revealing the significance of bulky residues in the vicinity of the CDR3, and the importance of intramolecular interactions between the CDR3 and the framework-2 region. Subsequently, we performed back-mutational analyses on the chimeric VHH. Back-mutations resulted in an increase of the thermal stability and affinity. These data suggested that back-mutations restored the intramolecular interactions, and proper positioning and/or dynamics of the CDR3, resulting in the gain of thermal stability and affinity. These observations revealed the molecular contribution of the framework region on VHHs and further designability of the framework region of VHHs without modifying the CDRs.

AB  - IntroductionAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social interactions and repetitive behaviors. This study examines the effects of fenofibrate on a propionic acid (PPA)-induced rat model of ASD, focusing on behavioral changes, inflammatory markers, and histological findings.Materials and MethodsThirty male Wistar rats were divided into three groups: a control group, a group receiving PPA and saline, and a group treated with PPA and fenofibrate for 15 days. Behavioral assessments, including the three-chamber sociability test, open-field test, and passive avoidance learning, were conducted. Biochemical analyses measured TNF-alpha, NGF, IL-17, IL-2, and galectin-3 levels in brain tissues. Histological evaluations focused on Purkinje neuron counts in the cerebellum and neuronal changes in the CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus, along with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) levels.ResultsFenofibrate treatment significantly improved behavioral outcomes, reducing autism-like behaviors compared to the PPA/saline group. Biochemically, the PPA/saline group showed elevated levels of malondialdehyde, TNF-alpha, IL-2, IL-17, and galectin-3, which were reduced following fenofibrate treatment. Histologically, the PPA/saline group exhibited fewer, dysmorphic Purkinje neurons and increased glial activity in the CA1 region, both of which were ameliorated by fenofibrate treatment.ConclusionFenofibrate shows promise in mitigating autism-like behaviors in a rat model of ASD, likely due to its antioxidative and neuroprotective properties, which contribute to preserving neuronal integrity and reducing inflammation.

AB  - Serotonin exerts a significant role in the mammalian central nervous system embryogenesis and brain ontogeny. Therefore, we investigate the effect of neonatal treatment of d-fenfluramine (d-FEN), a serotonin (5-HT) releaser, on the behavioral expression of adult male Swiss mice. For this purpose, we divided pregnant female Swiss mice into two groups (n = 6 each and similar to 35 g). Their off-spring were treated with d-FEN (3 mg/kg, s.c.) from postnatal days (PND) 5 to 20. At PND 21, one male puppy of each litter was euthanized; the midbrain and the hippocampus were dissected for RNA analysis. At PND 70, the male off-spring underwent a behavioral assessment in the open field, elevated plus-maze, light-dark box, tail suspension, and rotarod test. The programmed animals had a decrease in 5HT1a, serotonin transporter (SERT), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression in the mesencephalic raphe region. Alternatively, there was a reduction only in the tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH2) and BDNF expression in the hippocampus. In the light-dark box test, offspring of the treated group had higher latency to light and less time on the light side than the control. Also, it was observed less time of immobility in the tail suspension test. We also observed low motor skill learning in the rotarod test. These findings suggest that programming with d-FEN during the neonatal period alters a mesencephalic and hippocampal serotonergic system, promoting anxiety, antidepressant behavior, low coordination, and motor learning in adults.

AB  - Background: Sevoflurane is a widely used anesthetic in infants. However, long and repeated exposure to this drug can cause developmental neurotoxicity. This study aimed to investigate the role and mechanism of circular RNA DLGAP4 (circDLGAP4) in sevoflurane-induced neurotoxicity. Methods: Neonatal mice and mouse hippocampal neuronal cell line HT22 were used to construct sevofluraneinduced nerve injury models. The role of circDLGAP4 in sevoflurane-induced neurotoxicity was evaluated by gain-and/or loss-of-function methods. Pathological alterations in hippocampus were analyzed by hematoxylineosin and Tunel staining. Cell injury was assessed by cell viability and apoptosis, which was detected by CCK8 and flow cytometry. The expression of circDLGAP4 and miR-9-5p was determined by real-time PCR. Sirt1 and BDNF levels were measured by Western blot. Productions of TNF-alpha and IL-6 were examined by ELISA. Dualluciferase reporter assay and/or RNA pull-down assay were used to confirm the direct binding among circDLGAP4, miR-9-5p, and Sirt1. Rescue experiments were used to further verify the mechanism of circDLGAP4. Results: CircDLGAP4 expression was decreased by sevoflurane both in vivo and in vitro. Overexpression of circDLGAP4 elevated cell viability, reduced apoptosis and levels of TNF-alpha and IL-6, while circDLGAP4 knockdown showed the opposite effects in sevoflurane-induced HT22 cells. Mechanically, circDLGAP4 functioned via directly binding to and regulating miR-9-5p, followed by targeting the Sirt1/BDNF pathway. Additionally, circDLGAP4 upregulation relieved sevoflurane-induced nerve injury, reduced levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6 and miR-9-5p, but increased the expression of Sirt1 and BDNF in hippocampus. Conclusions: Our studies found that circDLGAP4 relieved sevoflurane-induced neurotoxicity by sponging miR-95p to regulate Sirt1/BDNF pathway.

AB  - Modulation of in vivo adult neurogenesis (AN) is an evolving concept in managing neurodegenerative diseases. CDRI-08, a bacoside-enriched fraction of Bacopa monnieri, has been demonstrated for its neuroprotective actions, but its effect on AN remains unexplored. This article describes the status of AN by monitoring neuronal stem cells (NSCs) proliferation, differentiation/maturation markers and BDNF-TrkB levels (NSCs signalling players) vs. the level of neurodegeneration and their modulations by CDRI-08 in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) of male rats with moderate grade hepatic encephalopathy (MoHE). For NSC proliferation, 10 mg/kg b.w. 5-bromo-2 '-deoxyuridine (BrdU) was administered i.p. during the last 3 days, and for the NSC differentiation study, it was given during the first 3 days to the control, the MoHE (developed by 100 mg/kg b.w. of thioacetamide i.p. up to 10 days) and to the MoHE male rats co-treated with 350 mg/kg b.w. CDRI-08. Compared with the control rats, the hippocampus DG region of MoHE rats showed significant decreases in the number of Nestin(+)/BrdU(+) and SOX2(+)/BrdU(+) (proliferating) and DCX+/BrdU+ and NeuN+/BrdU+ (differentiating) NSCs. This was consistent with a similar decline in BDNF+/TrkB(+) NSCs. However, all these NSC marker positive cells were observed to be recovered to their control levels, with a concordant restoration of total cell numbers in the DG of the CDRI-08-treated MoHE rats. The findings suggest that the restoration of hippocampal AN by CDRI-08 is consistent with the recovery of BDNF-TrkB-expressing NSCs in the MoHE rat model of neurodegeneration.

AB  - Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive muscle wasting disorder caused by a mutation in the dystrophin gene. In addition to muscle pathology, some patients with DMD will exhibit cognitive impairments with severity being linked to age and type of genetic mutation. Likewise, some studies have shown that mdx mice display impairments in spatial memory compared with wild-type (WT) controls, while others have not observed any such effect. Most studies have utilized the traditional C57BL/10 (C57) mdx mouse, which exhibits a mild disease phenotype. Recently, the DBA/2J (D2) mdx mouse has emerged as a more severe and perhaps clinically relevant DMD model; however, studies examining cognitive function in these mice are limited. Thus, in this study we examined cognitive function in age-matched C57 and D2 mdx mice along with their respective WT controls. Our findings show that 8- to 12-week-old C57 mdx mice did not display any differences in exploration time when challenged with a novel object recognition test. Conversely, age-matched D2 mdx mice spent less time exploring objects in total as a well as less time exploring the novel object, suggestive of impaired recognition memory. Biochemical analyses of the D2 mdx brain revealed higher soluble amyloid precursor protein beta (APP beta) and APP in the prefrontal cortex of mdx mice compared with WT, and lower soluble APP alpha in the hippocampus, suggestive of a shift towards amyloidogenesis and a similar pathogenesis to Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, our study demonstrates the utility of the D2 mdx model in studying cognitive impairment.

AB  - Secretory protein expression in mammalian cells is widely used in various fields, including biomedical research and biopharmaceutical production. However, achieving high-level expression of certain secretory proteins/peptides can be challenging. The naturally occurring N1 fragment of the prion protein is one of these difficult-to-produce secretory proteins, which hinders our understanding of its biological functions and limits its potential as a therapeutic molecule. To improve N1 production, we screened several well-folded protein domains and found that fusing N1 with a camelid nanobody (Nb) improved its translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum and significantly enhanced its secretion. Nb fusion does not alter the translocation mechanism, which remains dependent on the Sec61-Sec62- Sec63 complex. This approach also resulted in a significant increase in N1 production in the mouse brain using recombinant adeno-associated virus. Furthermore, fusing Nb to another unstructured protein, Shadoo (without glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor), or a peptide hormone, somatostatin, also greatly increased their production, demonstrating the applicability of this approach to other proteins and peptides. The enhancement of N1 production is comparable or better than Fc fusion, and the effect is observed with all tested camelid Nb but not with a shark Nb and to a lesser extent with a human immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region. Importantly, the Nb in the fusion protein retained its antigen-binding capability, paving the way for the development of a dual-functional protein. Collectively, we present a novel strategy for enhancing the production of secretory proteins, which holds great promise in creating functional biological molecules for a wide range of applications.

AB  - Basal forebrain cholinergic dysfunction, most likely linked with tau protein aggregation, is a characteristic feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent evidence suggests that tau protein is a putative target for the treatment of dementia, and the tau aggregation inhibitor, hydromethylthionine mesylate (HMTM), has emerged as a potential disease-modifying treatment. However, its efficacy was diminished in patients already receiving approved acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. In this study, we ask whether this negative interaction can also be mimicked in experimental tau models of AD and whether the underlying mechanism can be understood. From a previous age profiling study, 6-month-old line 1 (L1) tau transgenic mice were characterized by a severe reduction in several cholinergic markers. We therefore assessed whether long-term pre-exposure with the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor rivastigmine alone and in conjunction with the tau aggregation inhibitor HMTM can reverse cholinergic deficits in L1. Rivastigmine and HMTM, and combinations of the two compounds were administered orally for 11 weeks to both L1 and wild-type mice. The brains were sectioned with a focus on the basal forebrain, motor cortex and hippocampus. Immunohistochemical staining and quantification of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), tyrosine kinase A (TrkA)-positive neurons and relative optical intensity (ROI) for vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT), and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) reactivity confirmed reversal of the diminished cholinergic phenotype of interneurons (nucleus accumbens, striatum) and projection neurons (medial septum, nucleus basalis magnocellularis) by HMTM, to a greater extent than by rivastigmine alone in L1 mice. Combined administration did not yield additivity but, in most proxies, led to antagonistic effects in which rivastigmine decreased the benefits shown with HMTM alone. Local markers (VAChT and AChE) in target structures of the basal forebrain, motor cortex and hippocampal CA3 seemed to be normalized by HMTM, but not by rivastigmine or the combination of both drugs. HMTM, which was developed as a tau aggregation inhibitor, strongly decreased the tau load in L1 mice, however, not in combination with rivastigmine. Taken together, these data confirm a cholinergic phenotype in L1 tau transgenic mice that resembles the deficits observed in AD patients. This phenotype is reversible by HMTM, but at the same time appears to be subject to a homeostatic regulation induced by chronic pre-treatment with an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, which interferes with the efficacy of HMTM. The strongest phenotypic reversal coincided with a normalization of the tau load in the cortex and hippocampus of L1, suggesting that tau accumulation underpins the loss of cholinergic markers in the basal forebrain and its projection targets.

AB  - Tauopathies are neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the deposition of aggregates of the microtubule-associated protein tau, a main component of neurofibrillary tangles. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of tauopathy and dementia, with amyloid-beta pathology as an additional hallmark feature of the disease. Besides its role in stabilizing microtubules, tau is localized at postsynaptic sites and can regulate synaptic plasticity. The activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc) is an immediate early gene that plays a key role in synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory. Arc has been implicated in AD pathogenesis and regulates the release of amyloid-beta. We found that decreased Arc levels correlate with AD status and disease severity. Importantly, Arc protein was upregulated in the hippocampus of Tau KO mice and dendrites of Tau KO primary hippocampal neurons. Overexpression of tau decreased Arc stability in an activitydependent manner, exclusively in neuronal dendrites, which was coupled to an increase in the expression of dendritic and somatic surface GluA1-containing alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors. The taudependent decrease in Arc was found to be proteasomesensitive, yet independent of Arc ubiquitination and required the endophilin-binding domain of Arc. Importantly, these effects on Arc stability and GluA1 localization were not observed in the commonly studied tau mutant, P301L. These observations provide a potential molecular basis for synaptic dysfunction mediated through the accumulation of tau in dendrites. Our findings confirm that Arc is misregulated in AD and further show a physiological role for tau in regulating Arc stability and AMPA receptor targeting.

AB  - Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium melibiose permease (MelBSt) is a prototype of the Na+-coupled major facilitator superfamily transporters, which are important for the cellular uptake of molecules including sugars and small drugs. Although the symport mechanisms have been wellstudied, mechanisms of substrate binding and translocation remain enigmatic. We have previously determined the sugarbinding site of outward -facing MelBSt by crystallography. To obtain other key kinetic states, here we raised camelid singledomain nanobodies (Nbs) and carried out a screening against the WT MelBSt under 4 ligand conditions. We applied an in vivo cAMP-dependent two -hybrid assay to detect interactions of Nbs with MelBSt and melibiose transport assays to determine the effects on MelBSt functions. We found that all selected Nbs showed partial to complete inhibitions of MelBSt transport activities, confirming their intracellular interactions. A group of Nbs (714, 725, and 733) was purified, and isothermal titration calorimetry measurements showed that their binding affinities were significantly inhibited by the substrate melibiose. When titrating melibiose to the MelBSt/Nb complexes, Nb also inhibited the sugar -binding. However, the Nb733/MelBSt complex retained binding to the coupling cation Na+ and also to the regulatory enzyme EIIAGlc of the glucosespecific phosphoenolpyruvate/sugar phosphotransferase system. Further, EIIAGlc/MelBSt complex also retained binding to Nb733 and formed a stable supercomplex. All data indicated that MelBSt trapped by Nbs retained its physiological functions and the trapped conformation is similar to that bound by the physiological regulator EIIAGlc. Therefore, these conformational Nbs can be useful tools for further structural, functional, and conformational analyses.

AB  - The addition of new neurons to the existing hippocampal circuitry persists in the adult dentate gyrus (DG). During this process, named adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN), adult hippocampal progenitor cells (AHPs) give rise to newborn dentate granule cells (DGCs). The acquisition of a neuronal lineage by AHPs is tightly regulated by numerous signaling molecules and transcription factors. In this regard, glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3 beta) is a master regulator of the maturation of AHPs in vitro. Here we analyzed the cell-autonomous effects of overexpressing a constitutively active form of GSK-3 beta (GSK-3 beta S9A) in AHPs in vivo. To this end, we stereotaxically injected a GSK-3 beta S9A-encoding retrovirus (GSK-3 beta-V5) into the DG of young adult C57BL6/J Ola Hsd female mice and studied the cell lineage acquisition, migratory and marker expression patterns, and the morphological maturation of the infected cells over time. Strikingly, GSK-3 beta S9A-transduced cells expressed glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and NG2, thereby acquiring an immature astroglial phenotype, which differed markedly from the neuronal phenotype observed in cells transduced with a control retrovirus that encoded GFP. Accordingly, the morphology and migration patterns of cells transduced by the two retroviruses are remarkably divergent. These observations support the role of GSK-3 beta as a cornerstone that regulates the balance between new astocytes/neurons generated in the adult murine DG.

AB  - Childhood asthma has become one of the most common chronic diseases in children and adolescents. However, few case-control studies investigating the relationship between phthalate exposure and asthma in children and adolescents have been conducted, especially in Asia. Therefore, we assessed the potential associations between phthalate exposure and asthma among children and adolescents in Taiwan. Because various demographic and environmental variables may influence the incidence and prognosis of asthma, we performed a case-control study with propensity score matching. Out of 615 Childhood Environment and Allergic Diseases Study participants, we conditionally matched 41 children with clinically diagnosed asthma with 111 controls. We then analyzed 11 phthalate metabolites by using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. Compared with the control group, the median urinary phthalate levels for most phthalate metabolites in the case group were slightly increased, including monomethyl phthalate, mono-n-butyl phthalate, monobenzyl phthalate, monoethylhexyl phthalate, mono-(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate, mono-(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate, mono-(2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl) phthalate, and mono-(2-carboxymethylhexyl) phthalate. Hence, our results suggest that phthalate exposure may be associated with the development of asthma. In addition, prenatal environmental factors, such as active or passive smoking during pregnancy, may increase the risk of asthma.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an insidious neurodegenerative condition characterized by dementia, cognitive decline, and eventual mortality. The pathogenesis of AD is complex, influenced by multiple factors including neurotransmitter deficiencies, particularly acetylcholine (ACh) and the dysregulation of mental homeostasis, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and amyloid-beta (A beta) peptide accumulation. The latter is firmly linked to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and amyloid plaques in the cortical and hippocampal regions, which are hallmarks of the disease pathology. Recent advancements in therapeutic strategies have focused on inhibiting the amyloid-beta peptide, a key contributor to AD progression. This study explores the development of novel amyloid-beta inhibitors and their biological activities, focusing on the synthesis of radiolabeled compounds used in the diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, we explore the roles of crucial enzymes such as Electrophorus electricus acetylcholinesterase (eeAChE), human acetylcholinesterase (hAChE), and human butyrylcholinesterase (hBuChE) in the disease's neurochemical landscape. The goal of this review is to furnish the scientific community with insight into the design of innovative amyloid imaging agents. These agents are based on diverse scaffolds including flavone, pyrimidine, benzimidazole, imidazole, pyridine, pyrrole, quinoline, indanone, acridine, and peptide-based derivatives, serving as core structures for further research and development. This comprehensive evaluation not only elucidates the molecular underpinnings of AD but also propels forward the quest for efficacious diagnostic and therapeutic tools.

AB  - Neurogenesis occurs in the hippocampus throughout life and is implicated in various physiological brain functions such as memory encoding and mood regulation. L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) has long been believed to be an inert precursor of dopamine. Here, we show that L-DOPA and its receptor, GPR143, the gene product of ocular albinism 1, regulate neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG) in a dopamine-independent manner. L-DOPA at concentrations far lower than that of dopamine promoted proliferation of neural stem and progenitor cells in wild-type mice under the inhibition of its conversion to dopamine; this effect was abolished in GPR143 gene-deficient (Gpr143(-/y)) mice. Hippocampal neurogenesis decreased during development and adulthood, and exacerbated depression-like behavior was observed in adult Gpr143(-/y) mice. Replenishment of GPR143 in the DG attenuated the impaired neurogenesis and depression-like behavior. Our findings suggest that L-DOPA through GPR143 modulates hippocampal neurogenesis, thereby playing a role in mood regulation in the hippocampus.

AB  - Hippocampal neuronal plasticity is a fundamental process underpinning learning and memory formation and requiring elaborate molecular mechanisms that result in the dynamic remodelling of synaptic connectivity. The neurotrophic properties of midkine (Mdk) have been implicated in the development and repair of the nervous system, while Mdk knockout resulted in deficits in the formation of certain types of memory. The role of Mdk in the process of memory-associated neuronal plasticity, however, remains poorly understood. We investigated the learning-induced regulation of Mdk in spatial navigation and association learning using the water maze and the odour reward association learning paradigms, characterising a temporal profile of Mdk protein expression post-learning. Both learning events revealed similar patterns of upregulation of expression of the protein in the rat hippocampal dentate gyrus, which were rapid and transient. Moreover, administration of recombinant Mdk during the endogenous Mdk upregulation following learning enhanced memory in the water maze task revealing a pro-cognitive action of Mdk. We further show that, within the adult hippocampus, Mdk mRNA is predominantly expressed in granular and pyramidal neurons and that hippocampal neuronal Mdk expression is regulated by the canonical plasticity-associated neurotransmitter glutamate. Finally, we confirm that the positive action of Mdk on neurite outgrowth previously noted in cortical and cerebellar neurons extends to hippocampal neurons. Together, our findings suggest a role for Mdk in glutamate-mediated hippocampal neuronal plasticity important for long-term memory consolidation.image
   The role of the neurotrophic factor midkine in memory-associated neuronal plasticity is poorly understood. We show that midkine protein expression is transiently upregulated in the rat hippocampal dentate gyrus following learning of the water maze or olfactory reward association. Direct injection of midkine into the brain during the time window of natural upregulation enhances spatial memory. In vitro investigations show that the neuroplasticity-associated neurotransmitter glutamate might be responsible for the midkine upregulation and that midkine has a powerful neuroplastic action on the structure of hippocampal neurons. Together these findings suggest midkine may contribute to hippocampal memory-associated neuroplasticity.image

AB  - We explored the effect of inhibition of thioredoxin interacting protein (Txnip) on neuroprotection in M & uuml;ller cells under high glucose. Wild-type (WT) and Txnip knockout (Txnip-/-) mice were used to establish a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes model and a M & uuml;ller cells high glucose model. We detected BDNF expression and PI3K/ AKT/CREB pathway activation levels in the retina and M & uuml;ller cells of each group in vivo and in vitro experiments. The Txnip-/- STZ group showed higher expression of BDNF and phosphorylation of PI3K/AKT/CREB in retina, and less retinal photoreceptor apoptosis was observed in Txnip-/- diabetic group than in WT. After using an inhibitor of PI3K signaling pathway, BDNF expression was reduced; In vitro co-cultured with M & uuml;ller cells in different groups, 661 W cells showed different situations, Txnip-/- M & uuml;ller cells maximum downregulated Cleaved-caspase 3 expression in 661 W, accompanied by an increase in Bcl-2/Bax ratio. These findings indicate that inhibiting endogenous Txnip in mouse M & uuml;ller cells can promote their expression and secretion of BDNF, thereby reducing HG induced photoreceptor apoptosis and having important neuroprotective effects on DR. The regulation of BDNF expression by Txnip may be achieved by activating the PI3K/AKT/CREB pathway. This study suggests that regulating Txnip may be a potential target for DR treatment.

AB  - The current study characterized the combating memory impairment effect of seabuckthorn seed protein (SSP) and the arginine (Arg)-enriched peptides (SSPP) on d-galactose-induced brain aging in mice. The Arg content in SSP and SSPP were 10.11 and 17.82 g/100 g, respectively. Seven Arg peptides (Ile/Leu-Arg, Arg-Glu, Asp-Arg-Pro, Arg-Try-Ala, Glu-Arg-Ser, Val-Gly-Arg-Pro, and Lys-Thr-Glu-Arg) were identified from SSPP. The animal experiments of the Morris water maze and the step-down test indicated that the oral administration of SSP (0.25, 0.5, 1.0 mg/g.d) and SSPP (0.25, 0.5, 1.0 mg/g.d) significantly (p < 0.05) reversed the learning and memory impairment symptoms. The activation of endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase and neuronal NO synthase were increased, and inducible NO synthase decreased after SSP and SSPP in the hippocampus compared to the model group, with the SSPP being quite effective. Moreover, the treatment significantly exhibited the ability to normalize the serum inflammatory cytokine levels (NF-kappa B, TNF-alpha, IL-6) and suppress the Arg-inducible nitric oxide (Arg-iNO) pathway. Therefore, SSP and SSPP ingestion reversed the behavioral learning and memory impairment symptoms possibly associated with the anti-inflammation and Arg-iNO pathway. Consumption of SSP and SSPP diets can be beneficial to memory impairment.

AB  - Yes associated protein (YAP) is the main effector protein in the Hippo pathway, regulating cell growth by binding to transcription factors in the nucleus. However, the mechanisms by which YAP regulates the development and progression of gastric cancer (GC) remain largely unknown. In this study, bioinformatics analysis determined that YAP was significantly upregulated in GC and associated with poor prognosis. In addition, YAP deletion inhibits proliferation and migration of GC cells in vitro, while overexpression of YAP has the opposite effect. Mechanistically, overexpression of YAP induced FAK phosphorylation in gastric cancer cells, whereas knockdown of YAP had the opposite effect. Importantly, translocation expressed mutant plasmid YAP-S94A (YAP1 mutant without TEAD binding site) did not significantly change the level of FAK phosphorylation. Furthermore, Verteporfin (a small molecule inhibitor of YAP) interrupted the YAP-TEAD interaction and inhibited FAK phosphorylation, confirming that YAP can induce FAK phosphorylation in a TEAD-dependent manner. In addition, the silencing of FAK or the use of FAK inhibitors inhibited the aggregation of YAP proteins in the nucleus, forming a FAK-YAP positive feedback loop. Finally, we identify the FAK upstream gene, HMGB1, as a direct transcriptional target of YAP-TEAD. Silencing HMGB1 reversed YAP-induced FAK activation as well as cell proliferation and migration. Collectively, our results reveal a new signalling axis, YAP/HMGB1/FAK, in the regulation of cell proliferation and migration, and provide new insights into the crosstalk between Hippo signalling and cell proliferation.

AB  - The over-activation of NMDA receptors and oxidative stress are important components of neonatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI). Kynurenic acid (KYNA) acts as an NMDA receptor antagonist and is known as a reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger, which makes it a potential therapeutic compound. This study aimed to establish the neuroprotective and antioxidant potential of KYNA in an experimental model of HI. HI on seven-day-old rats was used as an experimental model. The animals were injected i.p. with different doses of KYNA 1 h or 6 h after HI. The neuroprotective effect of KYNA was determined by the measurement of brain damage and elements of oxidative stress (ROS and glutathione (GSH) level, SOD, GPx, and catalase activity). KYNA applied 1 h after HI significantly reduced weight loss of the ischemic hemisphere, and prevented neuronal loss in the hippocampus and cortex. KYNA significantly reduced HI-increased ROS, GSH level, and antioxidant enzyme activity. Only the highest used concentration of KYNA showed neuroprotection when applied 6 h after HI. The presented results indicate induction of neuroprotection at the ROS formation stage. However, based on the presented data, it is not possible to pinpoint whether NMDA receptor inhibition or the scavenging abilities are the dominant KYNA-mediated neuroprotective mechanisms.

AB  - Metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGlu(5)) is implicated in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, its alteration at the subcellular level in neurons is still unexplored. Here, we provide a quantitative description on the expression and localisation patterns of mGlu(5) in the APP/PS1 model of AD at 12 months of age, combining immunoblots, histoblots and high-resolution immunoelectron microscopic approaches. Immunoblots revealed that the total amount of mGlu(5) protein in the hippocampus, in addition to downstream molecules, i.e., G(q/11) and PLC beta(1), was similar in both APP/PS1 mice and age-matched wild type mice. Histoblots revealed that mGlu(5) expression in the brain and its laminar expression in the hippocampus was also unaltered. However, the ultrastructural techniques of SDS-FRL and pre-embedding immunogold demonstrated that the subcellular localisation of mGlu(5) was significantly reduced along the neuronal surface of hippocampal principal cells, including CA1 pyramidal cells and DG granule cells, in APP/PS1 mice at 12 months of age. The decrease in the surface localisation of mGlu(5) was accompanied by an increase in its frequency at intracellular sites in the two neuronal populations. Together, these data demonstrate, for the first time, a loss of mGlu(5) at the plasma membrane and accumulation at intracellular sites in different principal cells of the hippocampus in APP/PS1 mice, suggesting an alteration of the excitability and synaptic transmission that could contribute to the cognitive dysfunctions in this AD animal model. Further studies are required to elucidate the specificity of mGlu(5)-associated molecules and downstream signalling pathways in the progression of the pathology.

AB  - The effect of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) on cells under oxidative stress induced by glutamate, a neurotransmitter, and the underlying molecular mechanisms were assessed in the present study. We found that in the pre-treatment of HT-22 cells with glutamate in a dose-dependent manner, intracellular ROS were excessively generated, and additional cell damage occurred in the form of lipid peroxidation. The neurotoxicity caused by excessive glutamate was found to be ferroptosis and not apoptosis. Other factors (GPx-4, Nrf2, Nox1 and Hspb1) involved in ferroptosis were also identified. In other words, it was confirmed that GIP increased the activity of sub-signalling molecules in the process of suppressing ferroptosis as an antioxidant and maintained a stable cell cycle even under glutamate-induced neurotoxicity. At the same time, in HT-22 cells exposed to ferroptosis as a result of excessive glutamate accumulation, GIP sustained cell viability by activating the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling pathway. These results suggest that the overexpression of the GIP gene increases cell viability by regulating mechanisms related to cytotoxicity and reactive oxygen species production in hippocampal neuronal cell lines.

AB  - Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is a major flavan-3-ol of green tea polyphenols that exhibits various beneficial health effects, including antioxidant, anti-bacterial, and anti-inflammatory properties. This study aimed to evaluate whether EGCG prevents scopolamine-induced learning and memory impairment in in vivo and ex vivo models. Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were pre-treated with EGCG (5 mg/kg/day; intraperitoneal injection (i.p.)) for 10 days. Then, EGCG and scopolamine (1 mg/kg/day; i.p.) were applied 60 and 30 min before the behavioral tests, respectively, for another 9 days. EGCG alleviated the cognitive deficits in the Y-maze, passive avoidance, and Morris water maze tests. EGCG showed improved cholinergic functions by decreasing acetylcholinesterase activity in hippocampi dissected from the brain of the rats after the behavioral tests. EGCG also reduced oxidative stress, partly due to increased superoxide dismutase activity and decreased malondialdehyde level in the hippocampi of the rat brains after the behavioral tests. Furthermore, EGCG attenuated the scopolamine-induced blockade of long-term potentiation in organotypic hippocampal tissue of seven-day-old SD rats. Taken together, these results suggested that EGCG is a potential therapeutic agent for alleviating cognitive dysfunction.

AB  - Background: Despite accumulating evidence correlating oxidative stress with lupus disease activity, the brain redox pathways are still poorly investigated. Cinnamomum cassia, a widely used spice with powerful antioxidant properties, could be a novel therapeutic candidate in lupus. Methods: C57BL/6J female mice were divided into five groups: sham, sham-cinnamon, lupus, lupus-cinnamon starting from induction, and lupus-cinnamon starting two weeks before induction. Lupus was induced by skin application on the right ear with 1.25 mg of 5% imiquimod cream three times per week for six weeks. Cinnamomum cassia was given orally, five days per week, at 200 mg/kg. Results: Concomitant to TLR7-MYD88 pathway activation, the p-NRF2/NRF2 and p-FOXO3/FOXO3 ratios were increased in the hippocampus and alleviated by cinnamon treatment. BCL-2 positivity was enhanced in hippocampal neurons and reversed only by preventive cinnamon administration. In vitro, exposure of hippocampal cells to the plasma of different groups induced a surge in oxidative stress. This was associated with an increased t-BID/BID ratio. Cinnamon treatment, particularly in the preventive arm, normalized these modifications. Conclusions: Our study shows a neuroprotective effect of cinnamon by rescuing brain redox and apoptosis homeostasis in lupus, paving the way for its use as a natural therapeutic compound in the clinical management of lupus.

AB  - Pyrola corbieri Levl has been used to strengthen bones and nourish the kidney (the kidney governs the bone and is beneficial to the brain) by the local Miao people in China. However, the functional components and neurotrophic activity have not been reported. A new acidic homogeneous heteropolysaccharide named LTC-1 was obtained and characterized by periodate oxidation, Smith degradation, partial acid hydrolysis, GC-MS spectrometry, methylation analysis, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and its molecular weight was 3239 Da. The content of mannuronic acid (Man A) in LTC-1 was 46%, and the neutral sugar was composed of L-rhamnose (L-Rha), L-arabinose (L-Ara), D-xylose (D-Xyl), D-mannose (D-Man), D-glucose (D-Glc) and D-galactose (D-Gal) with a molar ratio of 1.00:3.63:0.86:1.30:6.97:1.30. The main chain of LTC-1 was composed of Glc, Gal, Man, Man A and the branched chain Ara, Glc, Gal. The terminal residues were composed of Glc and Gal. The main chain and branched chains were linked by (1 -> 5)-linked-Ara, (1 -> 3)-linked-Glc, (1 -> 4)-linked-Glc, (1 -> 6)-linked-Glc, (1 -> 3)-linked-Gal, (1 -> 6)-linked-Gal, (1 -> 3, 6)-linked-Man and ManA. Meanwhile, neurotrophic activity was evaluated through PC12 and primary hippocampal neuronal cell models. LTC-1 exhibited neurotrophic activity in a concentration-dependent manner, which significantly induced the differentiation of PC12 cells, promoted the neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells, enhanced the formation of the web architecture of dendrites, and increased the density of dendritic spines in hippocampal neurons and the expression of PSD-95. These results displayed significant neurotrophic factor-like activity of LTC-1, which suggests that LTC-1 is a potential treatment option for neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Liver failure is associated with increased levels of brain aromatic amino acids (AAAs), whose transport across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is mainly mediated by L-amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1). We aimed to investigate whether liver failure induced by bile duct ligation (BDL) increases levels of brain AAAs by affecting the expression and function of LAT1. The LAT1 function was assessed using the brain distribution of gabapentin. It was found that BDL significantly increased levels of gabapentin, phenylalanine, and tryptophan in the cortex, hippocampus, and striatum of rats, and upregulated the expression of total LAT1 protein in hippocampus and striatum as well as cortex membrane LAT1 protein. HCMEC/D3 served as in vitro BBB model, and the data showed that both the serum of BDL rats and bilirubin induced LAT1 expression and function, while bilirubin oxidase almost abolished the upregulation of LAT1 protein by bilirubin and the serum of BDL rats. The enhanced function and expression of LAT1 were also observed in the hippocampus and striatum of hyperbilirubinemia rats. Both aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) antagonist alpha-naphthoflavone and AhR silencing obviously attenuated the upregulation of LAT1 protein by bilirubin or omeprazole. This study provides the first evidence that BDL upregulates LAT1 at the rat BBB, attributed to the activation of AhR by the increased plasma bilirubin. The results highlight the mechanisms causing BDL-increased levels of brain AAAs and their physiological significance.

AB  - The neurotoxic effects of sevoflurane anesthesia on the immature nervous system have aroused public concern, but the specific effects and mechanism remain poorly understood. Pyroptosis caused by the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is pivotal for cell survival and acts as a key player in cognitive impairment. This study was carried out to determine the critical role of the NLRP3 inflammasome and high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) in sevoflurane-induced cognitive impairment. On gestational day 20 (G20), 3% sevoflurane was administered for 4 h to pregnant rats. The hippocampus and cerebral cortex of the offspring were harvested at postnatal day 1 (P1) for Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining. Pregnant rat sevoflurane exposure increased the protein levels of NLRP3, ASC, cleaved-caspase 1 (p20), mature-IL1 ss (m-IL-1 ss), and HMGB1 in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of offspring rats. More microglial cells of offspring were also observed after sevoflurane anesthesia. The Morris water maze (MWM) test was implemented to evaluate cognitive function from postnatal day 30 (P30) to postnatal 35 (P35) of offspring. The sevoflurane-treated offspring took longer than the control rats to find the MWM platform during the learning phase. Furthermore, they had a longer travel distance and less time in the target quadrant than the control rats in the probe trial. Maternal intraperitoneal injection of glycyrrhizin (an inhibitor of HMGB1) attenuated the sevoflurane-induced microglia and NLRP3/ASC inflammasome activation and cognitive impairment of offspring. Simultaneously, the sevoflurane-induced increase in Toll-like receptors (TLR4) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) was significantly reduced by glycyrrhizin. We concluded that the HMGB1 inhibitor may repress the sevoflurane-induced activation of the NLRP3/ASC inflammasome and cognitive dysfunction and that TLR4/NF-kappa B signaling maybe the key pathway, at least in part.

AB  - Olive ridley sea turtles, Lepidochelys olivacea, exhibit a polymorphic reproductive behavior, nesting solitarily or in mass aggregations termed "arribadas", where thousands of individuals nest synchronously. Arribada nesting provides fitness benefits including mate finding during nearshore aggregations and predator satiation at the time of hatching, but it is unknown if such benefits come with a physiological cost. We used plasma metabolite profiling, stable isotope analysis, biochemical and endocrine assays to test whether metabolic parameters differ between nesting modes, and if arribada nesting is associated with increased levels of oxidative damage compared to solitary nesting. Arribada nesters were bigger and had higher circulating thyroid hormone levels than solitary nesters. Similarly, pathways related to phospholipid and amino acid metabolism, catabolic processes, and antioxidant defense were enriched in individuals nesting in arribada. Stable isotope signatures in skin samples showed differences in feeding zones with arribada nesters likely feeding on benthic and potentially more productive grounds. Arribada nesters had increased levels of plasma lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation products compared to solitary nesters. These results suggest that metabolic profiles differ between nesting modes and that oxidative stress is a trade-off for the fitness benefits associated with arribada nesting.

Epidemiological studies have reported adverse pregnancy outcomes with prenatal azithromycin exposure (PAzE). However, the effect of PAzE on fetal hippocampal development is unclear. This study aimed to explore the effects and potential mechanism of PAzE-induced fetal hippocampal development at different doses, courses, and time.Method: Pregnant mice were administered azithromycin by gavage at different doses (50, 100 or 200 mg/kg.d), different courses (gestational day (GD)15-17 for three consecutive days, or GD17 once a day) and different time (GD10-12, GD15-17).Results: Compared with the control group, morphological development damage of the fetal hippocampus was observed in the PAzE group, with a dysbalance in neuronal proliferation and apoptosis, decreased expression of the neuronal-specific marker Snap25, NeuN, PSD95 and Map2, increased expression of the glial-specific marker Iba1, GFAP, and S-100 beta, and decreased expression of P2ry12. The PAzE-induced hippocampal developmental deficiency varied based on different doses, courses, and time, and the developmental toxicity was most significant in the late pregnancy, high dose, multi-course group (AZHT). The significant reduction of SOX2 and Wnt, which were related to regulation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) proliferation in PAzE fetus compared with the control group indicated that the SOX2/Wnt signaling may be involved in PAzE-induced hippocampal developmental toxicity.Conclusion: In this study, PAzE was associated with hippocampal developmental toxicity in a variety of nerve cells. Hippocampal developmental toxicity due to azithromycin was most significant in the late pregnancy, high dose (equivalent to maximum clinical dose) and multi-course group (AZHT). The findings provide an experimental and theoretical foundation for guiding the sensible use of medications during pregnancy and effectively assessing the risk of fetal hippocampal developmental toxicity.

AB  - Ginseng is an important medicinal herb consumed as dietary supplements. Ginsenosides and their metabolites have been reported to enhance cognitive performance, but their underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Brain-type creatine kinase (CK-BB) was previously screened out as one of the potential targets in brain tissues. In vitro, the strongest direct interaction between 20(S)-protopanaxadiol (PPD), a ginsenoside metabolite, and CK-BB was detected using biolayer interferometry (BLI). Drug affinity responsive target stability, cellular thermal shift assay, BLI, and isothermal titration calorimetry were subsequently used, and the binding of PPD to CK-BB was verified. The binding sites of the CK-BB/PPD complex were clarified by molecular docking and site-directed mutagenesis. Enzyme activity assay showed that the binding of PPD to CK-BB in vitro enhanced its activity. In vivo, PPD increased CK-BB activity in D-gal-induced mice. PPD also improved the D-gal-induced cognitive deficits and ameliorated alterations in oxidative stress and hippocampal synaptic plasticity. Therefore, the integration of PPD with its target protein CK-BB may promote CK-BB activity, thereby ameliorating hippocampal synaptic plasticity and cognitive deficits in D-gal-treated mice.

AB  - Autophagy regulates intermittent hypoxia (IH)-induced obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS). We investigated the effects of IH and its withdrawal on cognitive function, autophagy, and lysophagy in OSAHS. An OSAHS rat model was established, and rats were divided into five groups: normoxia control, IH-4w (4-week IH), IH-6w (6-week IH), IH-8w (8-week IH), and IH-8w + 4w (8-week IH and 4-week normoxia). The cognitive behavior; mitochondrial and lysosomal morphology of the hippocampal tissue; mitochondrial respiratory function, permeability, and membrane potential; lysosomal function; autophagy- and lysophagy-related protein levels; and hypoxia-associated autophagy gene expression in rats were assessed. The cognitive function of rats in the IH-4w, IH-6w, and IH-8w groups was significantly impaired. In IH-8w cells, mitochondrial function was damaged with swollen morphology and decreased quantity, respiration, permeability, and membrane potential, along with significantly increased mitophagy-related protein ATG5 and LC3II/LC3 levels and decreased p62 levels. Expression of hypoxia-associated autophagy genes Becn1, Hif1, Bnip3, Bnip3l, and Fundc1 was significantly higher in the IH-8w group. Significantly increased LAMP2, CTSB, and ACP2 levels in IH-8w cells further indicated impaired lysosomal function. Lysophagy-related protein LAMP1, LC3II/LC3I, and TFEB levels were significantly increased in the IH-8w group, whereas p62 level was significantly decreased. The above listed evidence indicated damage to the mitochondria and lysosomes, as well as stimulation of mitophagy and lysophagy in IH-treatment OSAHS rat model. After withdrawing IH and culturing for 4 weeks in normal conditions, the cognitive function of rats improved, and mitophagy and lysophagy decreased. Our findings indicate that IH impairs cognitive function and promotes mitophagy and lysophagy in an OSAHS rat model, and IH withdrawal recovered the above effects.

AB  - Bruxism is a worldwide oral health problem. Although there is a consensus about its multifactorial nature, its precise etiopathogenetic mechanisms are unclear. This study, taking advantage of a deeply characterized cohort of 769 individuals (aged 6-89 years) coming from Northern Italy's genetically isolated populations, aims to epidemiologically describe environmental risk factors for bruxism development and identify genes potentially involved through a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) approach. Logistic mixed models adjusted for age and sex were performed to evaluate associations between bruxism and possible risk factors, e.g., anxiety, smoking, and alcohol and caffeine intake. A case-control GWAS (135 cases, 523 controls), adjusted for age, sex, and anxiety, was conducted to identify new candidate genes. The GTEx data analysis was performed to evaluate the identified gene expression in human body tissues. Statistical analyses determined anxiety as a bruxism risk factor (OR = 2.54; 95% CI: 1.20-5.38; p-value = 0.015), and GWAS highlighted three novel genes potentially associated with bruxism: NLGN1 (topSNP = rs2046718; p-value = 2.63 x 10-7), RIMBP2 (topSNP = rs571497947; p-value = 4.68 x 10-7), and LHFP (topSNP = rs2324342; p-value = 7.47 x 10-6). The GTEx data analysis showed their expression in brain tissues. Overall, this work provided a deeper understanding of bruxism etiopathogenesis with the long-term perspective of developing personalized therapeutic approaches for improving affected individuals' quality of life.

AB  - MOTS-c is a 16-amino acid mitochondrial derivative peptide reported to be involved in regulating insulin and metabolic homeostasis via the AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK). AMPK agonist AICAR has been reported to improve cognition. Previous reports also pointed out that MOTS-c may be effective as a therapeutic option toward the prevention of the aging processes. Therefore, we investigated the roles of MOTS-c in the memory recognition process. The results showed that central MOTS-c not only enhanced object and location recognition memory formation and consolidation but also ameliorated the memory deficit induced by A beta(1-42) or LPS. The memory-ameliorating effects of MOTS-c could be blocked by AMPK inhibitor dorsomorphin. Moreover, MOTS-c treatment significantly increased the phosphorylation of AMPK but not ERK, JNK, and p38 in the hippocampus. The underlying mechanism of MOTS-c neuroprotection may involve inhibiting the activation of astrocytes and microglia and production of proinflammatory cytokines. In addition, we found that peripheral administration of MOTS-c does not cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and plays an effect. In order to improve the brain intake of MOTS-c, we screen out (PRR)(5), a cell penetrating peptides, as a carrier for MOTS-c into the brain. Then in the NOR task, intranasal or intravenous MP (cell-penetrating MOTS-c analogue) showed good memory performance on memory formation, memory consolidation, and memory impairment. Near-infrared fluorescent experiments showed the real-time biodistribution in brain after intranasal or intravenous infusion of MP. These results suggested that MOTS-c might be a new potential target for treatment of cognitive decline in AD.

AB  - Background: As an emerging nanomaterial, nano-alumina is widely used in chemical engineering, food and medicine due to its special physical and chemical properties, and its potential health hazards have attracted attention.Objective: Aim of this study is to understanding the effect and possible mechanism of nano-alumina on cognitive function in mice. Methods: Male healthy ICR mice were randomly assigned and given nasal drops of saline, nano-alumina (different doses) and micro-alumina for 30 days, respectively. Morris water maze test, step down test and open field test were used to detect learning and memory ability. Blood brain permeability was observed by immunofluorescence staining and lanthanum nitrate tracing, histopathological abnormalities in mice hippocampus was observed by thionine staining, the final determination of oxidative stress level in brain tissue was measured by using oxidative stress index detection kit and the level of LC3-II and Caspase-3, 8, 9 proteins were detected by western blot. Results: In the cerebral cortex of mice exposed to nano-alumina particles, lanthanum nitrate particles adhered to vascular endothelial cells, and the expression of ZO-1 and Occuldin decreased and morphology was disordered; most neurons in hippocampus CA3 region showed balloon-like swelling and degeneration, nucleoli disappeared and apical dendrites broke; mice exposed to nano-alumina, the escape latency in Morris water maze increased compared with the control group(P < 0.05),and the residence time in the original platform quadrant shortened significantly(P < 0.05);the platform latency was significantly shortened and the number of errors increased in the step down test compared with the control group; the residence time in the center of mice the nano-alumina treated was significantly increased in open field test (P < 0.05).Conclusion: The nano-alumina particles could be transported into the central nervous system via blood-brain barrier and olfactory bulb, impair learning and memory function in mice, which is more serious than the micro-alumina particles. The apoptosis of mice neurons caused by nano-alumina particles maybe due to the mixed neurotoxic effect of oxidative stress and the elemental toxicity of aluminum itself.

AB  - Background: Potential protection against the neurotoxic damages of high levels of fluoride on rats and SH-SY5Y cells by extract of Ginkgo biloba leaves, as well as underlying mechanisms, were examined. Methods: The rats were divided randomly into 4 groups, i.e., control, treatment with the extract (100 mg/kg body weight, gavage once daily), treatment with fluoride (50 ppm F- in drinking water) and combined treatment with both; SH-SY5Y cells exposed to fluoride and fluoride in combination with the extract or 4-Amino-1,8-naphthalimide (4-ANI), an inhibitor of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1). Spatial learning and memory in the rats were assessed employing Morris water maze test; the contents of fluoride in brains and urine by fluoride ionselective electrode; cytotoxicity of fluoride was by CCK-8 kit; the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and the content of malondialdehyde (MDA) by appropriate kits; the level of 8hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) was by ELISA; the content of ROS and frequency of apoptosis by flow cytometry; the expressions of phospho-histone H2A.X(Ser139), PARP-1, poly (ADP-ribose) (PAR) and Sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) by Western blotting or immunofluorescence. Results: The rats with prolong treatment of fluoride exhibited dental fluorosis, the increased contents of fluoride in brains and urine and the declined ability of learning and memory. In the hippocampus of the rats and SH-SY5Y cells exposed to fluoride, the levels of ROS, MDA, apoptosis, 8-OHdG and the protein expressions of histone H2A. X(Ser139), PARP-1 and PAR were all elevated; the activities of SOD and GSH-Px and the protein expression of SIRT1 reduced. Interestingly, the treatment of Ginkgo biloba extract attenuated these neurotoxic effects on rats and SH-SY5Y cells exposed to fluoride and the treatment of 4-ANI produced a neuroprotective effect against fluoride exposure.Conclusion: Ginkgo biloba extract attenuated neurotoxic damages induced by fluoride exposure to rats and SHSY5Y cells and the underlying mechanism might involve the inhibition of PARP-1 and the promotion of SIRT1.

AB  - Gyrophoric acid (GA), a lichen secondary metabolite, has attracted more attention during the last years because of its potential biological effects. Until now, its effect in vivo has not yet been demonstrated. The aim of our study was to evaluate the basic physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties of GA, which are directly associated with its biological activities. The stability of the GA in various pH was assessed by conducting repeated UV-VIS spectral measurements. Microsomal stability in rat liver microsomes was performed using Ultra-Performance LC/MS. Binding to human serum albumin (HSA) was assessed using synchronous fluorescence spectra, and molecular docking analysis was used to reveal the binding site of GA to HSA. In the in vivo experiment, 24 Sprague-Dawley rats (Velaz, Unetice, Czech Republic) were used. The animals were divided as follows. The first group (n = 6) included healthy males as control intact rats (male INT), and the second group (n = 6) included healthy females as controls (female INT). Groups three and four (male GA/n = 6 and female GA/n = 6) consisted of animals with daily administered GA (10 mg/kg body weight) in an ethanol-water solution per os for a one-month period. We found that GA remained stable under various pH and temperature conditions. It bonded to human serum albumin with the binding constant 1.788 x 10(6) dm(3)mol(-1) to reach the target tissue via this mechanism. In vivo, GA did not influence body mass gain, food, or fluid intake during the experiment. No liver toxicity was observed. However, GA increased the rearing frequency in behavioral tests (p < 0.01) and center crossings in the elevated plus-maze (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively). In addition, the time spent in the open arm was prolonged (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively). Notably, GA was able to pass through the blood-brain barrier, indicating its ability to permeate into the brain and to stimulate neurogenesis in the hilus and subgranular zone of the hippocampus. These observations highlight the potential role of GA in influencing brain function and neurogenesis.

AB  - BackgroundSchizophrenia is a mental disorder that causes considerable morbidity, whose risk largely results from genetic factors. Setd1a is a gene implicated in schizophrenia.ObjectiveTo study the gene expression changes found in heterozygous Setd1a +/- knockout mice in order to gain useful insight into schizophrenia pathogenesis.MethodsWe mined a single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) dataset from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and striatum of Setd1a +/- mice and identified cell type-specific differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differential transcript usage (DTU). DEGs and genes containing DTU found in each cell type were used to identify affected biological pathways using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA).ResultsWe identified 273 unique DEGs across all cell types in PFC and 675 unique gene peaks containing DTU. In striatum, we identified 327 unique DEGs across all cell types and 8 unique gene peaks containing DTU. Key IPA findings from the analysis of DEGs found in PFC and striatum implicate processes involved in protein synthesis, mitochondrial function, cell metabolism, and inflammation. IPA analysis of genes containing DTU in PFC points to protein synthesis, as well as cellular activities involving intracellular signaling and neurotransmission. One canonical pathway, 'EIF2 Signaling', which is involved in the regulation of protein synthesis, was detected in PFC DEGs, striatum DEGs, and PFC genes containing DTU, drawing attention to its importance in schizophrenia pathophysiology.ConclusionProcesses involving protein synthesis in general and the 'EIF2 Signaling' pathway in particular could be targets for the development of new research strategies and biomarkers in schizophrenia.

AB  - The cognitive dysfunction caused by prediabetes causes great difficulties in human life, and the terrible thing is that the means to prevent the occurrence of this disease are very limited at present, Berberine has shown the potential to treat diabetes and cognitive dysfunction, but it still needs to be further explored to clarify the mechanism of its therapeutic effect. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects and mechanisms of Berberine on prediabetes-induced cognitive dysfunction. Prediabetes rat model was induced by a high-fat diet and a normal diet was used as a control. They were fed for 20 weeks. At week 13, the model rats were given 100 mg/kg Berberine by gavage for 7 weeks. The cognitive function of rats was observed. At the same time, OGTT, fasting blood glucose, blood lipids, insulin and other metabolic parameters, oxidative stress, and apoptosis levels were measured. The results showed that the model rats showed obvious glucose intolerance, elevated blood lipids, and insulin resistance, and the levels of oxidative stress and apoptosis were significantly increased. However, after the administration of Berberine, the blood glucose and lipid metabolism of prediabetic rats were significantly improved, and the oxidative stress level and apoptosis level of hippocampal tissue were significantly reduced. In conclusion, Berberine can alleviate the further development of diabetes in prediabetic rats, reduce oxidative stress and apoptosis in hippocampal tissue, and improve cognitive impairment in prediabetic rats.

At week 13, the model rats were given 100 mg/kg Berberine by gavage for 7 weeks. OGTT, fasting blood glucose, blood lipid, insulin level, and insulin resistance index were measured in each group. The cognitive function of rats was observed by a water maze test and new object recognition experiment. At the same time, the level of oxidative stress in hippocampal tissues was observed, the apoptosis level of hippocampal cells was detected by TUNEL staining, and the expression of apoptosis-related proteins (Bax and Bcl2) was observed by western blot. Our results suggest that Berberine can alleviate the further development of diabetes in prediabetic rats while reducing oxidative stress and apoptosis in hippocampal tissue and improving cognitive impairment in prediabetic rats.image

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor and non-motor symptoms. Impairment of the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) and autophagy has been suggested to contribute to alpha-synuclein accumulation, which is identified as the pathological hallmark of PD. Recently, alteration in histone3 acetylation has also been found to be correlated to PD. Interestingly, the histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) enzyme, which regulates the acetylation of histone-3, was shown to be involved in autophagy. Venlafaxine is an antidepressant that was proposed to inhibit HDAC expression in depressive rats' hippocampi. In this study, we aimed to examine the ability of venlafaxine to inhibit striatal HDAC6 and to enhance alpha-synuclein clearance through the activation of the UPS and autophagy, in addition to treating depression, which is the most debilitating non-motor symptom, in a rotenone model of PD. Venlafaxine administration was noted to decrease alpha-synuclein accumulation and preserve dopaminergic neurons along with restoration of striatal dopamine levels and motor recovery. Its administration augmented the UPS and autophagic markers (beclin-1, p62, and LC3) with consequent modulation of apoptotic indicators (Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, cytochrome c, and caspase-3). Additionally, venlafaxine inhibited HDAC6 with further enhancement of autophagy and restoration of histone-3 acetylation with subsequent increases in survival gene expressions (Bcl-2 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor). Chloroquine (autophagy inhibitor) was used to indicate the proposed pathway. Moreover, venlafaxine hampered depressive symptoms and improved hippocampal noradrenaline and serotonin levels. Collectively, venlafaxine is suggested to display neuroprotective effects with improvement of motor and non-motor PD symptoms.

AB  - Angelica gigas Nakai root contains decursin which exerts beneficial properties such as anti-amnesic and anti-inflammatory activities. Until now, however, the neuroprotective effects of decursin against transient ischemic injury in the forebrain have been insufficiently investigated. Here, we revealed that post-treatment with decursin and the root extract saved pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus following transient ischemia for 5 min in gerbil forebrain. Through high-performance liquid chromatography, we defined that decursin was contained in the extract as 7.3 +/- 0.2%. Based on this, we post-treated with 350 mg/kg of extract, which is the corresponding dosage of 25 mg/kg of decursin that exerted neuroprotection in gerbil hippocampus against the ischemia. In addition, behavioral tests were conducted to evaluate ischemia-induced dysfunctions via tests of spatial memory (by the 8-arm radial maze test) and learning memory (by the passive avoidance test), and post-treatment with the extract and decursin attenuated ischemia-induced memory impairments. Furthermore, we carried out histochemistry, immunohistochemistry, and double immunohistofluorescence. Pyramidal neurons located in the subfield cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) among the hippocampal subfields were dead at 5 days after the ischemia; however, treatment with the extract and decursin saved the pyramidal neurons after ischemia. Immunoglobulin G (IgG, an indicator of extravasation), which is not found in the parenchyma in normal brain tissue, was apparently shown in CA1 parenchyma from 2 days after the ischemia, but IgG leakage was dramatically attenuated in the CA1 parenchyma treated with the extract and decursin. Furthermore, astrocyte endfeet, which are a component of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), were severely damaged at 5 days after the ischemia; however, post-treatment with the extract and decursin dramatically attenuated the damage of the endfeet. In brief, therapeutic treatment of the extract of Angelica gigas Nakai root and decursin after 5 min transient forebrain ischemia protected hippocampal neurons from the ischemia, showing that ischemia-induced BBB leakage and damage of astrocyte endfeet was significantly attenuated by the extract and decursin. Based on these findings, we suggest that Angelica gigas Nakai root containing decursin can be employed as a pharmaceutical composition to develop a therapeutic strategy for brain ischemic injury.

AB  - Hypocretin/Orexin (HCRT/OX) and dopamine (DA) are both key effectors of salience processing, reward and stress-related behaviors and motivational states, yet their respective roles and interactions are poorly delineated. We inactivated HCRT-to-DA connectivity by genetic disruption of Hypocretin receptor-1 (Hcrtr1), Hypocretin receptor-2 (Hcrtr2), or both receptors (Hcrtr1&2) in DA neurons and analyzed the consequences on vigilance states, brain oscillations and cognitive performance in freely behaving mice. Unexpectedly, loss of Hcrtr2, but not Hcrtr1 or Hcrtr1&2, induced a dramatic increase in theta (7-11 Hz) electroencephalographic (EEG) activity in both wakefulness and rapid-eye-movement sleep (REMS). DAHcrtr2-deficient mice spent more time in an active (or theta activity-enriched) substate of wakefulness, and exhibited prolonged REMS. Additionally, both wake and REMS displayed enhanced theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling. The baseline waking EEG of DAHcrtr2-deficient mice exhibited diminished infra-theta, but increased theta power, two hallmarks of EEG hyperarousal, that were however uncoupled from locomotor activity. Upon exposure to novel, either rewarding or stress-inducing environments, DAHcrtr2-deficient mice featured more pronounced waking theta and fast-gamma (52-80 Hz) EEG activity surges compared to littermate controls, further suggesting increased alertness. Cognitive performance was evaluated in an operant conditioning paradigm, which revealed that DAHcrtr2-ablated mice manifest faster task acquisition and higher choice accuracy under increasingly demanding task contingencies. However, the mice concurrently displayed maladaptive patterns of reward-seeking, with behavioral indices of enhanced impulsivity and compulsivity. None of the EEG changes observed in DAHcrtr2-deficient mice were seen in DAHcrtr1-ablated mice, which tended to show opposite EEG phenotypes. Our findings establish a clear genetically-defined link between monosynaptic HCRT-to-DA neurotransmission and theta oscillations, with a differential and novel role of HCRTR2 in theta-gamma cross-frequency coupling, attentional processes, and executive functions, relevant to disorders including narcolepsy, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and Parkinson's disease.

AB  - The anti-convulsant mechanisms and neuroprotective effects of Mucuna pruriens (MP) seed in male BALB/c mice were evaluated. Ninety mice were kindled with picrotoxin, strychnine, or pilocarpine hydrochloride at the 30th minute of intraperitoneal injection (i.p) of normal saline (0.2 ml), MP (200, 100, 50 mg/kg), diazepam (7.5 mg/ kg), or haloperidol (5 mg/kg). The onset of convulsion and percentage mortality was recorded. The histoarchitectural and immunohistochemical profiles of the brains were determined. Data were expressed as mean & PLUSMN; SEM with a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), while p < 0.05 was considered significant. There was a significant prolongation of the latency to first seizure across the treatment groups following picrotoxin, and pilocarpine-induced convulsion; a decrease in percentage mortality in the MP (50 mg/kg) treatment group, and an increase in the hippocampal nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 count, and Neu-N expression in the MP (200 mg/kg, and 100 mg/kg) treated mice. Treatment with MP seed may abolish seizure occurrence and consequential mortality; mechanisms traceable to its GABAergic expression and hippocampal NRF 2 and Neu N expression.

AB  - The aim of this study was to analyze the efficacy and underlying mechanism of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell exosome (ADSC-exosomes)-mediated protection on methotrexate (MTX)-induced neuronal damage. We established a H2O2-induced oxidative stress model in vitro, as well as an MTX-induced neuronal damage rat model in vivo. We analyzed the effects of ADSC-exosomes on neuronal damage and Nrf2-ARE signaling pathway in rats and related mechanisms. The morphological and functional recovery of rat hippocampal neurons by ADSC-exosomes was examined by Nissl staining and modified neurological severity score (mNSS) score. The activation of Nrf2-ARE pathway effectively inhibited H2O2-induced oxidative stress. ADSC-exosomes treatment restored the activity of hippocampal neuronal cells, reduced ROS production, and inhibited hippocampal neuronal cells apoptosis. In in vivo experiments, ADSC-exosomes ameliorates MTX-induced hippocampal neuron damage by triggering Nrf2-ARE pathway, decreasing IL-6, IFN-, and TNF-a levels and TUNEL positive cells in hippocampus, and repairing hippocampal neuronal cell damage. ADSC-exosomes ameliorated MTX-induced neuronal damage and suppressed oxidative stress induced by neuronal damage through the activation of Nrf2-ARE signaling pathway.

AB  - Brain mitochondrial dysfunction and reduced testosterone levels are common features of aging in men. Although evidence suggests that the two phenomena are interrelated, it is unclear whether testosterone supplementation ameliorates mitochondrial dysfunction in the aging male brain. Here, we show that testosterone supplementation significantly alleviates exploratory behavioral deficits and oxidative damage in the substantia nigra and hippocampus of aging male rats. These effects were consistent with improved mitochondrial function, reflected by testosterone-induced increases in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), antioxidant enzyme (GSH-PX, catalase, and Mn-SOD) expression/activity, and mitochondrial respiratory complex activities in both brain regions. Furthermore, elevated PGC-1 alpha, NRF-1, and TFAM expression (suggestive of enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis), increased citrate synthase activity, mtDNA copy number, and ND1, COX1, and ATP6 expression (indicative of increased mitochondrial content), as well as increased PINK1/Parkin and decreased P62 expression (suggesting mitophagy activation), were detected in the substantial nigra and hippocampus of aged male rats after testosterone supplementation. These findings suggest that testosterone supplementation may be a viable approach to ameliorating brain mitochondrial dysfunction and thus prevent or treat cognitive-behavioral deficits and neurodegenerative conditions associated with aging.

AB  - Senescent cells are responsible, in part, for tissue decline during aging. Here, we focused on CNS neural precursor cells (NPCs) to ask if this is because senescent cells in stem cell niches impair precursor-mediated tissue maintenance. We demonstrate an aging-dependent accumulation of senescent cells, largely senescent NPCs, within the hippocampal stem cell niche coincident with declining adult neurogenesis. Pharmacological ablation of senescent cells via acute systemic administration of the senolytic drug ABT-263 (Navitoclax) caused a rapid increase in NPC proliferation and neurogenesis. Genetic ablation of senescent cells similarly activated hippocampal NPCs. This acute burst of neurogenesis had long-term effects in middle-aged mice. One month post-ABT-263, adult-born hippocampal neuron numbers increased and hippocampus-dependent spatial memory was enhanced. These data support a model where senescent niche cells negatively influence neighboring non-senescent NPCs during aging, and ablation of these senescent cells partially restores neurogenesis and hippocampus-dependent cognition.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to identify the therapeutic effect of electroacupuncture (EA) on cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury, and to clarify the regulatory mechanism related to telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT)-mediated telomerase activity. A Middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) animal model was constructed and rats were treated by EA invention at the Baihui (GV20) and Fengchi (GB20) acupoints. Neurological deficits were assessed via rotarod test and Morris water maze test. 2,3,5-Triphenyltertrazolium chloride (TTC) staining was performed to evaluate infarct volume. Histological changes were observed under H&E staining and Nissl staining. TERT expression was examined using qRT-PCR and western blot. Telomerase activity was assessed with TRAP method. Neuron apoptosis and senescence were assessed by TUNEL and immunofluorescence assays. Inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress-indicators were examined using commercial kits. EA intervention at both GV20 and GB20 acupoints reduced infarct volumes (2.48 +/- 1.89 vs. 29.56 +/- 2.55), elevated the telomerase activity (0.84 +/- 0.08 vs. 0.34 +/- 0.09), and upregulated the levels of total TERT protein (0.61 +/- 0.09 vs. 0.21 +/- 0.05) and mitochondrial TERT (Mito-TERT; 0.54 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.27 +/- 0.03) in hippocampus tissues of MCAO/R rats. EA intervention attenuated motor dysfunction (112.00 +/- 6.69 vs. 30.02 +/- 2.60) and improved spatial learning (23.87 +/- 1.90 vs. 16.23 +/- 1.45) and memory ability (8.38 +/- 1.06 vs. 4.13 +/- 1.13) of rats with cerebral I/R injury. In addition, EA intervention significantly attenuated histopathological changes of injured neurons, mitigated neuron apoptosis (32.27 +/- 5.52 vs. 65.83 +/- 4.31) and senescence in MCAO/R rats, as well as inhibited excessive production of inflammatory cytokines and attenuated oxidative stress. However, the above therapeutic efficiency of EA intervention in MCAO/R rats was partly eliminated by TERT knockdown. EA intervention at GB20 and GV20 acupoints exerted a protective role in cerebral I/R injury partly through restoring TERT function, implying the clinical potential of EA treatment in the treatment of ischemic stroke.

AB  - With overall five-year survival rate less than 10%, pancreatic cancer (PC) represents the most lethal one in all human cancers. Given that the incidence of PC is still increasing, and current cancer treatment strategies are often inefficacious, its therapy is still a huge challenge. Here, we first revealed ovarian serous carcinoma is mostly anti-correlated with pancreatic cancer in gene expression signatures. Based on this observation, we proposed that ovarian cancer cells could defend PC. To confirm this strategy, we first showed that ovarian cancer cell SKOV3 can significantly inhibit the proliferation of pancreatic cancer cell SW1990 when they were co-cultured. We further validated this strategy by an animal model of pancreatic cancer xenografts. The result showed that the injection of SKOV3 significantly inhibits pancreatic cancer xenografts. Moreover, we found that SKOV3 with transgenic African elephant TP53 gene further enhances the therapeutic effect. RNA-sequencing analysis revealed that the ovarian cancer cell treatment strikingly induced changes of genes being involved in pancreas function and phenotype (e.g. enhancing pancreas function, pancreas regeneration, and cell adhesion) but not immune and inflammation-related functions, suggesting that the proposed strategy is different from immunotherapy and could be a novel strategy for cancer treatment.

AB  - Bladder cancer (BlC) is the fourth most common cancer in males worldwide, but few systemic chemotherapy options for its effective treatment exist. The development of new molecularly-targeted agents against BlC is therefore an urgent issue. The Hippo signaling pathway, with its upstream LATS kinases and downstream transcriptional co-activators YAP1 and TAZ, plays a pivotal role in diverse cell functions, including cell proliferation. Recent studies have shown that overexpression of YAP1 occurs in advanced BlCs and is associated with poor patient prognosis. Accessing data from our previous screening of a chemical library of compounds targeting the Hippo pathway, we identified DMPCA (N-(3,4-dimethoxyphenethyl)-6-methyl-2,3,4,9-tetrahydro-1H-carbazol-1-amine) as an agent able to induce the phosphorylation of LATS1 and YAP1/TAZ in BlC cells, thereby suppressing their viability both in vitro and in mouse xenografts. Our data indicate that DMPCA has a potent anti-tumor effect, and raise the possibility that this agent may represent a new and effective therapeutic option for BlC.

AB  - This study explored the role of succinate accumulation in the oxidative stress and iron accumulation in both pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced epileptogenesis and kainic acid (KA)-induced status epilepticus (SE). The levels of succinate, oxidative stress, iron content, iron-related protein expression, and the severity of neuronal injury and seizures were measured in both models. We found that increased concentrations of succinate were associated with increased levels of oxidative stress, iron content, iron regulator protein, and iron importer divalent metal transporter 1, as well as decreased levels of iron exporter ferropotin 1. Aggravated neuronal injury was observed in the hippocampi and cortices of both models. The cell-permeable molecule dimethyl malonate (DM), a competitive inhibitor of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), significantly attenuated succinate accumulation, reduced the oxidative stress and iron levels, and mitigated the severity of the seizures and neuronal injury. Our results thus indicate that the accumulation of succinate due to the reverse catalysis of SDH may exacerbate oxidative stress and thus induce iron accumulation and neuronal injury in both models. Targeting succinate accumulation may achieve neuroprotective and anti-seizure effects.

AB  - Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a severe neurological complication after anesthesia and surgery. However, there is still a lack of effective clinical pharmacotherapy due to its unclear pathogenesis. Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), which is obtained from honeybee propolis and medicinal plants, shows powerful antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulating properties. In this study, we aimed to evaluate whether CAPE mitigated cognitive impairment following anesthesia and surgery and its potential underlying mechanisms in aged mice. Here, isoflurane anesthesia and tibial fracture surgery were used as the POCD model, and H2O2-induced BV2 cells were established as the microglial oxidative stress model. We revealed that CAPE pretreatment suppressed oxidative stress and promoted the switch of microglia from the M1 to the M2 type in the hippocampus, thereby ameliorating cognitive impairment caused by anesthesia and surgery. Further investigation indicated that CAPE pretreatment upregulated hippocampal Sirt6/Nrf2 expression after anesthesia and surgery. Moreover, mechanistic studies in BV2 cells demonstrated that the potent effects of CAPE pretreatment on reducing ROS generation and promoting protective polarization were attenuated by a specific Sirt6 inhibitor, OSS_128167. In summary, our findings opened a promising avenue for POCD prevention through CAPE pretreatment that enhanced the Sirt6/Nrf2 pathway to suppress oxidative stress as well as favor microglia protective polarization.

AB  - Exercise has the unique aptitude to benefit overall health of body and brain. Evidence indicates that the effects of exercise can be saved in the epigenome for considerable time to elevate the threshold for various diseases. The action of exercise on epigenetic regulation seems central to building an "epigenetic memory" to influence longterm brain function and behavior. As an intrinsic bioenergetic process, exercise engages the function of the mitochondria and redox pathways to impinge upon molecular mechanisms that regulate synaptic plasticity and learning and memory. We discuss how the action of exercise uses mechanisms of bioenergetics to support a "epigenetic memory" with long-term implications for neural and behavioral plasticity. This information is crucial for directing the power of exercise to reduce the burden of neurological and psychiatric disorders.

AB  - Mechanisms underlying the growth and survival of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells positive for activating mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor gene (EGFR) have remained unclear. We here examined the functional relation between such mutant forms of EGFR and Yes-associated protein (YAP), a transcriptional coactivator of the Hippo signaling pathway that regulates cell proliferation and survival. Under the condition of serum deprivation, epidermal growth factor (EGF) induced activation of YAP in NSCLC cell lines positive for mutated EGFR but not in those wild type (WT) for EGFR. Similar EGF-induced activation of YAP was apparent in A549 lung cancer cells forcibly expressing mutant EGFR but not in those overexpressing the WT receptor. Furthermore, EGF induced apoptotic cell death in serum-deprived A549 cells overexpressing the WT form of EGFR but not in those expressing mutant EGFR, and knockdown of YAP rendered the latter cells sensitive to this effect of EGF. Our results thus suggest that activation of YAP mediates resistance of EGFR-mutated NSCLC cells to EGF-induced apoptosis and thereby contributes specifically to the survival of such cells.

AB  - Anthocyanin-rich foods, such as berries, reportedly ameliorate age-related cognitive deficits in both animals and humans. Despite this, investigation into the mechanisms which underpin anthocyanin-mediated learning and memory benefits remains relatively limited. The present study investigates the effects of anthocyanin intake on a spatial working memory paradigm, assessed via the cross-maze apparatus, and relates behavioural test performance to underlying molecular mechanisms. Six-week supplementation with pure anthocyanins (2% w/w), administered throughout the learning phase of the task, improved both spatial and psychomotor performances in aged rats. Behavioural outputs were accompanied by changes in the expression profile of key proteins integral to synaptic function/maintenance, with upregulation of dystrophin, protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) and tyrosine hydroxylase, and downregulation of apoptotic proteins B-cell lymphoma-extra-large (Bcl-xL) and the phosphorylated rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma (p-Raf). Separate immunoblot analysis supported these observations, indicating increased activation of extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK1), Akt Ser473, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) Ser2448, activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc/Arg 3.1) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in response to anthocyanin treatment, whilst alpha-E-catenin, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK1) and p38 protein levels decreased. Together, these findings suggest that purified anthocyanin consumption enhances spatial learning and motor coordination in aged animals and can be attributed to the modulation of key synaptic proteins, which support integrity and maintenance of synaptic function.

AB  - Background: Mitochondria have emerged as a promising target for ischemic disease. A previous study reported the application of mitochondrial transplantation in focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury, but it is unclear whether exogenous mitochondrial transplantation could be a therapeutic strategy for global ischemia/reperfusion injury induced by cardiac arrest. Methods: We hypothesized that transplantation of autologous mitochondria would rescue hippocampal cells and alleviate neurological impairment after cardiac arrest. In this study, we employed a rat cardiac arrest-global cerebral ischemia injury model (CA-GCII) and transplanted isolated mitochondria intravenously. Behavior test was applied to assess neurological deficit. Apoptosis and mitochondria permeability transition pore opening in hippocampus was determined using immunoblotting and swelling assay, respectively. Results: Transplanted mitochondria distributed throughout hippocampal cells and reduced oxidative stress. An improved neurological outcome was observed in rats receiving autologous mitochondria. In the hippocampus, mitophagy was enhanced while cell apoptosis was induced by ischemia/reperfusion insult was downregulated by mitochondrial transplantation. Mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) opening in surviving hippocampal cells was also suppressed. Conclusions: These results indicated that transplantation of autologous mitochondria rescued hippocampal cells from ischemia/reperfusion injury and ameliorated neurological impairment caused by cardiac arrest.

AB  - Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), a highly malignant tumor that arises in peripheral nerve tissues, is known to be highly resistant to radiation and chemotherapy. Although there are several reports on genetic mutations and epigenetic changes that define the pathogenesis of MPNST, there is insufficient information regarding the microenvironment that contributes to the malignancy of MPNST. In the present study, we demonstrate that adrenaline increases the cancer stem cell population in MPNST. This effect is mediated by adrenaline stimulation of beta-2 adrenergic receptor (ADRB2), which activates the Hippo transducer, YAP/TAZ. Inhibition and RNAi experiments revealed that inhibition of ADRB2 attenuated the adrenaline-triggered activity of YAP/TAZ and subsequently attenuated MPNST cells stemness. Furthermore, ADRB2-YAP/TAZ axis was confirmed in the MPNST patients' specimens. The prognosis of patients with high levels of ADRB2 was found to be significantly worse. These data show that adrenaline exacerbates MPNST prognosis and may aid the development of new treatment strategies for MPNST.

AB  - We report the design, synthesis, and validation of the novel compound photocaged N-6-cyclopentyladenosine (cCPA) to achieve precisely localized and timed release of the parent adenosine A1 receptor agonist CPA using 405 nm light. G(i) protein-coupled A(1) receptors (A(1)Rs) modulate neurotransmission via pre- and post-synaptic routes. The dynamics of the CPA-mediated effect on neurotransmission, characterized by fast activation and slow recovery, make it possible to implement a closed-loop control paradigm. The strength of neurotransmission is monitored as the amplitude of stimulus-evoked local field potentials. It is used for feedback control of light to release CPA. This system makes it possible to regulate neurotransmission to a pre-defined level in acute hippocampal brain slices incubated with 3 mu M cCPA. This novel approach of closed-loop photopharmacology holds therapeutic potential for fine-tuned control of neurotransmission in diseases associated with neuronal hyperexcitability.

AB  - Chronological aging is commonly accompanied by chronic low-grade inflammation (or "inflammaging"), a contributor to the development of age-related chronic diseases. Aging increases oxidative stress that accelerates telomere shortening, leading to cell senescence and the generation of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) that exacerbates inflammation. Dietary antioxidants may help protect telomeres and attenuate inflammation. Thyme essential oil (TEO), reported for its potency against neuroinflammation, was fed to chronologically aged C57BL/6J mice for 24 weeks. The TEO diet showed notable impacts on the hippocampus, indicated by lower expression of the aging-related gene p16(INK4A) (p = 0.0783) and significantly lower expression of cyclin D kinase Cdk4 and Cdk6 (p < 0.05) compared to the age-matched control mice. The TEO group also showed significantly lower gene expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine Il6 (p < 0.05) in the hippocampus and lower Il1b expression in the liver and cerebellum (p < 0.05). In vitro experiments conducted on NIH-3T3 cells expressing SASP revealed the dose-dependent anti-inflammatory activity of TEO. Remarkably, TEO diet-fed mice showed higher survival rates and significantly longer blood telomere lengths than the control mice. Monoterpene antioxidants in TEO, particularly thymol and p-cymene, may primarily contribute to the anti-inflammatory and telomere-protecting activities of TEO.

AB  - Adjuvants are crucial components of vaccines. Nevertheless, they are frequently considered as mere "excipients", and their mode of action is often poorly understood. Although the attractiveness of mRNA as an immunogen has been recognized already more than thirty years ago, it wasn't until the current COVID-19 crisis that its full potential was shown. From a fringe approach, it has now become a leading technology in vaccine development which will no doubt result in a tremendous boost in both prophylactic and therapeutic vaccination settings. The issue of finding the right adjuvant is especially relevant for mRNA-based vaccines, as mRNA itself is a strong activator of innate immune responses which represents a double-edged sword. Moreover, given the high sensitivity of RNA to ambient RNases, and to improve delivery efficiency, in recent years, a lot of effort has been invested in developing ways to package the mRNA in so-called nanoparticle formulations. Currently approved mRNA-based vaccines are all formulated in lipid nanoparticles, but many other approaches are being explored, each of which will result in a different type of immune stimulation. In this chapter, we want to provide an overview of the potential adjuvant effect of different types of nanoparticles and implications for vaccine development.

AB  - High ethanol consumption triggers neuroinflammation, implicated in sustaining chronic alcohol use. This inflammation boosts glutamate, prompting dopamine release in reward centers, driving prolonged drinking and relapse. Fibrate drugs, activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-& alpha;), counteract neuroinflammation in other contexts, prompting investigation into their impact on ethanol-induced inflammation. Here, we studied, in UChB drinker rats, whether the administration of fenofibrate in the withdrawal stage after chronic ethanol consumption reduces voluntary intake when alcohol is offered again to the animals (relapse-type drinking). Furthermore, we determined if fenofibrate was able to decrease ethanol-induced neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in the brain. Animals treated with fenofibrate decreased alcohol consumption by 80% during post-abstinence relapse. Furthermore, fenofibrate decreased the expression of the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-& alpha;) and interleukins IL-1 & beta; and IL-6, and of an oxidative stress-induced gene (heme oxygenase-1), in the hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, and prefrontal cortex. Animals treated with fenofibrate showed an increase M2-type microglia (with anti-inflammatory proprieties) and a decrease in phagocytic microglia in the hippocampus. A PPAR-& alpha; antagonist (GW6471) abrogated the effects of fenofibrate, indicating that they are dependent on PPAR-& alpha; activation. These findings highlight the potential of fenofibrate, an FDA-approved dyslipidemia medication, as a supplementary approach to alleviating relapse severity in individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD) during withdrawal.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease, associated with progressive cognitive impairment and memory loss. In the present study, we examined the protective effects of paeoniflorin against memory loss and cognitive decline in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mice. Treatment with paeoniflorin alleviated LPS-induced neurobehavioral dysfunction, as confirmed by behavioral tests, including the T-maze test, novel-object recognition test, and Morris water maze test. LPS stimulated the amyloidogenic pathway-related proteins (amyloid precursor protein, APP; beta-site APP cleavage enzyme, BACE; presenilin1, PS1; presenilin2, PS2) expression in the brain. However, paeoniflorin decreased APP, BACE, PS1, and PS2 protein levels. Therefore, paeoniflorin reverses LPS-induced cognitive impairment via inhibition of the amyloidogenic pathway in mice, which suggests that paeoniflorin may be useful in the prevention of neuroinflammation related to AD.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes is associated with a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Activation of glial cells, such as microglia and astrocytes, is crucial for the development of neuroinflammation in both diabetes and AD. The role of amyloid-beta oligomer (APO) in the hippocampus of diabetic mice has been investigated; however, the effect of galectin-3 and lipocalin-2 (LCN2) on amyloid toxicity-related glial activation in diabetic mice is not known. To fill this knowledge gap, we fed mice a high-fat diet (HFD) for 20 weeks to induce a diabetic state and then injected the hippocampus with APO. Sholl analysis of iba-1-positive microglia showed retraction of microglial ramifications in the hippocampus of HFD-fed diabetic mice. APO treatment caused more retraction of microglial process in HFD-fed mice. In particular, microglial galectin-3 levels and astrocytic LCN2 levels were increased in the hippocampus of HFD-fed mice with APO treatment. These findings suggest that galectin-3 and LCN2 are involved in amyloid toxicity mechanisms, especially glial activation under diabetic conditions. (c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: This study aimed to identify the better arc configuration of volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) for high-grade glioma and glioblastoma, focusing on a dose reduction to the hypothalamic-pituitary axis through an analysis of dose-volumetric parameters, as well as a correlation analysis between the planned target volume (PTV) to organs at risk (OAR) distance and the radiation dose. Method: Twenty-four patients with 9 high-grade glioma and 15 glioblastomas were included in this study. Identical CT, MRI and structure sets of each patient were used for coplanar VMAT (CO-VMAT), dual planar VMAT (DP-VMAT) and multi-planar VMAT (MP-VMAT) planning. The dose constraints adhered to the RTOG0825 and RTOG9006 protocols. The dose-volumetric parameters of each plan were collected for statistical analysis. Correlation analyses were performed between radiation dose and PTV-OARs distance. Results: The DP-VMAT and MP-VMAT achieved a significant dose reduction to most nearby OARs when compared to CO-VMAT, without compromising the dose to PTV, plan homogeneity and conformity. For centrally located OARs, including the hypothalamus, pituitary, brain stem and optic chiasm, the dose reductions ranged from 2.65 Gy to 3.91 Gy (p < 0.001) in DP-VMAT and from 2.57 Gy to 4 Gy (p < 0.001) in MP-VMAT. Similar dose reduction effects were achieved for contralaterally located OARs, including the hippocampus, optic nerve, lens and retina, ranging from 1.06 Gy to 4.37 Gy in DP-VMAT and from 0.54 Gy to 3.39 Gy in MP-VMAT. For ipsilaterally located OARs, DP-VMAT achieved a significant dose reduction of 1.75 Gy to D-max for the optic nerve. In the correlation analysis, DP-VMAT and MP-VMAT showed significant dose reductions to centrally located OARs when the PTV-OAR distance was less than 4 cm. In particular, DP-VMAT offered better sparing to the optic chiasm when it was located less than 2 cm from the PTV than that of MP-VMAT and CO-VMAT. DP-VMAT and MP-VMAT also showed better sparing to the contralateral hippocampus and retina when they were located 3-8 cm from the PTV. Conclusion: The proposed DP-VMAT and MP-VMAT demonstrated significant dose reductions to centrally located and contralateral OARs and maintained the high plan qualities to PTV with good homogeneity and conformity when compared to CO-VMAT for high-grade glioma and glioblastoma. The benefit in choosing DP-VMAT and MP-VMAT over CO-VMAT was substantial when the PTV was located near the hypothalamus, pituitary, optic chiasm, contralateral hippocampus and contralateral retina.

AB  - Little is known about the longitudinal association of cigarette smoking with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) related markers in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In this study, we aimed to examine the effect of a history of cigarette smoking on change in global cognition, verbal memory, functional performance, hippocampal volume, entorhinal cortex volume, brain glucose metabolism, and CSF AD pathologies over time in MCI subjects. At baseline, there were 870 subjects with MCI, including 618 non-smokers (no history of smoking) and 252 smokers (any lifetime history of smoking). Linear mixed models were fitted for each outcome with adjustment of several covariates. The major findings were: (1) Among older people with MCI, smokers showed faster decline in functional performance compared to non-smokers; (2) Smokers demonstrated steeper decline in entorhinal cortex volume than non-smokers; (3) A history of cigarette smoking was not associated with change in CSF A beta 42, t-tau or p-tau levels over time in MCI subjects. In conclusion, we found that a history of cigarette smoking was associated with faster decline in functional performance and entorhinal cortex volume over time at the prodromal stage of dementia.

AB  - ABSTRACT: The serotonin 1A (5-HT1A) receptor is a G-proteincoupled receptor implicated in the pathophysiology of several neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. We here report the preparation of two candidate 5-HT1A radioligands, [11C]AZ11132132 ([11C]3) and [11C]AZ11895530 ([11C]4), and their subsequent evaluation in vitro using autoradiography and in vivo using positron emission tomography (PET). Compounds 3 and 4 were radiolabeled at high radiochemical purity (>99%) and high molar activity (>38 GBq/mu mol) by heteroatom methylation with [11C]methyl iodide. Autoradiography on whole hemispheres from post-mortem human brain revealed substantial nonspecific binding of [11C]3, while the binding of [11C]4 to brain tissue was consistent with the distribution of 5-HT1A receptors and sensitive to co-incubation with the reference 5-HT1A antagonist WAY100635 (10 mu M). Following intravenous injection of [11C]4 into a cynomolgus monkey, brain radioactivity concentration (Cmax similar to 2.2 SUV) was high whereafter it decreased rapidly. The regional binding potential (BPND) values were calculated using the simplified reference tissue model with cerebellum as reference region. The values varied between 0.2 and 1.0 for temporal cortex, raphe nuclei, frontal cortex, and hippocampus which is consistent with the known 5-HT1A expression pattern. After pretreatment with WAY100635 (0.5 mg/kg), a homogeneous distribution of radioactivity was observed in non-human primate (NHP) brain. Although [11C]4 fulfilled important criteria for successful in vivo neuroimaging, including good blood-brain-barrier permeability and high specific binding in vitro to human brain tissue, the regional BPND values for [11C]4 in NHP brain were low when compared to those obtained with existing radioligands and thus do not merit further investigation of [11C]4. Evaluation of structurally related analogues is underway in our laboratory to identify improved candidates for clinical imaging.

AB  - Stress activates multiple neural pathways and neurotransmitters that often suppress pain perception, the phenomenon called stress-induced analgesia (SIA). Orexin neurons from the lateral hypothalamus project to entire brain structures such as the hippocampus. The present study examined this hypothesis that orexinergic receptors in the CA1 region of the hippocampus may play a modulatory role in the development of SIA in formalin test as an animal model of persistent inflammatory pain. One hundred-two adult male Wistar rats were administered with intra-CA1 orexin-1 receptor (OX1r) antagonist, SB334867, at the doses of 3, 10, 30, and 100 nmol or TCS OX2 29 as orexin-2 receptor (OX2r) antagonist at the doses of 1, 3, 10, and 30 nmol. Five min later, rats were exposed to forced swim stress (FSS) for a 6-min period. Then, pain-related behaviors induced by formalin injection were measured at the 5-min blocks during a 60-min period of formalin test. The current study indicated that solely stress exposure elicits antinociception in the early and late phases of the formalin test. The FSSinduced analgesia was prevented by intra-CA1 administration of SB334867 or TCS OX2 29 during either phase of the formalin test. Moreover, the contribution of the OX2r in the mediation of analgesic effect of stress was more prominent than that of the OX1r during both phases of the formalin test. It is suggested that OX1r and OX2r in the CA1 region of the hippocampus are involved in stress-induced analgesia in the animal model of persistent inflammatory pain.

AB  - Chronic neuroinflammation-induced anomalous glutamate receptor activation has been identified as one of the important factors in the pathogenesis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Thus, the current study was designed to elucidate the neuroprotective effect of the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), a haemopoietic growth factor, an anti-inflammatory, and a neuroprotectant to decipher the underlying mechanism(s) in the valproic acid (VPA)-induced experimental model of ASD. Experimentally, the ASD rat model was induced by a single dose of VPA (600 mg/kg; i.p.) on gestation day 12.5 to the pregnant female rats. After birth, pups were treated with vehicle, that is, normal saline 0.9% i.p., risperidone (2.5 mg/kg; i.p.), and G-CSF (10, 35, and 70 mu g/kg; i.p.) from postnatal day (PND) 23 to 43. All the groups were subjected to various developmental and behavior (???) tests from birth. The rats were sacrificed on PND 55, and their brain was excised and processed for biochemical parameters (oxidative stress, inflammatory markers, BDNF), histological examination (H&E, Nissl staining), NMDA, and AMPA receptor expression by immunohistochemistry, western blot, and real-time polymerase chain reaction evaluation. Also, the possible interaction of the G-CSF with NMDA and AMPA receptors was evaluated using the in silico method. The results of the study showed that in VPA-exposed rats, postnatal treatment of the G-CSF rescued all the behavioral abnormalities, oxidative stress, and inflammatory parameters in a dose-dependent manner while risperidone did not show any significant results. The in silico analysis showed the direct interaction of the G-CSF with NMDA and AMPA receptors. The upregulated expression of NMDA and AMPA both in the prefrontal cortex as well as hippocampus was alleviated by the G-CSF thereby validating its anti-inflammatory and excitoprotective properties. Thus, the G-CSF demonstrated neuroprotection against the core symptoms of autism in the VPA-induced rodent model, making it a potential candidate for the treatment of ASD.

AB  - A major factor contributing to the etiology of depression is a neurochemical imbalance of the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems, which is caused by persistently high levels of circulating stress hormones. Here, a computational model is proposed to investigate the interplay between dopaminergic and serotonergic-kynurenine metabolism under cortisolemia and its consequences for the onset of depression. The model was formulated as a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations represented with power-law functions. Parameter values were obtained from experimental data reported in the literature, biological databases, and other general information, and subsequently fine-tuned through optimization. Model simulations predict that changes in the kynurenine pathway, caused by elevated levels of cortisol, can increase the risk of neurotoxicity and lead to increased levels of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylaceltahyde (DOPAL) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetaldehyde (5-HIAL). These aldehydes contribute to alpha-synuclein aggregation and may cause mitochondrial fragmentation. Further model analysis demonstrated that the inhibition of both serotonin transport and kynurenine-3-monooxygenase decreased the levels of DOPAL and 5-HIAL and the neurotoxic risk often associated with depression. The mathematical model was also able to predict a novel role of the dopamine and serotonin metabolites DOPAL and 5-HIAL in the ethiology of depression, which is facilitated through increased cortisol levels. Finally, the model analysis suggests treatment with a combination of inhibitors of serotonin transport and kynurenine-3-monooxygenase as a potentially effective pharmacological strategy to revert the slow-down in monoamine neurotransmission that is often triggered by inflammation.
   Author summary According to the World Health Organization, major depressive disorder (MDD) was in 2014 the fourth leading cause of disability in people between the ages of 15 and 44 years. MDD is responsible for about 1 million suicides per year and associated with a number of other medical conditions such as coronary disease, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease. While MDD has been studied for a long time, molecular details of its pathophysiology are still scarce. Computational models offer a powerful opportunity to assist neuropsychiatric disorder research, as they permit the representation of large sets of physiological, cellular and biochemical phenomena through mathematical equations that can be simulated in a very efficient fashion and have the capacity to provide testable hypotheses. Here, we introduce a computational model of relevant biochemical pathways associated with high levels of circulating stress hormone, as they are observed in MDD. The model captures known observations well and demonstrates how increased levels of internally produced toxic agents, such as various kynurenines, DOPAL and 5-HIAL, can lead to dysregulation of key enzymes. These insights suggest new hypotheses for model-driven experiments, as well as novel potential targets for pharmacological intervention.

AB  - SP0.1-1, derived from Sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L.), has been discovered to exhibit unique antioxidant activity. In this study, we investigated the immunomodulatory activity and mechanisms of SP0.1-1 on macrophage RAW 264.7 cells in vitro and immunosuppressive mice induced by cyclophosphamide in vivo. The results indicated SP0.1-1 strengthened the immune functions via promoting the proliferation of RAW264.7 cells and phagocytic activity, along with stimulating the release of NO, ROS and cytokines including TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1 beta and IFN-gamma. Western blot and molecular docking analysis demonstrated that SP0.1-1 attached to the prime receptors TLR2 and TLR4 in RAW264.7 cells, and triggered the activation of MyD88-mediated MAPK and NF-kappa B signaling pathways, thereby exerting the immune response in RAW264.7 cells. However, the intervention of specific inhibitors against TLR2, TLR4, JNK, ERK, p38 and NF-kappa B blocked the TLR-mediated MAPK and NF-kappa B signaling pathways and downregulated the levels of NO and the aforementioned cytokines, thus suppressing the activation of macrophages. Therefore, it can be speculated that SP0.1-1 activated the macrophages principally via the TLR2/4-MyD88-mediated MAPK and NF-kappa B signaling pathways. Additionally, SP0.1-1 could protect against the cyclophosphamide-induced immunosuppression in mice, manifested by the improvement of body weight, immune organ indices, phagocytic index, and the relievement of spleen damage, along with the enhancement of cytokines TNF-alpha, IL-6, IFN-gamma and immunoglobulin IgG and IgM. These findings will shed light on the molecular mechanism of SP0.1-1 on the immunoregulatory effect, and lay the foundation for exploiting a potential immunostimulatory agent of SP0.1-1.

AB  - This study analyzed the endogenous metabolites and metabolic pathways in the serum of Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats gavaged with the Eerdun Wurile basic formula (EWB) using metabolomics methods and network pharmacology to explore the possible mechanism of action of the EWB in improving postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). SD rats were divided into the basic formula group, which received the EWB, and the control group, which received equal amounts of distilled water. The blood was collected from the abdominal aorta and analyzed for metabolite profiles using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS). Network pharmacology predicts the targets of the differential metabolites and disease targets; takes the intersection and constructs a "metabolite-disease-target" network; and performs protein-protein interaction, Gene Ontology, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses. A total of 56 metabolites were selected for significant differences between the groups, mainly affecting amphetamine addiction, alcoholism, and regulation of lipolysis in adipocytes. A total of 177 potential targets for differential metabolite action in POCD were selected. The PI3K-Akt pathway, the HIF-1 pathway, and the FoxO pathway were in key positions. The studies have shown that EWB could improve POCD through multicomponents, multitargets, and multipathways, providing new possibilities and reference values for the treatment of POCD.

AB  - BackgroundCognitive dysfunction caused by infection frequently emerges as a complication in sepsis survivor patients. However, a comprehensive understanding of its pathogenesis remains elusive.MethodsIn our in vivo experiments, an animal model of endotoxemia was employed, utilizing the Novel Object Recognition Test and Morris Water Maze Test to assess cognitive function. Various techniques, including immunofluorescent staining, Western blotting, blood-brain barrier permeability assessment, Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) assay, and Proximity-ligation assay, were employed to identify brain pathological injury and neuroinflammation. To discern the role of Caspase-11 (Casp11) in hematopoietic or non-hematopoietic cells in endotoxemia-induced cognitive decline, bone marrow chimeras were generated through bone marrow transplantation (BMT) using wild-type (WT) and Casp11-deficient mice. In vitro studies involved treating BV2 cells with E. coli-derived outer membrane vesicles to mimic in vivo conditions.ResultsOur findings indicate that the deficiency of Casp11-GSDMD signaling pathways reverses infection-induced cognitive dysfunction. Moreover, cognitive dysfunction can be ameliorated by blocking the IL-1 effect. Mechanistically, the absence of Casp11 signaling significantly mitigated blood-brain barrier leakage, microglial activation, and synaptic damage in the hippocampal CA3 region, ultimately leading to improved cognitive function.ConclusionThis study unveils the crucial contribution of Casp11 and GSDMD to cognitive impairments and spatial memory loss in a murine sepsis model. Targeting Casp11 signaling emerges as a promising strategy for preventing or treating cognitive dysfunction in patients with severe infections.

AB  - Human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) harboring one KRAS mutant allele often displays increasing genomic loss of the remaining wild-type (WT) allele (known as LOH at KRAS) as tumors progress to metastasis, yet the molecular ramification of this WT allelic loss is unknown. In this study, we showed that the restoration of WT KRAS expression in human PDAC cell lines with LOH at KRAS significantly attenuated the malignancy of PDAC cells both in vitro and in vivo, demonstrating a tumor-suppressive role of the WT KRAS allele. Through RNA-Seq, we identified the HIPPO signaling pathway to be positively regulated by WT KRAS in PDAC cells. In accordance with this observation, PDAC cells with LOH at KRAS exhibited increased nuclear localization and activation of transcriptional co-activator YAP1. Mechanistically, we discovered that WT KRAS expression sequestered YAP1 from the nucleus, through enhanced 14-3-3zeta interaction with phosphorylated YAP1 at S127. Consistently, expression of a constitutively-active YAP1 mutant in PDAC cells bypassed the growth inhibitory effects of WT KRAS. In patient samples, we found that the YAP1-activation genes were significantly upregulated in tumors with LOH at KRAS, and YAP1 nuclear localization predicted poor survival for PDAC patients. Collectively, our results reveal that the WT allelic loss leads to functional activation of YAP1 and enhanced tumor malignancy, which explains the selection advantage of the tumor cells with LOH at KRAS during pancreatic cancer clonal evolution and progression to metastasis, and should be taken into consideration in future therapeutic strategies targeting KRAS.

AB  - Simple Summary Studies of physiology, animal welfare, and behavior in endangered species are gaining more importance with the aim of contributing to their conservation, and studies that use non-invasive methods for hormonal determinations are especially valuable. In this study, feces were used to assess whether the adrenal and gonadal hormones showed variation in male Asian elephants in a 14-month period and to evaluate whether there were any influences of climatic variables with respect to hormonal secretion. We show here that the use of non-invasive methods to measure the levels of steroid hormones in Asian elephant feces allows us to obtain useful results without having to subject the animals to stressful activity or requiring specific training to obtain the samples. Additionally, this research provides a deeper understanding of endocrine regulation in captive Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) in order to enhance reproduction programs in captivity and conserve the species. The measurement of stress and reproductive hormones in wild animal species by non-invasive methods is of special interest. To assess whether the adrenal and gonadal hormones show annual variations in male Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) and to evaluate whether there is any influence of climatic variables on hormonal secretion, fecal samples were taken from a herd of 7 Asian elephants over a 14-month period to subsequently determine the concentrations of testosterone (T), androstenedione (A4), and cortisol (C) by a validated immunoassay technique. Data referring to three climatic variables in the place and period of study were collected, namely monthly mean values of temperature, humidity and rainfall. Levels of T and A4 showed two major increases in July (T: 1088.35 +/- 131.04 ng/g; A4: 480.40 +/- 50.86 ng/g) and October (T: 825.09 +/- 31.60 ng/g; A4: 319.96 +/- 32.69 ng/g) (p < 0.05). Our results show a secretion of fecal androgens dependent on temperature (T and A4), and humidity (T). Male musth was detected during the initial increases of T and A4 levels. The highest concentrations of C were observed in September (156.67 +/- 60.89 ng/g) (p < 0.05), probably due to the stressful fights that occurred during the musth period. The observed results of the fecal levels of T, A4 and C were similar to those obtained by invasive methods. In conclusion, fecal secretion of the three hormones in these captive male Asian elephants showed variations related in some cases to different weather factors.

AB  - The transformation of synaptic input into action potential output is a fundamental single-cell computation resulting from the complex interaction of distinct cellular morphology and the unique expression profile of ion channels that define the cellular phenotype. Experimental studies aimed at uncovering the mechanisms of the transfer function have led to important insights, yet are limited in scope by technical feasibility, making biophysical simulations an attractive complementary approach to push the boundaries in our understanding of cellular computation. Here we take a data-driven approach by utilizing high-resolution morphological reconstructions and patch-clamp electrophysiology data together with a multi-objective optimization algorithm to build two populations of biophysically detailed models of murine hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons based on the two principal cell types that comprise this region. We evaluated the performance of these models and find that our approach quantitatively matches the cell type-specific firing phenotypes and recapitulate the intrinsic population-level variability in the data. Moreover, we confirm that the conductance values found by the optimization algorithm are consistent with differentially expressed ion channel genes in single-cell transcriptomic data for the two cell types. We then use these models to investigate the cell type-specific biophysical properties involved in the generation of complex-spiking output driven by synaptic input through an information-theoretic treatment of their respective transfer functions. Our simulations identify a host of cell type-specific biophysical mechanisms that define the morpho-functional phenotype to shape the cellular transfer function and place these findings in the context of a role for bursting in CA3 recurrent network synchronization dynamics.
   Author summaryThe hippocampus is comprised of numerous types of neurons, which constitute the cellular substrate for its rich repertoire of network dynamics. Among these are sharp waves, sequential activations of ensembles of neurons that have been shown to be crucially involved in learning and memory. In the CA3 area of the hippocampus, two types of excitatory cells, thorny and a-thorny neurons, are preferentially active during distinct phases of a sharp wave, suggesting a differential role for these cell types in phenomena such as memory consolidation. Using a strictly data-driven approach, we built biophysically realistic models of both thorny and a-thorny cells and used them to investigate the integrative differences between these two cell types. We found that both neuron classes have the capability of integrating incoming synaptic inputs in a supralinear fashion, although only a-thorny cells respond with bursts of action potentials to spatially and temporally clustered synaptic inputs. Additionally, by using a computational approach based on information theory, we show that, owing to this propensity for bursting, a-thorny cells can encode more information in their spiking output than their thorny counterpart. These results shed new light on the computational capabilities of two types of excitatory neurons and suggest that thorny and a-thorny cells may play distinct roles in the generation of hippocampal network synchronization.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of Mycoplasma spp. and their identification in seals from Antarctica. During January and February 2010, 59 Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella), 17 Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii), and 5 Southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) were captured in three Antarctic islands. Oral and genital samples were collected, cultured, and cloned. The Intergenic Spacer Region 16S-23S rDNA (ISR) PCR products were sent for sequencing. Seventy-four (91.4%) out of the eighty-one seals sampled were PCR positive. From those, 57 isolates were cultured. Mycoplasmas were more prevalent in the mouth in comparison to the reproductive tract. The percentage of isolates were 76.3%, 58.8%, and 40.0% for Antarctic fur seals, Weddell seals, and Southern elephant seals, respectively. The ISR sequences divided the isolates into six clusters. Four clusters presented a very high similarity percentage with mycoplasma sequences obtained from seals. However, none of these mycoplasmas have been described to date. Cluster 1 is also close to M. miroungigenitalium. This study represents the first report of Mycoplasma species adapted to Antarctic pinnipeds. The findings contribute to the understanding of the ecology of mycoplasmas in Antarctic pinnipeds.

AB  - Simple Summary Caffeine is a natural substance found in coffee (Coffea spp.), cocoa (Theobroma cacao), cola (Cola nitida), guaran & aacute; (Paullinia cupana), mat & eacute; (Ilex paraguariensis), and tea plant (Camellia sinensis). These plant species are widely used to produce different drinks and foods, generating a large volume of by-products that may be used for animal feed. This article is part of a broad study that aims to evaluate the safety of using by-products containing caffeine to feed laying hens. In this study, we show that the eggs of laying hens fed caffeine contain this compound together with its primary metabolites: theophylline, theobromine, and paraxanthine. It is essential to highlight that the levels of these compounds found in eggs do not appear to pose any health risk to consumers.Abstract This study aimed to determine whether the eggs of laying hens fed caffeine contain this compound and its primary metabolites (theophylline, theobromine, and paraxanthine). Laying hens were distributed into four experimental groups fed rations containing 0 (control), 150, 300, or 450 mu g/g of caffeine. For residual analysis, six eggs per group were collected after 4, 8, and 12 weeks. The concentrations of caffeine, theophylline, theobromine, and paraxanthine were determined in the white and yolk of each egg by a high-performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array detector (HPLC-PDA) method. All four compounds were detected in the white and yolk of eggs produced by hens fed caffeine, but their levels in the egg white were approximately twice those in the yolk. The major metabolite found in eggs was theophylline (57.5% of caffeine metabolites in the egg white and 58.5% in the yolk), followed by theobromine (39.9% in the egg white and 41.5% in the yolk), and paraxanthine (2.64% in the egg white and non-detected in the yolk). In summary, caffeine and its metabolites, theophylline, theobromine, and paraxanthine, are transferred to the chicken eggs.

AB  - Simple Summary The assessment of animals' personalities can help manage decisions concerning zoo animals more appropriately; for example, a proper personality evaluation helps create stable social groups or increase the chances of breeding success if compatible breeding pairs are chosen. In zoos, the animals' personality is often evaluated by the caretakers due to their familiarity with the animals and their behaviours. In this study, we aimed to evaluate how reliable caretakers' ratings are when assessing dolphins' personalities. With this aim in mind, we asked 24 caretakers to score a variety of personality traits of bottlenose dolphins under their care through a questionnaire in two periods. Our findings showed fair to good degrees of agreement within scores of the same rater and across raters within the same centre. We were also able to identify which raters and centres showed significant score mean differences systematically. We believe the study of raters' outcomes reliability is crucial to make appropriate management decisions based on the animals' personalities. The evaluation of zoo animals' personalities can likely lead to a range of benefits, including improving breeding success, creating stable social groups, and designing and developing environmental enrichment programmes. The goal of this study was to use caretakers scores to evaluate personality in bottlenose dolphins and to assess the reliability of scores within each rater and among raters from each centre. To this end, 24 caretakers from 3 countries (Spain, France, and Argentina), including a total of 5 dolphinariums and 6 groups of dolphins, used a questionnaire based on the Five-Factor Model of Personality to score bottlenose dolphins on a number of personality traits in three different contexts. Each caretaker evaluated the animals under their care twice, ensuring that raters did not share thoughts nor impressions with other raters. Our findings showed a good degree of agreement between each rater's scores and a fair degree of agreement among scores of raters from the same centre. We also identified which raters and centres had significant mean score differences and detected that 4 out of 24 raters from two different centres showed such differences systematically. The evaluation of raters' reliability and the identification of particular inconsistent raters and centres is critical to make more appropriate and realistic management decisions that, in turn, directly impact animals' welfare.

AB  - The aim of the study was to determine the extent and intensity of gastrointestinal parasite infections in alpacas (Vicugna pacos) in Poland, considering factors such as region, gender, age, and season. The research was conducted on 29 herds located throughout Poland. Faecal samples from 512 alpacas were collected in autumn 2023 and spring 2024. Examination was performed using the direct flotation and McMaster methods. The average prevalence of gastrointestinal parasitic infections was 74.4%; 68.8% of alpacas were infected with nematodes and 34.8% with protists of the genus Eimeria. The most commonly detected parasites were Nematodirus spp. (38.5%) and Eimeria punoensis (18.2%). The analysis revealed significant differences in the intensity of gastrointestinal parasitic infections depending on region, age, gender, and season, suggesting the need to tailor deworming programs to the specific requirements of different groups of alpacas. Furthermore, regional differences in the prevalence of Strongyloides sp. and Strongylida infections were observed, indicating a significant impact of local environmental conditions and husbandry practices on the risk of infection. Seasonal variations in the intensity of Eimeria infections, particularly in autumn, were also noted. Parasitic infections in alpacas in Poland are common and generally asymptomatic. These results highlight the need for the implementation of a comprehensive preventive program for controlling parasitic infection, including regular diagnostics, pasture management optimization, maintenance of hygiene, and selective use of antiparasitic drugs in alpacas.

AB  - Simple Summary To investigate the genetic reprogramming that drives intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) maturation along the crypt-villus axis, entCerocytes were sequentially isolated from the villus tip to the crypts of porcine small intestine. The present study obtained the intestinal upper villus epithelial cells (F1) and crypt epithelial cells (F3) of 21-day suckling piglets using the divalent chelation and precipitation technique. By mRNA high-throughput sequencing analysis of F1 and F3, it was shown that a total of 672 unigenes were differentially expressed between F1 and F3, including 224 highly expressed and 448 minimally expressed unigenes. The greatest number of differentially expressed genes enriched in signal transduction, e.g., Wnt, Hippo, TGF-beta, mTOR, PI3K-Akt, and MAPK signaling pathways, were closely related to the differentiation, proliferation, maturation and apoptosis of IECs. Our results provide important information for identifying new regulators of IECs differentiation and maturation. Moreover, they can also provide insights into the regulatory mechanisms underlying intestinal epithelial cell renewal and the rapid repair of intestinal mucosal oxidative damage. It is well known that the small intestinal epithelial cells of mammals rapidly undergo differentiation, maturation, and apoptosis. However, few studies have defined the physiological state and gene expression changes of enterocytes along the crypt-villus axis in suckling piglets. In the present study, we obtained the intestinal upper villus epithelial cells (F1) and crypt epithelial cells (F3) of 21-day suckling piglets using the divalent chelation and precipitation technique. The activities of alkaline phosphatase, sucrase, and lactase of F1 were significantly higher (p < 0.05) than those of F3. To explore the differences at the gene transcription level, we compared the global transcriptional profiles of F1 and F3 using RNA-seq analysis technology. A total of 672 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between F1 and F3, including 224 highly expressed and 448 minimally expressed unigenes. Functional analyses indicated that some DEGs were involved in the transcriptional regulation of nutrient transportation (SLC15A1, SLC5A1, and SLC3A1), cell differentiation (LGR5, HOXA5 and KLF4), cell proliferation (PLK2 and TGFB3), transcriptional regulation (JUN, FOS and ATF3), and signaling transduction (WNT10B and BMP1), suggesting that these genes were related to intestinal epithelial cell maturation and cell renewal. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis showed that the DEGs were mainly associated with binding, catalytic activity, enzyme regulator activity, and molecular transducer activity. Furthermore, KEGG pathway analysis revealed that the DGEs were categorized into 284 significantly enriched pathways. The greatest number of DEGs enriched in signal transduction, some of which (Wnt, Hippo, TGF-beta, mTOR, PI3K-Akt, and MAPK signaling pathways) were closely related to the differentiation, proliferation, maturation and apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells. We validated the expression levels of eight DEGs in F1 and F3 using qRT-PCR. The present study revealed temporal and regional changes in mRNA expression between F1 and F3 of suckling piglets, which provides insights into the regulatory mechanisms underlying intestinal epithelial cell renewal and the rapid repair of intestinal mucosal damage.

AB  - Simple Summary The donkey (Equus asinus) is an odd-toed ungulate and the smallest species in the Equidae family. It is characteristically short-legged with extremely long ears. The wild ancestor of the donkey is equally Equus asinus, which is generally known as the "African wild ass" and is reportedly still extant. Donkeys are the only ungual animal domesticated exclusively in Africa. By nature, donkeys are very companionable, calm, enduring, intelligent, prudent, playful, and keen to learn, and they enjoy the company of humans. In Turkey, donkeys are used for pack transport and riding in order to lessen the physical load on humans. This study was conducted to assess the prediction performance of various algorithms using the morphological traits, body coat colour distribution, and body measurements of donkeys raised in Turkey. This study was carried out in order to determine the morphological characteristics, body coat colour distribution, and body dimensions of donkeys raised in Turkey, as well as to determine the relationships between these factors. For this reason, the predictive performance of various machine learning algorithms (i.e., CHAID, Random Forest, ALM, MARS, and Bagging MARS) were compared, utilising the biometric data of donkeys. In particular, mean measurements were taken from a total of 371 donkeys (252 male and 119 female) with descriptive statistical values as follows: height at withers, 100.7 cm; rump height, 103.1 cm; body length, 103.8 cm; chest circumference, 112.8 cm; chest depth, 45.7 cm; chest width, 29.1 cm; front shin circumference, 13.5 cm; head length, 55 cm; and ear length, 22 cm. The body colour distribution of the donkeys considered in this study was calculated as 39.35% grey, 19.95% white, 21.83% black, and 18.87% brown. Model fit statistics, including the coefficient of determination (R-2), mean square error, root-mean-square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and standard deviation ratio (SD ratio), were calculated to measure the predictive ability of the fitted models. The MARS algorithm was found to be the best model for defining the body length of donkeys, with the highest R-2 value (0.916) and the lowest RMSE, MAPE, and SD ratio values (2.173, 1.615, and 0.291, respectively). The experimental results indicate that the most suitable model is the MARS algorithm, which provides a good alternative to other data mining algorithms for predicting the body length of donkeys.

AB  - Unlike cutaneous melanoma, uveal melanoma (UM) is characterized by mutations in GNAQ and GNA11 and remains a fatal disease because there is essentially no effective targeted therapy or immunotherapy available. We report the discovery of the copper ionophore elesclomol as a GNAQ/11-specific UM inhibitor. Elesclomol was identified in a differential cytotoxicity screen of an in-house tool compound library, and its in vivo pharmacological efficacy was further confirmed in zebrafish and mouse UM models. Mechanistically, elesclomol transports copper to mitochondria and produces a large amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as Cu(II) is reduced to Cu(I) in GNAQ/11-mutant UM cells, which selectively activates LATS1 kinase in the Hippo signaling pathway and consequently promotes YAP phosphorylation and inhibits its nuclear accumulation. The inactivation of YAP downregulates the expression of SNAI2, which in turn suppresses the migration of UM cells. These findings were cross validated by our clinical observation that YAP activation was found specifically in UM samples with a GNAQ/11 mutation. Furthermore, addition of binimetinib, a MEK inhibitor, to elesclomol increased its synthetic lethality to GNAQ/11-mutant UM cells, thereby overriding drug resistance. This effect was confirmed in an orthotopic xenograft model and in a patient-derived xenograft model of UM. These studies reveal a novel mechanistic basis for repurposing elesclomol by showing that copper homeostasis is a GNAQ/11-specific vulnerability in UM. Elesclomol may provide a new therapeutic path for selectively targeting malignant GNAQ/11-mutant UM.

AB  - Aversive geofencing devices (AGDs) or animal-borne satellite-linked shock collars might become a useful tool to mitigate human-elephant conflict (HEC). AGDs have the potential to condition problem elephants to avoid human-dominated landscapes by associating mild electric shocks with preceding audio warnings given as they approach virtual boundaries. We assessed the opinions of different stakeholders (experts, farmers, and others who have and have not experienced HEC; n = 611) on the potential use of AGDs on Asian elephants. Most respondents expressed positive opinions on the potential effectiveness of AGDs in managing elephant movement (62.2%). About 62.8% respondents also provided positive responses for the acceptability of AGDs if pilot studies with captive elephants have been successful in managing their movements. Some respondents perceived AGDs to be unacceptable because they are unethical or harmful and would be unsuccessful given wild elephants may respond differently to AGDs than captive elephants. Respondents identified acceptability, support and awareness of stakeholders, safety and wellbeing of elephants, logistical difficulties, durability and reliable functionality of AGDs, and uncertainties in elephants' responses to AGDs as potential challenges for implementing AGDs. These issues need attention when developing AGDs to increase support from stakeholders and to effectively reduce HEC incidents in the future.

AB  - Ensuring the effective management of every rhinoceros population is crucial for securing a future for the species, especially considering the escalating global threat of poaching and the challenges faced in captive breeding programs for this endangered species. Steroid hormones play pivotal roles in regulating diverse biological processes, making fecal hormonal determinations a valuable non-invasive tool for monitoring adrenal and gonadal endocrinologies and assessing reproductive status, particularly in endangered species. The purpose of this study was to develop a statistical model for predicting the sex of white rhinoceroses using hormonal determinations obtained from a single fecal sample. To achieve this, 562 fecal samples from 15 individuals of the Ceratotherium simum species were collected, and enzyme immunoassays were conducted to determine the concentrations of fecal cortisol, progesterone, estrone, and testosterone metabolites. The biological validation of the method provided an impressive accuracy rate of nearly 80% in predicting the sex of hypothetically unknown white rhinoceroses. Implementing this statistical model for sex identification in white rhinoceroses would yield significant benefits, including a better understanding of the structure and dynamics of wild populations. Additionally, it would enhance conservation management efforts aimed at protecting this endangered species. By utilizing this innovative approach, we can contribute to the preservation and long-term survival of white rhinoceros populations.

AB  - Understanding hormone patterns in free-ranging African elephants can provide critical insights for the management of elephants in human care, particularly in addressing reproductive anomalies and the rising prevalence of obesity in zoo populations. This study is the first to establish baseline values for glucose, insulin, and leptin, and their potential relationships with reproductive and stress hormones. We measured the hormones in serum samples collected opportunistically in Kruger National Park between 2000 and 2016. Endocrine profiles were compared across age groups in both male and female elephants and between the wet and dry seasons. In females, progestogen and prolactin levels were highest in adults, and were not significantly correlated with the glucose-to-insulin (G/I) ratio or leptin. In males, testosterone levels were higher in adults, and the G/I ratio was a significant predictor of testosterone concentrations. Seasonal variations revealed that, in males, testosterone levels were higher, and cortisol concentrations were lower during the rainy season. In females, cortisol concentrations were negatively associated with progestogen levels during the dry season. These benchmarks offer zoos a reference point to assess whether current management approaches are effective, and how natural variation with the season may impact hormone levels.

AB  - Simple Summary Understanding how a disease evolved across the animal kingdom could help us better understand the disease and might lead to novel methods for treatment. Here, we studied the evolution of glaucoma, an irreversible eye disease, in mammals and birds, by studying the evolution of intraocular pressure (IOP), a central driver of glaucoma, and searching for associations between life history traits and IOP. Our results revealed that IOP is a taxa-specific trait that is higher in some species than in others. Higher IOPs appear to have evolved multiple times in mammals and birds. Higher IOPs were found in mammals with higher body mass and in aquatic birds. We also found that higher IOPs evolved through stabilizing selection, with the optimum IOP in mammals and birds being 17.67 and 14.31 mmHg, respectively. This supports the hypothesis that higher IOPs may be an adaptive trait for certain animals. Focusing on species with higher IOPs but no evidence of glaucoma may help identify glaucoma-resistant adaptations, which could be developed into human therapies. Glaucoma, an eye disorder caused by elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in humans. Understanding how IOP levels have evolved across animal species could shed light on the nature of human vulnerability to glaucoma. Here, we studied the evolution of IOP in mammals and birds and explored its life history correlates. We conducted a systematic review, to create a dataset of species-specific IOP levels and reconstructed the ancestral states of IOP using three models of evolution (Brownian, Early burst, and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU)) to understand the evolution of glaucoma. Furthermore, we tested the association between life history traits (e.g., body mass, blood pressure, diet, longevity, and habitat) and IOP using phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS). IOP in mammals and birds evolved under the OU model, suggesting stabilizing selection toward an optimal value. Larger mammals had higher IOPs and aquatic birds had higher IOPs; no other measured life history traits, the type of tonometer used, or whether the animal was sedated when measuring IOP explained the significant variation in IOP in this dataset. Elevated IOP, which could result from physiological and anatomical processes, evolved multiple times in mammals and birds. However, we do not understand how species with high IOP avoid glaucoma. While we found very few associations between life history traits and IOP, we suggest that more detailed studies may help identify mechanisms by which IOP is decoupled from glaucoma. Importantly, species with higher IOPs (cetaceans, pinnipeds, and rhinoceros) could be good model systems for studying glaucoma-resistant adaptations.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the productive and nutritional attributes of hydroponic corn forage grown on elephant grass and wood sawdust substrates at different stages. Two treatments (T) with different substrates were established: T1 - chopped and dehydrated elephant grass and T2 - wood sawdust. Forage samples were collected 13 and 20 days after sowing to evaluate seedling development, biomass production, and nutritional composition. The elephant grass substrate promoted better seedling development and greater biomass production and concentration of mineral matter at 13 days, whereas wood sawdust promoted a greater concentration of dry matter, crude protein, lignin, and non-fibrous carbohydrates (P < 0.05). The elephant grass substrates resulted in greater seedling height, production of green biomass, and concentrations of mineral matter, crude protein, and ether extract at 20 days, while wood sawdust promoted greater root length and greater concentrations of dry matter, acid detergent fiber, and lignin (P < 0.05). Elephant grass substrate and collection for 13 days promoted better production of hydroponic forage and its nutritional composition.

AB  - MiR-203 was identified as a hub of a potential regulatory miRNA network in central nervous system. Overexpressing of miR-203 in the frontal cortex of C57BL/6J wild type mouse induced neurodegeneration by increasing the apoptotic pathway and neuron death. AFF4, a transcription factor, was identified as a new bona fida protein target of miR-203 in CNS. The miRNA:mRNA interaction of miR-203 and AFF4 was verified using Dural-luciferase assay. Down-regulated expression of AFF4 was induced by overexpressing miR-203 both in vitro and in vivo. Open field test, Y maze and Morris water maze test were conducted for the behavioral assessment of the mice with stereotactic injection of lentiviral vector overexpressing miR-203 in the hippocampus. No anxiety-like behavior or impaired cognition was noticed in these mice. Consistent with the results of the behavioral assessment, the electron micrograph and Nissl staining revealed no significant change in the synaptic density and no neuron injuries in the hippocampus of mice overexpressing miR-203, respectively. Our results indicated that instead of promoting neurodegenerative phenotype, a more profound function should be ascribed to miR-203 in regulating neuron behavioral activities and cognition. Neuron-type specific functions of miR-203 are likely to be executed via its various downstream protein interactors. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Simple Summary Although animals are extensively used in experimentation for diverse purposes, ethical concerns have led to reluctance among a certain sector of the population. To find out the opinions of the Spanish population regarding animal research, we conducted a survey, obtaining responses from more than 800 people. While the majority were in favor, some groups were more prone to be against animal experimentation. In addition, we observed that people's opinions could be altered by reading media reports. We also observed that people did not know about the handling of animals or laws concerning animal testing. Furthermore, we found that people were against the use of animals for non-medical purposes. In general, the survey showed the variety of people's opinions and their concern for animal welfare. Since the time of Hippocrates in the 4th century BC, animal research has been extensively used for various purposes up to the present day. However, the use of animals for research has also been controversial for a long time. We report the findings of a public, online questionnaire-based survey designed to assess the opinions of a sample of Spanish society regarding animal research. Demographic data and opinions were obtained from 806 respondents. The results indicated a high level of acceptance of animal research (73.1%). However, certain factors, such as completing the questionnaire immediately after a reading negative media report (OR = 2.41; 95%CI: 1.64-3.54; p < 0.001), being a woman (OR = 1.77; 95%CI: 1.24-2.53; p = 0.002) or having a non-scientific background (OR = 2.47; 95%CI: 1.76-3.47; p < 0.001), were associated with a tendency towards a more negative opinion. The opinions seemed to be influenced by gender, education level and by protest incidents reported in the media. Our results also indicate that a lot of information regarding animal welfare, such as care and handling protocols, along with legislation was unknown to individuals. Further, a growing popularity of companion species and opposition to animal experimentation for non-biomedical purposes were reflected in the responses obtained. The use of animals for research purposes emerged as a sensitive social issue in terms of concerns about animal ethics and welfare.

AB  - Simple Summary Model-based decision-making guides organism behavior by representing the relationships between states. Previous studies have shown that the mammalian hippocampus (Hp) plays a key role in model-based learning. However, the hippocampal neural mechanisms of birds for model-based learning are largely unknown. We trained pigeons to perform a two-step task. Using a combination of neural analysis and computational modeling, we show that the pigeons use model-based inferences to learn multi-step tasks, and multiple LFP frequency bands collaboratively contribute to model-based learning. Specifically, the high-frequency (12-100 Hz) oscillations represent model-based valuations, while the low-frequency (1-12 Hz) neural similarity is influenced by the relationship between temporal context states. These findings expand the understanding of the hippocampus' role in avian model-based learning.Abstract Model-based decision-making guides organism behavior by the representation of the relationships between different states. Previous studies have shown that the mammalian hippocampus (Hp) plays a key role in learning the structure of relationships among experiences. However, the hippocampal neural mechanisms of birds for model-based learning have rarely been reported. Here, we trained six pigeons to perform a two-step task and explore whether their Hp contributes to model-based learning. Behavioral performance and hippocampal multi-channel local field potentials (LFPs) were recorded during the task. We estimated the subjective values using a reinforcement learning model dynamically fitted to the pigeon's choice of behavior. The results show that the model-based learner can capture the behavioral choices of pigeons well throughout the learning process. Neural analysis indicated that high-frequency (12-100 Hz) power in Hp represented the temporal context states. Moreover, dynamic correlation and decoding results provided further support for the high-frequency dependence of model-based valuations. In addition, we observed a significant increase in hippocampal neural similarity at the low-frequency band (1-12 Hz) for common temporal context states after learning. Overall, our findings suggest that pigeons use model-based inferences to learn multi-step tasks, and multiple LFP frequency bands collaboratively contribute to model-based learning. Specifically, the high-frequency (12-100 Hz) oscillations represent model-based valuations, while the low-frequency (1-12 Hz) neural similarity is influenced by the relationship between temporal context states. These results contribute to our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying model-based learning and broaden the scope of hippocampal contributions to avian behavior.

AB  - Serotonin type 6 receptor (5-HT6R) has been considered as a particularly promising target for treating cognitive deficits due to the positive effects of its antagonists in a wide range of memory impairment paradigms. In this study, we designed, synthesized, and evaluated a series of 3-(difluoromethyl)-1-(phenylsulfonyl)-4-(piperazin-1yl)-1H-indole derivatives as potent 5-HT6R antagonists. Structure-activity relationship study led to the discovery of five compounds (6a, 6m, 6n, 6p and 6q) with potent binding affinity at 5-HT6R. In in vivo pharmacokinetic studies in rats, 6p showed 30-folds higher AUC (267 ng center dot h/mL) and better bioavailability (34.39 %) than those of 6a (9.37 ng center dot h/mL and 5.95 %, respectively) by using difluoromethyl group replacing a methyl group. Besides, 6p showed good brain penetration with C-b/C-p ratio similar to 6. Based on the pharmacological characteristics and favorable pharmacokinetic properties, 6p was further chosen to evaluate cognition-enhancing property in the preliminary in vivo models. It is identified that 6p not only prevented scopolamine-induced learning deficits in the novel object recognition test but also rescued the recognition barrier caused by scopolamine. Finally, the combination of 6p and donepezil produces synergistic effects on increasing the acetylcholine levels in the intracerebral hippocampus. In light of these findings, we propose 6p as a potential 5-HT6R antagonist for treatment of AD.

AB  - EEHV is a ubiquitous virus, which most likely has co-evolved with elephants and is shed by healthy individuals and maintained in the herds. Yet, the factors determining calf susceptibility to the virus remain unknown. Here, we explored the impact of EEHV-HD in the European captive Asian elephant population in a retrospective statistical study spanning the last 35 years. We show that EEHV-HD was implicated in more than half of all deaths recorded in calves older than one months old. Moreover, the median age across EEHV-HD fatalities was significantly lower compared to other death causes. Finally, we investigated if heredity and zoo-associated factors could be linked to a higher susceptibility of calves to this disease. We used a univariable logistic regression model to evaluate if either fathers, mothers, or zoos could, separately, be considered as risk factors to the development of the disease. Afterwards, we used a two multivariable model, combining: (1) fathers and zoos, and (2) mothers and zoos. Overall, we found that two fathers, one mother, and four zoos had three or more times higher risk of their calves becoming sick when compared to all others, pointing us to the presence of a management or environmental element, which can have paternal and maternal influence and leads to calf susceptibility or resistance to EEHV-HD.

AB  - Simple Summary In the present study, laboratory analyses conducted on unusual forages have been used to calculate various parameters and define some quality indexes using different equations. It was found that the quality of unusual forages decreased during the growth but maintained a high level. Different indexes were used to evaluate the forage quality. The Relative Feed Value and the Relative Forage Quality indexes, when calculated with the formula for legumes, correctly summarized the trend of the nutritional characteristics of the unusual forages at different maturity stages. The quality of a forage influences the production of animals, and it can be defined in many ways. Laboratory analyses are important tools because they can be used to indicate the quality of the forages, and they represent a relatively quick way of defining their nutritive values. However, specific quality indexes are necessary to evaluate and rank forages. The quality of conventional forages is predicted by different indexes, according to whether they are legumes or grasses. However, no indications are given about what formulae should be used for unusual forages. In the present study, laboratory analyses have been conducted on three unusual crops belonging to three different botanical families (amaranth, borage, and camelina) at four growth stages, and conventional quality indexes have been calculated and applied to establish their quality. The obtained results have shown that the nutritive value of the unusual forages modified during the growth, although they always maintained a high quality. Hence, the Relative Feed Value of unusual forages can be measured using the ADF content or digestibility value. The Relative Forage Quality, calculated with the legume formula, seems more appropriate for the considered unusual forages as it was able to reveal any changes that took place during maturity.

AB  - Simple Summary A change in hematology profiles is one indicator of EEHV infection before clinical signs appear; however, to be effective, individual baselines and age-matched reference values are needed. A longitudinal investigation of viremia, hematology values, and stress biomarkers was performed in three non-EEHV and six prior infected EEHV calves to better understand EEHV-HD-associated factors. Blood, saliva, and feces were collected for 1 year for analysis of complete blood count (CBC), viral load, glucocorticoids (GCs), and Immunoglobulin A (IgA). Results did not differ between the groups, except for one elephant that presented with EEHV-HD during the study and exhibited high viremia, altered hematology profiles, and decreased stress biomarker concentrations. Thus, as in other studies, hematology changes were associated with EEHV infection, while preliminary data in one calf suggests that stress-response measures might also be informative and warrant further investigation. Elephant endotheliotropic herpesvirus hemorrhagic disease (EEHV-HD) is a virulent disease that causes severe hemorrhage and sudden death in Asian elephant calves. A change in hematology profiles is one indicator of infection before clinical signs appear; however, to be effective, individual baselines and age-matched reference values are needed. Stress has been speculated to be a factor in clinical EEHV cases, but relationships have not been demonstrated empirically. This study evaluated blood hematology and several stress response markers-salivary cortisol, fecal glucocorticoid metabolites (FGM), salivary Immunoglobulin A (SIgA), and fecal IgA (FIgA) in samples collected for 1 year from three healthy calves with no EEHV history (non-EEHV), and six that had previously been infected, developed clinical signs and survived (prior-EEHV). Hematology values between non-EEHV and prior-EEHV elephants were not different and within published reference ranges. Concentrations of salivary cortisol, FGM, SIgA, and FIgA also were variable and showed seasonal differences, but no relationships to prior EEHV status. One of the prior EEHV calves became re-infected, developed hemorrhagic disease (HD), and died during the study period. That calf exhibited lymphocytopenia, monocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Additionally, all stress biomarker concentrations were lower in the 12 days before viremia was observed. Thus, as in other studies, changes in hematology occur with EEHV infection, while preliminary data in one calf suggests that stress-response measures might also be informative and should be studied further.

AB  - Simple Summary VHSV (viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus) is a globally important group of viruses, infecting a wide range of fish species, in both marine and freshwater. New initiatives are now being taken to re-establish Atlantic cod as an aquaculture species. Any susceptibility to diseases would be relevant for this industry. Atlantic cod was experimentally infected with a strain of VHSV originating from a disease outbreak of farmed rainbow trout in Norway. The fish infected by injection did develop the disease, as verified by investigations of tissue samples. However, no transmission of the virus to cohabitant fish (i.e., individuals sharing the tank with infected fish) was found. This indicates that, despite the fact that the virus is capable of causing disease in Atlantic cod, the degree and ability to infect the fish is limited. The first known outbreak caused by a viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) strain of genotype III in rainbow trout occurred in 2007 at a marine farm in Storfjorden, Norway. The source of the virus is unknown, and cod and other marine fish around the farms are suspected as a possible reservoir. The main objective of this study was to test the susceptibility of juvenile Atlantic cod to the VHSV isolate from Storfjorden. As the pathology of VHS in cod is sparsely described, an additional aim of the study was to give a histopathological description of the disease. Two separate challenge experiments were carried out, using both intra peritoneal (ip) injection and cohabitation as challenge methods. Mortality in the ip injection experiment leveled at approximately 50% three weeks post challenge. Both immunohistochemical and rRT-PCR analysis of organs sampled from diseased and surviving fish confirmed VHSV infection. No VHSV was detected in the cohabitants. The results indicate that Atlantic cod has a low natural susceptibility to this VHSV genotype III strain. One of the most extensive pathological changes was degeneration of cardiac myocytes. Immunohistochemistry confirmed that the lesions were related to VHSV. In some fish, the hematopoietic tissue of spleen and kidney showed degeneration and immunostaining, classical signs of VHS, as described in rainbow trout. Positive immunostaining of the capillaries of the gills, suggests this organ as a useful alternative when screening for VHSV.

AB  - Simple Summary The aim of this study was to provide information about horses and ponies in equine-assisted services (EAS), particularly in the areas of selection, longevity, and retirement as little published information exists about this sector of the United States horse industry. Survey results revealed centers do use selection procedures when evaluating horses which often included initial screenings and trial periods. Horses are active in programs from anywhere less than a year to over 20 years. The greatest number of horses are active for 1-6 or 7-10 years. Horses are retired for a variety of reasons. The most common reasons include unsoundness, behavior, and other health issues. We conclude behavior, soundness, and health are key considerations when selecting and retiring horses in EAS. These areas should be focused on at an individual horse level in future research efforts. The information presented in this article helps us understand the horses in EAS programs, provides a starting point for future research, and begins to explore the unique needs of programs and horses in EAS. Little published information exists on the horses in equine-assisted services (EAS), particularly their selection, longevity, and retirement. The purpose of this study was to characterize horses and procedures used in EAS. A pilot survey was developed using focus group discussions and distributed to Professional Association of Therapeutic Horsemanship, International (PATH Intl) centers in Florida (n = 45, Part I) before further modification and distribution to members of PATH Intl., American Hippotherapy Association (AHA), eagala, and Certified Horsemanship Association (CHA) (n = 26,000, Part II). Response rates were 36% (Part I) and 0.7% (Part II). Centers report a median of 10 (Part I) or 9 (Part II) horses and ponies. Selection procedures included initial screening (Part I = 100%, Part II = 96%), pre-purchase or pre-donation exam (I = 64%, II = 60%), acclimation period (I = 100%, II = 84%), trial period (I = 91%, II = 90%), and other (II = 11%). Horses remained active in programs for less than a year to over 20 years with the greatest number working 7-10 (Part I) or 1-6 (Part II) yr. In Part I of the study, behavior (44%) was the leading cause of retirement followed by unsoundness (33%). In Part II, unsoundness was the highest ranked response followed by behavior. Behavior, soundness, and health emerged as key factors in horse selection and retirement. Future work should focus on investigating these issues at an individual horse level.

AB  - Puerarin 6''-O-acetate (P6''A), a puerarin derivative with a high stability and an improved permeability, exhibits a promising potential in drug development. The large-scale production of P6''A through green synthesis procedures has never been achieved owing to the low availability of acetyl-CoA. Herein, the enzymatic synthesis of P6''A in Escherichia coli cell factories overproducing acetyl-CoA has been achieved. Firstly, the effect of three acetyl-CoA-producing pathways on P6''A conversion in E.coli was compared comprehensively. The pathways containing acetyl-CoA synthetase (ACS) or the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex were thereby identified as favorable fluxes yielding more acetyl-CoA. Hence, cells co-expressing ACS and the PDH complex were selected as cell factories overproducing acetyl-CoA owing to the positive cooperativity of ACS and PDH. Subsequently, the maa gene encoding maltose acetyltransferase (MAT) was introduced into these acetyl-CoA-producing cell factories to form engineered strains Q1-Q14. After condition optimization, the engineered strain Q5 got a P6 '' A yield of 0.98 g L-1 in M9P-Glc medium supplemented with 2.5 mM puerarin and 1.5% glucose. To further improve P6 '' A production, the maa gene in Q5 was replaced by a mutant maaE125N gene to generate another engineered strain (Q15). Microbial production of P6''A in Q15 was achieved through the centrifuge tube culture, the shake-flask culture and the 6-L reactor culture and the highest P6'' A yield of up to 2.02 g L-1 was obtained in the reactor fermentation. Enzymatically synthesized P6''A displayed a high stability in human and mouse plasma, a dose-dependent cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells and an improved liposolubility. This research provides a feasible procedure for the green synthesis of puerarin monoesters and lays a foundation for druggability research on P6''A.

AB  - Simple Summary During the first days after parturition, mammalian milk (colostrum) is specifically formulated to nourish newborns. Immunoglobulins are a particularly important component for newborn New World camelids, as their immune system is almost totally dependent on the intestinal transfer of colostral immunoglobulins to acquire passive immunity. In this study, colostrum samples were collected from 20 alpaca mares in the first four days after parturition and analyzed for their immunoglobulin concentration. Sampling started on the day of parturition. The associations of immunoglobulins with other components were determined. The immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentrations decreased significantly within the first four days after parturition. The correlation coefficients between IgG content and the content of various minerals were significant but variable. The correlation between IgG content and fat and lactose content was negative but between IgG content and protein content was highly positive. This strong association could be used for a brief estimation of the IgG content of the colostrum based on the measured protein concentration. The results of the present study can be used for the development of colostrum replacers where motherless rearing is required. Colostrum provides the newborn with nutrients and immunoglobulins. Immunoglobulins and their intestinal transfer play a major role in the immune system of neonates since they are born agammaglobulinemic. In this study immunoglobulin G (IgG) content was determined in alpaca colostrum and the correlations of the IgG concentration by fat, protein, lactose and minerals were calculated. Colostrum samples were collected daily from 20 multiparous alpaca mares during the first four days after parturition. The IgG concentrations were determined by radial immunodiffusion using a Camelid IgG Test Kit. The IgG concentration decreased significantly from 26,319 mg/dL on day 1 to 3848.8 mg/dL on day 4. There were significant correlations between IgG concentration and the other components of the colostrum. While the correlations between IgG and fat (r = -0.69, p <= 0.001) and lactose (r = -0.64, p <= 0.001) were negative, the correlations with protein (r = 0.91, p <= 0.001), magnesium (r = 0.86, p <= 0.001) and cobalt (r = 0.87, p <= 0.001) were strongly positive. Due to the strong association, the colostrum protein concentration could be used for a brief estimation of the IgG content.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Paradise fish (Macropodus opercularis) has been a favored subject of behavioral research during the last decades of the 20th century. Lately, however, with a massively expanding genetic toolkit and a well annotated, fully sequenced genome, zebrafish (Danio rerio) became a central model of recent behavioral research. But, as the zebrafish behavioral repertoire is less complex than that of the paradise fish, the focus on zebrafish is a compromise. With the advent of novel methodologies, we think it is time to bring back paradise fish and develop it into a modern model of behavioral and evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo) studies. The first step is to define the housing and husbandry conditions that can make a paradise fish a relevant and trustworthy model. Here, we define the relevant welfare parameters for keeping a healthy population of paradise fish and provide a detailed description of our recent experience in raising and successfully breeding this species under laboratory conditions.
   Thanks to its small size, external fertilization and fecundity, over the past four decades, zebrafish (Danio rerio) has become the dominant fish model species in biological and biomedical research. Multiple lines of evidence, however, suggest that the reliance on only a handful of genetic model organisms is problematic, as their unique evolutionary histories makes them less than ideal to study biological questions unrelated to their historically contingent adaptations. Therefore, a need has emerged to develop novel model species, better suited for studying particular problems. The paradise fish (Macropodus opercularis) has a much more complex behavioral repertoire than zebrafish and has been a favored model animal in ethological research during the last decades of the previous century. We believe that with currently available, easily adaptable genetic toolkits, this species could be easily developed into a popular model of behavioral genetics. Despite its earlier popularity, however, the description of a detailed housing and husbandry protocol for this species is still missing from scientific literature. We present here a detailed description of how to raise and breed paradise fish successfully under laboratory conditions, and also discuss some of the challenges we faced while creating a stable breeding population for this species in our facility.

AB  - Background: Emerging infectious diseases threaten human and animal health, with most pathogens originating from wildlife. Bats are natural hosts for many infectious agents. Previous studies have demonstrated that changes in some specific genes in bats may contribute to resistance to viral infections, but they have mostly overlooked the immune function of the bat gut microbiota. Aims: In this study, we used fecal transplants to transfer the gut microbiota from the Greater Horseshoe Bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) into mice treated with antibiotics. The gut microbiota changes in mice were detected using 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing technology. Flow cytometry was used to detect changes in associated immune cells in the spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes of the mice. Results: The results showed that the gut microbiota of mice showed characteristics of some bat gut microbiota. The Greater Horseshoe Bat's gut microbiota changed some immune cells' composition in the spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes of mice and also conferred a faster and higher proportion of natural killer cell activation. Conclusion: This result provides new evidence for the regulatory immune function of bat gut microbiota and contributes to a deeper insight into the unique immune system of bats.

AB  - Recently, it has been demonstrated that in sarcopenic obesity (SO), physical activity could improve cognitive functions. Moreover, previous studies suggested that muscle contraction could influence cognitive function via myokines. This study investigated the potential effects of resistant exercise on cognitive and muscle functions in SO. SO was induced by a high-fat diet treatment for 8 weeks in 8-month-old male C57BL/6J mice. Then, resistant exercise (ladder climbing) for 8 weeks was performed. Muscle and cognitive function tests and morphological analysis were conducted. The protein levels of myokines were investigated in muscle, plasma, and the hippocampus in sarcopenic obese mice. Muscle and cognitive functions were significantly elevated in the obesity-exercise group (EX) compared to the obesity-control group (OB). Interestingly, muscle function was positively correlated with cognitive function. Abnormal morphological changes in the hippocampus were ameliorated in EX compared to OB, but not in the muscle. Protein levels of cognitive function-related myokines and energy metabolism-related markers in EX were significantly elevated in both muscle and hippocampus compared to those in OB. Interestingly, the protein level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in EX was simultaneously increased in all tissues including muscle, plasma, and hippocampus compared to that in OB. In conclusion, modulation of muscle-derived cognitive function-related myokines in various pathological conditions via a resistant exercise could be a possible way of relieving muscle and cognitive dysfunction.

AB  - Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is the main cause of death in the whole world. This study aimed to investigate whether forkhead box O4 (FoxO4) could negatively modulate ubiquitin specific peptidase 10 (USP10) transcription to aggravate the apoptosis and oxidative stress of hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-induced cardiomyocytes through Hippo/YAP pathway. mRNA expression as well as protein expressions of USP10 and FoxO4 in H9C2 cells after H/R induction or transfection were respectively detected by Reverse transcription-quantitative (RT-q) PCR analysis and Western blot. The viability and apoptosis of H9C2 cells after H/R induction or transfection were respectively detected by CCK-8 and TUNEL assays. The expressions of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in H9C2 cells after H/R induction or transfection were analyzed using appropriate kits and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were detected using a ROS Assay Kit. Dual luciferase reporter assay and Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) have adopted to confirm the combination of USP10 and FoxO4. Western blot was also used to analyze the expression of apoptosis-related proteins and Hippo/YAP pathway-related proteins. As a result, USP10 expression was decreased in H/R-induced H9C2 cells in a time-dependent manner. USP10 overexpression increased the viability and suppressed the apoptosis and oxidative stress of H/R-induced H9C2 cells. In addition, FoxO4 modulated USP10 transcription. FoxO4 expression was increased in H9C2 cells induced by H/R. FoxO4 overexpression could reverse the protective effects of USP10 overexpression on H/R-induced H9C2 cells by regulating the Hippo/YAP signaling pathway. In conclusion, FoxO4 negatively modulated USP10 transcription to aggravate the apoptosis and oxidative stress of H/R-induced H9C2 cells via blocking Hippo/YAP pathway.

AB  - Increased neurogenesis elicits antidepressive-like effects. The antidiabetic drug metformin (Met) reportedly promotes hippocampal neurogenesis, which ameliorates spatial memory deficits and depression-like behaviors. However, the precise molecular mechanisms underpinning Met-induced neuronal differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs) remain unclear. We showed that Met enhanced neuronal differentiation of NSCs via Gadd45g but not Gadd45a and Gadd45b. We further found that Gadd45g increased demethylation of neurogenic differentiation 1 promoter by regulating the activity of passive and active DNA demethylation enzymes through an adenylate-activated protein kinase -independent mechanism in Met-treated NSCs. Importantly, genetic deficiency of Gadd45g decreased hippocampal neurogenesis, which could contribute to spatial memory decline, and depression-like behaviors in the adult mice, whereas forced expression of Gadd45g alleviated the depressive-like behaviors. Our findings provide a model that Gadd45g-mediated DNA demethylation contributes to Met-induced neuronal genesis and its antidepressant-like effects and propose the concept that targeting Gadd45g regulation of neurogenesis might serve as a novel antidepressant strategy.

AB  - Hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) exposure has been linked with gastrointestinal toxicity, whereas the molecular pathways and key targets remain elusive. Computational toxicology analysis predicted the correlation between protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and genes regarding Cr(VI)-induced intestinal injury. Here, we generated a mouse model with intestinal epithelium-specific fi c knock out of Ppp2r1a (encoding PP2A Aa a subunit) to investigate the mechanisms underlying Cr(VI)induced small intestinal toxicity. Heterozygous (HE) mice and matched WT littermates were administrated with Cr(VI) at 0, 5, 20, and 80 mg/l for 28 successive days. Cr(VI) treatment led to crypt hyperplasia, epithelial cell apoptosis, and intestinal barrier dysfunction, accompanied by the decline of goblet cell counts and Occludin expression in WT mice. Notably, these effects were aggravated in HE mice, indicating that PP2A Aa a deficiency fi ciency conferred mice with susceptibility to Cr(VI)-induced intestinal injury. The combination of data analysis and biological experiments revealed Cr(VI) exposure could decrease YAP1 phosphorylation at Ser127 but increase protein expression and activity, together with elevated transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif protein driving epithelial crypt cells proliferation following damage, suggesting the involvement of Hippo/YAP1 signaling pathway in Cr(VI)-induced intestinal toxicity. Nevertheless, the enhanced phosphorylation of YAP1 in HE mice resulted in proliferation/repair defects in intestinal epithelium, thereby exacerbating Cr(VI)-induced gut barrier dysfunction. Notably, by molecular docking and further studies, we identified fi ed urolithin A, a microbial metabolite, attenuated Cr(VI)-induced disruption of intestinal barrier function, partly by modulating YAP1 expression and activity. Our fi ndings reveal the novel molecular pathways participated in Cr(VI)-caused small intestinal injury and urolithin A could potentially protect against environmental hazards-induced intestinal diseases.

AB  - The strategy to reuse the mycelium grown in solid-state cultivation for enzyme production was developed in this work. Also, the nutrients and syringe-type bioreactor necessary for the enzymatic production have also been tested to make the process more sustainable and less onerous. For the best condition of supplementation in the mycelia turnover system, the enzymatic activities over filter paper were 5 times and 2 times higher than the ones found in the conventional production by Penicillium echinulatum S1M29 and Trichoderma reesei RUT C30, respectively. A xylanase activity of 1303 U/g by P. echinulatum S1M29 was reported in this work after the four cycles of extraction, showing the efficiency of this novel strategy for this fungus. The reuse of the mycelium in solid-state cultivation proved to be a promising strategy to increase production and productivity and reduce the amounts of inputs used in enzyme production processes.

AB  - There is now a relatively large body of evidence suggesting a relationship between dysfunction of myelin and oligodendrocytes and the etiology of several neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression and schizophrenia, and also suggesting that ultrasound methods may alleviate some of the symptoms of depression. We have applied low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) to the brains of mice treated with the demyelinating drug cuprizone, a drug that has been used as the basis for a rodent model relevant to a number of psychiatric and neurologic disorders including depression, schizophrenia, and multiple sclerosis. Prior to conducting the studies in mice, preliminary studies were carried out on the effects of LIPUS in vitro in neuron-like SH-SY5Y cells and primary glial cells. In subsequent studies in mice, female C57BL/6 mice were restrained in plastic tubes for 20 min daily with the ultrasound transducer near the end of the tube directly above the mouse's head. LIPUS was used at an intensity of 25 mW/cm(2) once daily for 22 days in control mice and in mice undergoing daily repetitive restraint stress (RRS). Behavioral or neurochemical studies were done on the mice or the brain tissue obtained from them. The studies in vitro indicated that LIPUS stimulation at an intensity of 15 mW/cm(2) delivered for 5 min daily for 3 days in an enclosed sterile cell culture plate in an incubator increased the viability of SH-SY5Y and primary glial cells. In the studies in mice, LIPUS elevated levels of doublecortin, a marker for neurogenesis, in the cortex compared to levels in the RRS mice and caused a trend in elevation of brain levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the hippocampus relative to control levels. LIPUS also increased sucrose preference (a measure of the attenuation of anhedonia, a common symptom of several psychiatric disorders) in the RRS model in mice. The ability of LIPUS administered daily to rescue damaged myelin and oligodendrocytes was studied in mice treated chronically with cuprizone for 35 days. LIPUS increased cortex and corpus callosum levels of myelin basic protein, a protein marker for mature oligodendrocytes, and neural/glial antigen 2, a protein marker for oligodendrocyte precursor cells, relative to levels in the cuprizone + sham animals. These results of this exploratory study suggest that future comprehensive time-related studies with LIPUS on brain chemistry and behavior related to neuropsychiatric disorders are warranted.

AB  - Background Studies showed the protective role of Salvia in traditional medicine against neurodegenerative diseases. Salvia macilenta is one of the potent antioxidant herbs among Salvia species against oxidative stress. In the current study, the effect of oral administration of S. macilenta in the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory activities of A beta-injected male albino Wistar rats was determined. Methods Rats were received S. macilenta (50 mg/kg/day) orally, for ten successive days and then some of them received A beta (10 ng/mu l) in their hippocampus (CA1 region). Proteins involved in antioxidant defense system and inflammatory signaling pathways in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex were evaluated using Western blotting technique. To study apoptosis, Western blotting technique and histological staining were used. Catalase activity, glutathione peroxidase (GSH) and nitric oxide levels were measured. Results Results demonstrated that S. macilenta increased Nrf2 protein level and decreased TNF alpha and IL-6 protein level in A beta-injected rats compared to the A beta-injected group in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Histological analysis showed pretreatment with S. macilenta decreased apoptosis levels in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, about 41 and 42%, compared to A beta-injected rats, respectively. This study showed that catalase activity was changed in the S. macilenta + A beta group compared to the A beta-injected rats. Also, GSH level was increased in the S. macilenta + A beta group compared to the A beta-injected rat. Conclusion Orally treatment of S. macilenta extract in A beta-injected rats could ameliorate protective pathways and, so, it can be one of the proposed dietary supplements for the prevention of Alzheimer's disease and dementia.

AB  - Simple Summary: African elephants are highly social animals that perform a so-called Greeting Ceremony in the wild when meeting elephants they are familiar with but have not seen for a certain timespan. Until now, it has not been known whether zoo elephants also show this unique behaviour. Therefore, this study was designed around the reunifications of two mother-daughter pairs that had been separated for 2 and 12 years, and two unifications of unrelated elephants, as a comparison. First contact was conducted in a protected setting, i.e., there was a fence between the animals to prevent possible fighting. Signs of the Greeting Ceremony shown by the elephants, the distance they kept to the separating fence, and the time until the elephants' trunks touched for the first time were observed. The results demonstrate that the related elephants showed all behavioural characteristic of the Greeting Ceremony, kept close to the fence, and touched trunks after only a few seconds, while elephants that were not familiar with each other did not show a full Greeting Ceremony, stayed further from the fence, and touched trunks for the first time only after several minutes upon meeting. This study testifies that zoo elephants show the same typical social behaviour known from wild elephants (namely the Greeting Ceremony) and, therefore, behave species-specific. It also confirms the strong family bonds of elephants and the cognitive abilities of elephants, specifically their long-term social memory.
   & nbsp;</p>
   The introduction of elephants into new groups is necessary for breeding programmes. However, behavioural studies on the reactions of these animals at first encounters are missing. In the present study, female African elephants (Loxodonta africana) living in zoos were observed during unifications with unfamiliar elephants (introduction of two to one females and one to two females; n = 6) and reunifications with related elephants (two mother-daughter-pairs; n = 4) that were separated for 2 and 12 years, respectively. First encounters of the elephants were observed and recorded by scan sampling. The parameters measured were (a) signs of the characteristic Greeting Ceremony, (b) distance to the fence separating the elephants during first contact, and (c) time until trunks touched for the first time. The data were statistically analysed with SPSS. The results showed that related elephants performed a full Greeting Ceremony on reunifications. Unrelated elephants only expressed a minor greeting. During first encounters, related elephants predominantly showed affiliative behaviour (p = 0.001), whilst unrelated elephants expressed more agonistic behaviour (p = 0.001). The distance to the fence was significantly smaller for related elephants than for unrelated elephants (p = 0.038). first contact of trunks occurred on average after 3.00 s. in related elephants and 1026.25 s. in unrelated elephants. These findings indicate that related elephants recognise their kin after up to 12 years of separation, meet them with a full Greeting Ceremony during reunification, and seek contact to the related elephant, while unrelated elephants are hesitant during unifications with unfamiliar elephants and express more agonistic behaviour. The results testify that zoo elephants show the same species-specific social behaviour as their conspecifics in the wild. It also confirms the cognitive abilities of elephants and the significance of matrilines for breeding programmes.</p>

AB  - The demand for animal products has significantly increased over the past decades as a result of the growing population and the heightened standards of living. Increased livestock farming does not only yield desired products but also significant quantities of wastes, particularly manure whose storage and application are being monitored with a tightening network of regulations. The problem is that manure is considered merely as a substrate for biogas production or as a fertilizer, whereas the substantial portion of fibers residing in herbivore manure has remained underutilized. Here, we propose a manure management system, in which not only biogas and fertilizer precursors but also high-value materials in the form of (nano)cellulose are produced. We show that high biogas yields can be achieved for elephant manure and the remaining substrate enables effortless isolation of cellulose nanofibers, leading to a significant reduction of the environmental impact compared with traditional systems based on wood.

AB  - Background: Malnutrition during pregnancy and the first 1000 days of life can impair brain function and hippocampus development. Research has shown that protein deficiency (PD) in pregnant and lactating mothers can lead to neurocognitive issues from early life into adulthood. Moringa oleifera has been used as a dietary supplement for malnutrition; however, its neuroprotective effects on offspring with PD are unclear. Aims: This study aimed to investigate the effects of ethanol leaf extract of Moringa oleifera (EEMO) on rat offspring born to mothers who experienced protein deficiency during pregnancy and lactation. Methods: Female Sprague Dawley rats were given low (9% protein) or normal protein diets (18% protein) during pregnancy and lactation. Afterward, EEMO was administered to the offspring starting from the end of lactation for 5 weeks. Results: Offspring from mothers with protein deficiency showed low birth weight, slow weight gain, low BMI, low albumin levels, and anemia compared to those born with mothers fed with a standard protein diet. However, pups treated with EEMO showed higher cognitive improvement and a decrease in the ratio of abnormal to normal cells in the cornu ammoni (CA) CA1, CA2, CA3, and CA4 regions of the hippocampus. Conclusions: The present study suggests that EEMO supplementation could improve conditions of protein deficiency and cognitive function, making it a cost-effective dietary supplement for addressing these issues.

AB  - Microenvironmental factors, including substrate stiffness, regulate stem cell behavior and differentiation. However, the effects of substrate stiffness on the behavior of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)- derived embryoid bodies (EB) remain unclear. To investigate the effects of mechanical cues on iPSC-EB differentiation, a 3D hydrogel-sandwich culture (HGSC) system is developed that controls the microenvironment surrounding iPSC-EBs using a stiffness-tunable polyacrylamide hydrogel assembly. Mouse iPSC-EBs are seeded between upper and lower polyacrylamide hydrogels of differing stiffness (Young's modulus [E'] = 54.3 +/- 7.1 kPa [hard], 28.1 +/- 2.3 kPa [moderate], and 5.1 +/- 0.1 kPa [soft]) and cultured for 2 days. HGSC induces stiffness-dependent activation of the yes-associated protein (YAP) mechanotransducer and actin cytoskeleton rearrangement in the iPSC-EBs. Moreover, moderate-stiffness HGSC specifically upregulates the mRNA and protein expression of ectoderm and mesoderm lineage differentiation markers in iPSC-EBs via YAP-mediated mechanotransduction. Pretreatment of mouse iPSC-EBs with moderate-stiffness HGSC promotes cardiomyocyte (CM) differentiation and structural maturation of myofibrils. The proposed HGSC system provides a viable platform for investigating the role of mechanical cues on the pluripotency and differentiation of iPSCs that can be beneficial for research into tissue regeneration and engineering.

AB  - Dysfunction of neuronal nitric oxide synthase contributes to neurotoxicity, which triggers cell death in various neuropathological diseases, including epilepsy. Studies have shown that inhibition of neuronal nitric oxide synthase activity increases the epilepsy threshold, that is, has an anticonvulsant effect. However, the exact role and potential mechanism of neuronal nitric oxide synthase in seizures are still unclear. In this study, we performed RNA sequencing, functional enrichment analysis, and weighted gene coexpression network analysis of the hippocampus of tremor rats, a rat model of genetic epilepsy. We found damaged hippocampal mitochondria and abnormal succinate dehydrogenase level and Na+-K+-ATPase activity. In addition, we used a pilocarpine-induced N2a cell model to mimic epileptic injury. After application of neuronal nitric oxide synthase inhibitor 7-nitroindazole, changes in malondialdehyde, lactate dehydrogenase and superoxide dismutase, which are associated with oxidative stress, were reversed, and the increase in reactive oxygen species level was reversed by 7-nitroindazole or reactive oxygen species inhibitor N-acetylcysteine. Application of 7-nitroindazole or N-acetylcysteine downregulated the expression of caspase-3 and cytochrome c and reversed the apoptosis of epileptic cells. Furthermore, 7-nitroindazole or N-acetylcysteine downregulated the abnormally high expression of NLRP3, gasdermin-D, interleukin-1 beta and interleukin-18. This indicated that 7-nitroindazole and N-acetylcysteine each reversed epileptic cell death. Taken together, our findings suggest that the neuronal nitric oxide synthase/reactive oxygen species pathway is involved in pyroptosis of epileptic cells, and inhibiting neuronal nitric oxide synthase activity or its induced oxidative stress may play a neuroprotective role in epilepsy.

AB  - BackgroudThe recurrence rate of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) is positively correlated with eosinophil infiltration. Increased interleukin (IL)-19 and eosinophil chemokine RANTES levels have been reported in patients with CRSwNP. This study aimed to clarify the role of IL-19 in mediating RANTES expression and eosinophilic infiltration in eosinophilic CRSwNP (Eos CRSwNP).MethodsNasal tissue samples were obtained from patients with CRSwNP and controls. The expression of IL-19, its receptors, ECP, and RANTES in tissues was investigated. Primary human nasal epithelial cells (HNECs) and nasal polyp tissue blocks were cultured, then stimulated by IL-19; ERK phosphorylation, NF-kappa B pathway activation, RANTES level, eosinophils migration and infiltration were detected using RT-qPCR, ELISA, western blotting, HE, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence staining, confocal microscopy, and transwell migration assay.ResultsThe expression of IL-19 and its receptors (IL-20R1/IL-20R2), eosinophil cationic protein, and RANTES in nasal tissues from patients with Eos CRSwNP was significantly increased compared to that in non-Eos CRSwNP and control subjects. IL-19 co-localized with RANTES in nasal tissues and significantly elevated RANTES expression in HNECs. IL-19-blocking antibody and siRNA knockdown of IL-20R1 ameliorated the effect of IL-19 on RANTES secretion in HNECs. Moreover, IL-19-induced RANTES upregulation was associated with the activation of the ERK and NF-kappa B pathways. NF-kappa B activation was mediated by the ERK pathway in IL-19-treated HNECs, and IL-19 enhanced eosinophil infiltration in nasal polyp tissue blocks.ConclusionsOur findings indicate that IL-19 promotes RANTES expression via the ERK/NF-kappa B pathway in HNECs and is implicated in eosinophil infiltration in patients with Eos CRSwNP.

AB  - Using next generation sequencing of dried blood spots and subsequent validation, Ponnusamy et al identify let-7b-5p as an elevated microRNA in neonates with moderate to severe encephalopathy. Using cell culture and murine models of perinatal brain injury they demonstrate that the effects of let-7b-5p are elicited via the Hippo-YAP pathway, which should be validated in large neonate cohorts to expand our understanding of let-7b-5p as a biomarker for neonatal encephalopathy.
   Despite increasing knowledge on microRNAs, their role in the pathogenesis of neonatal encephalopathy remains to be elucidated. Herein, we identify let-7b-5p as a significant microRNA in neonates with moderate to severe encephalopathy from dried blood spots using next generation sequencing. Validation studies using Reverse Transcription and quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction on 45 neonates showed that let-7b-5p expression was increased on day 1 in neonates with moderate to severe encephalopathy with unfavourable outcome when compared to those with mild encephalopathy. Mechanistic studies performed on glucose deprived cell cultures and the cerebral cortex of two animal models of perinatal brain injury, namely hypoxic-ischaemic and intrauterine inflammation models confirm that let-7b-5p is associated with the apoptotic Hippo pathway. Significant reduction in neuronal let-7b-5p expression corresponded with activated Hippo pathway, with increased neuronal/nuclear ratio of Yes Associated Protein (YAP) and increased neuronal cleaved caspase-3 expression in both animal models. Similar results were noted for let-7b-5p and YAP expression in glucose-deprived cell cultures. Reduced nuclear YAP with decreased intracellular let-7b-5p correlated with neuronal apoptosis in conditions of metabolic stress. This finding of the Hippo-YAP association with let-7b needs validation in larger cohorts to further our knowledge on let-7b-5p as a biomarker for neonatal encephalopathy.

AB  - Maternal separation (MS) is a model to induce permanent alternations in the central nervous system (CNS) and is associated with increased levels of anxiety and cognitive deficiencies. Since methyl donor choline (Ch) has been shown to play a significant role in learning and memory and enhance synaptic plasticity, the authors hypothesized that Ch may attenuate MS-induced impairments in synaptic plasticity and cognitive performance. Rat pups underwent an MS protocol for 180 min/day from postnatal day (PND) 1 to 21. Ch was administered subcutaneously (100 mg/kg, 21 days) to the choline chloride and MS + choline chloride groups from PND 29 to 49. Anxiety-like behaviour, recognition memory, and spatial and passive avoidance learning and memory were measured in the adolescent rats. In addition, evoked field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSP) were recorded from the CA1 region of the hippocampus. MS induced higher anxiety-like behaviour in the animals. It also impaired learning and memory. However, MS had no effect on locomotor activity. Subcutaneous administration of Ch attenuated MS-induced cognitive deficits and enhanced the learning and memory of MS rats. Ch also decreased anxiety-like behaviour in the open-field test. The present results showed that long-term potentiation (LTP) was induced in all groups except MS and MS + saline animals. However, Ch injection induced LTP and had maintenance in MS + choline chloride, but it was not statistically significant compared with the MS group. In summary, the present findings indicate that MS can interfere with normal animal's cognition and subcutaneous of Ch may be considered an appropriate therapeutic strategy for promoting cognitive dysfunctions in MS animals.

AB  - Simple Summary All elephant species are now endangered or critically endangered. It is extremely important for the veterinary care of elephants to be effective at diagnosing diseases and monitoring treatment. Routine blood cell testing is a standard method for monitoring elephant health and detecting possible infections. Elephants naturally have different ratios of white blood cells (WBCs; immune cells) in their blood compared to other animals, with unusually high percentages of one cell type (monocytes). Because elephant WBCs also look different from those of most other animals, a person must identify the cells under the microscope instead of using machine analysis. These elephant-specific WBC features may be important in fighting diseases, but very little is known about elephant monocytes. The aims of this study were to establish methods for isolating elephant monocytes, studying their function, and accurately identifying them using flow cytometry, a more precise technique than microscopy. Blood from Asian elephants was used. Methods were created and tested. An approach to identifying elephant monocytes using flow cytometry was established. These results will lead to better studies of the elephant immune system and can help to more accurately count WBCs in elephant samples.Abstract Optimal veterinary care of managed elephant populations is vital due to the continued decline of wild populations. Appropriate health monitoring and accurate disease diagnosis include hematologic evaluation. Elephant hematology is distinctive in that elephants have high percentages of monocytes in health. Elephant monocytes also have unusual morphology, a feature shared with manatees and rock hyraxes. Manual white blood cell counting is used for elephant hematology, as analyzers are generally inaccurate. The aims of this study were to evaluate basic cell isolation and functional testing protocols for use in elephant monocyte research, and to test several available antibodies via flow cytometry for use in elephant monocyte identification. Peripheral blood samples from five Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) were used. Methods for monocyte isolation and evaluation of phagocytic function were established. Putative lymphocyte and monocyte populations were identified using a scatter on flow cytometry. Antibodies against CD11b, CD11c, CD14, and ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (IBA1) were tested, with IBA1 showing the highest apparent diagnostic utility in labeling monocytes. Combined flow cytometric scatter and IBA1 positivity appear to identify Asian elephant monocytes. These data provide a methodologic basis for further investigation into elephant monocyte function and immune response to infection.

AB  - Within the southern African elephant tourism industry, chaining or tethering elephants is still a relatively routine practice, despite the known negative impacts. Cited reasons for chaining include fear of aggressive interactions between elephants when handlers are absent, or a general increase in expression of aggressive behaviours (both to other elephants and to their human handlers). In Zimbabwe, concerns expressed include the danger of elephants escaping and entering human-inhabited areas. Four male semi-captive elephants at a Zimbabwe tourist facility were taken off overnight (similar to 12 h) tethers and were placed in small pens ('bomas'), approximate sizes from 110 m(2) to 310 m(2)), as part of a strategy to improve elephant welfare. Behavioural data were collected from overnight videos from December 2019 to March 2020, between 18:00 to 06:00, using focal, instantaneous sampling (5-min interval). Data were collected for three nights at three time periods: (i) Tethered; (ii) approximately four weeks post-release; (iii) approximately eight weeks post-release. Behavioural change over these time points was analysed using general linear models with quasibinomial error structures. Behavioural changes indicative of improved welfare were observed following these management changes, and no significant increases in aggression were observed either between elephants, or towards their human handlers. Proportion of time engaging in lying rest was higher in the first month after release from tethering (mean +/- SD, 50 +/- 14%) than when elephants were tethered (20 +/- 18%) (p < 0.05). Additionally, although not statistically significant, stereotypies were reduced when elephants were no longer tethered (4 +/- 6% observations tethered compared to 2 +/- 2% off tethers), and positive social behaviour also increased (1 +/- 1% on tethers, 2 +/- 2% off tethers), with the greatest improvements seen in the pair-housed elephants. To improve elephant welfare in southern African tourism facilities we strongly advocate that less restrictive management practices which enable greater choice and freedom of movement overnight are implemented.

AB  - In the central nervous system of mammals, there are specialized areas, known as neurogenic niches, in which neurogenesis is observed in the postnatal period. It is believed that astrocytes in the composition of neurogenic niches play a significant role in the regulation of neurogenesis, and therefore they are considered as a promising "target" for the possible control of neurogenesis, including the use of optogenetics. In the framework of this study, we have formed an in vitro model of a neurogenic niche, consisting of cerebral endothelial cells, astrocytes, and neurospheres. Astrocytes in the neurogenic niche model expressed channelrhodopsin ChR2 and underwent photoactivation. The effect of photoactivated astrocytes on the expression profile of neurogenic niche cells was evaluated using methods of immunocytochemical analysis. It was found that intact astrocytes in the composition of the neurogenic niche promoted neuronal differentiation of stem cells, as well as the activation of astroglia expressing photosensitive proteins, changed expression of molecules characterized by intercellular interactions of pools of resting and proliferating cells in the composition of the neurogenic niche with the participation of NAD(+) (Cx43, CD38, CD157), lactate (MCT1). The registered changes reflect: (i) impaired paracrine interactions between two subpopulations of cells, one of which acts as a source of NAD(+), and another one is a consumer of NAD(+) required for processes of the intracellular signal transduction; (ii) changes in the mechanisms of lactate transport due to aberrant expression of the lactate transporter MCT1 in cells forming a pool of cells developing along the neuronal path of differentiation (but not neuronal stem cells). In general, during photostimulation of niche astrocytes, the total proliferative activity increases mainly due to neural progenitor cells, but not neural stem cells. Thus, optogenetic activation of astrocytes can become a promising tool for controlling the activity of neurogenesis processes and the formation of a local proneurogenic microenvironment in an in vitro model of the neurogenic niche.

AB  - Hypoxic-ischemic (HI) brain injury in neonatal encephalopathy triggers a wave of neuroinflammatory events attributed to causing the progressive degeneration and functional deficits seen weeks after the primary damage. The cellular processes mediating this prolonged neurodegeneration in HI injury are not sufficiently understood. Consequently, current therapies are not fully protective. In a recent study, we found significant improvements in neurologic outcomes when a small molecule antagonist for Activin-Like Kinase 5 (ALK5), a transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) receptor was used as a therapeutic in a rat model of moderate term HI. Here, we have extended those studies to a mouse preterm pup model of HI. For these studies, postnatal day 7 (P7) CD1 mice of both sexes were exposed to 35-40 minutes of HI. Beginning 3 days later, SB505124, the ALK5 receptor antagonist, was administered systemically through intraperitoneal injections performed every 12 hours for 5 days. When evaluated 23 days later, SB505124-treated mice had (similar to)2.5-fold more hippocampal area and (similar to)2-fold more thalamic tissue. Approximately (similar to)90% of the ipsilateral hemisphere (ILH) was preserved in the SB505124-treated HI mice compared to the vehicle-treated HI mice, where the ILH was (similar to)60% of its normal size. SB505124 also preserved the subcortical white matter. SB505124 treatment preserved levels of aquaporin-4 and n-cadherin, key proteins associated with blood-brain-barrier function. Importantly, SB505124 administration improved sensorimotor function as assessed by a battery of behavioral tests. Altogether these data lend additional support to the conclusion that SB505124 is a candidate neuroprotective molecule that could be an effective treatment for HI-related encephalopathy in moderately injured preterm infants.

AB  - The investigation was to determine the effect of camel milk fermented with Limosilactobacillus fermentum KGL4 (MTCC 25515) on ACE- inhibiting, anti-inflammatory, and diabetes-preventing properties and also to release the novel peptides with antidiabetic and anti- hypertensive attributes with molecular interaction studies. Growth conditions were optimised on the basis of total peptide production by inoculating the culture in camel milk at different rates ( 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5%) along with different incubation periods (12, 24, 36, and 48 h). However, after 48 h of fermentation with a 2.5% rate of inoculum, the highest proteolytic activity was obtained. Reverse phase high-pressure liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) was used to calculate the % Rpa from permeates of 3 kDa and 10 kDa fractions. Molecular weight distributions of fermented and unfermented camel milk protein fractions were compared using SDS-PAGE. Spots obtained from 2D gel electrophoresis were separated on the basis of pH and molecular weight. Spots obtained from 2D gel were digested with trypsin, and the digested samples were subjected to RP-LC/MS for the generation of peptide sequences. The inhibition of tumour necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-6, and interleukin-1 during fermentation was studied using RAW 264.7 macrophages. In the study, fermented camel milk with KGL4 (CMKGL4) inhibited LPS- induced nitric oxide (NO) production and pro-inflammatory cytokine production (TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1 beta) by the murine macrophages. The results showed that the peptide structures (YLEELHRLNK and YLQELYPHSSLKVRPILK) exhibited considerable binding affinity against hPAM and hMGA during molecular interaction studies.

AB  - Depression is a neuropsychiatric disorder and has intrauterine developmental origins. This study aimed to confirm the depression susceptibility in offspring rats induced by prenatal dexamethasone exposure (PDE) and to further explore the intrauterine programming mechanism. Wistar rats were injected with dexamethasone (0.2 mg/kg center dot d) subcutaneously during the gestational days 9-20 and part of the offspring was given chronic stress at postnatal weeks 10-12. Behavioral results showed that the adult PDE female offspring was susceptible to depression, accompanied by increased hippocampal miR-134-5p expression and decreased sex-determining region Y-box 2 (SOX2) expression, as well as disorders of neural progenitor cells proliferation and hippocampal neurogenesis. The PDE female fetal rats presented consistent changes with the adult offspring, accompanied by the upregulation of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression and decreased sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) expression. We further found that the H3K9ac level of the miR-134-5p promoter was significantly increased in the PDE fetal hippocampus, as well as in adult offspring before and after chronic stress. In vitro, the changes of GR/SIRT1/miR-134-5p/SOX2 signal by dexamethasone were consistent with in vivo experiments, which could be reversed by GR receptor antagonist, SIRT1 agonist, and miR-134-5p inhibitor. This study confirmed that PDE led to an increased expression level as well as H3K9ac level of miR-134-5p by activating the GR/SIRT1 pathway in the fetal hippocampus and then inhibited the SOX2 expression. The programming effect mediated by the abnormal epigenetic modification could last from intrauterine to adulthood, which constitutes the intrauterine programming mechanism leading to hippocampal neurogenesis disorders and depression susceptibility in female offspring.

AB  - Ferroptosis, a newly described form of regulated cell death, is characterized by the iron-dependent accumulation of lipid peroxides, glutathione depletion, mitochondrial alterations, and enhanced lipoxygenase activity. Inhibition of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), a key intracellular antioxidant regulator, promotes ferroptosis in different cell types. Scant information is available on GPX4-induced ferroptosis in hippocampal neurons. Moreover, the role of calcium (Ca2+) signaling in ferroptosis remains elusive. Here, we report that RSL3, a selective inhibitor of GPX4, caused dendritic damage, lipid peroxidation, and induced cell death in rat primary hippocampal neurons. Previous incubation with the ferroptosis inhibitors deferoxamine or ferrostatin-1 reduced these effects. Likewise, preincubation with micromolar concentrations of ryanodine, which prevent Ca2+ release mediated by Ryanodine Receptor (RyR) channels, partially protected against RSL3-induced cell death. Incubation with RSL3 for 24 h suppressed the cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration increase induced by the RyR agonist caffeine or by the SERCA inhibitor thapsigargin and reduced hippocampal RyR2 protein content. The present results add to the current understanding of ferroptosis-induced neuronal cell death in the hippocampus and provide new information both on the role of RyR-mediated Ca2+ signals on this process and on the effects of GPX4 inhibition on endoplasmic reticulum calcium content.

AB  - Because mammalian cardiomyocytes largely cease to proliferate immediately after birth, the regenerative activity of the heart is limited. To date, much effort has been made to clarify the regulatory mechanism of cardiomyocyte proliferation because the amplification of cardiomyocytes could be a promising strategy for heart regenerative therapy. Recently, it was reported that the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3 promotes the proliferation of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs) and human iPS cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs). Additionally, Yes-associated protein (YAP) induces cardiomyocyte proliferation. The purpose of this study was to address the importance of YAP activity in cardiomyocyte proliferation induced by GSK-3 inhibitors (GSK-3Is) to develop a novel strategy for cardiomyocyte amplification. Immunofluorescent microscopic analysis using an anti-Ki-67 antibody demonstrated that the treatment of NRCMs with GSK-3Is, such as BIO and CHIR99021, increased the ratio of proliferative cardiomyocytes. YAP was localized in the nuclei of more than 95% of cardiomyocytes, either in the presence or absence of GSK-3Is, indicating that YAP was endogenously activated. GSK-3Is increased the expression of beta-catenin and promoted its translocation into the nucleus without influencing YAP activity. The knockdown of YAP using siRNA or pharmacological inhibition of YAP using verteporfin or CIL56 dramatically reduced GSK-3I-induced cardiomyocyte proliferation without suppressing beta-catenin activation. Interestingly, the inhibition of GSK-3 also induced the proliferation of hiPSC-CMs under sparse culture conditions, where YAP was constitutively activated. In contrast, under dense culture conditions, in which YAP activity was suppressed, the proliferative effects of GSK-3Is on hiPSC-CMs were not detected. Importantly, the activation of YAP by the knockdown of alpha-catenin restored the proproliferative activity of GSK-3Is. Collectively, YAP activation potentiates the GSK-3I-induced proliferation of cardiomyocytes. The blockade of GSK-3 in combination with YAP activation resulted in remarkable amplification of cardiomyocytes.

AB  - Metabolic dysfunctions, such as hyperglycemia and insulin resistance, have been associated to cognitive impairment and dementia regardless of advanced age, although the underlying mechanisms are still elusive. Thus, this study investigates the deleterious effects of metabolic syndrome (MetS) induced by long-term exposure to a high-sucrose diet on motor and cognitive functions of male adult rats and its relationship with hippocampal endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Weaned Wistar male rats were fed a high-sucrose diet until adulthood (HSD; 6 months old) and compared to both age-matched (CTR; 6 months old) and middle-aged chow-fed rats (OLD; 20 months old). MetS development, serum redox profile, behavioral, motor, and cognitive functions, and hippocampal gene/protein expressions for ER stress pro-adaptive and pro-apoptotic pathways, as well as senescence markers were assessed. Prolonged exposure to HSD induced MetS hallmarked by body weight gain associated to central obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, insulin resistance, and oxidative stress. Furthermore, HSD rats showed motor and cognitive decline similar to that in OLD animals. Noteworthy, HSD rats presented marked hippocampal ER stress characterized by failure of pro-adaptive signaling and increased expression of Chop, p21, and Parp-1 cleavage, markers of cell death and aging. This panorama resembles that found in OLD rats. In toto, our data showed that early and sustained exposure to a high-sucrose diet induced MetS, which subsequently led to hippocampus homeostasis disruption and premature impairment of motor and cognitive functions in adult rats.

AB  - Apples Malus domestica, known as a rich source of triterpene acids, induced more variety and quantity of triterpene acids in response to herbivory or mechanical damage. There were 3 major induced compounds: pomaceic acid and euscaphic acid, both of which are known apple triterpene acids, and 2 alpha,19 alpha-dihydroxy-3-oxours-12-en-28-oic acid (named eriobotoric acid), which was first identified in apples. In this study, the 3 compounds' induction curves after damage, varietal differences in induction amounts, and physiological roles against pest insects were further investigated. Eriobotoric acid showed clear antifeedant activity against lepidopteran insect Spodoptera litura but not against apple pests.

AB  - Investigation of neural growth and connection is crucial in the field of neural tissue engineering. Here, using a femtosecond laser direct writing (fs-DLW) technique, we propose a directionally aligned porous microtube array as a culture system for accelerating the growth of neurons and directing the connection of neurites. These microtubes exhibited an unprece-dented guidance effect toward the outgrowth of primary embryonic rat hippocampal neurons, with a wrap resembling the myelin sheaths of neurons. The speed of neurite growth inside these microtubes was significantly faster than that outside these microtubes. We also achieved selective/directing connection of neural networks inside the magnetic microtubes via precise microtube delivery to a gap between two neural clusters. This work not only proposes a powerful microtube platform for accelerated growth of neurons but also offers a new idea for constructing biological neural circuits by arranging the size, location, and pattern of microtubes.

AB  - Background/Objectives: Spermatogenesis is a key process in male reproduction that, if it does not happen correctly, can lead to infertility, with diabetes being one of the most prevalent causes of spermatogenesis disruption. Currently, there is a lack of research examining the potential benefits of targeting cell proliferation to enhance spermatogenesis in this condition. XMU-MP1 has been identified as an inhibitor of MST1, a core component of the Hippo pathway, which is anticipated to promote proliferation and regeneration. This study aims to evaluate the effects of XMU-MP1 treatment on sperm and testicular characteristics in mice. Methods: We used the STZ-induced diabetic mouse model to investigate the impact of administering XMU-MP1 on testicular tissue and sperm parameters. This study compared the seminiferous tubules, specifically focusing on the diameter of the seminiferous tubule, the thickness of the seminiferous tubule epithelium, the ratio of the thickness of the seminiferous tubule epithelium to the diameter of the seminiferous tubules, and the lumen diameter of the seminiferous tubules. We also conducted a comparison of sperm parameters, including sperm concentration, progressive motility, total motility, total motility, and morphology. Results: XMU-MP1-treated mice had a larger spermatogenesis area and better sperm motility than control mice. Diabetic mice treated with XMU-MP1 also showed a trend toward improvements in the spermatogenesis area, sperm concentration, sperm motility, and sperm morphology, although these improvements were not statistically significant. Conclusions: XMU-MP1 serves as a potential compound to improve spermatogenesis in mice.

AB  - Earth's temperature has risen by approximate to 0.18 degrees C per decade since 1981 and year 2022 is the sixth-warmest year on record. The exploration of cooling strategies that operate with less energy consumption is thus highly desirable. Through this project, a camel-fur-inspired passive membrane encapsulated sorbent cooler that can periodically absorb moisture from the atmosphere and release it for daytime evaporative cooling, leading to effective regulation of building temperature without additional energy input is demonstrated. This sorbent cooler with high sorption capacity is made of anhydrous salt and modified expanded graphite and further encapsulated by a breathable porous membrane. This novel material is shape-stabilized, and it has excellent cycling performance, and remarkable water adhesion ability. In this evaporative-cooling demonstration, the average cooling power of the camel-fur-inspired sorbent can reach up to 630 W m-2, which is much higher than the radiative cooling approach. This theoretical model implies that the proposed sorbent cooler has the potential to cut down cooling energy carbon emission by 61% to 87.83% when compared to emissions released from cooling energy usage in reference buildings. This nature-inspired approach paves a new way for efficient space cooling without extra water supply and with minimized energy consumption.

AB  - STUDY QUESTION: Does YAP1 inhibition alleviate progesterone resistance in endometriosis?SUMMARY ANSWER: YAP1 inhibition reduces progesterone resistance in vitro and in vivo.WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Progesterone resistance not only causes treatment failure for endometriosis but also inhibits eutopic endometrial cell proliferation, dysregulates decidualization, and reduces the success rates of pregnancy. Hippo/yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) signaling pathway plays an important role in the pathogenesis of endometriosis.STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Paraffin-embedded tissues containing paired endometriotic and endometrial specimens (n = 42) and serum samples isolated from normal controls (n = 15) or endometriotic patients with (n = 25) or without (n =21) prior dienogest treatment were analyzed. A mouse model of endometriosis was also used to evaluate the effects of YAP1 inhibition on progesterone resistance.PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Primary endometriotic and endometrial stromal cells treated with YAP1 inhibitor or miR-21 mimic/inhibitor were used for the in vitro studies including decidualization induction, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), and RNA immunoprecipitation. Tissue specimens and serum from human and mouse were used for immunohistochemistry staining, exosome isolation, and microRNA (miRNA) quantification, respectively.MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Herein, we report, by using ChIP-PCR and RNA-IP, that YAP1 inhibits progesterone receptor (PGR) expression through upregulation of miR-21-5p. Upregulation of miR-21-5p not only reduces PGR expression but also inhibits endometrial stromal cell decidualization. Indeed, levels of YAP1 and miR-21-5p are inversely correlated with the level of PGR in human endometrial samples. In contrast, knockdown of YAP1 or treatment with verteporfin (VP), a YAP1 inhibitor, reduces miR-21-5p expression, thus leading to an increase in PGR expression in ectopic endometriotic stromal cells. In the mouse model of endometriosis, treatment with VP increases PGR expression and enhances decidualization. More importantly, VP synergistically increases the treatment effect of progestin in causing the regression of endometriotic lesions and improves the decidualization capability of the endometrium. Interestingly, treatment with dienogest, a synthetic progestin, reduces YAP1 and miR-21-5p expression in human cells and in the mouse model of endometriosis. Patients who received dienogest treatment for 6 months show a significant decrease in serum extracellular vesicle-associated miR-21-5p level.LARGE SCALE DATA: A public dataset (GSE51981) containing a large cohort of endometriotic tissues is available from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO).LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: A large cohort of clinical samples is needed to verify the current diagnostic value of miR21-5p in future studies. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The reciprocal regulation of YAP1 and PGR suggests that combined YAP1 inhibitor and progestin may be a better therapeutic approach for treating endometriosis.STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): This study was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan (MOST-111-2636-B-006-012, MOST-111-2314-B-006-075-MY3, and MOST-106-2320-B-006-072-MY3).

AB  - Sevoflurane is one of the most widely used anesthetics in surgery which is the main cause of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). Previous reports confirmed that YTHDF1 is differently expressed in sevoflurane-induced POCD, while the roles and mechanistic details remain unclear. The molecular expressions were assessed using qRT-PCR, western blot, immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry. Pathological change in the hippocampus tissues was analyzed using HE staining. Cognitive ability in rats was measured using MWM test. Hippocampal neuronal viability and apoptosis were measured by MTT assay and flow cytometry, respectively. The levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were assessed using ELISA. The interaction between YTHDF1 and CREB was analyzed by RNA immunoprecipitation assay. YTHDF1 was significantly decreased in hippocampus tissues by sevoflurane exposure, and its overexpression could improve sevoflurane-induced neuron damage and cognitive dysfunction. Meanwhile, YTHDF1 upregulation repressed sevoflurane-induced activation of NLRP3 inflammation and pyroptosis in hippocampus tissues. Subsequently, YTHDF1 directly interacted to CREB mRNA to augment its stability and translation via a m6A-dependent manner, thus activating CREB/BDNF pathway. In addition, the inactivation of CREB/BDNF pathway could reverse the protective effects of YTHDF1 overexpression on sevoflurane-mediated neuronal damage and pyroptosis. These findings revealed that YTHDF1 improved sevoflurane-induced neuronal pyroptosis and cognitive dysfunction through activating CREB-BDNF signaling.

AB  - Evodia lepta Merr. (Evodia lepta) is a well-known traditional Chinese medicine, which has been widely used in herbal tea. We previously reported that the coumarin compounds from the root of Evodia lepta exhibited neuroprotective effects. However, whether Evodia lepta could inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome in dementia was still unknown. In this study, the components of the Evodia lepta extract were identified by HPLC-Q-TOF HRMS. We employed a scopolamine -treated mouse model. Evodia lepta extract (10 or 20 mg/kg) and donepezil were treated by gavage once a day for 14 consecutive days. Following the behavioral tests, oxidative stress levels were measured. Then, Western blot and immunofluorescence analysis were used to evaluate the expressions of NLRP3 inflammasome. 14 major components of the Evodia lepta extract were identified by HPLC-Q-TOF HRMS. The results of Morris water maze, object recognition task and open field test indicated that Evodia lepta extract could ameliorate cognitive impairment in scopolamine -treated mice. Evodia lepta extract improved cholinergic system. Moreover, Evodia lepta extract improved the expressions of PSD95 and BDNF. Evodia lepta extract suppressed neuronal oxidative stress and apoptosis. In addition, Evodia lepta extract inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome in the hippocampus of scopolamine -treated mice. Evodia lepta extract could protect against cognitive impairment by inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome in scopolaminetreated mice.

AB  - For efficient processing, spatiotemporal spike patterns representing similar input must be able to transform into a less similar output. A new computational model with physiologically plausible parameters shows how the neuronal process referred to as "pattern separation" can be very well achieved by single neurons if the temporal qualities of the output patterns are considered. Spike patterns generated by a varying number of neurons firing with fixed different frequencies within a gamma range are used as input. The temporal and spatial summation of dendritic input combined with theta-oscillating excitability in the output neuron by subthreshold membrane potential oscillations (SMOs) lead to high temporal separation by different delays of output spikes of similar input patterns. A Winner Takes All (WTA) mechanism with backward inhibition suffices to transform the spatial overlap of input patterns to much less temporal overlap of the output patterns. The conversion of spatial patterns input into an output with differently delayed spikes enables high separation effects. Incomplete random connectivity spreads the times up to the first spike across a spatially expanded ensemble of output neurons. With the expansion, random connectivity becomes the spatial distribution mechanism of temporal features. Additionally, a "synfire chain" circuit is proposed to reconvert temporal differences into spatial ones.

AB  - Glycation of biomolecules results in the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs). Immunoglobulin G (IgG) has been implicated in the progression of various diseases, including diabetes and cancer. This study purified three IgG subclasses (IgG1, IgG2, and IgG3) from Camelus dromedarius colostrum using ammonium sulfate fractionation and chromatographic procedures. SDS-PAGE was performed to confirm the purity and molecular weight of the IgG subclasses. Several biochemical and biophysical techniques were employed to study the effect of glycation on camel IgG using methylglyoxal (MGO), a dicarbonyl sugar. Early glycation measurement showed an increase in the fructosamine content by similar to four-fold in IgG2, similar to two-fold in IgG3, and a slight rise in IgG1. AGEs were observed in all classes of IgGs with maximum hyperchromicity (96.6%) in IgG2. Furthermore, glycation-induced oxidation of IgGs led to an increase in carbonyl content and loss of -SH groups. Among subclass, IgG2 showed the highest (39.7%) increase in carbonyl content accompanied by 82.5% decrease in -SH groups. Far UV-CD analysis illustrated perturbation of beta-sheet structure during glycation reaction with MGO. Moreover, glycation of IgG proceeds to various conformational states like aggregation and increased hydrophobicity. In addition, the cytotoxicity assay (MTT) illustrated the proliferation of breast cancer cells (MCF-7) with IgG2 treatment.

AB  - The aim of this research was to explore the potential of treadmill exercise in preventing brain aging and neurodegenerative diseases caused by oxidative stress, by studying its effects on d-galactose-induced mice and the mechanisms involved. The results showed that C57BL/6 mice induced with d-gal exhibited cognitive impairment and oxidative stress damage, which was ameliorated by treadmill exercise. The Morris water maze also showed that exercise improved cognitive performance in aging mice and alleviated hippocampal and mitochondrial damage. The study also found that treadmill exercise increased the expression of nuclear factor Nrf2, p-GSK3 beta, HO-1, NQO1, BDNF, and Bcl-2 proteins while decreasing the expression of Bax. Furthermore, there was a substantial increase in the levels of CAT, GSH-PX and SOD in the serum, along with a decrease in MDA levels. The outcomes propose that aerobic exercise has the potential to hinder oxidative stress and cell death in mitochondria through the modulation of the Nrf2/GSK3 beta signaling pathway, thus improving cognitive impairment observed in the aging model induced by d-galactose. It appears that treadmill exercise could potentially serve as an effective therapeutic approach to mitigating brain aging and neurodegenerative diseases triggered by oxidative stress.

AB  - Oxygen support plays a critical role in the management of preterm infants in neonatal intensive care units. On the other hand, the possible effects of oxygen supplementation on cellular functions, specifically glucose metabolism, have been less understood. Purpose: of the study is to investigate whether supplemental oxygen alters glucose metabolism and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) activity in the brain tissue and its relevance with silent information regulator proteins (SIRT) pathway. For this purpose, newborn C57BL/6 pups were exposed to 90% oxygen from birth until postnatal day 7 (PN7) and metabolites of glysolysis and PPP were investigated through metabolomics analysis. SIRT1, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) and transaldolase (TALDO) proteins were examined immunohistochemically and molecularly in the prefrontal and hippocampus regions of the brain. Later on, SIRT1 inhibition was carried out. Our results indicate that supplemental oxygen causes an increase in PPP metabolites as well as activation of G6PD enzyme in the brain tissue, which is reversed by SIRT1 inhibition. Our study underlines a connection between supplemental oxygen, glucose metabolism, PPP pathway and the SIRT signaling. Understanding these intricate relationships not only deepens our knowledge of cellular physiology but also holds promise for therapeutic interventions for creating neuroprotective strategies in preterm brain.

AB  - Fractures are frequent and severe musculoskeletal injuries. This study aimed to investigate the function of tenascin-C (TNC) in regulating chondrogenic during fracture healing and elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms. A well -established femur fracture model in male C57BL/6J mice was used to transect the middle diaphysis of the femur. To identify the essential role of TNC, shTNC lentiviruses or TNC protein were administered in the animal model. Micro -CT analysis, histologic analysis, immunostaining assays, and gene expression analysis were employed to investigate the effect of TNC during fracture healing. An in vitro mesenchymal stem cell culture system was developed to investigate the role and molecular mechanism of TNC in regulating chondrogenesis. TNC expression was induced at the inflammatory phase and peaked at the cartilaginous callus phase during fracture healing. Knockdown of TNC expression in callus results in decreased callus formation and impaired fracture healing. Conversely, administration of exogenous TNC promoted chondrogenic differentiation, cartilage template formation and ultimately improved fracture healing. Both the Hedgehog and Hippo signaling pathways were found to be involved in the pro-chondrogenic function of TNC. Our observations demonstrate that TNC is a crucial factor responsible for endochondral ossification in fracture healing and provide a potential therapeutic strategy for promoting fracture healing.

KW  - YAP/TAZ
AB  - Angiogenesis, a finely regulated process, plays a crucial role in the progression of various diseases. Cerebral cavernous malformation 3 (CCM3), alternatively referred to as programmed cell death 10 (PDCD10), stands as a pivotal functional gene with a broad distribution across the human body. However, the precise role of CCM3 in angiogenesis regulation has remained elusive. YAP/TAZ, as core components of the evolutionarily conserved Hippo pathway, have garnered increasing attention as a novel mechanism in angiogenesis regulation. Nonetheless, whether CCM3 regulates angiogenesis through YAP/TAZ mediation has not been comprehensively explored. In this study, our primary focus centers on investigating the regulation of angiogenesis through CCM3 knockdown mediated by YAP/TAZ. Silencing CCM3 significantly enhances the proliferation, migration, and tubular formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), thereby promoting angiogenesis. Furthermore, we observe an upregulation in the expression levels of VEGF and VEGFR2 within HUVECs upon silencing CCM3. Mechanistically, the evidence we provide suggests for the first time that endothelial cell CCM3 knockdown induces the activation and nuclear translocation of YAP/TAZ. Finally, we further demonstrate that the YAP/TAZ inhibitor verteporfin can reverse the pro-angiogenic effects of siCCM3, thereby confirming the role of CCM3 in angiogenesis regulation dependent on YAP/TAZ. In summary, our findings pave the way for potential therapeutic targeting of the CCM3-YAP/TAZ signaling axis as a novel approach to promote angiogenesis.

AB  - In recent years, the number of patients with neurodegenerative illness such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) has increased with the aging of the population. In this study, we evaluated the effect of Grape skin extract (GSE) on neurotypic SH-SY5Y cells as an in vitro AD model, murine neurospheres as an ex vivo neurogenesis model and SAMP8 mice as an in vivo AD model. Our in vitro result showed that pre-treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with GSE ameliorated AB-induced cytotoxicity. Moreover, GSE treatment significantly decreased the number of neurospheres, but increased their size suggesting reduced stem cell self-renewal but increased proliferation. Our in vivo Morris water maze test indicated that GSE improves learning and memory in SAMP8 mice. To detect proliferation and newborn neurons, we measured BrdU+ cells in the dentate gyrus (DG). GSE treatment increased the number of BrdU+ cells in the DG of SAMP8 mice. Finally, we showed that GSE induced a decrease in inflammatory cytokines and an increase in neurotransmitters in the cerebral cortex of SAMP8 mice. These results suggested that GSE increased neurogenic zone proliferation and memory but decreased oxidative stress associated with pro-inflammatory cytokines in aging, thus protecting neurons.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a highly lethal event with a poor prognosis. Recovering residual neuronal function in the intermediate stage of TBI is important for treatment; however, neuroinflammation and neuronal apoptosis impede residual neuronal repair processes. Considering that hyperglycemia influences inflammatory processes and neuronal survival, we examined the effects of high glucose on neuroinflammation and neuronal death during the intermediate phase of TBI. Rat models of type 2 diabetes mellitus and/or TBI were developed and behaviorally assessed. Neurological function and cognitive abilities were impaired in TBI rats and worsened by type 2 diabetes mellitus. Histopathological staining and analyses of serum and hippocampal mRNA and protein levels indicated that neuroinflammation and apoptosis were induced in TBI rats and exacerbated by hyperglycemia. Hyperglycemia inhibited hippocampal mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 5 (MEK5) phosphorylation in TBI rats. In vitro assays were used to assess inflammatory factor expression, apoptotic protein levels and neuronal survival after MEK5 activation in TBI-and/or high-glucose treated neurons. MEK5/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 5 (ERK5) pathway activation reduced the inflammation, cleaved caspase-3 expression, Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and apoptosis of TBI neurons, even under high glucose conditions. Thus, high glucose exacerbated neuroinflammation and apoptosis in the intermediate stage post-TBI by inhibiting the MEK5/ERK5 pathway.

AB  - Alzheimer's Diseases (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid deposits of A beta peptide in the brain. Besides genetic background, the presence of other diseases and an unhealthy lifestyle are known risk factors for AD development. Albeit accumulating clinical evidence suggests that an impaired lipid metabolism is related to A beta deposition, mechanistic insights on the link between amyloid fibril formation/clearance and aberrant lipid interactions are still unavailable. Recently, many studies have described the key role played by membrane bound A beta assemblies in neurotoxicity. Moreover, it has been suggested that a derangement of the ubiquitin proteasome pathway and autophagy is significantly correlated with toxic A beta aggregation and dysregulation of lipid levels. Thus, studies focusing on the role played by lipids in A beta aggregation and proteostasis could represent a promising area of investigation for the design of valuable treatments. In this review we examine current knowledge concerning the effects of lipids in A beta aggregation and degradation processes, focusing on the therapeutic opportunities that a comprehensive understanding of all biophysical, biochemical, and biological processes involved may disclose.

AB  - Perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PNDs), main complications of surgery and anesthesia in the elderly, are mainly associated with neuroinflammation and remain poorly understood. This study aimed to explore the function of the NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome in the development of PNDs. Male C57BL/6 mice underwent right carotid artery exposure surgery, with or without treatment with adeno-associated virus vectors carrying NLRP3 (AAV-NLRP3), which was administered either intracerebroventricularly or via tail vein injection. Mouse brain tissue was collected 24 h postoperatively for biochemical assays. Another group of mice was subjected to the Morris water maze and novel object recognition tests to assess their learning and memory abilities. The results revealed that surgery and anesthesia increased NLRP3 protein expression level and programmed cell death in the hippocampus of mice, leading to impaired learning and memory, while AAV-NLRP3 treatment attenuated these effects. Additionally, inhibition of high-mobility group protein box 1 (HMGB-1) expression level alleviated surgery-induced upregulation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B), and NLRP3 in the hippocampus of mice. The NLRP3 inflammasome emerged critical for the occurrence of neuroinflammation and postoperative cognitive impairment, which could be alleviated by inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome via the HMGB-1/TLR4/NF-kappa B pathway.

AB  - Emerged evidence indicated that stimulating hippocampal neurogenesis is a potential strategy for restoring cognition in AD. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) play an essential role in neurogenesis. Meanwhile, the enzymatic power of the phosphatases is much greater than that of kinases. Dual-specificity phosphatase 16 (DUSP16), known to as a phosphatase negatively regulate MAPKs, may be implicated in neural differentiation. Nevertheless, the effect of DUSP16 on cognitive disorders by stimulating neural progenitor cell (NPC) differentiation in AD mice remains unclear. Our study demonstrates an association between DUSP16 SNPs and clinical progression in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Besides, increased DUSP16 expression was detected in both 3xTg and SAMP8 mouse models of AD, accompanied by NPC neural differentiation impairments. By silencing DUSP16, the induction of neural differentiation, synaptic transmission, and cognitive benefits were observed in both AD mice. Furthermore, DUSP16 was involved in the process of NPC differentiation through regulating c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation and SOX2 expression. Moreover, ETS transcription factor (ELK1) was involved in the DUSP16 transcription, which resulted in the upregulation of DUSP16 at the state of AD. Our data uncovers a potential regulatory role for DUSP16 in adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) and provides a possibility to find a novel strategy for AD intervention.

AB  - Background and Purpose: Age is identified as a significant prognostic factor for poorer outcome after stroke. However, environmental enrichment (EE) has been reported to promote functional recovery after ischemic stroke. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether environmental enrichment was beneficial to ischemic stroke in aged rats. Methods: Aged rats were randomly assigned as control rats, rats subjected to cerebral ischemia, and rats with cerebral ischemia treated with EE for 30 days. Focal cortical ischemia was induced by intracranial injection of endothelin-1 (ET-1). EE housing began one day after focal ischemia and was maintained for the whole experimental period. We used immunofluorescence staining to analyze the neurogenesis in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay to evaluate apoptosis. The expression of neuronal nuclei, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and Iba-1 around the infarcted area were also measured by double immunohistochemistry. Results: EE enhanced the proliferation of newborn neurons in the SVZ, as well as increased the long-term survival of newborn neurons. EE also exerted effects on inflammation after stroke. Furthermore, EE suppressed apoptosis and improved the motor functions after stroke in the aged rats. Conclusions: EE improved post-stroke recovery on the basis of enhancing neurogenesis in aged rats.

AB  - Renal fibrosis is a manifestation of the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and chronic inflammation is a main driver in the development of renal fibrosis. Yes-associated protein (YAP), acting as a transcriptional co-activator within the Hippo signaling pathway, has been implicated in renal fibrosis. Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) exhibits high expression level in renal fibrosis induced by unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO), yet the interplay between YAP and EZH2 in renal fibrosis remains to be elucidated. ZLD1039, a selective inhibitor of EZH2, has demonstrated protective effects against cancer and acute kidney injury (AKI). In this study, we conducted a systemic pharmacological investigation to determine if ZLD1039 treatment mitigates UUO-induced renal inflammation and fibrosis through modulation of the Hippo-YAP pathway. Our results revealed that UUO triggered renal inflammation and collagen deposition, with significant activation of YAP. Notably, ZLD1039 treatment effectively alleviated renal inflammation and fibrosis, while inhibiting the expression and nuclear translocation of YAP. Mechanically, we observed a notable down-regulation of large tumor suppressor homolog 1 (LATS1) in parallel with the up-regulation of EZH2. Furthermore, inhibition of EZH2 by ZLD1039 was linked to the up-regulation of LATS1 expression and YAP inactivation. Similarly, in vitro pharmacological inhibition of EZH2 by ZLD1039 resulted in elevated LATS1 expression and diminished YAP activation. Collectively, our findings suggest that ZLD1039, a selective inhibitor of EZH2, likely attenuates renal inflammation and fibrosis probably by up-regulating LATS1 and inhibiting YAP activation. This mechanistic link between EZH2 and YAP provides a fresh perspective on treating renal fibrosis.

AB  - Autistic Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by impaired social interaction & communication as well as restricted and repetitive behavior. The currently reported incidence of ASD is 1-2%, and it increases dramatically to 10-20% in families predisposed to ASD. To date, there is no effective way to treat or prevent ASD, and only symptomatic treatment with limited efficacy is available. Oxytocin (Oxt) enhances affiliative behavior and improves social cognition. Social deficits characteristic of autism may be related to dysfunctional Oxt neurotransmission. Thus, administration of Oxt may relieve ASD, however it has a short plasma half-life and poor Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) permeability. CD38, a multifunctional ecto-enzyme expressed in brain and immune cells, was found to be critical for social behavior via regulation of Oxt secretion. All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is a potent inducer of CD38 and improves social behavior, but it is toxic and teratogenic. We have shown that beta-carotene has a similar therapeutic effect. The present study aimed to investigate the activity of novel beta-carotene derivatives in rescuing low sociability found in BTBR mice, providing an in vivo "proof of principle" that beta-carotene derivatives are potential agents to prevent/ameliorate the reappearance of ASD in high-risk populations for ASD. Beta-carotene and its synthetic analogs were administered orally to newborn BTBR mice with ASD associated like behavior. After 2 months, they were tested (at dosages of 0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg) by cognitive (T-maze spontaneous alteration and neurological score) and behavioral tests (reciprocal social interaction, repetitive grooming / bedding behavior), previously shown as indicators for autistic behavior. The following biochemical and molecular biology parameters were also examined: serum Oxt; gene expression in hippocampus and hypothalamus of CD 38, Oxt, Oxt receptor, BDNF, and retinoic acid receptor. The new compounds were significantly more effective than control. The most effective compounds, both in the behavioral tests and in their biochemical effects, were (3R,3 ' R)-astaxanthin bis(N-Cbz-L-alanine ester) (3B(and (3S,3 ' S)-astaxanthin bis(N,N-dimethylglycine ester (5). They did not exert any neurological symptoms. Thus, beta-carotene derivatives may have the potential to prevent and/or ameliorate autistic symptoms when administered orally after birth to newborns of families predisposed to autism.

AB  - Aluminum (Al) exposure was implicated in neurodegenerative diseases and cognitive impairment, yet the involvement of zinc (Zn) and its mechanism in Al-induced mild cognitive impairment (MCI) remains poorly understood. The objective is to explore the role of Zn in Al-induced cognitive impairment and its potential mechanisms. Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) test scores and serum Al, Zn from Al industry workers were collected. A mediation analysis was performed to evaluate the role of serum Zn among serum Al and MoCA test scores. Subsequently, an Al-exposure study was conducted on a rat model categorized into control, low-, medium-, and high-dose groups. After a Morris Water Maze test and detection of Al, Zn content in the hippocampus, integrated transcriptomic and proteomic analyses between the control group and the high-dose group were performed to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEPs), proteins (DEPs), and pathways. To corroborate these findings, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blotting (WB) were selected to identify the gene and protein results. Zn overall mediates the relationship between serum Al and cognitive function (mediation effect 17.82%, effect value = - 0.0351). In the Al-exposed rat model, 734 DEGs, 18 miRNAs, 35 lncRNAs, 64 circRNAs, and 113 DEPs were identified between the high-dose group and the control group. Among them, ROCK1, DMD, and other four DEPs were identified as related to zinc finger proteins (ZNF). Co-enrichment analyses of the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) linked these changes to the RHOA/ROCK1 signaling axis. ZNF-related proteins Rock1, DMD, and DHX57 in the high-dose group were downregulated (p = 0.006, 0.003, 0.04), and the expression of Myl9, Rhoa, miR431, and miR182 was also downregulated (p = 0.003, 0.032, 0.032, and 0.046). These findings also show correlations between Al, Zn levels in the hippocampus, water maze performance, and expressions of Myl9, Rhoa, miR431, miR182, DMD, ROCK1, and DHX57, with both negative and positive associations. Based on the results, we determined that Zn was involved in Al-induced MCI in Al workers and Al-exposed rat models. Al exposure and interaction with Zn could trigger the downregulation of ZNF of ROCK1, DMD, and DHX57. miR431, miR182 regulate RHOA/ROCK1 was one of the Zn-involved pathways in Al-induced cognitive impairment.

AB  - Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is a malignant and lethal disease caused by relapse after androgen-deprivation (ADT) therapy. Since enzalutamide is innovated and approved by US FDA as a new treatment option for mCRPC patients, drug resistance for enzalutamide is a critical issue during clinical usage. Although several underlying mechanisms causing enzalutamide resistance were previously identified, most of them revealed that drug resistant cells are still highly addicted to androgen and AR functions. Due to the numerous physical functions of AR in men, innovated AR-independent therapy might alleviate enzalutamide resistance and prevent production of adverse side effects. Here, we have identified that yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) is overexpressed in enzalutamide-resistant (EnzaR) cells. Furthermore, enzalutamide-induced YAP1 expression is mediated through the function of chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor 2 (COUP-TFII) at the transcriptional and the post-transcriptional levels. Functional analyses reveal that YAP1 positively regulates numerous genes related to cancer stemness and lipid metabolism and interacts with COUP-TFII to form a transcriptional complex. More importantly, YAP1 inhibitor attenuates the growth and cancer stemness of EnzaR cells in vitro and in vivo. Finally, YAP1, COUP-TFII, and miR-21 are detected in the extracellular vesicles (EVs) isolated from EnzaR cells and sera of patients. In addition, treatment with EnzaR-EVs induces the abilities of cancer stemness, lipid metabolism and enzalutamide resistance in its parental cells. Taken together, these results suggest that YAP1 might be a crucial factor involved in the development of enzalutamide resistance and can be an alternative therapeutic target in prostate cancer.

AB  - Structural, functional, and molecular alterations in excitatory spines are a common hallmark of many neurodevelopmental disorders including intellectual disability and autism. Here, we describe an optimized methodology, based on combined use of DiI and immunofluorescence, for rapid and sensitive characterization of the structure and composition of spines in native brain tissue. We successfully demonstrate the applicability of this approach by examining the properties of hippocampal spines in juvenile Fmr1 KO mice, a mouse model of Fragile X Syndrome. We find that mutant mice display pervasive dysgenesis of spines evidenced by an overabundance of both abnormally elongated thin spines and cup-shaped spines, in combination with reduced density of mushroom spines. We further find that mushroom spines expressing the actin-binding protein Synaptopodin-a marker for spine apparatus-are more prevalent in mutant mice. Previous work identified spines with Synaptopodin/spine apparatus as the locus of mGluR-LTD, which is abnormally elevated in Fmr1 KO mice. Altogether, our data suggest this enhancement may be linked to the preponderance of this subset of spines in the mutant. Overall, these findings demonstrate the sensitivity and versatility of the optimized methodology by uncovering a novel facet of spine dysgenesis in Fmr1 KO mice.

AB  - Neurogenesis is a biological process characterized by new neurons formation from stem cells. For decades, it was believed that neurons only multiplied during development and in the postnatal period but the discovery of neural stem cells (NSCs) in mature brain promoted a revolution in neuroscience field. In mammals, neurogenesis consists of migration, differentiation, maturation, as well as functional integration of newborn cells into the pre-existing neuronal circuit. Actually, NSC density drops significantly after the first stages of development, however in specific places in the brain, called neurogenic niches, some of these cells retain their ability to generate new neurons and glial cells in adulthood. The subgranular (SGZ), and the subventricular zones (SVZ) are examples of regions where the neurogenesis process occurs in the mature brain. There, the potential of NSCs to produce new neurons has been explored by new advanced methodologies and in neuroscience for the treatment of brain damage and/or degeneration. Based on that, this review highlights endogenous factors and drugs capable of stimulating neurogenesis, as well as the perspectives for the use of NSCs for neurological and neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Quercetin has been studied extensively for its anti-Alzheimer's disease (AD) and anti-aging effects. Our previous studies have found that quercetin and in its glycoside form, rutin, can modulate the proteasome function in neuroblastoma cells. We aimed to explore the effects of quercetin and rutin on intracellular redox homeostasis of the brain (reduced glutathione/oxidized glutathione, GSH/GSSG), its correlation with beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) activity, and amyloid precursor protein (APP) expression in transgenic TgAPP mice (bearing human Swedish mutation APP transgene, APPswe). On the basis that BACE1 protein and APP processing are regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and that supplementation with GSH protects neurons from proteasome inhibition, we investigated whether a diet containing quercetin or rutin (30 mg/kg/day, 4 weeks) diminishes several early signs of AD. Genotyping analyses of animals were carried out by PCR. In order to determine intracellular redox homeostasis, spectrofluorometric methods were adopted to quantify GSH and GSSG levels using o-phthalaldehyde and the GSH/GSSG ratio was ascertained. Levels of TBARS were determined as a marker of lipid peroxidation. Enzyme activities of SOD, CAT, GR, and GPx were determined in the cortex and hippocampus. Beta ACE1 activity was measured by a secretase-specific substrate conjugated to two reporter molecules (EDANS and DABCYL). Gene expression of the main antioxidant enzymes: APP, BACE1, a Disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 10 (ADAM10), caspase-3, caspase-6, and inflammatory cytokines were determined by RT-PCR. First, overexpression of APPswe in TgAPP mice decreased GSH/GSSG ratio, increased malonaldehyde (MDA) levels, and, overall, decreased the main antioxidant enzyme activities in comparison to wild-type (WT) mice. Treatment of TgAPP mice with quercetin or rutin increased GSH/GSSG, diminished MDA levels, and favored the enzyme antioxidant capacity, particularly with rutin. Secondly, both APP expression and BACE1 activity were diminished with quercetin or rutin in TgAPP mice. Regarding ADAM10, it tended to increase in TgAPP mice with rutin treatment. As for caspase-3 expression, TgAPP displayed an increase which was the opposite with rutin. Finally, the increase in expression of the inflammatory markers IL-1 beta and IFN-gamma in TgAPP mice was lowered by both quercetin and rutin. Collectively, these findings suggest that, of the two flavonoids, rutin may be included in a day-to-day diet as a form of adjuvant therapy in AD.

AB  - The expression of estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha, encoded by ESR1) has been shown to be associated with the prognostic outcomes of patients in various cancers; however, its prognostic and mechanistic significance in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unclear. Here, we evaluated the expression of ER alpha and its association with clinicopathological features in 339 HCC patients. ER alpha was expressed in 9.4% (32/339) of HCCs and was related to better overall survival (OS; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.11, p = 0.009, 95% C.I. = 0.016-0.82) and disease-free survival (DFS, HR = 0.4, p = 0.013, 95% C.I. = 0.18-0.85). ER alpha expression was also associated with features related to more favorable prognosis, such as older age, lower serum alpha-fetoprotein level, and less microvascular invasion (p < 0.05). In addition, to obtain mechanistic insights into the role of ER alpha in HCC progression, we performed integrative transcriptome data analyses, which revealed that yes-associated protein (YAP) pathway was significantly suppressed in ESR1-expressing HCCs. By performing cell culture experiments, we validated that ER alpha expression enhanced YAP phosphorylation, attenuating its nuclear translocation, which in turn suppressed the downstream signaling pathways and cancer cell growth. In conclusion, we suggest that ER alpha expression is an indicator of more favorable prognosis in HCC and that this effect is mediated by inactivation of YAP signaling. Our results provide new clinical and pathobiological insights into ER alpha and YAP signaling in HCC.
   Liver cancer: How estrogen receptors hinder tumor growth Estrogen receptor signaling can act as a brake preventing the progression of an often deadly form of liver cancer. Studies have shown that women are at a lower risk of developing and succumbing to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) than men, suggesting a potential role for sex hormones. Researchers in South Korea led by Hyun Goo Woo of the Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon, and Young Nyun Park of Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, have now shown that expression of the estrogen receptor alpha is a strong prognostic predictor for HCC. In a survey of patient tumor samples, they found that expression of this hormone receptor is associated with nearly a tenfold increased likelihood of survival. The researchers identified a mechanism by which estrogen receptor alpha signaling impedes cancerous growth, revealing potential new drug targets.

AB  - Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune inflammatory demyelinating disease that results in motor, sensory, cognitive, and affective deficits. Hippocampal demyelination, a common occurrence in MS, is linked to impaired cognitive function and mood. Despite this, the precise mechanisms underlying cognitive impairments in MS remain elusive. Pleiotrophin (PTN), secreted by neural stem cells and astrocytes, plays a crucial role in regulating cognition. This study investigates the role of astrocyte-derived PTN. We found that genetic deletion of astrocyte-derived PTN hinders hippocampal neurogenesis. Additionally, conditional ablation of PTN in astrocytes exacerbates neurogenic deficits in the demyelinated hippocampus. Importantly, overexpression of PTN in astrocytes reverses neurogenic and cognitive impairments caused by demyelination, underscoring PTN's protective role in MS. PTN cooperates with protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type Z1 (PTPRZ1) or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) receptors to activate the AKT signaling pathway, thereby enhancing hippocampal neurogenesis and cognition in demyelinated mice. These findings illuminate novel effects of astrocyte-derived PTN on hippocampal neurogenesis and cognition.

AB  - Human neural progenitor cell (hNPC) transplantation holds great potential to treat neurological diseases. However, hNPC grafts take a long time to differentiate into mature neurons due to their intrinsically prolonged developmental timetable. Here, we report that postoperative physical exercise (PE), a prevailing rehabilitation intervention, promotes the neuronal commitment, maturation, and integration of engrafted hNPCs, evidenced by forming more synapses, receiving more synaptic input from host neurons, and showing higher neuronal activity levels. More important, NPC transplantation, combined with PE, shows significant improvement in both structural and behavioral outcomes in stroke-damaged rats. PE enhances in growth of blood vessels around the infarction region and neural tract reorganization along the ischemic boundary. The combination of NPC transplantation and postoperative PE creates both a neurotrophic/growth factor-enriched proneuronal microenvironment and an ideal condition for activity-dependent plasticity to give full play to its effects. Our study provides a potential approach to treating patients with stroke injury.

AB  - Memory generalisations may be underpinned by either encoding- or retrieval-based generalisation mechanisms and different training schedules may bias some learners to favour one of these mechanisms over the other. We used a transitive inference task to investigate whether generalisation is influenced by progressive vs randomly interleaved training, and overnight consolidation. On consecutive days, participants learnt pairwise discriminations from two transitive hierarchies before being tested during fMRI. Inference performance was consistently better following progressive training, and for pairs further apart in the transitive hierarchy. BOLD pattern similarity correlated with hierarchical distances in the left hippocampus (HIP) and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) following both training schedules. These results are consistent with the use of structural representations that directly encode hierarchical relationships between task features. However, such effects were only observed in the MPFC for recently learnt relationships. Furthermore, the MPFC appeared to maintain structural representations in participants who performed at chance on the inference task. We conclude that humans preferentially employ encoding-based mechanisms to store map-like relational codes that can be used for memory generalisation. These codes are expressed in the HIP and MPFC following both progressive and interleaved training but are not sufficient for accurate inference.
   Author summary
   Integrating information across distinct situations allows both humans and non-human animals to solve novel problems. For instance, by observing that topaz is hard enough to scratch quartz, and that quartz is hard enough to scratch gypsum, one can infer that topaz must be harder than gypsum-even if these materials have never been seen together. This type of generalisation (transitive inference) can be achieved by combing different pieces of information either, 1) when an inference is actually needed (retrieval-based generalisation), or 2) when new information is first encountered (encoding-based generalisation). We predicted that the use of these generalisation mechanisms depends on the order in which information is presented and whether that information was learnt before an overnight rest. Contrary to our predictions, behavioural and neuroimaging analyses of a transitive inference task in humans showed convergent evidence for encoding-based generalisations in all conditions. While these conditions had a large impact on inferential ability, we found that brain regions involved in memory invariably learnt inferred relationships between items that had not been seen together. Strikingly, this appeared to be the case even when participants where unbale to make accurate inferences.

AB  - Intracellular tau accumulation is a hallmark pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies. Tau protein, in the hyperphosphorylated form, is the component of paired helical filaments (PHFs) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in AD. Blocking tau aggregation and/or phosphorylation is currently a promising strategy for AD treatment. Here, we elucidate that quercetagitrin, a natural compound derived from African marigold (Tagetes erecta), could inhibit tau aggregation and reduce tau phosphorylation at multiple disease-related sites in vitro. Moreover, the in vivo effect of quercetagitrin was assessed in P301S-tau transgenic via oral administration. The compound treatment restored the cognitive deficits and neuron loss in the mice. The formation of NFTs and tau phosphorylations in the hippocampus and cortex of the mice was also prevented by the compound. Moreover, quercetagitrin feeding displayed neuroinflammation protection through the inhibition of NF-?B activation in the mice. Together, our data reveal that quercetagitrin possesses the potential to further develop as a therapeutic medicine for AD and other tauopathies.

AB  - Liver cancer stem cells were found to rely on glycolysis as the preferred metabolic program. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase 1 (PCK1), a gluconeogenic metabolic enzyme, is down -regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma and is closely related to poor prognosis. The oncogenesis and progression of tumors are closely related to cancer stem cells. It is not completely clear whether the PCK1 deficiency increases the stemness of hepatoma cells and promotes the oncogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma. Herein, the results showed that PCK1 inhibited the self -renewal property of hepatoma cells, reduced the mRNA level of cancer stem cell markers, and inhibited tumorigenesis. Moreover, PCK1 increased the sensitivity of hepatocellular carcinoma cells to sorafenib. Furthermore, we found that PCK1 activated the Hippo pathway by enhancing the phosphorylation of YAP and inhibiting its nuclear translocation. Verteporfin reduced the stemness of hepatoma cells and promoted the pro-apoptotic effect of sorafenib. Thus, combined treatment with verteporfin and sorafenib may be a potential anti -tumor strategy in hepatocellular carcinoma.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has long been considered a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the molecular links between T2DM and AD remain obscure. Here, we reported that serum-/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (SGK1) is activated by administering a chronic high-fat diet (HFD), which increases the risk of T2DM, and thus promotes Tau pathology via the phosphorylation of tau at Ser214 and the activation of a key tau kinase, namely, GSK-3 beta, forming SGK1-GSK-3 beta-tau complex. SGK1 was activated under conditions of elevated glucocorticoid and hyperglycemia associated with HFD, but not of fatty acid-mediated insulin resistance. Elevated expression of SGK1 in the mouse hippocampus led to neurodegeneration and impairments in learning and memory. Upregulation and activation of SGK1, SGK1-GSK-3 beta-tau complex were also observed in the hippocampi of AD cases. Our results suggest that SGK1 is a key modifier of tau pathology in AD, linking AD to corticosteroid effects and T2DM.

AB  - In this study, four series of piperazine derivatives were designed, synthesised and subjected to biological test, and compound 6a with potential antidepressant activity was obtained. An affinity assay of compound 6a with 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin, 5-HT)(1A) receptor (5-HT1AR) was undertaken, and the effects on the 5-HT level in the brains of mice were also tested. The results showed that compound 6a had the best affinity with 5-HT1AR (K-i = 1.28 nM) and significantly increased the 5-HT level. The expression levels of 5-HT1AR, BDNF, and PKA in the hippocampus were analysed by western blot and immunohistochemistry analyses. The results showed that the expression of 5-HT1AR, BDNF, and PKA in the model group was reduced compared to that of the control group, and compound 6a could reverse this phenomenon. Molecular docking was performed to investigate the interactions of the studied compound 6a with 5-HT1AR on the molecular level. [Graphical Abstract]

AB  - In recent years, rare-earth-doped upconverting nanoparticles (UCNPs) have been widely used in different life sciences due to their unique properties. Nanoparticles have become a multifunctional and promising new approach to neurobiological disorders and have shown extraordinary application potential to overcome the problems related to conventional treatment strategies. This study evaluated the internalization mechanisms, bio-distribution, and neurotoxicity of NaYF4:20%Yb3+,2%Er3+ UCNPs in rat organotypic hippocampal slices. TEM results showed that UCNPs were easily internalized by hippocampal cells and co-localized with selected organelles inside neurons and astrocytes. Moreover, the UCNPs were taken into the neurons via clathrin- and caveolae-mediated endocytosis. Propidium iodide staining and TEM analysis did not confirm the adverse effects of UCNPs on hippocampal slice viability and morphology. Therefore, UCNPs may be a potent tool for bio-imaging and testing new therapeutic strategies for brain diseases in the future.

AB  - The piperazine derivative N-(2,6-difluorophenyl)-2-(4-phenylpiperazin-1-yl)propanamide (cmp2) has emerged as a potential transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily C, member 6 (TRPC6) modulator, offering a promising pathway for Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapy. Our recent findings identify cmp2 as a novel compound with synaptoprotective effects in primary hippocampal cultures and effective blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration. In vivo studies demonstrate that cmp2 (10 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) restores synaptic plasticity deficits in 5xFAD mice. This study further shows cmp2's selectivity towards tetrameric TRPC6 channel in silico. Acute administration of cmp2 is non-toxic, with no indications of chronic toxicity, and Ames testing confirms its lack of mutagenicity. Behavioral assays reveal that cmp2 improves cognitive functions in 5xFAD mice, including increased novel object recognition, better passing of the Morris water maze, and improved fear memory, as well as upregulation of motor function in beam walking tests. These findings suggest that cmp2 holds promise as a candidate for AD treatment.

Group III received 6G alone at 50 mg/kg bw orally for 14 days. Groups IV and V received 6G at 20 and 50 mg/kg bw for 7 days, respectively, and LPS for another 7 days to induce neurotoxicity. Group VI received 5 mg/kg bw of donepezil for 7 days and LPS for 7 days. Pretreatment with 20 and 50 mg/kg bw of 6G protected against LPS-mediated learning and memory function, and also locomotor and motor deficits. Besides, 20 and 50 mg/kg bw 6G mitigated LPS-induced alteration in markers of oxidative stress. Furthermore, induction of amyloidogenesis associated with disruption of histoarchitecture and high expression of interleukin 1 beta, inducible nitric oxide synthase, amyloid precursor protein (APP), beta-secretase 1, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor by LPS was mitigated by the two doses of 6G in the rat hippocampus and cerebral cortex region of the brain. 6G pretreatment at the two doses mitigated LPS-mediated histopathological changes in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of rats. Overall, our results demonstrate that the protective effect of 6G is mediated through the reversal of neurobehavioral deficit, oxidative stress, inflammation, and amyloidogenesis, thus making 6G a possible chemoprophylactic agent against brain injury as a result of LPS exposure.
   Practical applications In the search for a holistic prevention of inflammation-associated neurodegeneration, nutraceuticals are becoming prominent. Hence, this study presents 6G, an active constituent of ginger, as a chemoprotective, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory agent, which is able to ameliorate cognitive impairments, oxidative stress, neuroplasticity, amyloidogenesis, and inflammation in LPS-induced rat model of neuroinflammation.

AB  - Magnetic technology has been a hotspot of neuromodulation research in recent years. However, magnetic coil is limited by their size, and it is impossible to realize precise targeted magnetic stimulation to the target area at the cellular scale. To this end, this study designs a 1 x 4 array micro-magnetic stimulation (mu MS) device with four sub-millimeter-sized elements, enabling precise magnetic stimulation of the CA1-CA3-DG tri-synaptic positions in the rat hippocampal region. First, it is determined that 70 KHz/2 mT/1 min magnetic stimulation parameter has a modulatory effect on the long-term potentiation (LTP) of Schaffer-CA1 in rat hippocampus. Then, a 1 x 4 array mu MS device is used to perform magnetic stimulation at 70 KHz/2 mT/1 min, targeting the CA1, CA3, and DG regions individually with single-point magnetic stimulation; and multi-region magnetic stimulation is applied to the double-point targeting regions of CA1-CA3, CA1-DG, and CA3-DG, as well as the triple-point targeting region of CA1-CA3-DG, so as to investigate the regulation of LTP by single-region magnetic stimulation and multi-region magnetic stimulation. The experimental results indicate that, in the case of single-region magnetic stimulation, the magnitude of the increase in LTP in the CA1 region is the greatest, followed by the CA3 region, while the effect of magnetic stimulation on the DG region is less pronounced. In multi-region magnetic stimulation, synergistic magnetic stimulation of the three-point CA1-CA3-DG results in a greater increase in LTP compared to stimulation of two individual areas, and the enhancement of LTP induction with multi-region magnetic stimulation surpasses that of single-region stimulation. This study has implications for the collaborative targeted magnetic stimulation application of arrayed micro-magnetic devices.

AB  - Aging is characterized by progressive functional decline driven by stem cell exhaustion, chronic inflammation, and cellular senescence. Mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs), which play a central role in tissue repair, are particularly vulnerable to age-associated dysfunction. Lei et al. (Cell 188:1-22, 2025) address this limitation by engineering human embryonic stem cell-derived MPCs with enhanced FOXO3 activity (termed SRCs). Intravenous administration of FOXO3-SRCs to aged cynomolgus macaques significantly slowed aging across multiple organs compared to wild-type MPCs. SRC treatment improved cognitive performance, preserved brain structure, protected bone integrity, and rejuvenated immune function. Transcriptomic and DNA methylation aging clocks revealed substantial reductions in biological age, with the most pronounced rejuvenation observed in the reproductive system, skin, lung, muscle, and hippocampus. These effects were partly attributed to SRC-derived exosomes enriched in gero-protective proteins and metabolites. Importantly, SRCs exhibited robust safety, showing no tumorigenicity or immunogenicity. This work positions FOXO3-enhanced MPCs and their exosomes as promising candidates for systemic anti-aging interventions, shifting the therapeutic paradigm from treating individual diseases to targeting the aging process itself.

AB  - This study was conducted to evaluate the distribution of respiratory viral pathogens in the emergency department during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Between May 2020 and September 2022, patients aged between 0.1 and 98 years arrived at the emergency department of Asia University Hospital, and samples from nasopharyngeal swabs were tested by the FilmArray (TM) Respiratory Panel (RP). SARS-CoV-2 positivity was subsequently retested by the cobas Liat system. There were 804 patients for whom the FilmArray (TM) RP was tested, and 225 (27.9%) of them had positive results for respiratory viruses. Rhinovirus/enterovirus was the most commonly detected pathogen, with 170 (61.8%) cases, followed by adenovirus with 38 (13.8%), SARS-CoV-2 with 16 (5.8%) cases, and coronavirus 229E, with 16 (5.8%) cases. SARS-CoV-2 PCR results were positive in 16 (5.8%) cases, and there were two coinfections of SARS-CoV-2 with adenovirus and rhinovirus/enterovirus. A total of 43 (5.3%) patients were coinfected; the most coinfection was adenovirus plus rhinovirus/enterovirus, which was detectable in 18 (41.9%) cases. No atypical pathogens were found in this study. Intriguingly, our results showed that there was prefect agreement between the detection of SARS-CoV-2 conducted with the cobas Liat SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A/B nucleic acid test and the FilmArray TM RP. Therefore, the FilmArray (TM) RP assay is a reliable and feasible method for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. In summary, FilmArray (TM) RP significantly broadens our capability to detect multiple respiratory infections due to viruses and atypical bacteria. It provides a prompt evaluation of pathogens to enhance patient care and clinical selection strategies in emergency departments during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Excessive exercise leads to body fatigue and destroys the balance of the oxidation/oxidation resistance system in the body, thus damaging the central nervous system and reducing learning and memory ability. Nrf2 is an important transcription factor that regulates the cell oxidative stress response. Therefore, the research and development of natural antioxidants with the effect of regulating Nrf2-related signalling pathways to improve central fatigue caused by body fatigue has application value. Methods and results: Cordyceps militaris poly-saccharides were extracted, isolated and purified via DEAE-cellulose 52 and Sepharose CL-6B columns to obtain two saccharides, Cordyceps militaris acidic polysaccharides (CMPB) and CMPB-b. The results of behavioural tests showed that compared with the model group, the learning and memory abilities of the CMPB-H group (800 mg/ kg) mice were remarkably improved in the dark avoidance and Morris water maze tasks (p < 0.01), and the levels of fatigue metabolites and oxidative stress in the body were obviously decreased (p < 0.01). The expression level of BDNF, PI3K, Nrf2 and HO-1 proteins in the hippocampus were significantly increased (p < 0.01). In vitro experiments, compared with the PC12 oxidative stress model group, CMPB-b high-dose group (100 mu g/mL) had remarkably improved oxidative stress. CMPB-b also obviously promoted the phosphorylation of PI3K and AKT proteins (p < 0.01) and the nuclear translocation of Nrf2 (p < 0.01), and significantly increased the expression of HO-1 (p < 0.01). Conclusion: CMPB can alleviate the fatigue state of high-intensity swimming mice and improve the learning and memory impairment of exercise-fatigue mice by regulating the Nrf2-related signalling pathway. Its antioxidant active component CMPB-b exerts in vitro antioxidative neurological damage by the same mechanism. Our systematic studies provide strong supporting evidence for the future use of Cordyceps militaris acidic polysaccharides in health products to improve resistance to fatigue.

AB  - The basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors (TFs) function importantly in numerous life processes in plants. However, bZIP members and their biological roles remain unknown in Camelina sativa, a worldwide promising oil crop. Here, 220 CsbZIP proteins were identified in camelina and classified into thirteen groups. Two and 347 pairs of tandem and segmental duplication genes were detected to be underwent purification selection, with segmental duplication as the main driven-force of CsbZIP gene family expansion. Most CsbZIP genes displayed a tissue-specific expression pattern. Particularly, CsbZIP-A12 significantly positively correlated with many FA/oil biosynthesis-related genes, indicating CsbZIP-A12 may regulate lipid biosynthesis. Notably, yeast one-hybrid (Y1H), beta-Glucuronidase (GUS), dual-luciferase (LUC) and EMSA assays evidenced that CsbZIP-A12 located in nucleus interacted with the promoters of CsSAD2-3 and CsFAD3-3 genes responsible for unsaturated fatty acid (UFA) synthesis, thus activating their transcriptions. Overexpression of CsbZIP-A12 led to an increase of total lipid by 3.275 % compared to the control, followed with oleic and alpha-linolenic acid levels enhanced by 3.4 % and 5.195 %, and up-regulated the expressions of CsSAD2-3, CsFAD3-3 and CsPDAT2-3 in camelina seeds. Furthermore, heterogeneous expression of CsbZIP-A12 significantly up-regulated the expressions of NtSAD2, NtFAD3 and NtPDAT genes in tobacco plants, thereby improving the levels of total lipids and UFAs in both leaves and seeds without negative effects on other agronomic traits. Together, our findings suggest that CsbZIP-A12 upregulates FA/oil biosynthesis by activating CsSAD2-3 and CsFAD3-3 as well as possible other related genes. These data lay a foundation for further functional analyses of CsbZIPs, providing new insights into the TF-based lipid metabolic engineering to increase vegetable oil yield and health-beneficial quality in oilseeds.

AB  - Alcohol is one of the most commonly used addictive substances. Addiction memory is a necessary part of the mechanism underlying drug addiction. Lonicera japonica and its extract can mitigate organ damage caused by alcohol. In this study, Lonicera japonica polysaccharide (LJP) was extracted, and its effect on alcohol addiction memory was investigated. LJP inhibited the cue-induced reinstatement of conditioned place preference and elevated Tuj1 and DCX levels in the hippocampus to suppress neuronal damage. LJP also reduced the hippocampal glutamate (Glu) levels, alcohol-induced abnormal enhancement of the addiction memory, and decreased VPS34 phosphorylation and hyper activation of autophagy pathways in the hippocampus of alcohol-dependent mice. Our results suggest that LJP is a potential functional food to treat or ameliorate alcohol-induced addiction and that VPS34 is a potential target for modulating alcohol cravings.

AB  - This study investigated the neuroprotective effect of 70% ethanol extract of Ecklonia cava (EE) in amyloid beta (A beta)-induced cognitive deficit mice. As a result of analyzing the bioactive compounds in EE, nine compounds were identified using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS). In particular, the diekcol content was quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography with diode-array detection (DAD-HPLC). Biochemical analysis was performed on brain tissue to determine the mechanism of the cognitive function improvement effect of EE. The result showed that EE ameliorated learning and memory decline in behavioral tests on A beta-induced mice. EE also attenuated oxidative stress by regulating malondialdehyde (MDA) content, reduced glutathione (GSH), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels. Similarly, EE also improved mitochondrial dysfunction as mitochondrial membrane potential, ATP production, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. In addition, EE enhanced synapse function by modulating acetylcholine-related enzymes and synaptic structural proteins in the whole brain, hippocampus, and cerebral cortex tissues. Also, EE regulated A beta-induced apoptosis and inflammation through the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) signaling pathways. Furthermore, EE protected neurotoxicity by increasing brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) production. These results suggest that EE may be used as a dietary supplement for the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD).

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, particularly in young people. Diffuse axonal injuries (DAI) are the result of strong rotational and translational forces on the brain parenchyma, leading to cerebral oedema and neuronal death. DAI is typically characterized by coma without focal lesions at presentation and is defined by localized axonal damage in multiple regions of the brain parenchyma, often causing impairment of cognitive and neuro-vegetative function. Following TBI, axonal degeneration has been identified as a progressive process that begins with the disruption of axonal transport, leading subsequently to axonal swelling, axonal ballooning, axonal retraction bulges, secondary disconnection and Wallerian degeneration. The objective of this paper is to report on a series of patients who have suffered fatal traumatic brain injury, in order to verify neurological outcomes in dynamics, relative to the time of injury, using antibodies for neurofilament (NFL), spectrin II, beta-amyloid (beta-APP), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and cluster of differentiation 68 (CD68). From the studied cases, a total of 50 cases were chosen, which formed two study groups. The first study group comprises 30 cases divided according to survival interval. The control group comprises 20 cases with no history of traumatic brain injury. Cardiovascular disease and history of stroke, cases suffering from loss of vital functions, a post-traumatic survival time of less than 15 min, autolysis and putrefaction were established as criteria for exclusion. Based on their expression, we tested for diagnosis and degree of DAI as a strong predictor of mortality. Immunoreactivity was significantly increased in the DAI group compared to the control group. The earliest changes were recorded for GFAP and CD68 immunolabeling, followed by beta-APP, spectrin II and NFM. The most intense changes in immunostaining were recorded for spectrin II. Comparative analysis of brain apoptosis, reactive astrocytosis and inflammatory reaction using specific immunohistochemical markers can provide important information on diagnosis of DAI and prognosis, and may elucidate the timing of the traumatic event in traumatic brain injury.

AB  - NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), the key transcription regulator of phase II enzymes, has been considered beneficial for neuronal protection. We previously designed a novel chalcone analog, 1-(2,3,4-trimethoxyphenyl)-2-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)-acrylketone (Tak), that could specifically activate Nrf2 in vitro. Here, we report that Tak confers significant hippocampal neuronal protection both in vitro and in vivo. Treatment with Tak has no significant toxicity on cultured neuronal cells. Instead, Tak increases cellular ATP production by increasing mitochondrial function and decreases the levels of reactive oxygen species by activating Nrf2-mediated phase II enzyme expression. Tak pretreatment prevents glutamate-induced excitotoxic neuronal death accompanied by suppressed mitochondrial respiration, increased superoxide production, and activation of apoptosis. Further investigation indicates that the protective effect of Tak is mediated by the Akt signaling pathway. Meanwhile, Tak administration in mice can sufficiently abrogate scopolamine-induced cognitive impairment via decreasing hippocampal oxidative stress. In addition, consistent benefits are also observed in an energy stress mouse model under a high-fat diet, as the administration of Tak remarkably increases Akt signaling-mediated antioxidative enzyme expression and prevents hippocampal neuronal apoptosis without significant effect on the mouse metabolic status. Overall, our study demonstrates that Tak protects cognitive function by Akt-mediated Nrf2 activation to maintain redox status both vivo and in vitro, suggesting that Tak is a promising pharmacological candidate for the treatment of oxidative neuronal diseases.

AB  - Bridge construction equipment (BCE) is crucial for efficiently executing large-scale infrastructure projects, particularly those involving continuous long-span bridges. Current BCE technologies, like the Overhead Movable Scaffolding System (OMSS), are often chosen for their high efficiency and cost-effective reusability. However, the lack of a standardised design framework tailored to Australian conditions complicates the design process, potentially leading to increased inefficiencies and safety concerns. This research project seeks to establish a novel design procedure for BCE, using the OMSS in Australia as a case study. The project adopts parametric design techniques using Rhinoceros (Rhino) 3D and Grasshopper to create a three-dimensional linear model. This model undergoes initial structural optimisation with Karamba3D. Subsequent advanced analyses include linear static design assessments performed in Strand7, a sophisticated finite element analysis software. The evaluation primarily utilises Australian standards to assess performance against various load types and combinations, such as permanent (dead), imposed (live), and wind loads. The structural integrity, including maximum displacement, axial forces, and bending moments, is manually verified against the analysis outcomes. The results confirm that the OMSS model adheres to ultimate and serviceability limit state requirements, affirming the effectiveness of the proposed design procedure for BCE. The research culminates in a design procedure flowchart and further suggests future research directions to refine BCE design methodologies for complex bridge construction scenarios.

AB  - Ischemic stroke is the main cause of death/disability, posing a great menace to human health. Though efforts to search for therapeutic drugs are ongoing, few of them have succeeded. Adenosine A(1) receptor (A1R) activation could ameliorate ischemic injury, representing a very tempting target for stroke treatment. Tetrahydroxy stilbene glycoside (TSG), a potent antioxidant from the well-known Chinese herb Polygonum multiflorum Thunb., has been reported to have notable neuroprotective activities but the underlying mechanisms are elusive. This study investigated the mechanism of TSG focusing on A1R. TSG markedly decreased mortality, neurological deficit score, cerebral infarct size and brain water content of MCAO rats, and ameliorated the disorders in purine metabolism, energy metabolism and antioxidative defense system. TSG helped the survival of SH-SY5Y cells in OGD/R by alleviating oxidative stress and glutamate release, and by maintaining calcium homeostasis. TSG effects were abolished by A1R antagonist DPCPX. Docking and binding assays confirmed the binding of TSG with A1R. In addition, TSG upregulated the A1R level lowered by MCAO and OGD/R. The downstream signals of A1R activation, ERK1/2, HIF-1 alpha and NF-kappa B contributed to the neuroprotection of TSG. Moreover, void of "well-known" cardiovascular side effects of classical A1R agonists, TSG showcased its great potential for stroke treatment.

AB  - Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is a type of kidney cancer. It advances quickly and often metastasizes, making the prognosis for patients challenging. This study used weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to study gene expression data of different stages of ccRCC obtained in the GEO database. The analysis identified three significant highly preserved gene modules across the datasets: GSE53757, GSE22541, GSE66272, and GSE73731. Functional annotation and pathway enrichment analysis using DAVID revealed inflammatory pathways (e.g., NF-kB, Hippo, and HIF-1 pathways) that may drive ccRCC development and progression. The study also introduced the involvement of viral infections associated with the disease in the metabolic reprogramming of ccRCC. A drug repurposing analysis was also conducted to identify potential drug candidates for ccRCC using the upregulated and downregulated hub genes. The top candidates are ziprasidone (dopamine and serotonin receptor antagonist) and fentiazac (cyclooxygenase inhibitor). Other drug candidates were also obtained, such as phosphodiesterase/DNA methyltransferase/ATM kinase inhibitors, acetylcholine antagonists, and NAD precursors. Overall, the study's findings suggest that identifying several genes and signaling pathways related to ccRCC may uncover new targets, biomarkers, and even drugs that can be repurposed, which can help develop new and effective treatments for the disease.

AB  - Termites can cause severe economic damage in households, reservoirs, agriculture, and forests. Monitoring termite activity plays an important role in integrated termite management. A device for the automatic monitoring of termites with high accuracy and reliability is highly demanded. Here, we introduce Dekan electromagnetic induction with non-looping (DEMINL) method and a novel wireless system for the monitoring of termite activities. The system comprises of a termite bait station and a handheld reader. While the wood pieces in the bait station were consumed by termites, the device could generate alarm signals, which are sent to a signal reader (receiver) through radio frequency identification (RFID) and displayed on the handheld reader's screen. Field tests at three locations over a two-year period showed an accurate detection rate of 97.5-98.5%. The DEMINL-based device demonstrated high accuracy and durability in detecting termites, making it suitable for termite monitoring in households, crop fields, forests, and reservoirs.

AB  - A low-clearance tunnel portal in the shallow-buried, joint-developed, broken, and loose surrounding rock slope deposit may cause safety issues during construction. In this study, the Guanyin Mountain Tunnel of the Chong-Ai expressway was taken as a case study, and the characteristics of the loose and broken surrounding rocks, their low clearance, and shallow buried bias were comprehensively studied. The three-dimensional numerical model of the Guanyin Mountain tunnel portal section was constructed by the Rhino, AutoCAD, and FLAC 3D software, and the whole construction process of the tunnel portal was simulated. Under the conditions of loose and broken surrounding rocks, the surrounding rock deformation, surface settlement, and slope stability at the portal of the shallow buried tunnel with a small clear distance during the construction of the center diaphragm (CD) method and circular reserved core soil method were studied. The following conclusions are drawn. During the simulated excavation of the tunnel, the maximum surface settlement is 10.74 mm, which meets the requirement of the specification. When the left tunnel is excavated, the surrounding rock deformation of the right arch shoulder should be carefully considered. The maximum deformation value can reach 14.314 mm. After excavation, the deformation rate of the right tunnel is large, and initial support should be installed in time. Since the stratum rock at the portal of the tunnel is strongly weathered, the uplift value of the arch bottom is large and gradually decreases along the axial direction. The tunnel arch bottom and arch foot are plastic areas prone to tensile damage. Therefore, it is imperative to strengthen the inverted arch support of the tunnel in the strongly weathered rock stratum. The excavation sequence of the tunnel portal section adopts the method of excavating the left tunnel first and then excavating the right tunnel, which is more conducive to ensuring the slope stability.

AB  - We aim to determine the sleep correlates of age-related brain loss in a sample of middle-aged to older males with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). We recruited consecutive treatment naive male patients with moderate to severe OSA from January to November of 2019. We excluded participants if they had dementia, stroke or heart disease. We collected demographic variables and vascular risk factors. We also obtained the insomnia severity index, the Epworth sleepiness scale and the Pittsburgh sleep quality index. We also obtained computerized neurocognitive testing with the go-no-go response inhibition test, Stroop interference test, catch game test, staged information processing speed test, verbal memory test and non-verbal memory test. We derived age and education adjusted domain-specific Z-scores for global cognition, memory, attention, processing speed and executive function. We used brain MRI T1-weighted images to derive total hippocampal and gray matter volumes. Partial correlations evaluated associations between variables from sleep questionnaires (e.g., insomnia severity index score), and polysomnographic variables (the apnea-hypopnea index, average oxygen levels during sleep) with cognitive domains and brain volumes. We examined 16 participants with an age range of 40-76 years, 73% Hispanic/Latino. The mean apnea-hypopnea index was 48.9 +/- 25.5 and average oxygen saturation during sleep was 91.4% +/- 6.9%. Hypertension was seen in 66% and diabetes mellitus in 27%. We found that the insomnia severity index score and average oxygen levels during sleep had the strongest correlations with brain volumes and cognition. These preliminary findings may aid in developing future strategies to improve age-related brain loss in patients with OSA.

AB  - Due to their antioxidant and other beneficial properties, polyphenol-rich plants are important functional foods. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the content of two polyphenols-ellagic acid and quercetin-in fruits of wild medicinal plants of Polish origin, as potential sources of these compounds. The research material was chosen considering both the popularity of the fruits and their recognized medicinal and pharmaceutical properties. All selected fruits-barberry (Berberis vulgaris), blackthorn (Prunus spinosa), chokeberry (Aronia melanocarpa), elderberry (Sambucus nigra), hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna), lingonberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea), rowanberry (Sorbus aucuparia), and sea-buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides syn. Elaeagnus rhamnoides)-are known for therapeutic use in Polish folk medicine. Extracts were analyzed for ellagic acid and quercetin content using UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS. Quantitative results revealed that barberries, blackthorn, and sea-buckthorn contained the highest amounts of ellagic acid, up to 3.29 +/- 0.24, 3.50 +/- 0.16, and 4.80 +/- 0.18 mu g/g dw, respectively, while lingonberry provided up to 196.20 +/- 3.10 mu g/g dw of quercetin, making it a valuable dietary source of this flavonoid. The study confirms that Polish wild medicinal plants are valuable reservoirs of key polyphenols relevant to human health and support their potential inclusion in dietary strategies for disease prevention.

AB  - An acute stressor can cause sleep disruptions. Electroencephalography (EEG) is one of the major tools to measure sleep. In rats, sleep stages are classified as rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep and non-rapid-eye movement (NREM) sleep, by different characteristics of EEGs. Sleep alterations after exposure to an acute stress are regularly determined by the power spectra of brain waves and the changes of vigilance stages, and they all depend on EEG analysis. Herein, we hypothesized that the Shannon entropy can be employed as an indicator to detect stress-induced sleep alterations, since we noticed that an acute stressor, the footshock stimulation, causes certain uniformity changes of the spectrograms during NREM and REM sleep in rats. The present study applied the Shannon entropy on three features of brain waves, including the amplitude, frequency, and oscillation phases, to measure the uniformities in the footshock-induced alterations of sleep EEGs. Our result suggests that the footshock stimuli resulted in a smoother and uniform amplitude as well as varied frequencies of EEG waveforms during REM sleep. In contrast, the EEGs during NREM sleep exhibited a smoother, but less uniform, amplitude after the footshock stimuli. The result depicts the change property of brain waves after exposure to an acute stressor and, also, demonstrates that the Shannon entropy could be used to detect EEG alteration in sleep disorders.

AB  - BackgroundLiver fibrosis is a common pathological process of chronic liver disease, characterized by excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM). Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been found to have potential therapy effect on liver fibrosis, but the mechanism involved was still unclear. The objective of this study is to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSCs) on the treatment of liver fibrosis, with particular emphasis on elucidating the underlying mechanism of action through which ADMSCs inhibit the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs).MethodsADMSCs were isolated from adipose tissue and injected intravenously into hepatic fibrosis model of rats. The histopathological changes, liver function, collagen deposition, the expression of fibroin and Hippo pathway were evaluated. In vitro, ADMSCs were co-cultured with HSCs activated by transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), and the inhibitor of Hippo pathway was used to evaluate the therapeutic mechanism of ADMSCs transplantation.ResultsThe results showed that after the transplantation of ADMSCs, the liver function of rats was improved, the degree of liver fibrosis and collagen deposition were reduced, and the Hippo signaling pathway was activated. In vitro, ADMSCs can effectively inhibit the proliferation and activation of HSCs induced by TGF-beta 1 treatment. However, the inhibitory effect of ADMSCs was weakened after blocking the Hippo signaling pathway.ConclusionsADMSCs inhibit HSCs activation by regulating YAP/TAZ, thereby promoting functional recovery after liver fibrosis. These findings lay a foundation for further investigation into the precise mechanism by which ADMSCs alleviate liver fibrosis.

AB  - Many neurodegenerative diseases have several similar cellular dysregulations. We investigated the inhibitory role of Ishige okamurae, an edible brown alga, on neurodegenerative processes by estimating the effects of Ishige okamurae on excitotoxicity induced by glutamate in vitro and neurodegeneration induced by trimethyltin (TMT) in vivo. This study aimed to describe the molecular mechanisms responsible for the mediating anti-neurodegenerative effects of Ishige okamurae extract (IOE). The oral administration of IOE to TMT-injected mice impeded the TMT-mediated short- and long-term memory impairments investigated by the Morris water maze and Y-maze test. IOE attenuated TMT-mediated cellular apoptosis and the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in mice brains. Glutamate-induced apoptosis and the expression of reactive oxygen species, Nrf2, and HO-1 in HT22 cells were also attenuated by IOE. In addition, TMT- and glutamate-induced phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in mouse brain tissues and HT22 cells were attenuated by the treatment of IOE. In HT22 cells, administration of MAPK inhibitors recovered the glutamate induced by the expression of Nrf2, HO-1, and cellular dysregulation to the equal extent to IOE administration. Taken together, these results suggest that IOE could attenuate neurodegenerative processes, such as TMT- and glutamate-mediated neuronal dysregulation, by regulating MAPKs/Nrf-2/HO-1 antioxidant pathways.

AB  - Termites pose a threat to water conservancy infrastructure due to their concealed, recurring, and long-term destructive behaviors. Consequently, implementing termite monitoring in critical hydrological facilities-such as reservoirs-is essential for timely prevention and control. Owing to its real-time efficiency, environmental sustainability, and overall effectiveness, the intelligent termite monitoring system has gradually emerged as a pivotal strategy for termite management. This paper systematically expounds upon the fundamental principles, overarching architecture, and key features of the current intelligent termite monitoring technology in China. Drawing on its practical application in the Suokoutan Reservoir, we detail the specific implementation procedures and examine the corresponding outcomes. Furthermore, an in-depth analysis of the system's prospective development is presented, providing feasible references and scientific guidance for advancing termite monitoring, early warning, and control in water conservancy projects.

AB  - Featured Application Endolysosomal cathepsin expression and activities are differentially regulated in the cortex, striatum, hippocampus, and cerebellum of mice upon aging and/or cathepsin deficiencies. The association of cathepsin proteases in neurobiology is increasingly recognized. Our previous studies indicated that cathepsin-K-deficient (Ctsk(-/-)) mice have learning and memory impairments. Alterations in cathepsin expression are known to result in compensatory changes in levels of related cathepsins. To gain insight into the therapeutic usefulness of cathepsin inhibitors in aging individuals with osteoporosis or neurodegenerative diseases, we studied for variations in cathepsin expression and activity in aged (18-20 months) versus young (5-7 months) wild-type (WT) and cathepsin-deficient mice brains. There were age-dependent increases in cathepsin B, D, and L and cystatin C protein levels in various brain regions, mainly of WT and Ctsk(-/-) mice. This corresponded with changes in activity levels of cathepsins B and L, but not cathepsin D. In contrast, very little age-dependent variation was observed in cathepsin-B- and cathepsin-L-deficient mouse brain, especially at the protein level. The observed alterations in cathepsin protein amounts and activity are likely contributing to changes in important aging-related processes such as autophagy. In addition, the results provide insight into the potential impact of cathepsin inhibitor therapy in aged individuals, as well as in long-term use of cathepsin inhibitor therapy.

AB  - This study investigates the effects of in vitro digestion on the antioxidant activity and release of phenolics, xanthine alkaloids, and L-theanine contents of matcha. It establishes digestibility values between 61.2-65.8%. Considering native matcha, the rutin content (303-479 mu g/g) reached higher values than catechin (10.2-23.1 mu g/g). Chlorogenic acid (2090-2460 mu g/g) was determined as predominant. Rutin, quercetin, ferulic, ellagic, and caffeic acid were the least-released phenolics, and their remaining residues reached 76-84%. Protocatechuic, hydroxybenzoic acid, epigallocatechin, and epigallocatechin-3-gallate were the best-released phenolics, with the remaining residues under 1%. Caffeine, L-theanine, and theobromine contents in native matcha reached 16.1, 9.85, and 0.27 mg/g, respectively. Only caffeine (3.66-5.26 mg/g) and L-theanine (0.09-0.15 mg/g) were monitored in the undigested residue, representing 13 and 0.1% of the remaining part, respectively. A chemiluminescence assay showed that water-soluble antioxidants showed significant antioxidant activity in native matcha, while lipid-soluble compounds showed higher antioxidant activity in the undigested samples. Cinnamic and neochlorogenic acids were determined as the main contributors to the ACW values in the undigested matcha, epicatechin, and quercetin in the ACL fraction. The application of the digestion process reduced the antioxidant activity by more than 94%. SEM has proved specific digestion patterns of in vitro digestibility of matcha.

AB  - Background and aim. Acute rhinitis (AR) is a common condition in children, primarily of viral origin, causing nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, and discomfort, with a significant impact on quality of life and economic burden. Current treatments are limited to symptomatic relief, with nasal irrigation being the primary non-pharmacological intervention. This study aimed at evaluating the efficacy and safety of Elysium Naso-gola-an isotonic saline solution enriched with mullein (Verbascum thapsus), thyme (Thymus vulgaris), propolis, and long-chain polyphosphates-in reducing symptom severity and duration in pediatric AR. Methods. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot trial was conducted on 60 children (aged 4-14 years) with AR. Participants were randomized into two groups: the active group received Elysium Naso-gola, while the placebo group received a sterile isotonic saline solution, both administered as nasal sprays four times daily for seven days. Symptom severity was assessed at baseline (T0), day 5 (T1), and day 10 (T2) using the I-NOSE questionnaire and Visual Analog Scale (VAS). The primary outcome was symptom reduction at T1, while secondary outcomes included nasal obstruction improvement and complete symptom resolution at T2. Results. At baseline, both groups exhibited comparable symptoms severity. At T1, the active group showed a significant reduction in I-NOSE scores compared to placebo group (p < 0.05), with a marked decrease in nasal obstruction severity. VAS scores also indicated a greater improvement in nasal breathing in the active group. At T2, complete symptom resolution was achieved in 60% of patients treated with Elysium Naso-gola, compared to only 5.3% in the placebo group (p < 0.01). No adverse events were reported, and treatment adherence was high in both groups. Conclusions. The findings suggest that Elysium Naso-gola is a safe and effective non-pharmacological treatment for pediatric AR, providing faster symptom relief and higher resolution rates. Larger multicenter trials are warranted to confirm these preliminary results and further explore its role in pediatric respiratory care.

AB  - Proper selection and application of preprocessing steps are crucial for obtaining accurate segmentation in brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact brain extraction (BE) and bias field correction (BFC) methods have on regional brain volume (RBV) measurements of preterm neonates' T2w MRI at term-equivalent age (TEA). Five BE methods (Manual, BET2, SWS, HD-BET, SynthStrip) were applied together with two BFC methods (SPM-BFC and N4ITK), before segmenting the neonatal brain into eight tissue classes (cortical grey matter, white matter, cerebral spinal fluid, deep nuclear grey matter, hippocampus, amygdala, cerebellum, and brainstem) using an automated segmentation software (MANTiS). Quantitative assessments were conducted, including the coefficient of variation (CV), coefficient of joint variation (CJV), Dice coefficient (DC), and RBV. HD-BET, together with N4ITK, showed the highest performance (mean +/- standard deviation) regarding CV of 0.047 +/- 0.005 (white matter) and 0.070 +/- 0.005 (grey matter), CJV of 0.662 +/- 0.095, DC of 0.942 +/- 0.063, and RBV without significant differences (except in the brainstem) from the manual segmentation. Therefore, such combination of methods is recommended for improved skull-stripping accuracy, intensity homogeneity, and reproducibility of RBV of T2w MRI at TEA.

AB  - Construction engineering projects are costly and require large amounts of labor, physical, and financial resources. The failure of a construction engineering project typically brings huge losses. Previous studies have focused on the identification of risks, but insufficient attention has been given to strategic resource allocation for risk management after risk identification. Statistics show that most construction engineering project failures are caused by common risks. Common risks are called gray rhino risks. This metaphor illustrates that many risks are obvious but dangerous. This study was motivated by the challenge of efficiently managing gray rhino risks with limited inputs. The literature suggests that gray rhino risks are abundant in construction engineering projects and that there are mutual eliciting relationships between them, which make it difficult for the manager to devote enough resources to the prevention of key risks. Considerable resources are wasted on unimportant risks, resulting in key risk occurrence and failure of construction engineering projects. Therefore, this study describes an innovative multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) technique for ranking risks based on the strength of the eliciting relationships between them. This study used the fuzzy technique and created an interference fuzzy analytical network process (IF-ANP) method. By employing the IF-ANP alongside a decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) approach, the subjectivity can be effectively reduced and the accuracy improved during expert risk evaluation for construction engineering projects. IF-ANP was used to quantify eliciting relationships between risks and DEMATEL was used to rank risks based on the IF-ANP result. An empirical study was done to meticulously rank five risks that were selected from the gray rhino risks in the Chengdu-Chongqing Middle Line High-speed Railway construction engineering project. They are capital chain rupture, decision failure, policy and legal risk, economic downturn, and stakeholder conflict. The results showed that the policy and legal risk was the source of other risks, and that these other risks were symptoms rather than the disease.

AB  - Background: Intranasal administration of lysine aspirin (LAS) is a safe and effective method for aspirin treatment after desensitisation (ATAD). Changes in quality of life (QoL) in patients on intranasal LAS have not been documented and we aimed to investigate QoL in N-ERD patients on or off nasal ATAD. Moreover, an estimate of the cost burden of intranasal LAS is given. Methods: A cross-sectional review was conducted for all challenge-confirmed N-ERD patients who were in follow-up in our rhinology clinic. They were asked to complete a SNOT-22 questionnaire, a visual analogue scale for sense of smell (sVAS). Information on prices of LAS and other consumables used for intranasal ATAD was obtained from our hospital pharmacy to obtain an estimate of the cost burden. Results: Thirty-four patients replied to the email (79.1% response rate). Of these, 21 (61.8%) were on intranasal LAS. A statistically significant lower score in the total SNOT-22 was found amongst patients on intranasal LAS (p = 0.02). The subanalysis of SNOT-22 domains showed that patients on LAS had statistically significant lower scores in the domains "rhinologic symptoms" (p = 0.05), "function" (p = 0.02), and "emotion" (p = 0.01). No significant differences were observed when looking at sVAS. The cost of 1-year treatment of LAS per person was approximate to GBP 180.7 with a daily cost of approximate to GBP 0.50. Conclusions: This study supports the efficacy of nasal ATAD in the management of N-ERD and suggests that long-term use can lead to QoL improvement with cost benefits.

AB  - To increase the value of the by-products of the canned tuna industry, the memory enhancement effect and the possible mechanisms of omega-3-rich tuna oil in bilateral ovariectomized (OVX) rats were assessed. Female rats were orally given tuna oil at doses of 140, 200, and 250 mg/kg of body weight (BW) for 28 days before OVX and for 21 days continually after OVX. Memory performance was assessed every week, whereas the parameters regarding mechanisms of action were assessed at the end of the study. All doses of tuna oil enhanced memory, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) levels, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities but decreased cortisol, acetylcholinesterase (AChE), malondialdehyde (MDA), and inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Medium and high doses of tuna oil suppressed monoamine oxidase (MAO) but increased eNOS activity. A high dose of tuna oil suppressed gamma-aminotransferase (GABA-T) but increased glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) and sirtuin-1. A medium dose of tuna oil decreased homocysteine (Hcys) and C-reactive protein. No change in telomere or estradiol was observed in this study. Our results suggest the memory-enhancing effect of tuna oil in an OVX rat model of menopause. The main mechanisms may involve a reduction in oxidative stress, inflammation, and neurotransmitter regulation.

AB  - Background/Objectives: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is marked by amyloid-beta plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), leading to cognitive decline and debilitating non-cognitive symptoms. This study aimed to evaluate compounds from four different classes in a short-term (7-day) study using transgenic tau mice to assess their ability to reduce non-cognitive symptoms. The best candidate was then evaluated for longer exposure to assess non-cognitive symptoms, cognition, and pathology. Methods: Tg4510 mice, expressing mutated human tau (P301L), were administered with levetiracetam, methylphenidate, diazepam, and quetiapine for 7 days at 6 months old, when pathology and cognitive deficits are established. Drugs were given in the diet, and non-cognitive symptoms were evaluated using metabolic cages. Levetiracetam was chosen for longer exposure (3 months) in 3-month-old Tg4510 mice and non-transgenic controls to assess behavior and pathology. Results: After 3 months of diet, levetiracetam mildly reduced tau pathology in the hippocampus but did not improve cognition in Tg4510 mice. Interestingly, it influenced appetite, body weight, anxiety-like behavior, and contextual fear memory in non-transgenic animals but not in Tg4510 mice. Conclusions: While levetiracetam has shown benefits in amyloid deposition models, it had limited effects on tau pathology and behavior in an animal model of tau deposition, which is crucial for AD context. The differential effects on non-transgenic versus Tg4510 mice warrant further investigation.

AB  - A small number of robust studies have explored the association between cognitive tests and marital status levels of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients using the TADPOLE dataset. Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) cognition performance combined with marital status levels is associated with increased odds of MCI than either RAVLT in isolation. The cross-sectional association between RAVLT performance in immediate response, learning, forgetting, and perception of forgetting with marital status and MCI was evaluated using TADPOLE data. We included participants with MCI and normal cognition in our study. Based on our logistic regression model, four RAVLT subgroups are associated with MCI (low and high response performance, immediate response with learning, immediate response with learning and forgetting, immediate response with learning, forgetting, and perception of forgetting). We adjusted models for sex, age, race, marital status, education, ethnicity, APOE4 genotype, hippocampus, whole brain, ventricles, and ICV. A mean age of 77/67 years was observed in the sample (n = 6560), 44% of participants were females, and 58% had mild cognitive impairment. Subgroups whose ages are 61 to 70 (OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.15-0.45) and older (OR 0.07, 95% CI 0.04-0.12), as well as race: black/African American (OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.03-0.52), multiple races (OR 0.05, 95% CI 0.01-0.24), and never married (OR 0.2, 95% CI 0.12-0.34) were negatively associated with immediate response and forgetting subgroup tests. There is a need for studies that evaluate other cognitive tests in the TADPOLE dataset with missing data as a predictive tool that aligns with the factors associated with MCI.

AB  - Cold-pressed camelina oil (CPCO) is exceptional seed oil with a unique fatty acid profile promoting health and wellness. Therefore, this work focused on estimating and comparing the physicochemical properties and sensory quality of eight CPCO samples available on the Polish market. All analyzed oils were rich in alpha-linolenic acid (ALA = 29.91-36.27%) and contained low amounts of saturated fatty acids (SAFA = 10.61-12.20%). Oxidative stability of the studied CPCO samples, using the Rancimat test, ranged between 4.8 and 6.8 h, while peroxide (PV = 0.58-4.61 meq O-2/kg) and anisidine (AnV = 0.15-1.60) values differed significantly. Moreover, the water and volatile matter contents (WVMC = 0.05-0.17%) and phosphorus level (P = 3.03-13.58 mg/kg) were monitored in commercial CPCO samples. Low concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon contaminants (sigma 4PAHs = 0.72-7.22 mu g/kg) were established in all oils. A quantitative descriptive analysis (QDA) was developed to characterize the sensory properties of eight CPCO samples. Six oil samples had high overall sensory quality (OSQ > 4.0), but OSQ < 3.5 was an unacceptance sensory quality for two of the oils. The developed lexicon might be used in the oil industry to monitor product quality, sensory profiling of new product development, and benchmark competitors' samples.

AB  - Epilepsy (EP) is one of the most common neurological diseases in the world. Anemarrhena asphodeloides Bunge. (AA), as a typical heat-cleaning medicine, has been proven to possess the antiepileptic effect in clinical and experimental studies. Anemarrhena asphodeloides steroidal saponins (AAS) are main components. However, the therapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms of AAS against EP are not been fully elucidated. In this study, 63 steroidal saponins were discovered in AAS by UPLC-Q-TOF/MS analysis. Pharmacological and behavioral analysis demonstrated that AAS could significantly lower the Racine classification and reduce the frequency of generalized spike rhythm the rate of tetanic seizures in kainic acid-induced epileptic rats. Hematoxylin and eosin and Nissl staining-indicated AAS could significantly improve hippocampal injury and neuron loss in epileptic rats. TMT proteomic analysis discovered 26 different expressed proteins (DEPs), which were identified as the rescue proteins. After bioinformatic analysis, Heat Shock Protein 90 Alpha Family Class B Member 1 (Hsp90ab1) and Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase (Ywhab) were screened as key DEPs and verified by western blotting. AAS could significantly inhibited the up-regulation of Hsp90ab1 and Ywhab in EP rats; these two proteins might be the key targets of AAS in treating EP.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a debilitating systemic disorder that has a detrimental impact on the overall well-being of individuals. Emerging research suggests that long non-coding RNAs play a role in neural development and function. Nevertheless, the precise relationship between lncRNAs and Alzheimer's disease remains uncertain. The authors' recent discoveries have uncovered an unconventional mechanism involving the regulation of synaptic plasticity and the functioning of the hippocampal fragile X mental retardation protein 1 (FMR1)-neurotrophin 3 (NTF3) pathway, which is mediated by cancer susceptibility candidate 15 (CASC15). Subsequently, functional rescue experiments were performed to illustrate the efficient delivery of exosomes harboring a significant amount of 2610307p16Rik transcripts, which is the murine equivalent of human CASC15, to the hippocampal region of mice. This resulted in significant improvements in synaptic morphological plasticity and cognitive function in APP/PS1 mice. Given the pivotal involvement of CASC15 in synaptic plasticity and the distinctive regulatory mechanisms of the CASC15-FMR1-NTF3 axis, CASC15 emerges as a promising biomarker for Alzheimer's disease and may even possess potential as a feasible therapeutic target.

AB  - Central and systemic inflammation play pivotal roles in epileptogenesis and proepileptogenesis in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). The interplay between peripheral CD4+ T cells and central microglia orchestrates the "systemic-central" immune response in TLE. However, the precise molecular mechanisms linking central and systemic inflammation in TLE remain unknown. This preliminary findings revealed an imbalance in Th1/Th2 subsets in the periphery, accompanied by related cytokines release in TLE patients. they proposed that this peripheral Th1/Th2 imbalance may influence central inflammation by mediating microglial state dynamics within epileptic foci and distant brain regions. In Li-pilocarpine-induced TLE rats, a peripheral Th1/Th2 imbalance and observed corresponding central and systemic responses is confirmed. Notably, CD4+ T cells infiltrated through the compromised blood-brain barrierand are spatially close to microglia around epileptic foci. Intravenous depletion and reinfusion of CD4+ T cells modulated microglia state dynamics and altered neuroinflammatory cytokines secretion. Moreover, mRNA sequencing of the human hippocampus identified Notch1 as a key regulator of Th1/Th2 differentiation, CD4+ T cell recruitment to brain infiltration sites, and the regulation of microglial responses, seizure frequency, and cognition. This study underscores the significance of Th1/Th2 imbalance in modulating the "systemic-central" response in TLE, highlighting Notch1 as a potential therapeutic target.
   This study identifies a significant association between peripheral Th1/Th2 imbalance and central microglia state dynamics during temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) progression. It underscores the complex interaction between peripheral CD4+ T cells and central microglia in orchestrating the 'systemic-central' immune response in TLE, with Notch 1 emerging as a potential therapeutic target to mitigate central inflammation. image

AB  - The plant hormone salicylic acid (SA) plays critical roles in plant innate immunity. Several SA derivatives and associated modification are identified, whereas the range and modes of action of SA-related metabolites remain elusive. Here, the study discovered 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,4-DHBA) and its glycosylated form as native SA derivatives in plants whose accumulation is largely induced by SA application and Ps. camelliae-sinensis (Pcs) infection. CsSH1, a 4/5-hydroxylase, catalyzes the hydroxylation of SA to 2,4-DHBA, and UDP-glucosyltransferase UGT95B17 catalyzes the formation of 2,4-DHBA glucoside. Down-regulation reduced the accumulation of 2,4-DHBA glucosides and enhanced the sensitivity of tea plants to Pcs. Conversely, overexpression of UGT95B17 increased plant disease resistance. The exogenous application of 2,4-DHBA and 2,5-DHBA, as well as the accumulation of DHBA and plant resistance comparison, indicate that 2,4-DHBA functions as a potentially bioactive molecule and is stored mainly as a glucose conjugate in tea plants, differs from the mechanism described in Arabidopsis. When 2,4-DHBA is applied exogenously, UGT95B17-silenced tea plants accumulated more 2,4-DHBA than SA and showed induced resistance to Pcs infection. These results indicate that 2,4-DHBA glucosylation positively regulates disease resistance and highlight the role of 2,4-DHBA as potentially bioactive molecule in the establishment of basal resistance in tea plants.

AB  - Elevated Wnt/beta-catenin signaling has been commonly associated with tumorigenesis especially colorectal cancer (CRC). Here, an MST4-p beta-catenin(Thr40) signaling axis essential for intestinal stem cell (ISC) homeostasis and CRC development is uncovered. In response to Wnt3a stimulation, the kinase MST4 directly phosphorylates beta-catenin at Thr40 to block its Ser33 phosphorylation by GSK3 beta. Thus, MST4 mediates an active process that prevents beta-catenin from binding to and being degraded by beta-TrCP, leading to accumulation and full activation of beta-catenin. Depletion of MST4 causes loss of ISCs and inhibits CRC growth. Mice bearing either MST4(T178E) mutation with constitutive kinase activity or beta-catenin(T40D) mutation mimicking MST4-mediated phosphorylation show overly increased ISCs/CSCs and exacerbates CRC. Furthermore, the MST4-p beta-catenin(Thr40) axis is upregulated and correlated with poor prognosis of human CRC. Collectively, this work establishes a previously undefined machinery for beta-catenin activation, and further reveals its function in stem cell and tumor biology, opening new opportunities for targeted therapy of CRC.

AB  - Although the intestinal clock (the circadian timing system in the gastrointestinal tract) is known to direct a wide variety of diurnal nutrients and metabolites, its role in the functioning of extra-intestinal tissues such as the brain remains elusive. Here the role of the intestinal clock in shaping cognitive function is investigated. It is found that Bmal1-iKO mice (mice with Bmal1 [Brain and muscle Arnt-like protein 1] specifically knocked out in the intestine, a mouse line deficient in intestinal clock function) show a defect in cognitive memory irrespective of the time-of-day. Bmal1-iKO-associated cognitive decline is attributed to impaired adenosine signaling and compromised long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus. Adenosine signaling promotes LTP via enhancing BDNF expression and inhibiting synapse loss. Furthermore, the impairment in adenosine signaling is accounted for by the reductions in intestinal absorption of and hippocampal level of adenosine but not by a change in adenosine receptors. Consistently, adenosine supplementation rescues cognitive deficits associated with the malfunction of the intestinal clock. Moreover, BMAL1 regulates the expression of ADK (adenosine kinase, a primary enzyme for adenosine clearance) in the small intestine and thus promotes intestinal adenosine absorption through REV-ERB alpha which binds directly to Adk P2 promoter to inhibit its transcription. Together, an unsuspected role of the intestinal clock in controlling cognitive memory is identified, highlighting the intestinal clock as a promising target for the management of cognitive disorders.

AB  - Simultaneously recording network activity and ultrastructural changes of the synapse is essential for advancing understanding of the basis of neuronal functions. However, the rapid millisecond-scale fluctuations in neuronal activity and the subtle sub-diffraction resolution changes of synaptic morphology pose significant challenges to this endeavor. Here, specially designed graphene microelectrode arrays (G-MEAs) are used, which are compatible with high spatial resolution imaging across various scales as well as permit high temporal resolution electrophysiological recordings to address these challenges. Furthermore, alongside G-MEAs, an easy-to-implement machine learning algorithm is developed to efficiently process the large datasets collected from MEA recordings. It is demonstrated that the combined use of G-MEAs, machine learning (ML) spike analysis, and 4D structured illumination microscopy (SIM) enables monitoring the impact of disease progression on hippocampal neurons which are treated with an intracellular cholesterol transport inhibitor mimicking Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC), and show that synaptic boutons, compared to untreated controls, significantly increase in size, leading to a loss in neuronal signaling capacity.

AB  - Plants exhibit remarkable regenerative abilities under stress conditions like injury, herbivory, and damage from harsh weather, particularly through adventitious root formation. They have sophisticated molecular mechanisms to recognize and respond to wounding. Jasmonic acid (JA), a wound hormone, triggers auxin synthesis to stimulate root regeneration. Melatonin (MT), structurally similar to auxin, also significantly influences root induction, but its specific mechanism is unclear. Phytomelatonin's signal transduction is discovered in wound-induced root formation, identifying SlPMTR1/2 as phytomelatonin receptors, transmitting signals to SHOOT BORNE ROOTLESS 1 (SlSBRL1), a key regulator of wound-induced root regeneration, via the G protein alpha subunit 1 (SlGPA1). Additionally, SlPMTR1/2 is activated by JA, and targeted by SlMYC2. Overall, the specific mechanisms of phytomelatonin on wound-induced root regeneration is uncovered and revealed a crosstalk between phytomelatonin and JA, offering new insights into plant repair mechanisms.

AB  - Benzophenones are widely supplemented in personal care products, but little is known about its neurodevelopmental toxicity. The previous epidemiological study discovered a negative correlation between maternal exposure to a benzophenone metabolite 4-hydroxybenzophenone (4HBP) and child's neurodevelopment, yet the causal relationship and detailed mechanism remain to be defined. Here, it is reported that prenatal, but not postnatal, exposure to environmentally relevant level of 4HBP impairs hippocampus development and causes cognitive dysfunction in offspring mice. Transcriptomic analyses reveal that 4HBP induces the endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptotic signaling and inflammatory response in hippocampal neural stem cells. Mechanistically, 4HBP exposure activates protein kinase R-like ER kinase (PERK) signaling, which induces CHOP, inhibits I kappa B translation, and transactivates p65, thereby promoting inflammation and apoptosis on multiple levels. Importantly, genetic or pharmacological inhibition of PERK pathway significantly attenuates 4HBP-induced NF kappa B signaling and neurodevelopmental abnormalities in mice and in a human brain organoid model. The study uncovers the neurodevelopmental toxicity of BP and cautions its exposure during pregnancy.

AB  - The main characteristics of neurodegenerative diseases represented by Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) is the progressive irreversible loss of neurons, leading to varying degrees of pathological changes and loss of cognitive function. There is still no effective treatment. With the acceleration of global aging society, the incidence of neurodegenerative diseases is rapidly increasing, becoming a serious global public health concern that urgently requires the development of effective therapeutic strategies. The Hippo signaling pathway, a highly evolutionarily conserved pathway, consists of the core components MST1/2, LATS1/2,and downstream effectors, transcriptional co-activators YAP and TAZ. It plays a crucial role in the regulation of various biological processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, development, and apoptosis. Dysregulation of the Hippo pathway contributes to the development of many diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, immune disorders, etc. Therefore, targeting the dysregulated components of the Hippo pathway may be an effective strategy for treating various diseases. Increasing evidence indicates that the Hippo pathway is excessively activated in the development of neurodegenerative diseases, manifested by increased expression of MST1 and downregulation of YAP. Stabilizing the Hippo pathway levels has shown improvements in AD and PD. However, most studies on the Hippo pathway in AD and PD focus on changes in the expression levels of Hippo pathway components, and research in other neurodegenerative diseases is still lacking. Therefore, further investigation is needed to fully understand the mechanistic role of the Hippo pathway in neurodegenerative diseases. Meanwhile, miRNA, similarly dysregulated in neurodegenerative diseases and serving as biomarkers, is a primary target for miRNA therapy in neurodegenerative diseases, including AD and PD. Activating or inhibiting dysregulated miRNAs is the main strategy of miRNA therapy during the neurodegenerative disease development. Evidence suggests that the interaction between the Hippo pathway and miRNA can result in widespread biological effects and crosstalk in the occurrence of different types of diseases. However, studies on the interplay between the Hippo pathway and miRNA in neurodegenerative diseases are relatively scarce. In this paper, we predicted the miRNAs related to Hippo pathway through bioinformatics database, and further screened the miRNAs with crosstalk relationship with Hippo signaling pathway through experiments in combination with PubMed. Then, the mechanism of action of Hippo signaling pathway related miRNAs in AD and PD is further elucidated. It is reported that the Hippo pathway and its related miRNA may exert neuroprotective effects by reducing oxidative stress, improving neuroinflammation, stabilizing autophagy levels, maintaining neuronal mitochondrial function, and ameliorating blood-brain barrier dysfunction, thereby delaying the progression of AD and PD. However, research on miRNA directly regulating the Hippo pathway to improve AD and PD is limited, and observations of the Hippo pathway and its related miRNA in other neurodegenerative diseases are scarce.
   However, considering the regulatory relationship between the Hippo pathway and miRNA in multiple diseases and their respective roles in key mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases, such as oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, the crosstalk between miRNA and the Hippo pathway holds a crucial regulatory role in the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, the interaction pathways of the Hippo pathway and its related miRNA may be a pivotal avenue for exploring effective therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative diseases in the future.

AB  - Memristors with nonstoichiometric tungsten oxide (WOx) as an active layer, derived from the oxidation of atomically thin two-dimensional tungsten diselenide (WSe2), enable the creation of the monolithic layered structure of WOx/WSe2. These devices are promising candidates for emulating various biological synaptic functions in the human brain. In this study, we fabricate monolithic few-layer WOx/WSe2 memristors with precisely controlled WOx thickness by UV-ozone treatment from 1 L to 9 L, depending on chuck temperature. The postsynaptic responses of the topmost single-layer (1 L) oxidized WSe2 and fully (9 L) oxidized WSe2 memristors exhibit sharply contrasting behaviors, which can be applied to mimic the heterosynaptic plasticity in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Beyond the significance of emulating the biological synaptic characteristics, we explore the feasibility of using each oxidation-layer-controlled memristor as a hardware accelerator. Their performances are assessed through application in a CIFAR-10 pattern recognition task using a convolutional neural network. Pattern recognition rates of 84 % and 71 % are obtained for the 1 L and 9 L WOx-based devices, respectively. We also examine the applicability of a synaptic cell composed of devices with oppositely switched characteristics. Consequently, the synaptic weight-defined as the difference in conductance between two synaptic devices-can be either increased (potentiated) or decreased (depressed) by simultaneously updating both devices with the same voltage signal. This weight update concept achieves a moderate recognition rate of 85.94 % when using an MNIST pattern-based recognition task, simplifying the complex weight-adjustment process.

AB  - Purpose: Transgender individuals commonly undergo hormone therapy as part of their gender-affirming care. Given the lack of clinical data regarding the impact of these exogenous hormones on airway management as well as the limited knowledge of transgender health, we examined the prevalence of airway events in transgender women undergoing facial feminization procedures.Methods: Retrospective chart reviews were performed on 282 transgender women, ages 14-75, who underwent facial feminization surgeries between 2014 and 2020. Our control group consisted of 375 age-matched, cisgender patients undergoing rhinoplasty procedures during the same time period. Airway events, defined as desaturations (oxygen saturation <= 92%) within 45 minutes of induction and/or >= two attempts required for endotracheal intubation, were stratified based on severity. Statistical analysis was performed using multinomial logistic regression.Results: Compared to our cisgender men and cisgender women control cohorts, the total rate of airway events in transgender women was higher (14.2% vs. 7.5% and 3.6%). Within the transgender women cohort, 57.5% of airway events were considered mild, 35.0% moderate, and 7.5% severe. In our subgroup analysis, transgender women undergoing facial feminization procedures experienced significantly more airway events. There were no statistically significant associations between airway events and the studied variables, including age, body mass index, and Mallampati scores.Conclusion: Transgender women may face a higher risk of airway events during facial feminization surgery influenced by various factors including previous surgeries, hormonal therapies, and comorbid conditions. Anesthesiologists should consider these variables along with the procedure type to preempt potential airway difficulties in their transgender patients.

AB  - Cancer vaccines offer a promising avenue in cancer immunotherapy by inducing systemic, tumor-specific immune responses. Tumor extracellular vesicles (TEVs) are nanoparticles naturally laden with tumor antigens, making them appealing for vaccine development. However, their inherent malignant properties from the original tumor cells limit their direct therapeutic use. This study introduces a novel approach to repurpose TEVs as potent personalized cancer vaccines. The study shows that inhibition of both YAP and autophagy not only diminishes the malignancy-associated traits of TEVs but also enhances their immunogenic attributes by enriching their load of tumor antigens and adjuvants. These revamped TEVs, termed attenuated yet immunogenically potentiated TEVs (AI-TEVs), showcase potential in inhibiting tumor growth, both as a preventive measure and a possible treatment for recurrent cancers. They prompt a tumor-specific and enduring immune memory. In addition, by showing that AI-TEVs can counteract cancer growth in a personalized vaccine approach, a potential strategy is presented for developing postoperative cancer immunotherapy that's enduring and tailored to individual patients.
   Simultaneously inhibiting the YAP protein and autophagy while inducing ICD on tumor cells leads to the production of attenuated yet immunogenically potentiated TEVs (AI-TEVs). AI-TEVs effectively activate tumor-specific immunity and can be used as a prophylactic and post-operative therapy to prevent cancer recurrence. They can also serve as the basis for personalized cancer vaccines by utilizing autologous tumor cells. image

AB  - We report a simple platform for the fabrication of nonspherical alginate hydrogel particles using a dripping method. Hydrogel particles with novel morphologies, such as vortex ring, teardrop, disk, sphere, and mushroom, are fabricated by controlling various parameters. We monitored the deformation process of the hydrogel particles after they penetrated the crosslinking solution using a high-speed camera. Then, we proposed a mechanism showing a unique morphological transformation from a spherical to a disk shape. We demonstrated how controlling the collecting height that causes the drop impact force against the crosslinking solution surface was critical to producing hydrogel particles with these intriguing shapes. In particular, disk-shaped alginate particles show their ability as potential platforms for culturing mouse adrenocortical tumor cells (Y1) and a hippocampal neuronal cell (HT-22). To modify alginate particles, cell-adhesive gelatin is incorporated into the alginate matrix and then alginate particles are coated with poly(allylamine hydrochloride). Two modified alginate particles show good adhesion and proliferation rates on their surfaces. In particular, the hybrid hydrogel particles provide great potential to be developed into promising materials for cell culture, drug delivery, and tissue engineering.

Despite notable quality of life (QOL) improvements secondary to FFS, there is yet to be a standardized framework for evaluating patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). This study aimed to examine different PROMs reported in the literature and advocate for optimizing QOL metrics for post-FFS patients.Methods: An electronic database search of Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane was completed according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines for studies about FFS and QOL. Inclusion criteria were original studies published in English through January 2025 that contained QOL survey data. We considered QOL to be assessed by postoperative satisfaction, revisions, regrets, and subjective surveys.Results: A total of 31 studies met inclusion criteria and were selected from the 3,971 studies identified from our literature search. A total of 3,731 patients underwent FFS procedures. Eight studies exclusively used nonvalidated satisfaction rating questionnaires, 4 exclusively used nonvalidated QOL surveys, 15 studies exclusively used validated surveys, and 3 used both a nonvalidated QOL survey and validated surveys. One study used an open-text interview approach to collect data.Conclusion: Overall, there remain inconsistencies in PROMs across studies assessing QOL in patients who have undergone FFS. Questionnaires such as GENDER-Q are promising tools for addressing limitations. Standardizing QOL metrics is crucial for enabling meaningful peer benchmarking and will be a necessary step toward improved outcomes and the inclusion of FFS as a reconstructive surgery under insurance.

AB  - Purpose: Facial feminization surgery (FFS) is associated with improved psychological outcomes in transgender patients. We aimed to evaluate the impact of FFS on patient satisfaction with facial appearance using validated, patient-reported outcome tools.Methods: Patients were recruited to complete a FACE-Q survey at least 6 months after their FFS. FACE-Q modules used included "Satisfaction with Facial Appearance Overall," "Facial Attributes" (forehead/eyebrows, nose, cheeks, cheekbone, chin, jawline, and neck), "Decision," "Outcomes," "Psychological Function," and "Social Function." "Satisfaction with Facial Appearance Overall" was compared to FACE-Q outcomes in transgender patients on hormone replacement therapy (HRT), alone.Results: Twenty-three patients completed the survey. Rhinoplasty was the most common procedure (82.6%). Insurance was rated as a major barrier in 50% of patients. "Satisfaction with Facial Appearance Overall" using the FACE-Q was 69.3, with "Psychological Function" rated at 73.7 and "Social Function" rated at 76.1. FFS was associated with a higher overall satisfaction in facial appearance compared to patients on HRT for 3 months (69.3 vs. 48.5, p<0.01) and 12 months, alone (69.3 vs. 54.4, p<0.001). Wait time for FFS of less than a year (beta=-20.4, p=0.04) and undergoing FFS at a younger age (beta=-1.4, p<0.001) were independently associated with higher satisfaction scores in overall facial appearance.Conclusions: FFS is associated with greater satisfaction with overall facial appearance, especially compared to transgender patients only on HRT. Insurance was the greatest barrier to receiving FFS. Improved access to surgery is needed to yield higher overall satisfaction with facial appearance.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a prevalent head injury worldwide which increases the risk of neurodegenerative diseases. Increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammatory chemokines after TBI induces secondary effects which damage neurons. Targeting NADPH oxidase or increasing redox systems are ways to reduce ROS and damage. Earlier studies show that C-C motif chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5) has neurotrophic functions such as promoting neurite outgrowth as well as reducing apoptosis. Although CCL5 levels in blood are associated with severity in TBI patients, the function of CCL5 after brain injury is unclear. In the current study, we induced mild brain injury in C57BL/6 (wildtype, WT) mice and CCL5 knockout (CCL5-KO) mice using a weight-drop model. Cognitive and memory functions in mice were analyzed by Novel-object-recognition and Barnes Maze tests. The memory performance of both WT and KO mice were impaired after mild injury. Cognition and memory function in WT mice quickly recovered after 7 days but recovery took more than 14 days in CCL5-KO mice. FJC, NeuN and Hypoxyprobe staining revealed large numbers of neurons damaged by oxidative stress in CCL5-KO mice after mTBI. NADPH oxidase activity show increased ROS generation together with reduced glutathione peroxidase-1 (GPX1) and glutathione (GSH) activity in CCL5-KO mice; this was opposite to that seen in WT mice. CCL5 increased GPX1 expression and reduced intracellular ROS levels which subsequently increased cell survival both in primary neuron cultures and in an overexpression model using SHSY5Y cell. Memory impairment in CCL5-KO mice induced by TBI could be rescued by i.p. injection of the GSH precursor - N-acetylcysteine (NAC) or intranasal delivery of recombinant CCL5 into mice after injury. We conclude that CCL5 is an important molecule for GPX1 antioxidant activation during post-injury day 1-3, and protects hippocampal neurons from ROS as well as improves memory function after trauma.

AB  - Blood-brain barrier dysfunction (BBBD) and accumulation of senescent astrocytes occur during brain aging and contribute to neuroinflammation and disease. Here, we explored the relationship between these two age-related events, hypothesizing that chronic hippocampal exposure to the blood-borne protein serum albumin could induce stress-induced premature senescence (SIPS) in astrocytes via transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF beta) signaling. We found that 1 week of albumin exposure significantly increased TGF beta signaling and senescence marker expression in cultured rat hippocampal astrocytes. These changes were preventable by pharmacological inhibition of the type I TGF beta receptor (TGF beta R) ALK5. To study these effects in vivo, we utilized an animal model of BBBD in which albumin was continuously infused into the lateral ventricles of adult mice. Consistent with our in vitro results, 1 week of albumin infusion significantly increased TGF beta signaling activation and the burden of senescent astrocytes in hippocampal tissue. Pharmacological inhibition of ALK5 TGF beta R or conditional genetic knockdown of astrocytic TGF beta R prior to albumin infusion was sufficient to prevent albumin-induced astrocyte senescence. Together, these results establish a link between TGF beta signaling activation and astrocyte senescence and suggest that prolonged exposure to serum albumin due to BBBD can trigger these phenotypic changes.

AB  - The mechanisms underlying the generation of hippocampal epileptic seizures and interictal events and their interactions with the sleep-wake cycle are not yet fully understood. Indeed, medial temporal lobe epilepsy is associated with hippocampal abnormalities both at the neuronal (channelopathies, impaired potassium and chloride dynamics) and network level (neuronal and axonal loss, mossy fiber sprouting), with more frequent seizures during wakefulness compared with slow-wave sleep. In this article, starting from our previous computational modeling work of the hippocampal formation based on realistic topology and synaptic connectivity, we study the role of micro- and mesoscale pathological conditions of the epileptic hippocampus in the generation and maintenance of seizure-like theta and interictal oscillations. We show, through the simulations of hippocampal activity during slow-wave sleep and wakefulness that: (i) both mossy fiber sprouting and sclerosis account for seizure-like theta activity, (ii) but they have antagonist effects (seizure-like activity occurrence increases with sprouting but decreases with sclerosis), (iii) though impaired potassium and chloride dynamics have little influence on the generation of seizure-like activity, they do play a role on the generation of interictal patterns, and (iv) seizure-like activity and fast ripples are more likely to occur during wakefulness and interictal spikes during sleep.

AB  - Background It has been reported that activation of glutamate kainate receptor subunit 2 (GluK2) subunit-containing glutamate receptors and the following Fas ligand(FasL) up-regulation, caspase-3 activation, result in delayed apoptosis-like neuronal death in hippocampus CA1 subfield after cerebral ischemia and reperfusion. Nitric oxide-mediated S-nitrosylation might inhibit the procaspase activation, whereas denitrosylation might contribute to cleavage and activation of procaspases.Objectives The study aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying procaspase-3 denitrosylation and activation following kainic acid (KA)-induced excitotoxicity in rat hippocampus.Methods S-nitrosylation of procaspase-3 was detected by biotin-switch method. Activation of procaspase-3 was shown as cleavage of procaspase-3 detected by immunoblotting. FasL expression was detected by immunoblotting. Cresyl violets and TdT-mediated dUTP Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL) staining were used to detect apoptosis-like neuronal death in rat hippocampal CA1 and CA3 subfields.Results KA led to the activation of procaspase-3 in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and the activation was inhibited by KA receptor antagonist NS102. Procaspase-3 was denitrosylated at 3 h after kainic acid administration, and the denitrosylation was reversed by SNP and GSNO. FasL AS-ODNs inhibited the procaspase-3 denitrosylation and activation. Moreover, thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) inhibitor auranofin prevented the denitrosylation and activation of procaspase-3 in rat hippocampal CA1 and CA3 subfields. NS102, FasL AS-ODNs, and auranofin reversed the KA-induced apoptosis and cell death in hippocampal CA1 and CA3 subfields.Conclusions KA led to denitrosylation and activation of procaspase-3 via FasL and TrxR. Inhibition of procaspase-3 denitrosylation by auranofin, SNP, and GSNO played protective effects against KA-induced apoptosis-like neuronal death in rat hippocampal CA1 and CA3 subfields. These investigations revealed that the procaspase-3 undergoes an initial denitrosylation process before becoming activated, providing valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms and possible treatment of excitotoxicity.

AB  - AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) functions as a molecular sensor that plays a critical role in maintaining cellular energy homeostasis. Dysregulation of the AMPK signaling has been linked to synaptic failure and cognitive impairments. Our recent study demonstrates abnormally increased AMPK activity in the hippocampus of aged mice. The kinase catalytic subunit of AMPK exists in two isoforms alpha 1 and alpha 2, and their specific roles in aging-related cognitive deficits are unknown. Taking advantage of the unique transgenic mice (AMPK alpha 1/alpha 2 cKO) recently developed by our group, we investigated how isoform-specific suppression of the neuronal AMPK alpha may contribute to the regulation of cognitive and synaptic function associated with aging. We found that aging-related impairment of long-term object recognition memory was improved with suppression of AMPK alpha 1 but not AMPK alpha 2 isoform. Moreover, aging-related spatial memory deficits were unaltered with suppression of either AMPK alpha isoform. Biochemical experiments showed that the phosphorylation levels of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha subunit (eIF2 alpha) were specifically decreased in the hippocampus of the AMPK alpha 1 cKO mice. We further performed large-scale unbiased proteomics analysis and revealed identities of proteins whose expression is differentially regulated with AMPK alpha isoform suppression. These novel findings may provide insights into the roles of AMPK signaling pathway in cognitive aging.

AB  - The traditional medicinal mushroom Hericium erinaceus is known for enhancing peripheral nerve regeneration through targeting nerve growth factor (NGF) neurotrophic activity. Here, we purified and identified biologically new active compounds from H. erinaceus, based on their ability to promote neurite outgrowth in hippocampal neurons. N-de phenylethyl isohericerin (NDPIH), an isoindoline compound from this mushroom, together with its hydrophobic derivative hericene A, were highly potent in promoting extensive axon outgrowth and neurite branching in cultured hippocampal neurons even in the absence of serum, demonstrating potent neurotrophic activity. Pharmacological inhibition of tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) by ANA-12 only partly prevented the NDPIH-induced neurotrophic activity, suggesting a potential link with BDNF signaling. However, we found that NDPIH activated ERK1/2 signaling in the absence of TrkB in HEK-293T cells, an effect that was not sensitive to ANA-12 in the presence of TrkB. Our results demonstrate that NDPIH acts via a complementary neurotrophic pathway independent of TrkB with converging downstream ERK1/2 activation. Mice fed with H. erinaceus crude extract and hericene A also exhibited increased neurotrophin expression and downstream signaling, resulting in significantly enhanced hippocampal memory. Hericene A therefore acts through a novel pan-neurotrophic signaling pathway, leading to improved cognitive performance.

AB  - Astrocytes release numerous factors known to contribute to the process of synaptogenesis, yet knowledge about the signals that control their release is limited. We hypothesized that neuron-derived signals stimulate astrocytes, which respond to neurons through the modulation of astrocyte-released synaptogenic factors. Here we investigate the effect of cholinergic stimulation of astrocytes on synaptogenesis in co-cultured neurons. Using a culture system where primary rat astrocytes and primary rat neurons are first grown separately allowed us to independently manipulate astrocyte cholinergic signaling. Subsequent co-culture of pre-stimulated astrocytes with naive neurons enabled us to assess how prior stimulation of astrocyte acetylcholine receptors uniquely modulates neuronal synapse formation. Pre-treatment of astrocytes with the acetylcholine receptor agonist carbachol increased the expression of synaptic proteins, the number of pre- and postsynaptic puncta, and the number of functional synapses in hippocampal neurons after 24 h in co-culture. Astrocyte secretion of the synaptogenic protein thrombospondin-1 increased after cholinergic stimulation and inhibition of the receptor for thrombospondins prevented the increase in neuronal synaptic structures. Thus, we identified a novel mechanism of neuron-astrocyte-neuron communication, where neuronal release of acetylcholine stimulates astrocytes to release synaptogenic proteins leading to increased synaptogenesis in neurons. This study provides new insights into the role of neurotransmitter receptors in developing astrocytes and into our understanding of the modulation of astrocyte-induced synaptogenesis.

AB  - To investigate whether Liraglutide had a neuroprotective after cardiac arrest and return of spontaneous circulation (CA/ROSC) and explore its potential mechanisms. Adopting an 8-min asphyxial cardiac arrest model. Evaluate the neurological deficit score (NDS), observe pathological changes in hippocampal tissue with HE staining, and measure the expression level of proteins in hippocampal tissue with Western blot. Detection of hippocampal cell apoptosis using TUNEL (TdT-mediated dUTP Nick-End Labeling) method. Immunofluorescence staining was used to detect the expression of LC-3 in the hippocampus, and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect the inflammatory factor TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta in serum and hippocampus. Autophagy and apoptosis were activated and the expressions of proteins reached significance at 24 h after CA/ROSC. Moreover, rapamycin enhanced apoptosis, ferroptosis and aggravated neuro-pathological damage while 3-methyladenine reduced that. Furthermore, liraglutide treatment improved the 7-day survival rate and NDS, reduced histological signs of injury and inhibited apoptosis, ferroptosis and inflammatory cytokines released after cardiac arrest, and these effects were offset by autophagy agonist. Liraglutide could exert a protective role against post-cardiac arrest brain injury, which could be partially mediated by inhibiting autophagy and ferroptosis. Results clearly indicate that liraglutide may attenuate post-cardiac arrest brain injury (PCABI) by anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory via inhibiting autophagy and ferroptosis.

AB  - Objective To improve the clinical understanding of anti-gamma-aminobutyric-acid B receptor encephalitis (anti-GABABR encephalitis) by analyzing 13 cases.
   Methods We retrospectively studied demographic and clinical features including clinical symptoms, serum/cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) laboratory findings (including antibody test), brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electroencephalogram (EEG), treatment plan, and treatment effect for 13 patients with a definitive diagnosis of anti-GABABR encephalitis.
   Results Seven patients (53.8%, 7/13) were complicated with lung cancer. Epileptic seizures were the most common symptoms at onset in 11 patients (84.6%, 11/13). All patients had seizures in the course of the disease. Abnormalities in craniocerebral MRI examination, including hippocampus, occipital lobe, insular lobe, were found in six of nine tested patients, and EEG abnormalities were found in seven out of nine tested patients. Elevated pro-gastrin releasing peptide (ProGRP) levels were found in 70% of patients with a median value of 490.10 pg/ml; and CSF oligoclonal bands were positive for 4 of 10 tested cases. However, there were no significant differences in modified Rankin Scale (mRS) between the ProGRP or CSF oligoclonal band positive and negative groups at admission and follow-up (p > .05). The value between SCLC and non-SCLC subgroup was significantly different (p < .05). Ten patients received immunotherapy (three patients refused treatment). After immunotherapy, the frequency of seizures was significantly reduced. There was a significant difference in mRS between admission and after treatment (p < .05). The average survival time after onset was 27.7 months.
   Conclusions Epilepsy is the most common clinical manifestation of Anti-GABABR encephalitis. The prognosis of anti-GABABR encephalitis is poor. Section of anti-GABABR encephalitis patients have higher level of serum ProGRP and positive GSF oligoclonal bands. Elevated ProGRP or positive CSF oligoclonal bands with classic clinical features can potentially help to improve early recognition of anti-GABABR encephalitis.

AB  - Epilepsy is a commonly diagnosed neurological disease, which often develops already in childhood. The prominent feature of this dysfunction is the strong, unprovoked hypersynchronous neuronal activity of the brain, especially in the cortex, which appears in recurrent seizures. Previous studies indicated a potential modulatory role of kainate types of glutamate receptors in this mechanism. In our experiments, we used combined hippocampal-entorhinal rat brain slices of different ages. Developing (2-, 3-, and 4-week-old), adolescent (6-week-old), and adult (3-month-old) groups were investigated. During the experiments, first, we provoked convulsions with magnesium-free perfusion solution; then, to investigate the role of kainate receptors, seizure-like events (SLEs) were suppressed by applying a specific GluK1/2 antagonist (UBP-296). Neuronal network activity was recorded by a multi-electrode array chip, and temporal features of field potentials and single-cell activity were analyzed in the different age-groups. The frequency, duration of spontaneous events, the overall seizure characteristics, and spike activities were compared. Spontaneous events were categorized into interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) and SLEs on the basis of the temporal structure of activities. In 3- and 4-week-old animals, IEDs were observable, which entirely disappeared after the 4th week. The structure and the length of SLEs varied in the younger animals (3- and 4-week-old animals); however, after the 6th week, these events became more stabilized. In most groups, the count of detected spikes was significantly higher in layer II/III than in layer V. The neuronal networks started to behave like adult ones at 4 weeks of age. The length of events decreased in adult animals due to the maturation of the network, and the inhibition becomes stronger. The IEDs disappeared completely, and the SLEs became stable and stereotypic in 6-week-old animals. UBP-296 administration reduced the number of IEDs; however, this had no substantial effect on the SLEs. (c) 2022 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - Background: Doxorubicin (Dox) is one of the most effective anti-neoplastic agents. Quercetin (QE) exhibits antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Aim: To detect neuroprotective properties of quercetin in rats exposed to doxorubicin-induced brain injury. Material and methods: 48 rats were allocated equally into four groups: control group: (given normal saline), QE group: (given 80 mg/kg of QE orally daily for 2 weeks), Dox group: (received 2.5 mg/kg of Dox every other day for a total of seven intraperitoneal injections), and Dox thorn QE group: (received 2.5 mg/kg of Dox every other day for a total of seven intraperitoneal injections and 80 mg/kg of QE orally daily for 2 weeks). Subsequently, biochemical analyses were carried out along with histopathological (light and electron microscopic) and immunohistochemical examinations of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Results: The Dox group revealed a decline in the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase, along with an increase in malondialdehyde and an increase in DNA damage. Furthermore, sections of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus revealed neurodegenerative changes, decreased synaptophysin, and increased Interleukin-1 beta expressions. Biochemical and histopathological results were markedly improved by QE administration. Conclusions: It can be concluded that QE induces protective effects against Dox-induced neurotoxicity.

AB  - High-frequency stimulation (HFS) is a crucial therapeutic approach for neurodegenerative conditions, such as epilepsy. However, its underlying mechanism of inhibition remains unclear. In this study, a rat model of epileptiform discharges (EDs) was constructed by perfusing brain slices with magnesium-free artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF), where after HFS was used to stimulate the CA3 area of the hippocampus. The EDs signals of each sub-region of hippocampal slices before and after HFS were recorded based on a multi-electrode Array (MEA). Secondly, the changes of approximate entropy (ApEn) complexity of rhythms in different regions of hippocampal slices before and after HFS were deeply analyzed The results showed that different rhythm characteristics of EDs signals exhibited significant differences before and after HFS. Here HFS significantly inhibited the delta rhythm of field potential and enhanced the beta rhythm. Finally, the changing rhythm of the EDs signal in the propagation path before and after HFS was analyzed, and it was found that the inhibitory target of HFS on EDs signal was in the CA3b sub-region. The rhythm would gradually decline with the propagation of EDs signal in the hippocampal neural pathway. This study shows that HFS can modulate the local field potential, thus inhibiting the pathological rhythm caused by epilepsy, which provides a novel research incentive for HFS to inhibit EDs.

AB  - Glycemic variability (GV) markedly exacerbates cognitive impairment in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), in part through chronic inflammation. This study investigated the therapeutic efficacy of the NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor MCC950 in mitigating GV-induced cognitive impairment in an aged rat model of T2DM. Aged Sprague-Dawley rats with induced T2DM were subjected to GV conditions, and the effects of MCC950 were evaluated through measurement of body weight, blood glucose, lipid profiles, insulin level, inflammatory markers, and cognitive function. Transcriptomic analysis was performed on the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Treatment with MCC950 significantly alleviated weight loss and hyperglycemia in the GV group compared with the control group. MCC950 also reduced the levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, and pro- inflammatory markers (interleukin-1(3 (IL-1(3) and interleukin-18 (IL-18)). Most notably, MCC950 improved spatial learning and memory retention in the GV group. Immunohistochemical analysis indicated a reduction in inflammasome activation and an increase in the expression level of the neuronal marker NeuN in the hippo- campus. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that MCC950 altered neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathways in the hippocampus and influenced receptor binding and cell adhesion processes in the prefrontal cortex. These findings validated the efficacy of NLRP3 inhibitor in mitigating GV-induced cognitive impairment in elderly rats with T2DM and provided the basis for subsequent clinical studies exploring the broader potential of NLRP3targeted interventions in addressing diabetes-associated cognitive impairment.

AB  - Anxiety is one of the most common mental disorders. We aim to find novel biomarkers to explore its potential mechanism in anxiety disorders. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened out from GSE29014 and GSE100084 datasets. Protein-protein interaction network, enrichment analysis, and principal component analysis were employed to determine hub genes. The anxiety model was constructed by restraint stress. Behavioral tests, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, hematoxylin-eosin, and Nissl staining were applied to evaluate the anxiety model. The potential mechanisms were investigated by corticosterone (CORT)-induced PC12 cells as an in vitro model. Proteins and mRNA expression levels were measured by western blot and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Cell counting kit, 5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine, and flow cytometry assays were employed to measure proliferation and apoptosis. PTPRC, SMC3, STAG2, FLT3, SYNE1, TERF2IP, NIPBL, ZFP451, MLLT3, and JAK1 were identified as hub genes with high prediction value for anxiety. Hippocampal neurons were damaged with decreased 5-hydroxytryptamine, gamma-amino butyric acid, and neuropeptide Y, as well as increased corticotrophin releasing factor and cholecystokinin in anxiety model. PTPRC, SMC3, STAG2, SYNE1, NIPBL, and ZFP451 were downregulated in anxiety mice. STAG2 was selected as the research target. In CORT-induced PC12 cells, STAG2 overexpression promoted cell proliferation, while inhibiting apoptosis and the expression of proteins in cGAS-STING pathway. STAG2 is a potential biomarker of anxiety that exerts a neuroprotective effect on CORT-induced PC12 cells via suppressing cGAS-STING pathway.

AB  - With the aggravation of global aging, the rapid rise in the obesity rate, and the increasing number of patients with intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD), the principles and mechanism of this disease remain unclear. This study explored the molecular mechanism of IDD treatment through interactions of the lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA-signaling pathways and the effects on the proliferation and apoptosis of human nucleus pulposus cells (HNPCs) cultured in vitro. Our study revealed that lncRNA JPX is expressed at low levels in HNPCs under normoxic conditions. Luciferase and RNA pull-down assays were used to verify that lncRNA JPX directly bound to miR-18a-5p and influenced HNPC proliferation and apoptosis. Subsequently, a luciferase assay confirmed the direct binding of miR-18a-5p to HIF-1 alpha and demonstrated a negative correlation between miR-18a-5p and HIF-1 alpha. In addition, the HIF-1 alpha antagonist reversed the inhibition of the Hippo-YAP pathway by the miR-18a-5p inhibitor. In conclusion, overexpression of lncRNA JPX upregulated HIF-1 alpha by inhibiting the expression of miR-18a-5p, thereby inhibiting the Hippo-YAP pathway. By inhibiting this pathway, JPX overexpression promoted the proliferation of HNPCs and decreased their apoptosis. Therefore, the lncRNA JPX is a potential new target. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Pesticides are widely used in agriculture to kill pests, but their action is non-selective and results in several hazardous effects on humans and animals. Pesticide toxicity has been demonstrated to alter a variety of neurological functions and predisposes to various neurodegenerative diseases. Although, there is no data available for hexaflumuron (HFM) and hymexazol (HML) neurotoxicity. Hence, the present study aims to investigate the possible mechanisms of HFM and HML neurotoxicity. 21 male Wistar rats were divided into three groups and daily received the treatment via oral gavage for 14 days as follows: group (1) normal saline, group (2) HFM (1/100LD50), and group (3) HML (1/100 LD50). Our results revealed that both HFM and HML produced a significant increase in MDA levels and a decrease in GSH and CAT activity in some brain areas. There were severe histopathological alterations mainly neuronal necrosis and gliosis in different examined areas. Upregulation of mRNA levels of JNK and Bax with downregulation of Bcl-2 was also recorded in both pesticides exposed groups. In all studied toxicological parameters, HML produced neurotoxicity more than HFM. HFM targets the cerebral cortex and striatum, while HML targets the cerebral cortex, striatum, hippocampus, and cerebellum. We can conclude that both HFM and HML provoke neurobehavioral toxicity through oxidative stress that impairs the mitochondrial function and activates the JNK-dependent apoptosis pathway.

AB  - Alzheimer?s disease (AD) is characterized by cognitive decline due to the accumulation of extracellular ?amyloid (A?) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain, which impair glutamate (Glu) metabolism. Deproteinized Calf Blood Extractive Injection (DCBEI) is a biopharmaceutical that contains 17 types of amino acids and 5 types of nucleotides. In this study, we found that DCBEI pretreatment reduced L-Glu-dependent neuroexcitation toxicity by maintaining normal mitochondrial function in HT22 cells. DCBEI treatment also reduced the expression of pro-apoptosis proteins and increased the expression of anti-apoptosis proteins. Furthermore, DCBEI attenuated AD-like behaviors (detected via the Morris water maze test) in B6C3-Tg (APPswePSEN1dE9)/Nju double transgenic (APP/PS1) mice; this effect was associated with a reduction in the amount of A? and neurofibrillary tangle deposition and the concomitant reduction of phospho-Tau in the hippocampus. Metabonomic profiling revealed that DCBEI regulated the level of neurotransmitters in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. Label-free proteomics revealed that DCBEI regulated the expression of Nrf-2 and its downstream targets, as well as the levels of phospho-protein kinase B and mitogen-activated protein kinase. Together, these data show that DCBEI can ameliorate AD symptoms by upregulating Nrf2-mediated antioxidative pathways and thus preventing mitochondrial apoptosis.

AB  - Status epilepticus (SE) is a life-threatening disorder associated with neuronal pyroptosis. This study aims to explore the mechanism of HDAC1 in hippocampal neuronal pyroptosis induced by kainic acid in mice, providing a theoretical basis for SE treatment. A mouse model of SE was established by kainic acid. After sh-HDAC1 injection, the severity of SE and hippocampal neuronal damage were assessed. Cell model was established using kainic acid-induced HT22, followed by detection of HDAC1, miR-15a-5p, Caspase-1, cleaved Caspase-1, H3K9ac, and GSDMD-N using qRT-PCR and Western blot assays. Levels of IL-1 beta, IL-18, and LDH were measured. The enrichment of HDAC1 on the miR-15a-5p promoter was detected. The binding of miR-15a-5p to Caspase-1 was validated. We found that HDAC1 was highly expressed in kainic acid-induced SE. HDAC1 knockdown alleviated the symptoms of SE, inhibited cleaved Caspase-1, GSDMD-N, IL-1 beta, and IL-18, and suppressed hippocampal neuronal pyroptosis. HDAC1 bound to the miR-15a-5p promoter and reduced H3K9ac, thereby inhibiting miR-15a-5p expression. miR-15a-5p bound to Caspase-1 and inhibited Caspase-1 expression. Inhibiting miR-15a-5p or overexpressing Caspase-1 partially reversed the inhibitory effect of si-HDAC1 on kainic acid-induced cell pyroptosis. In conclusion, HDAC1 aggravates hippocampal neuronal pyroptosis in SE via the miR-15a-5p/Caspase-1 axis through deacetylation of H3K9.

AB  - To study the neuronal protective effect and its potential mechanism of C16 against gp120-induced cognitive impairment in vitro and in vivo. The NORT method was used to evaluate the short-term memory abilities of rats, the morphological changes in hippocampus were observed by Nissl staining. Cell viability and damage degree were detected by MTT and LDH. The cell living/apoptosis status of PC12 cells was determined by AO/EB double staining and the relative mRNA expressions of PKR, IRE1 alpha, JNK, GRP78, and CHOP were detected by RT-qPCR. In comparison with the gp120 + Memantine and gp120 + C16 groups, the rats in the gp120 group showed a significantly decreased discrimination index (P < 0.001), with disordered CA1 region cells and reduced neuron numbers. AO/EB double staining revealed morphological changes in the gp120 and NMDA groups, while cells in the gp120 + C16 and NMDA + C16 groups resembled the control group. And C16 can significantly down-regulate the mRNA expression levels of PKR, IRE1 alpha, JNK, GRP78, and CHOP. (P < 0.05). C16 can reduce the cognitive impairment stimulated by gp120 or NMDA, the protective mechanism may be correlated with inhibiting the upregulation of PKR/IRE1 alpha/JNK pathway and suppressing apoptosis induced by downstream proteins GRP78 and CHOP.

AB  - Upon postsynaptic glutamate receptor activation, the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration rises and initiates signaling and plasticity in spines. The plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase (PMCA) is a major player to limit the duration of cytosolic Ca2+ signals. It forms complexes with the glycoprotein neuroplastin (Np) isoforms Np55 and Np65 and functionally interplays with N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-type ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluNRs). Moreover, binding of the Np65-specific extracellular domain to Ca2+-permeable GluA1-containing alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA)-type ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluA1Rs) was found to be required for long-term potentiation (LTP). However, the link between PMCA and iGluRs function to regulate cytosolic Ca2+ signals remained unclear. Here, we report that Np65 coordinates PMCA and iGluRs' functions to modulate the duration and amplitude of cytosolic Ca2+ transients in dendrites and spines of hippocampal neurons. Using live-cell Ca2+ imaging, acute pharmacological treatments, and GCaMP5G-expressing hippocampal neurons, we discovered that endogenous or Np65-promoted PMCA activity contributes to the restoration of basal Ca2+ levels and that this effect is dependent on iGluR activation. Super-resolution STED and confocal microscopy revealed that electrical stimulation increases the abundance of synaptic neuroplastin-PMCA complexes depending on iGluR activation and that low-rate overexpression of Np65 doubled PMCA levels and decreased cell surface levels of GluN2A and GluA1 in dendrites and Shank2-positive glutamatergic synapses. In neuroplastin-deficient hippocampi, we observed reduced PMCA and unchanged GluN2B levels, while GluN2A and GluA1 levels were imbalanced. Our electrophysiological data from hippocampal slices argues for an essential interplay of PMCA with GluN2A- but not with GluN2B-containing receptors upon induction of synaptic plasticity. Accordingly, we conclude that Np65 may interconnect PMCA with core players of glutamatergic neurotransmission to fine-tune the Ca2+ signal regulation in basal synaptic function and plasticity.

AB  - Studies have shown that electroacupuncture (EA) can effectively improve vascular cognitive impairment (VCI), but its mechanisms have not been clearly elucidated. This study is aimed at investigating the mechanisms underlying the effects of EA treatment on hippocampal synaptic transmission efficiency and plasticity in rats with VCI. Methods. Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to VCI with bilateral common carotid occlusion (2VO). EA stimulation was applied to Baihui (GV20) and Shenting (GV24) acupoints for 30 min once a day, five times a week, for four weeks. Our study also included nonacupoint groups to confirm the specificity of EA therapy. The Morris water maze (MWM) was used to assess cognitive function. Electrophysiological techniques were used to detect the field characteristics of the hippocampal CA3-CA1 circuit in each group of rats, including input-output (I/O), paired-pulse facilitation ratios (PPR), field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP), and excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC). The expression of synapse- and calcium-mediated signal transduction associated proteins was detected through western blotting. Results. The MWM behavioural results showed that EA significantly improved cognitive function in VCI model rats. EA increased the I/O curve of VCI model rats from 20 to 90 mu A. No significant differences were observed in hippocampal PPR. The fEPSP of the hippocampal CA3-CA1 circuit was significantly increased after EA treatment compared with that after nonacupuncture treatment. We found that EA led to an increase in the EPSC amplitude and frequency, especially in the decay and rise times. In addition, the protein expression and phosphorylation levels of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 2B, alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate receptor 1, and Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II increased to varying degrees in the hippocampus of VCI model rats. Conclusion.

AB  - Mounting evidences have shown that nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase-2 (Nox-2) pathway modifies glutamic-acid decarboxylase-67 (GAD(67)) (GABAergic enzyme) and cholinergic systems via oxidative-nitrergic mechanisms in schizophrenia pathology. Rutin, a neuroactive antioxidant compound, with proven neuroprotective property has been shown to reduce schizophrenic-like behavior in mice. This study sought to investigate the mechanisms of action of the psychopharmacological activity of rutin in the preventive and reversal effects of ketamine-induced schizophrenic-like behavior, oxidative-nitrergic stress, cholinergic and GABAergic derangements in mice. In the preventive treatment, male mice were given rutin (0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg) or risperidone (0.5 mg/kg) orally for 14 days prior to ketamine (20 mg/kg, i.p.) treatment from the 8 to 14th day. However, in the reversal treatment, ketamine was given for 14 days prior to rutin and risperidone. Behavioral (open-field, social-interaction and Y-maze tests), biochemical (oxidative/nitrergic stress markers, acetylcholinesterase activity), immunohistochemical (GAD(67), Nox-2) and neuronal cell deaths in the striatum, prefrontal cortex, and hippocampus were evaluated. Ketamine-induced behavioral impairments were prevented and reversed by rutin. Exposure of mice to ketamine increased malondialdehyde, nitrite contents, acetylcholinesterase activity, neuronal cell death and Nox-2 expressions in the striatum, prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Conversely, these derangements were prevented and reversed by rutin. The decreased glutathione levels due to ketamine were marked increased by rutin. Rutin only prevented ketamine-induced decrease in GAD(67) expression in the striatal-hippocampal region. Altogether, the study showed that the prevention and reversal treatments of mice with rutin attenuated ketamine-induced schizophrenic-like behaviors via reduction of Nox-2 expression, oxidative/nitrergic stresses, acetylcholinesterase activity, and increased GAD(67) enzyme.

AB  - It is well known that the development of neurodegeneration, and especially Alzheimer's disease (AD), is often accompanied by impaired olfaction which precedes memory loss. A neuropeptidase neprilysin (NEP)-a principal amyloid-degrading enzyme in the brain-was also shown to be involved in olfactory signalling. Previously we have demonstrated that 5xFAD mice develop olfactory deficit by the age of 6 months which correlated with reduced NEP expression in the brain areas involved in olfactory signalling. The aim of this study was to analyse the effect of administration of a histone deacetylase inhibitor, valproic acid (VA), to adult 5xFAD mice on their olfaction and memory as well as on brain morphology and NEP expression in the parietal cortex (PC) and hippocampus (Hip). The data obtained demonstrated that administration of VA to 7-month-old mice (200 mg/kg of body weight) for 28 days resulted in improvement of their memory in the Morris water maze as well as olfaction in the odor preference and food search tests. This correlated with increased expression of NEP in the PC and Hip as well as a reduced number of amyloid plaques in these brain areas. This strongly suggests that NEP can be considered an important therapeutic target not only in AD but also in olfactory loss.

AB  - The chikungunya (CHIK) virus is an arbovirus belonging to the alphavirus (Togaviridae family). Around 85% of infected individuals suffer from symptoms such as high fever and severe joint pain; about 30 to 40% will develop a chronic joint illness. The Nsp4 protease is the most conserved protein in the alphavirus family and serves as an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Targeting this enzyme might inhibit the CHIKV replication cycle. This work aims to in silico study the CHIKV RdRp inhibitory effect of peptides derived from camel milk protein as antiviral peptides. Various bioinformatics tools were recruited to identify, screen, predict and assess peptides obtained from camel milk as antiviral peptides (AVPs). During this study, CHIKV Nsp4 (polymerase) was used as a target to be inhibited by interaction with peptides derived from camel milk protein. Among 91 putative bioactive peptides, the best predicted 5 were further evaluated. Molecular docking showed that the top 5 AVPs generated better docking scores and interacted well with active sites of Nsp4 by the formation of different hydrogen bonds as well as other bonds. AVP63 and AVP20 showed the best Molecular docking and MD simulation results. The residue 315ASP of the GDD motif (catalytic core) exhibited a favorable interaction with the AVPs. The findings of this study suggest that the AVP20 derived from camel milk protein can be a potential novel CHIKV polymerase inhibitor.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma

AB  - The last two decades have seen the emergence of three highly pathogenic coronaviruses with zoonotic origins, which prompted immediate attention to the underlying cause and prevention of future outbreaks. Intensification of camel husbandry in the Middle East has resulted in increased human-camel interactions, which has led to the spread of potentially zoonotic viruses with human spillover risks like MERS-coronavirus, camelpox virus, etc. Type-I interferons function as the first line of defense against invading viruses and are pivotal for limiting viral replication and immune-mediated pathologies. Seven novel dromedary camel interferon delta genes were identified and cloned. Functional characterization of this novel class of IFNs from the mammalian suborder tylopoda is reported for the first time. The camel interferon-delta proteins resemble the reported mammalian counterparts in sequence similarity, conservation of cysteines, and phylogenetic proximity. Prokaryotically expressed recombinant camel interferon -81 induced IFN-stimulated gene expression and also exerted antiviral action against camelpox virus, an endemic zoonotic virus. The pre-treatment of camel kidney cells with re-combinant camel IFN-81 increased cell survival and reduced camelpox virus in a dose-dependent manner. The identification of novel IFNs from species with zoonotic spillover risk such as camels, and evaluating their antiviral effects in-vitro will play a key role in improving immunotherapies against viruses and expanding the arsenal to combat emerging zoonotic pathogens.

AB  - Bipolar disorder (BD) is a central nervous system condition that is typified by fluctuations in mood, oscillating between depressive and manic, and/or hypomanic episodes. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that strength training may act as a potent protector against behavioral and neurochemical changes induced by BD. A strength training protocol was performed with adult male Wistar rats, and seven days following the conclusion of training, a single ouabain injection was administered. Following ouabain administration, the animals were subjected to behavioral tests after the seventh (manic period) and fourteenth (depressive period) days. Subsequently, rats were euthanized and the hippocampus was collected for western blotting assays. We demonstrated that strength training provided protection against ouabain-induced behavioral changes, both during the manic and depressive periods, including increased locomotor activity, risk-taking and aggressive-like behaviors, and impaired memory performance. Furthermore, physical training protected against ouabaininduced decrease of neurogenesis/neuroplasticity-related pathways, including BDNF/TrKB/ERK/CREB and PI3K/AKT/mTOR/p70S6K. These findings suggest that strength training has a protective effect, attenuating or preventing BD-induced deficits, and may have therapeutic potential as an adjuvant treatment for this patient population in the future.

AB  - It is widely acknowledged that epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent and atypical neuronal discharges, resulting in transient dysfunction within the brain. The protective role of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in epilepsy has been elucidated by recent studies, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. To investigate this, the concentration of H2S was measured by spectrophotometry and a fluorescent probe in LiCl/Pilocarpine (LiCl/Pilo)-induced seizures in rats. The localization of proteins was examined using immunofluorescence. Electroencephalogram and behavioral tests were employed to evaluate the occurrence of seizures. Neuropathological changes in the hippocampus were examined by hematoxylin-eosin staining, Nissl staining, and transmission electron microscopy. Through proteomics and bioinformatics analysis, we identified the differential proteins in the hippocampus of rats following H2S intervention. Protein changes were detected through western blotting. The results showed that H2S treatment significantly alleviated seizures and minimized post -seizures neurological damage in rats. Proteomics analysis revealed adenylate cyclase 3 (AC3) as a protein potentially targeted by H2S. Moreover, the AC3 activator forskolin reversed the downregulation effect of H2S on the AC3/cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)/protein kinase A (PKA)/transient receptor potential vanilloid 2 (TRPV2) signaling pathway. In conclusion, H2S targets and downregulates the expression of AC3, thereby modulating the AC3/cAMP/PKA signaling pathway to regulate the expression of TRPV2 in LiCl/Pilo-induced seizures, ultimately leading to seizure inhibition and neuroprotection.

AB  - Methamphetamine (METH) is a highly addictive and widely abused drug that causes complex adaptive changes in the brain's reward system, such as the nucleus accumbens (NAc). LASP1 (LIM and SH 3 domain protein 1) as an actin-binding protein, regulates synaptic plasticity. However, the role and mechanism by which NAc LASP1 contributes to METH addiction remains unclear. In this study, adult male C57BL/6J mice underwent repeated METH exposure or METH-induced conditioned place preference (CPP). Western blotting and immunohistochemistry were used to determine LASP1 expression in the NAc. Furthermore, LASP1 knockdown or overexpression using adeno-associated virus (AAV) administration via stereotactic injection into the NAc was used to observe the corresponding effects on CPP. We found that repeated METH exposure and METH-induced CPP upregulated LASP1 expression in the NAc. LASP1 silencing in the NAc reversed METH-induced CPP and reduced PSD95, NR2A, and NR2B expression, whereas LASP1 overexpression in the NAc enhanced CPP acquisition, accompanied by increased PSD95, NR2A, and NR2B expression. Our findings demonstrate an important role of NAc LASP1 in modulating METH induced drug-seeking behavior and the underlying mechanism may be related to regulate the expression of synapse-associated proteins in the NAc. These results reveal a novel molecular regulator of the actions of METH on the NAc and provide a new strategy for treating METH addiction.

AB  - Cellular senescence is an established cause of cell and tissue aging. Senescent cells have been shown to increase in multiple organs during aging, including the skin. Here we hypothesized that senescent cells residing in the skin can spread senescence to distant organs, thereby accelerating systemic aging processes. To explore this hypothesis, we initially observed an increase in several markers of senescence in the skin of aging mice. Subsequently, we conducted experiments wherein senescent fibroblasts were transplanted into the dermis of young mice and assessed various age-associated parameters. Our findings reveal that the presence of senescent cells in the dermal layer of young mice leads to increased senescence in both proximal and distal host tissues, alongside increased frailty, and impaired musculoskeletal function. Additionally, there was a significant decline in cognitive function, concomitant with increased expression of senescence-associated markers within the hippocampus brain area. These results support the concept that the accumulation of senescent cells in the skin can exert remote effects on other organs including the brain, potentially explaining links between skin and brain disorders and diseases and, contributing to physical and cognitive decline associated with aging.
   This study demonstrates that transplanting senescent cells into the skin of young mice accelerates physical and cognitive decline, potentially due to the spread of senescent cells. These findings indicate a cross-organ communication between the skin and systemic aging processes.image

AB  - Aging is a natural phenomenon characterized by accumulation of cellular damage and debris. Oxidative stress, cellular senescence, sustained inflammation, and DNA damage are the main cellular processes characteristic of aging associated with morphological and functional decline. These effects tend to be more pronounced in tissues with high metabolic rates such as the brain, mainly in regions such as the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala. These regions are highly related to cognitive behavior, and therefore their atrophy usually leads to decline in processes such as memory and learning. These cognitive declines can occur in physiological aging and are exacerbated in pathological aging. In this article, we review the cellular processes that underlie the triggers of aging and how they relate to one another, causing the atrophy of nerve tissue that is typical of aging. The main topic of this review to determine the central factor that triggers all the cellular processes that lead to cellular aging and discriminate between normal and pathological aging. Finally, we review how the use of supplements with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties reduces the cognitive decline typical of aging, which re-inforces the hypothesis of oxidative stress and cellular damage as contributors of physiological atrophy of aging. Moreover, cumulative evidence suggests their possible use as therapies, which improve the aging population's quality of life.

AB  - Phosphoinositides are essential signaling molecules. The PI5P4K family of phosphoinositide kinases and their substrates and products, PI5P and PI4,5P(2), respectively, are emerging as intracellular metabolic and stress sensors. We performed an unbiased screen to investigate the signals that these kinases relay and the specific upstream regulators controlling this signaling node. We found that the core Hippo pathway kinases MST1/2 phosphorylated PI5P4Ks and inhibited their signaling in vitro and in cells. We further showed that PI5P4K activity regulated several Hippo- and YAP-related phenotypes, specifically decreasing the interaction between the key Hippo proteins MOB1 and LATS and stimulating the YAP-mediated genetic program governing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Mechanistically, we showed that PI5P interacted with MOB1 and enhanced its interaction with LATS, thereby providing a signaling connection between the Hippo pathway and PI5P4Ks. These findings reveal how these two important evolutionarily conserved signaling pathways are integrated to regulate metazoan development and human disease.

AB  - Background: Reduced cerebral blood flow (CBF) contributes to the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, it is unclear whether there is a spatial-temporal-specific pattern of changed CBF in AD progression. Methods: We systematically screened literature databases for cross-sectional and longitudinal studies reporting resting CBF or CBF velocity (CBFv) among patients with AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and healthy controls (HCs). Standardised mean differences (SMDs) for CBF and mean differences (MDs) for CBFv were calculated. Quality assessments, meta-analysis, subgroup analysis, and meta-regression were subsequently performed (PROSPERO: CRD42020207548). Results: Overall, 244 studies comprising 13,644 participants and 60 regions were included. Compared with HCs, AD subjects had decreased resting CBF throughout the brain (SMD range: -1.87 to -0.32), especially within the posterior cingulate and temporal-parietal regions. However, MCI subjects presented decreased CBF in ten regions with modest effects (SMD range: -0.86 to -0.25), especially in the precuneus. We identified the decreased CBF in the temporal, parietal, and hippocampal regions was associated with the lower AD Mini-Mental State Examination scores. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the spatial-temporal pattern of CBF decreased from the precuneus, posterior cingulate and temporal-parietal regions to broader areas with progression from HC to MCI to AD, supporting the incorporation of CBF into the AD research framework.

AB  - Cardiac fibrosis is associated with increased stiffness of the myocardial extracellular matrix (ECM) in part mediated by increased cardiac fibroblast proliferation However, our understanding of the mechanisms regulating cardiac fibroblast proliferation are incomplete. Here we characterise a novel mechanism involving a combined activation of Yes-associated protein (YAP) targets RUNX Family Transcription Factor 2 (RUNX2) and TEA Domain Transcription Factor (TEAD). We demonstrate that cardiac fibroblast proliferation is enhanced by interaction with a stiff ECM compared to a soft ECM. This is associated with activation of the transcriptional co-factor, YAP. We demonstrate that this stiffness induced activation of YAP enhances the transcriptional activity of both TEAD and RUNX2 transcription factors. Inhibition of either TEAD or RUNX2, using gene silencing, expression of dominant-negative mutants or pharmacological inhibition, reduces cardiac fibroblast proliferation. Using mutants of YAP, defective in TEAD or RUNX2 activation ability, we demonstrate a dual role of YAP-mediated activation of TEAD and RUNX2 for substrate stiffness induced cardiac fibroblast proliferation. Our data highlights a previously unrecognised role of YAP mediated RUNX2 activation for cardiac fibroblast proliferation in response to increased ECM stiffness.

AB  - Numerous eukaryotic toxins that accumulate in geophytic plants are valuable in the clinic, yet their biosynthetic pathways have remained elusive. A notable example is the >150 Amaryllidaceae alkaloids (AmAs), including galantamine, an FDA-approved treatment for Alzheimer's disease. We show that while AmAs accumulate to high levels in many daffodil tissues, biosynthesis is localized to nascent, growing tissue at the leaf base. A similar trend is found in the production of steroidal alkaloids (e.g., cyclopamine) in corn lily. This model of active biosynthesis enabled the elucidation of a complete set of biosynthetic genes that can be used to produce AmAs. Taken together, our work sheds light on the developmental and enzymatic logic of diverse alkaloid biosynthesis in daffodils. More broadly, it suggests a paradigm for biosynthesis regulation in monocot geophytes, where plants are protected from herbivory through active charging of newly formed cells with eukaryotic toxins that persist as above-ground tissue develops.

AB  - Maintaining genomic stability is a prerequisite for proliferating NPCs to ensure genetic fidelity. Though histone arginine methylation has been shown to play important roles in safeguarding genomic stability, the underlying mechanism during brain development is not fully understood. Protein arginine N-methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) is a type II protein arginine methyltransferase that plays a role in transcriptional regulation. Here, we identify PRMT5 as a key regulator of DNA repair in response to double-strand breaks (DSBs) during NPC proliferation. Prmt5F/F; Emx1-Cre (cKO-Emx1) mice show a distinctive microcephaly phenotype, with partial loss of the dorsal medial cerebral cortex and complete loss of the corpus callosum and hippocampus. This phenotype is resulted from DSBs accumulation in the medial dorsal cortex followed by cell apoptosis. Both RNA sequencing and in vitro DNA repair analyses reveal that PRMT5 is required for DNA homologous recombination (HR) repair. PRMT5 specifically catalyzes H3R2me2s in proliferating NPCs in the developing mouse brain to enhance HR-related gene expression during DNA repair. Finally, overexpression of BRCA1 significantly rescues DSBs accumulation and cell apoptosis in PRMT5-deficient NSCs. Taken together, our results show that PRMT5 maintains genomic stability by regulating histone arginine methylation in proliferating NPCs.

AB  - Bats are distinctive among mammals due to their ability to fly, use laryngeal echolocation, and tolerate vi-ruses. However, there are currently no reliable cellular models for studying bat biology or their response to viral infections. Here, we created induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from two species of bats: the wild greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) and the greater mouse-eared bat (Myotis myotis). The iPSCs from both bat species showed similar characteristics and had a gene expression profile resem-bling that of cells attacked by viruses. They also had a high number of endogenous viral sequences, partic-ularly retroviruses. These results suggest that bats have evolved mechanisms to tolerate a large load of viral sequences and may have a more intertwined relationship with viruses than previously thought. Further study of bat iPSCs and their differentiated progeny will provide insights into bat biology, virus host relationships, and the molecular basis of bats' special traits.

AB  - The Hippo/Yes-associated protein (YAP) signaling pathway has been shown to be able to maintain organ size and homeostasis by regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. The abuse of aminoglycosides is one of the main causes of sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL). However, the role of the Hippo/YAP signaling pathway in cochlear hair cell (HC) damage protection in the auditory field is still unclear. In this study, we used the YAP agonist XMU-MP-1 (XMU) and the inhibitor Verteporfin (VP) to regulate the Hippo/YAP signaling pathway in vitro. We showed that YAP overexpression reduced neomycin-induced HC loss, while downregulated YAP expression increased HC vulnerability after neomycin exposure in vitro. We next found that activation of YAP expression inhibited C-Abl-mediated cell apoptosis, which led to reduced HC loss. Many previous studies have reported that the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is significantly increased in cochlear HCs after neomycin exposure. In our study, we also found that YAP overexpression significantly decreased ROS accumulation, while downregulation of YAP expression increased ROS accumulation. In summary, our results demonstrate that the Hippo/YAP signaling pathway plays an important role in reducing HC injury and maintaining auditory function after aminoglycoside exposure. YAP overexpression could protect against neomycin-induced HC loss by inhibiting C-Abl-mediated cell apoptosis and decreasing ROS accumulation, suggesting that YAP could be a novel therapeutic target for aminoglycosides-induced sensorineural hearing loss in the clinic.

AB  - Lymphatic drainage generates force that induces prostate cancer cell motility via activation of Yes-associated protein (YAP), but whether this response to fluid force is conserved across cancer types is unclear. Here, we show that shear stress corresponding to fluid flow in the initial lymphatics modifies taxis in breast cancer, whereas some cell lines use rapid amoeboid migration behavior in response to fluid flow, a separate subset decrease movement. Positive responders displayed transcriptional profiles characteristic of an amoeboid cell state, which is typical of cells advancing at the edges of neoplastic tumors. Regulation of the HIPPO tumor suppressor pathway and YAP activity also differed between breast subsets and prostate cancer. Although subcellular localization of YAP to the nucleus positively correlated with overall velocity of locomotion, YAP gain- and loss-of-function demonstrates that YAP inhibits breast cancer motility but is outcompeted by other pro-taxis mediators in the context of flow. Specifically, we show that RhoA dictates response to flow. GTPase activity of RhoA, but not Rac1 or Cdc42 Rho family GTPases, is elevated in cells that positively respond to flow and is unchanged in cells that decelerate under flow. Disruption of RhoA or the RhoA effector, Rho-associated kinase (ROCK), blocked shear stress-induced motility. Collectively, these findings identify biomechanical force as a regulator amoeboid cell migration and demonstrate stratification of breast cancer subsets by flow-sensing mechanotransduction pathways.

AB  - RAS GTPases bind effectors to convert upstream cues to changes in cellular function. Effectors of classical H/K/NRAS are defined by RBD/RA domains which recognize the GTP-bound conformation of these GTPases, yet the specificity of RBD/RAs for over 160 RAS superfamily proteins remains poorly explored. We have systematically mapped interactions between BRAF and four RASSF effectors, the largest family of RA-containing proteins, with all RAS, RHO and ARF small GTPases. 39 validated complexes reveal plasticity in RASSF binding, while BRAF demonstrates tight specificity for classical H/K/NRAS. Complex between RASSF5 and diverse RAS GTPases at the plasma membrane can activate Hippo signalling and sequester YAP in the cytosol. RASSF8 undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation and resides in YAP-associated membraneless condensates, which also engage several RAS and RHO GTPases. The poorly studied RASSF3 has been identified as a first potential effector of mitochondrial MIRO proteins, and its co-expression with these GTPases impacts mitochondria and peroxisome distribution. These data reveal the complex nature of GTPase-effector interactions and show their systematic elucidation can reveal completely novel and biologically relevant cellular processes.
   Effectors in the RASSF family demonstrate distinct and wide-ranging specificity for RAS superfamily GTPases. Identified complexes can regulate Hippo signalling and control nuclear shuttling of YAP, as well as additional cellular processes such as mitochondrial distribution.The RA domains of RASSF proteins complex with diverse RAS superfamily GTPases.RASSF-GTPase interactions alter YAP subcellular distribution, including its sequestration in membraneless organelles.RASSF3 is recruited to mitochondria by MIRO GTPases and they impact distribution of mitochondria and peroxisomes.

AB  - The mechanism underlying the transition from the pre-symptomatic to the symptomatic state is a crucial aspect of epileptogenesis. SYN2 is a member of a multigene family of synaptic vesicle phosphoproteins playing a fundamental role in controlling neurotransmitter release. Human SYN2 gene mutations are associated with epilepsy and autism spectrum disorder. Mice knocked out for synapsin II (SynII KO) are prone to epileptic seizures that appear after 2 months of age. However, the involvement of the endocannabinoid system, known to regulate seizure development and propagation, in the modulation of the excitatory/inhibitory balance in the epileptic hippocampal network of SynII KO mice has not been explored. In this study, we investigated the impact of endocannabinoids on glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses at hippocampal dentate gyrus granule cells in young pre-symptomatic (1-2 months old) and adult symptomatic (5-8 months old) SynII KO mice. We observed an increase in endocannabinoid-mediated depolarization-induced suppression of excitation in young SynII KO mice, compared to age-matched wild-type controls. In contrast, the endocannabinoid-mediated depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition remained unchanged in SynII KO mice at both ages. This selective alteration of excitatory synaptic transmission was accompanied by changes in hippocampal endocannabinoid levels and cannabinoid receptor type 1 distribution among glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic terminals contacting the granule cells of the dentate gyrus. Finally, inhibition of type-1 cannabinoid receptors in young pre-symptomatic SynII KO mice induced seizures during a tail suspension test. Our results suggest that endocannabinoids contribute to maintaining network stability in a genetic mouse model of human epilepsy.

AB  - YAP, an effector of the Hippo signalling pathway, promotes organ growth and regeneration. Prolonged YAP activation results in uncontrolled proliferation and cancer. Therefore, exogenous regulation of YAP activity has potential translational applications. We present a versatile optogenetic construct (optoYAP) for manipulating YAP localisation, and consequently its activity and function. We attach a LOV2 domain that photocages a nuclear localisation signal (NLS) to the N-terminus of YAP. In 488 nm light, the LOV2 domain unfolds, exposing the NLS, which shuttles optoYAP into the nucleus. Nuclear import of optoYAP is reversible and tuneable by light intensity. In cell culture, activated optoYAP promotes YAP target gene expression and cell proliferation. Similarly, optofYap can be used in zebrafish embryos to modulate target genes. We demonstrate that optoYAP can override a cell's response to substrate stiffness to generate anchorage-independent growth. OptoYAP is functional in both cell culture and in vivo, providing a powerful tool to address basic research questions and therapeutic applications in regeneration and disease.

AB  - Extracellular matrix stiffness is enhanced in cancer and fibrosis; however, there is limited knowledge on how matrix mechanics modulate expression and signaling of the methyltransferase G9a. Here, we show that matrix stiffness and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 1 signaling together regulate G9a expression and the levels of the histone mark H3K9me2. Suppressing the activity and expression of G9a attenuates TGF beta 1-induced alpha smooth muscle actin (alpha SMA) and N-cadherin expression and cell morphology changes in mammary epithelial cells cultured on stiff substrata. Knockdown of G9a increases the expression of large tumor suppressor kinase 2 (LATS2) and decreases the nuclear localization of yes associated protein (YAP). Furthermore, inhibition of LATS promotes an increase in YAP nuclear localization and alpha SMA expression, while inhibition of YAP attenuates alpha SMA expression. Overall, our findings indicate that a G9a-LATS-YAP signaling cascade regulates mammary epithelial cell response to matrix stiffness and TGF beta 1.

AB  - The Hippo tumor suppressor pathway controls transcription by regulating nuclear abundance of YAP and TAZ, which activate transcription with the TEAD1-TEAD4 DNA-binding proteins. Recently, several small-molecule inhibitors of YAP and TEADs have been reported, with some entering clinical trials for different cancers with Hippo pathway deregulation, most notably, mesothelioma. Using genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screens we reveal that mutations in genes from the Hippo, MAPK, and JAK-STAT signaling pathways all modulate the response of mesothelioma cell lines to TEAD palmitoylation inhibitors. By exploring gene expression programs of mutant cells, we find that MAPK pathway hyperactivation confers resistance to TEAD inhibition by reinstating expression of a subset of YAP/TAZ target genes. Consistent with this, combined inhibition of TEAD and the MAPK kinase MEK, synergistically blocks proliferation of multiple mesothelioma and lung cancer cell lines and more potently reduces the growth of patient-derived lung cancer xenografts in vivo. Collectively, we reveal mechanisms by which cells can overcome small-molecule inhibition of TEAD palmitoylation and potential strategies to enhance the anti-tumor activity of emerging Hippo pathway targeted therapies.
   Genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screens identify mechanisms by which mesothelioma cells respond to TEAD palmitoylation inhibitors, which are the first Hippo pathway targeted therapies.

AB  - Cells need to rapidly and precisely react to multiple mechanical and chemical stimuli in order to ensure precise context-dependent responses. This requires dynamic cellular signalling events that ensure homeostasis and plasticity when needed. A less well-understood process is cellular response to elevated interstitial fluid pressure, where the cell senses and responds to changes in extracellular hydrostatic pressure. Here, using quantitative label-free digital holographic imaging, combined with genome editing, biochemical assays and confocal imaging, we analyse the temporal cellular response to hydrostatic pressure. Upon elevated cyclic hydrostatic pressure, the cell responds by rapid, dramatic and reversible changes in cellular volume. We show that YAP and TAZ, the co-transcriptional regulators of the Hippo signalling pathway, control cell volume and that cells without YAP and TAZ have lower plasma membrane tension. We present direct evidence that YAP/TAZ drive the cellular response to hydrostatic pressure, a process that is at least partly mediated via clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Additionally, upon elevated oscillating hydrostatic pressure, YAP/TAZ are activated and induce TEAD-mediated transcription and expression of cellular components involved in dynamic regulation of cell volume and extracellular matrix. This cellular response confers a feedback loop that allows the cell to robustly respond to changes in interstitial fluid pressure.

AB  - Synapses connect discrete neurons into vast networks that send, receive, and encode diverse forms of information. Synaptic function and plasticity, the neuronal process of adapting to diverse and variable inputs, depend on the dynamic nature of synaptic molecular components, which is mediated in part by cell adhesion signaling pathways. Here, we found that the enzyme biliverdin reductase (BVR) physically links together key focal adhesion signaling molecules at the synapse. BVR-null (BVR-/-) mice exhibited substantial deficits in learning and memory on neurocognitive tests, and hippocampal slices in which BVR was postsynaptically depleted showed deficits in electrophysiological responses to stimuli. RNA sequencing, biochemistry, and pathway analyses suggested that these deficits were mediated through the loss of focal adhesion signaling at both the transcriptional and biochemical level in the hippocampus. Independently of its catalytic function, BVR acted as a bridge between the primary focal adhesion signaling kinases FAK and Pyk2 and the effector kinase Src. Without BVR, FAK and Pyk2 did not bind to and stimulate Src, which then did not phosphorylate the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, a critical posttranslational modification for synaptic plasticity. Src itself is a molecular hub on which many signaling pathways converge to stimulate NMDAR-mediated neurotransmission, thus positioning BVR at a prominent intersection of synaptic signaling.

AB  - Activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) and its downstream genes are involved in progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Herein, we demonstrated that sulfhydration of Ras-related protein Rab-7a (RAB7A) was regulated by ATF6. High expression of RAB7A indicated poor prognosis of HCC patients. RAB7A overexpression contributed to proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion of HepG2 and Hep3B cells. Furthermore, we found that RAB7A enhanced aerobic glycolysis in HepG2 cells, indicating a higher degree of tumor malignancy. Mechanistically, RAB7A suppressed Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) binding to 14-3-3 and conduced to YAP1 nuclear translocation and activation, promoting its downstream gene expression, thereby promoting growth and metastasis of liver cancer cells. In addition, knocking down RAB7A attenuated the progression of orthotopic liver tumors in mice. These findings illustrate the important role of RAB7A in regulating HCC progression. Thus, RAB7A may be a potential innovative target for HCC treatment.

AB  - Yes-associated protein (YAP)-a major effector protein of the Hippo pathway- regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and senescence. Amp-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a key sensor that monitors cellular nutrient supply and energy status. Although YAP and AMPK are considered to regulate cellular senescence, it is still unclear whether AMPK is involved in YAP-regulated cellular senescence. Here, we found that YAP promoted AMPK alpha 1 aggregation and localization around mitochondria by co-transfecting CFP-YAP and YFPAMPK alpha 1 plasmids. Subsequent live cell fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay did not exhibit direct interaction between YAP and AMPK alpha 1. FRET, Co-immunoprecipitation, and western blot experiments revealed that YAP directly bound to TEAD, enhancing the expression of AMPK alpha 1 and p-AMPK alpha. Treatment with verteporfin inhibited YAP's binding to TEAD and reversed the elevated expression of AMPK alpha 1 in the cells overexpressing CFP-YAP. Verteporfin also reduced the proportion of AMPK alpha 1 puncta in the cells co-expressing CFP-YAP and YFP-AMPK alpha 1. In addition, the AMPK alpha 1 puncta were demonstrated to inhibit cell viability, autophagy, and proliferation, and ultimately promote cell senescence. In conclusion, YAP binds to TEAD to upregulate AMPK alpha 1 and promotes the formation of AMPK alpha 1 puncta around mitochondria under the condition of coexpression of CFP-YAP and YFP-AMPK alpha 1, in which AMPK alpha 1 puncta lead to cellular senescence.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common form of inherited intellectual disability, results from a loss of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), an RNA-binding protein whose deficiency impacts many targeted mRNA and brain functions. However, how these FMRP targets contribute to the pathogenesis of FXS is not fully understood, and effective treatment is lacking. Here, we identify signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) as a target of FMRP in adult hippocampal neural stem cells (NSCs). FMRP regulates Stat3 mRNA stability and protein translation, and loss of FMRP results in elevated Stat3 mRNA and protein, leading to aberrant neurogenesis and impaired dendritic maturation in adult NSCs and developing neurons. Activation of Stat3 in adult mouse hippocampal NSCs impairs cognitive flexibility. We show that STAT3 phosphorylation specifically binds to MYC, which is essential for adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Both genetic reduction of STAT3 and pharmacological treatment with artesunate, the first-line drug for treating malaria worldwide, rescue neurogenic and cognitive deficits in FMRP-deficient mice. Our work reveals a potential regulatory role for FMRP and STAT3-MYC signaling pathway in adult neurogenesis and cognitive flexibility, and provides a potential novel therapeutic strategy for treating adult FXS patients.

AB  - The hippocampus is critical for episodic memory. Although hippocampal activity represents place and other behaviorally relevant variables, it is unclear how it encodes numerous memories of specific events in life. To study episodic coding, we leveraged the specialized behavior of chickadees-food-caching birds that form memories at well-defined moments in time whenever they cache food for subsequent retrieval. Our recordings during caching revealed very sparse, transient barcode-like patterns of firing across hippocampal neurons. Each "barcode"uniquely represented a caching event and transiently reactivated during the retrieval of that specific cache. Barcodes co-occurred with the conventional activity of place cells but were uncorrelated even for nearby cache locations that had similar place codes. We propose that animals recall episodic memories by reactivating hippocampal barcodes. Similarly to computer hash codes, these patterns assign unique identifiers to different events and could be a mechanism for rapid formation and storage of many non -interfering memories.

AB  - Regulatory T lymphocyte (Treg) homing reactions mediated by G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-ligand interactions play a central role in maintaining intestinal immune homeostasis by restraining inappropriate immune responses in the gastrointestinal tract. However, the origin of Treg homing to the colon remains mysterious. Here, we report that the C10ORF99 peptide (also known as CPR15L and AP57), a cognate ligand of GPR15 that controls Treg homing to the colon, originates from a duplication of the flanking CDHR1 gene and is functionally paired with GPR15 in amniotes. Evolutionary analysis and experimental data indicate that the GPR15-C10ORF99 pair is functionally conserved to mediate colonic Treg homing in amniotes and their expression patterns are positively correlated with herbivore diet in the colon. With the first herbivorous diet in early amniotes, a new biological process (herbivorous diet short-chain fatty acid-C10ORF99/GPR15-induced Treg homing colon immune homeostasis) emerged, and we propose an evolutionary model whereby GPR15-C10ORF99 functional pairing has initiated the first colonic Treg homing reaction in amniotes. Our findings also highlight that GPCR-ligand pairing leads to physiological adaptation during vertebrate evolution.

TI  - Input-specific regulation of glutamatergic synaptic transmission in the medial prefrontal cortex by mGlu2/mGlu4 receptor heterodimers
T2  - SCIENCE SIGNALING
LA  - English
AB  - Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are G protein-coupled receptors that regulate various aspects of central nervous system processing in normal physiology and in disease. They are thought to function as disulfide-linked homodimers, but studies have suggested that mGluRs can form functional heterodimers in cell lines. Using selective allosteric ligands, ex vivo brain slice electrophysiology, and optogenetic approaches, we found that two mGluR subtypes-mGluR2 and mGluR4 (or mGlu(2) and mGlu(4))-exist as functional heterodimers that regulate excitatory transmission in a synapse-specific manner within the rodent medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Activation of mGlu(2)/mGlu(4) heterodimers inhibited glutamatergic signaling at thalamo-mPFC synapses but not at hippocampus-mPFC or amygdala-mPFC synapses. These findings raise the possibility that selectively targeting these heterodimers could be a therapeutic strategy for some neurologic and neuropsychiatric disorders involving specific brain circuits.

AB  - Base excision repair, initiated by DNA glycosylases, preserves genomic integrity by removing damaged bases. DNA glycosylases Ogg1 and Mutyh were shown to alter the hippocampal transcriptome independently of DNA damage repair. However, the role of DNA glycosylases as transcriptional regulators and their involvement in cognition remain unclear. Here, we combine transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses of the hippocampus in mice deficient in DNA glycosylases. We report that the combined deficiency of Ogg1 and Mutyh impairs spatial long-term memory. Mechanistically, Ogg1 and Mutyh modulate DNA methylation of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) target genes. PRC2 occupancy and associated histone post-translational modifications depend on Ogg1 and Mutyh in neurons and glia. These epigenetic changes correlate with cell-type specific differences in gene expression of PRC2 targets. Finally, human genetic data link DNA glycosylase-regulated genes to cognitive function, highlighting a novel role for Ogg1 and Mutyh in modulating the epigenome to control transcriptional responses relevant for brain-related diseases.Graphical AbstractCreated in BioRender.

AB  - Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play an important regulatory role in the pathogenesis and progression of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), which have not been thoroughly elucidated. In this study, we revealed for the first time that circRILPL1 was upregulated in NPC, weakened adhesion and decreased stiffness of NPC cells, and promoted NPC proliferation and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, circRILPL1 inhibited the LATS1-YAP kinase cascade by binding to and activating ROCK1, resulting in decrease of YAP phosphorylation. Binding and cooperating with transport receptor IPO7, circRILPL1 promoted the translocation of YAP from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where YAP enhanced the transcription of cytoskeleton remodeling genes CAPN2 and PXN. By which, circRILPL1 contributed to the pathogenesis of NPC. Our results demonstrated that circRILPL1 promoted the proliferation and metastasis of NPC through activating the Hippo-YAP signaling pathway by binding to both ROCK1 and IPO7. Highly expressed circRILPL1 in NPC may serve as an important biomarker for tumor diagnosis and may also be a potential therapeutic target.

AB  - Gulf War Illness (GWI), a disorder suffered by approximately 200,000 veterans of the first Gulf War, was caused by exposure to low-level organophosphate pesticides and nerve agents in combination with battlefield stress. To elucidate the mechanistic basis of the brain-related symptoms of GWI, human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) derived from veterans with or without GWI were differentiated into forebrain glutamatergic neurons and then exposed to a Gulf War (GW) relevant toxicant regimen consisting of a sarin analog and cortisol, a human stress hormone. Elevated levels of total and phosphorylated tau, reduced microtubule acetylation, altered mitochondrial dynamics/transport, and decreased neuronal activity were observed in neurons exposed to the toxicant regimen. Some of the data are consistent with the possibility that some veterans may have been predisposed to acquire GWI. Wistar rats exposed to a similar toxicant regimen showed a mild learning and memory deficit, as well as cell loss and tau pathology selectively in the CA3 region of the hippocampus. These cellular responses offer a mechanistic explanation for the memory loss suffered by veterans with GWI and provide a cell-based model for screening drugs and developing personalized therapies for these veterans.

AB  - Replication stress is a driver of genomic instability, contributing to carcinogenesis by causing DNA damage and mutations. While YAP, the downstream co-activator of the Hippo signaling pathway, plays a crucial role in regulating cell growth and differentiation, it is unclear whether it generates replication stress exploitable for therapy. Here, we report that oncogenic YAP shortens the G1 phase through increased CDK4/6 activity, leading to early S-phase entry. This causes origin underlicensing, an overall reduced rate of DNA replication, and, unusually, an accelerated speed of individual replication forks. CHK1 inhibition in cells expressing oncogenic YAP results in DNA damage during S-phase, which is not due to premature CDK1 activation or mitotic entry. Sensitivity to CHK1 inhibition depends on the YAP-TEAD interaction and involves a global increase in transcription and an increase in transcription-replication conflicts (TRCs). Replication stress from oncogenic YAP can be mitigated by restoring G1 length through partial CDK4/6 inhibition or by reducing YAP-induced hypertranscription. Our findings suggest a potential therapeutic strategy for targeting YAP-dependent cancers by exploiting their vulnerability to replication stress.

AB  - Introduction. Transient global ischaemia in rodents causes selective loss of hippocampal CA1neurons, but the potential involvement of endocytic pathways has not been fully explored. The aim of this study was to investigate the changes in early endosomes in the CA1 subfield after ischaemia and reperfusion. Material and methods. A four-vessel occlusion (4-VO) model was established in Wistar rats to induce 13 minutes of global cerebral ischaemia. Neuronal death was detected by Fluoro-Jade B (FJ-B) staining at various intervals after reperfusion, and intracellular membrane changes in ischaemic neurons were revealed using DiOC6(3), 6 (3), a lipophilic fluorescent probe. Ras-related protein Rab5 (Rab5) immunostaining was performed to detect changes in early endosomes in ischaemic neurons. Western blot analysis was used to confirm the morphological observations on Rab5 in the CA1 hippocampal subfield. Results. FJ-B staining confirmed progressive neuronal death in the CA1 subfield in ischaemic rats after reperfusion. DiOC6(3) 6 (3) staining revealed abnormally increased membranous components in ischaemic CA1 neurons. Specifically, early endosomes, as labelled by Rab5 immunostaining, significantly increased in number and size in CA1 neurons at 1.5 and 2 days post-reper fusion, followed by rupture at day 3 and a decrease in staining intensity at day 7 post-reper fusion. Western blot analysis confirmed a significant upregulation of Rab5 protein levels at day 2, which returned to near control levels by day 7. Conclusions. Our study revealed significant changes in the dynamics of early endosomes in CA1 neurons after ischaemia-reper fusion injury. The initial increase in the area fraction of early endosomes in CA1 neurons may reflect an upregulation of endocytic activity, whereas the fragmentation and reduction of early endosomes at the later stage may indicate a failure of adaptive mechanisms of ischaemic neurons against ischaemia-induced death. Understanding the temporal dynamics of early endosomes provides critical insights into the cellular mechanisms that govern fate of CA1 hippocampal neuronsl after ischaemia/reper fusion.

AB  - BackgroundThe dynamics of phosphatidylserine in the plasma membrane is a tightly regulated feature of eukaryotic cells. Phosphatidylserine (PS) is found preferentially in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. Disruption of this asymmetry leads to the exposure of phosphatidylserine on the cell surface and is associated with cell death, synaptic pruning, blood clotting and other cellular processes. Due to the role of phosphatidylserine in widespread cellular functions, an efficient phosphatidylserine probe is needed to study them. Currently, a few different phosphatidylserine labelling tools are available; however, these labels have unfavourable signal-to-noise ratios and are difficult to use in tissues due to limited permeability. Their application in living tissue requires injection procedures that damage the tissue and release damage-associated molecular patterns, which in turn stimulates phosphatidylserine exposure.MethodsFor this reason, we developed a novel genetically encoded phosphatidylserine probe based on the C2 domain of the lactadherin (MFG-E8) protein, suitable for labelling exposed phosphatidylserine in various research models. We tested the C2 probe specificity to phosphatidylserine on hybrid bilayer lipid membranes by observing surface plasmon resonance angle shift. Then, we analysed purified fused C2 proteins on different cell culture lines or engineered AAVs encoding C2 probes on tissue cultures after apoptosis induction. For in vivo experiments, neurotropic AAVs were intravenously injected into perinatal mice, and after 2 weeks, brain slices were collected to observe C2-SNAP expression.ResultsThe biophysical analysis revealed the high specificity of the C2 probe for phosphatidylserine. The fused recombinant C2 proteins were suitable for labelling phosphatidylserine on the surface of apoptotic cells in various cell lines. We engineered AAVs and validated them in organotypic brain tissue cultures for non-invasive delivery of the genetically encoded C2 probe and showed that these probes were expressed in the brain in vivo after intravenous AAV delivery to mice.ConclusionsWe have demonstrated that the developed genetically encoded PS biosensor can be utilised in a variety of assays as a two-component system of C2 and C2m2 fusion proteins. This system allows for precise quantification and PS visualisation at directly specified threshold levels, enabling the evaluation of PS exposure in both physiological and cell death processes.

AB  - Background: This study aimed to investigate the mechanisms of acute rejection for vascularized composite allotransplantation (VCA) using microRNAs (miRNAs) differential expression in a VCA animal model. Methods: Brown Norway rats were used as transplant donors and Lewis rats as VCA receptors. The changes were divided into different stages before and after transplantation in Lewis rats, and all appearance changes were recorded. Also, histological evaluations were performed on all recipients, and the expression of microRNAs was analyzed when acute immune rejection occurred. Then, we used GO and KEGG Pathway enrichment analyses to predict miRNA targets. Finally, differentially expressed miRNAs were detected by RT-qPCR. Results: Compared to pre-operation, 22 miRNAs were differentially expressed after operations. Among them, nine were upregulated, and 13 were downregulated in skin tissues. The RT-qPCR results revealed that rno-miR-340-5p and rno-miR-21-5p were significantly upregulated and enriched in the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. Moreover, rno-miR-145-5p and rno-miR-195-5p were significantly downregulated, and most of their target genes were enriched in the Hippo signaling pathway. The histological evaluations showed that, after VCA, the skin tissue presented severe acute rejection. Conclusions: The miRNAs rno-miR-340-5p, rno-miR-21-5p, rno-miR-145-5p, and rno-miR-195-5p were significantly regulated during VCA acute rejection, when the four miRNAs analyses were done on skin biopsies. These miRNAs might be potential biomarkers for objective, early, and minimally invasive rejection diagnosis.

AB  - Synaptic scaling is a form of homeostatic plasticity which allows neurons to adjust their action potential firing rate in response to chronic alterations in neural activity. Synaptic scaling requires profound changes in gene expression, but the relative contribution of local and cell-wide mechanisms is controversial. Here we perform a comprehensive multi-omics characterization of the somatic and process compartments of primary rat hippocampal neurons during synaptic scaling. We uncover both highly compartment-specific and correlating changes in the neuronal transcriptome and proteome. Whereas downregulation of crucial regulators of neuronal excitability occurs primarily in the somatic compartment, structural components of excitatory postsynapses are mostly downregulated in processes. Local inhibition of protein synthesis in processes during scaling is confirmed for candidate synaptic proteins. Motif analysis further suggests an important role for trans-acting post-transcriptional regulators, including RNA-binding proteins and microRNAs, in the local regulation of the corresponding mRNAs. Altogether, our study indicates that, during synaptic scaling, compartmentalized gene expression changes might co-exist with neuron-wide mechanisms to allow synaptic computation and homeostasis.

AB  - Developing hippocampal neurons undergo rapid synaptogenesis in response to neurotrophic signals to form and refine circuit connections. The adipokine leptin is a satiety factor with neurotrophic actions, which potentiates both glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptogenesis in the hippocampus during neonatal development. Brief exposure to leptin enhances GABA(A) receptor-dependent synaptic currents in hippocampal neurons. Here, using molecular and electrophysiological techniques, we found that leptin increased the surface localization of GABA(A) receptors and the number of functional GABAergic synapses in hippocampal cultures from male and female rat pups. Leptin increased the interaction between GABA(A) receptors and the Rho guanine exchange factor beta-PIX (a scaffolding protein at GABAergic postsynaptic sites) in a manner dependent on the kinase CaMKK. We also found that the leptin receptor and beta-PIX formed a complex, the amount of which transiently increased upon leptin receptor activation. Furthermore, Tyr(985) in the leptin receptor and the SH3 domain of beta-PIX are crucial for this interaction, which was required for the developmental increase in GABAergic synaptogenesis. Our results suggest a mechanism by which leptin promotes GABAergic synaptogenesis in hippocampal neurons and reveal further complexity in leptin receptor signaling and its interactome.

AB  - Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is a rare and frequently fatal lymphoma subtype. The programmed death-1 (PD-1) pathway has emerged as a potential therapeutic target, but the effectiveness of PD-1 antibody sintilimab in combination with immunochemotherapy as a frontline treatment for PCNSL remains to be determined. In this phase 2 trial (ChiCTR1900027433) with a safety run-in, we included patients aged 18-70 with newly diagnosed PCNSL. Participants underwent six 21-day cycles of a SMTR regimen, which includes sintilimab (200 mg, Day 0), rituximab (375 mg/m2, Day 0), methotrexate (3.0 g/m2, Day 1 or 1.0 g/m2 for patients aged >= 65 years), and temozolomide (150 mg/m2/d, Days 1-5). Among 27 evaluable patients, the overall response rate (ORR) was 96.3% (95% confidence interval: 81-99.9%), with 25 complete responses. At a median follow-up of 24.4 months, the medians for duration of response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival were not reached. The most common grade 3-4 treatment-related toxicities were increased levels of alanine aminotransferase (17.9%) and aspartate aminotransferase (14.3%). Additionally, baseline levels of interferon-alpha and the IL10/IL6 ratio in cerebrospinal fluid emerged as potential predictors of PFS, achieving areas under the curve of 0.88 and 0.84, respectively, at 2 years. Whole-exome sequencing revealed a higher prevalence of RTK-RAS and PI3K pathway mutations in the durable clinical benefit group, while a greater frequency of Notch and Hippo pathway mutations in the no durable benefit group. These findings suggest the SMTR regimen is highly efficacious and tolerable for newly diagnosed PCNSL, warranting further investigation.

AB  - The Hippo pathway, a signaling cascade involved in the regulation of organ size and several other processes, acts as a conduit between extracellular matrix (ECM) cues and cellular responses. We asked whether the basement membrane (BM), a specialized ECM component known to induce quiescence and differentiation in mammary epithelial cells, would regulate the localization, activity, and interactome of YAP, a Hippo pathway effector. To address this question, we used a broad range of experimental approaches, including 2D and 3D cultures of both mouse and human mammary epithelial cells, as well as the developing mouse mammary gland. In contrast to malignant cells, nontumoral cells cultured with a reconstituted BM (rBM) displayed higher concentrations of YAP in the cytoplasm. Incidentally, when in the nucleus of rBM-treated cells, YAP resided preferentially at the nuclear periphery. In agreement with our cell culture experiments, YAP exhibited cytoplasmic predominance in ductal cells of developing mammary epithelia, where a denser BM is found. Conversely, terminal end bud (TEB) cells with a thinner BM displayed higher nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratios of YAP. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that genes regulated by YAP were overrepresented in the transcriptomes of microdissected TEBs. Consistently, mouse epithelial cells exposed to the rBM expressed lower levels of YAP-regulated genes, although the protein level of YAP and Hippo components were slightly altered by the treatment. Mass spectrometry analysis identified a differential set of proteins interacting with YAP in cytoplasmic fractions of mouse epithelial cells in the absence or presence of rBM. In untreated cells, YAP interactants were enriched in processes related to ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, whereas in cells exposed to rBM YAP interactants were mainly key proteins related to amino acid, amino sugar, and carbohydrate metabolism. Collectively, we unraveled that the BM induces YAP translocation or retention in the cytoplasm of nontumoral epithelial cells and that in the cytoplasm YAP seems to undertake novel functions in metabolic pathways.

AB  - The Hippo kinase cascade functions as a central hub that relays input from the "outside world" of the cell and translates it into specific cellular responses by regulating the activity of Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1). How Hippo translates input from the extracellular signals into specific intracellular responses remains unclear. Here, we show that transforming growth factor beta beta (TGF beta)-activated TAK1 activates LATS1/2, which then phosphorylates YAP1. Phosphorylated YAP1 (p-YAP1) associates with RUNX3, but not with TEAD4, to form a TGF beta-stimulated restriction (R)-point-associated complex which activates target chromatin loci in the nucleus. Soon after, p-YAP1 is exported to the cytoplasm. Attenuation of TGF beta signaling results in re-localization of unphosphorylated YAP1 to the nucleus, where it forms a YAP1/TEAD4/SMAD3/AP1/p300 complex. The TGF beta-stimulated spatiotemporal dynamics of YAP1 are abrogated in many cancer cells. These results identify a new pathway that integrates TGF beta signals and the Hippo pathway (TGF beta -> TAK1 -> LATS -> YAP1 cascade) with a novel dynamic nuclear role for p-YAP1.

AB  - The hippocampus is thought to encode a "cognitive map,'' a structural organization of knowledge about relationships in the world. Place cells, spatially selective hippocampal neurons that have been extensively studied in rodents, are one component of this map, describing the relative position of environmental features. However, whether this map extends to abstract, cognitive information remains unknown. Using the relative reward value of cues to define continuous "paths'' through an abstract value space, we show that single neurons in primate hippocampus encode this space through value place fields, much like a rodent's place neurons encode paths through physical space. Value place fields remapped when cues changed but also became increasingly correlated across contexts, allowing maps to become generalized. Our findings help explain the critical contribution of the hippocampus to value-based decision-making, providing a mechanism by which knowledge of relationships in the world can be incorporated into reward predictions for guiding decisions.

AB  - Aging is a major risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases and is associated with decreased buffering capacity of the proteostasis network. We investigated the significance of the unfolded protein response (UPR), a major signaling pathway activated to cope with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, in the functional deterioration of the mammalian brain during aging. We report that genetic disruption of the ER stress sensor IRE1 accelerated age-related cognitive decline. In mouse models, overexpressing an active form of the UPR transcription factor XBP1 restored synaptic and cognitive function, in addition to reducing cell senescence. Proteomic profiling of hippocampal tissue showed that XBP1 expression significantly restore changes associated with aging, including factors associated with synaptic function and pathways linked to neurodegenerative diseases. Similar changes were observed in human brain aging. Collectively, our results demonstrate that strategies to manipulate the UPR in mammals may help sustain healthy brain aging.

AB  - Nuclear Cyclin D1 (Ccnd1) is a main regulator of cell cycle progression and cell proliferation. Interestingly, Ccnd1 moves to the cytoplasm at the onset of differentiation in neuronal precursors. However, cytoplasmic functions and targets of Ccnd1 in post-mitotic neurons are unknown. Here we identify the & alpha;4 subunit of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A receptors (GABAARs) as an interactor and target of Ccnd1-Cdk4. Ccnd1 binds to an intracellular loop in & alpha;4 and, together with Cdk4, phosphorylates the & alpha;4 subunit at threonine 423 and serine 431. These modifications upregulate & alpha;4 surface levels, increasing the response of & alpha;4-containing GABAARs, measured in whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. In agreement with this role of Ccnd1-Cdk4 in neuronal signalling, inhibition of Cdk4 or expression of the non-phosphorylatable & alpha;4 decreases synaptic and extra-synaptic currents in the hippocampus of newborn rats. Moreover, according to & alpha;4 functions in synaptic pruning, CCND1 knockout mice display an altered pattern of dendritic spines that is rescued by the phosphomimetic & alpha;4. Overall, our findings molecularly link Ccnd1-Cdk4 to GABAARs activity in the central nervous system and highlight a novel role for this G1 cyclin in neuronal signalling.

AB  - As the most primordial signaling pathway in animal physiology, the Hippo pathway and innate immunity play crucial roles not only in sensing cellular conditions or infections, but also in various metabolite homeostasis and tumorigenesis. However, the correlation between cellular homeostasis and antiviral defense is not well understood. The core kinase LATS1/2, could either enhance or inhibit the anti-tumor immunity in different cellular contexts. In this study, we found that LATS2 can interact with PQBP1, the co-factor of cGAS, thus enhanced the cGAS-STING mediated innate immune response to HIV-1 challenge. LATS2 was observed to upregulate type-I interferon (IFN-I) and cytokines in response to HIV-1 reverse-transcribed DNA and inhibited HIV-1 infection. Due to the involvement of PQBP1, the function of LATS2 in regulating cGAS activity is not relying on the downstream YAP/TAZ as that in the canonical Hippo pathway. The related kinase activity of LATS2 was verified, and the potential phosphorylation site of PQBP1 was identified. Our study established a novel connection between Hippo signaling and innate immunity, thus may provide new potential intervention target on antiviral therapeutics.

AB  - Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is a potential biomarker of prognosis and therapeutic response. We conducted this study to explore the role of the molecular tumor burden index (mTBI) in ctDNA as a therapeutic response and prognostic biomarker in a larger cohort prospective phase III randomized multicenter study. We collected 291 plasma samples from 125 metastatic breast cancer patients from the CAMELLIA study (NCT01917279). Target-capture deep sequencing of 1021 genes was performed to detect somatic variants in ctDNA from the plasma samples. The pretreatment mTBI value was correlated with tumor burden (P = 0.025). Patients with high-level pretreatment mTBI had shorter overall survival than patients with low-level pretreatment mTBI, and the median overall survival was 40.9 months and 68.4 months, respectively (P = 0.011). Patients with mTBI decrease to less than 0.02% at the first tumor evaluation had longer progression-free survival and overall survival (P < 0.001 and P = 0.007, respectively). The mTBI has good sensitivity to identify complete response/partial response and progressive disease based on computed tomography scans (88.5% and 87.5%, respectively). The patients classified as molecular responders had longer progression-free survival and overall survival than the nonmolecular responders in the overall cohort (P < 0.001 and P = 0.036, respectively), as well as in the cohort in which computed tomography scans were defined as representing stable disease (P = 0.027 and P = 0.015, respectively). The mTBI in ctDNA detected in liquid biopsies is a potential biomarker of therapeutic response and prognosis in patients with metastatic breast cancer.

AB  - Wnt signalling induces a gradient of stem/progenitor cell proliferation along the crypt-villus axis of the intestine, which becomes expanded during intestinal regeneration or tumour formation. The YAP transcriptional co-activator is known to be required for intestinal regeneration, but its mode of regulation remains controversial. Here we show that the YAP-TEAD transcription factor is a key downstream effector of Wnt signalling in the intestine. Loss of YAP activity by Yap/Taz conditional knockout results in sensitivity of crypt stem cells to apoptosis and reduced cell proliferation during regeneration. Gain of YAP activity by Lats1/2 conditional knockout is sufficient to drive a crypt hyperproliferation response. In particular, Wnt signalling acts transcriptionally to induce YAP and TEAD1/2/4 expression. YAP normally localises to the nucleus only in crypt base stem cells, but becomes nuclear in most intestinal epithelial cells during intestinal regeneration after irradiation, or during organoid growth, in a Src family kinase-dependent manner. YAP-driven crypt expansion during regeneration involves an elongation and flattening of the Wnt signalling gradient. Thus, Wnt and Src-YAP signals cooperate to drive intestinal regeneration.

AB  - Cold-inducible RNA binding protein (CIRBP), a stress response protein, protects cells from mild hypothermia or hypoxia by stabilizing specific mRNAs and promoting their translation. Neurons subjected to hypobaric hypoxia insult trigger various cell death programs. One of these is ferroptosis, a novel non-apoptotic form of programmed cell death, which is characterized by excessive iron ion accumulation and lipid peroxidation. Here, we establish that CIRBP can regulate neuronal ferroptosis both in vivo and in vitro. We observe that hypoxia leads to neuronal death via intracellular ferrous iron overload and impaired antioxidant systems, accompanied by suppressed CIRBP expression. Genetic enrichment of CIRBP in hippocampal neurons CIRBPTg mice bred with Emx1-Cre mice attenuates hypoxia-induced cognitive deficits and neuronal degeneration. Mechanistically, CIRBP alleviates neuronal ferroptosis and intracellular ferrous ion accumulation by binding to the mitochondrial ferritin (FTMT) 3'UTR to stabilize mRNA and promote its translation. Our novel study shows the critical role of CIRBP in the progression of ferroptosis, and provides promising therapeutic target for hypoxia-induced neurological diseases.

AB  - Interorgan communication is vital for tissue homeostasis and health in multicellular organisms, and its disruption can lead to diseases such as cancer. Adipose tissue acts as a key endocrine center, secreting cytokines that influence remote organs. Despite clear links between obesity and increased cancer risk, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Here, utilizing a Drosophila genetic model combining Gal4-UAS and QF-QUAS tissue-specific transgene expression systems, we reveal that adipose-secreted Spz5 ligand promotes distal epithelial tumor overgrowth and invasion. Mechanistically, Spz5 binds to tumor cell Toll-6 receptors, triggering the degradation of the endocytic adaptor protein AP-2 alpha via Mib1-mediated ubiquitination. Consequently, impaired endocytosis leads to Smoothened (Smo) accumulation on the cell membrane and subsequent activation of the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway. This abnormal Hh activation synergizes with the oncogenic Yorkie (Yki) to drive tumor growth and invasion. Furthermore, tumor-derived Unpaired ligands (Upds) activate the JAK-STAT pathway in the fat bodies, which leads to Hippo pathway-dependent upregulation of spz5 expression. Thus, our study provides insights into the complex regulatory mechanisms by which systemic interorgan communication influences tumor progression.

AB  - This multicentre, two-arm, phase 2 study aimed to explore the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant camrelizumab plus chemotherapy or apatinib in patients with initially unresectable stage II-III non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Eligible patients regardless of PD-L1 expression received neoadjuvant camrelizumab 200 mg and platinum-doublet chemotherapy every 3 weeks (arm A) or those with PD-L1-positive tumors received neoadjuvant camrelizumab and apatinib 250 mg once daily (arm B), for 2-4 cycles, followed by surgery. The primary endpoint was major pathological response (MPR) rate. Thirty patients in arm A and 21 in arm B were enrolled. Surgery rates were 50.0% (15/30) in arm A and 42.9% (9/21) in arm B, with all patients achieving R0 resections. Of these patients, the MPR and pathological complete response rates were both 20.0% (95% CI 4.3-48.1) in arm A and were 55.6% (95% CI 21.2-86.3) and 11.1% (95% CI 0.3-48.2) in arm B, respectively. The corresponding objective response rates were 33.3% (95% CI 11.8-61.6) and 55.6% (95% CI 21.2-86.3). With a median follow-up of 22.4 months (95% CI 19.0-26.0), the median event-free survival was not reached (NR; 95% CI 13.6-NR) in arm A and 16.8 months (95% CI 8.6-NR) in arm B. Grade 3 or above treatment-related adverse events occurred in eight (26.7%) patients in arm A and three (14.3%) in arm B. Biomarker analysis showed baseline TYROBP expression was predictive of treatment response in arm B. Neoadjuvant camrelizumab plus chemotherapy or apatinib exhibits preliminary efficacy and manageable toxicity in patients with initially unresectable stage II-III NSCLC.

AB  - Dynamic protein S-palmitoylation is critical for neuronal function, development, and synaptic plasticity. Synap-tic activity-dependent changes in palmitoylation have been reported for a small number of proteins. Here, we characterized the palmitoylome in the hippocampi of male mice before and after context-dependent fear con-ditioning. Of the 121 differentially palmitoylated proteins identified, just over half were synaptic proteins, whereas others were associated with metabolic functions, cytoskeletal organization, and signal transduction. The synapse-associated proteins generally exhibited increased palmitoylation after fear conditioning. In con-trast, most of the proteins that exhibited decreased palmitoylation were associated with metabolic processes. Similar results were seen in cultured rat hippocampal neurons in response to chemically induced long-term po-tentiation. Furthermore, we found that the palmitoylation of one of the synaptic proteins, plasticity-related gene-1 (PRG-1), also known as lipid phosphate phosphatase-related protein type 4 (LPPR4), was important for synaptic activity-induced insertion of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) into the postsynaptic membrane. The findings identify proteins whose dynamic palmitoylation may regulate their role in synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory.

AB  - High-altitude cognitive impairment (HACI) results from acute or chronic exposure to hypoxic conditions. Brain lipid homeostasis is crucial for cognitive function, and lipid droplet (LD) accumulation in glia cells is linked to cognitive decline in aging and stroke. However, whether high-altitude exposure affects brain lipid homeostasis is unclear. Microglia, key regulators of brain homeostasis and inflammation, play a significant role in pathological cognitive impairment and are implicated in LD formation. This study investigates whether lipid dysregulation contributes to HACI and explores microglia-driven mechanisms and potential interventions. Mice were exposed to a simulated 7000 m altitude for 48 h, followed by a week of recovery. Cognitive function and LD accumulation in brain cells were assessed. Microglia were depleted using PLX5622, and mice were exposed to hypoxia or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to validate microglia's role in driving astrocytic LD accumulation and cognitive decline. Minocycline was used to inhibit inflammation. In vitro, co-culture systems of microglia and astrocytes were employed to confirm microglia-derived pro-inflammatory factors' role in astrocytic LD accumulation. Hypobaric hypoxia exposure induced persistent cognitive impairment and LD accumulation in hippocampal astrocytes and microglia. Microglia depletion alleviated cognitive deficits and reduced astrocytic LD accumulation. Hypoxia or LPS did not directly cause LD accumulation in astrocytes but activated microglia to release IL-1 beta, inducing astrocytic LD accumulation. Microglia depletion also mitigated LPS-induced cognitive impairment and astrocytic LD accumulation. Minocycline reduced hypoxia-induced LD accumulation in co-cultured astrocytes and improved cognitive function. Hypoxia triggers pro-inflammatory microglial activation, leading to LD accumulation and the release of IL-1 beta, which drives astrocytic LD accumulation and neuroinflammation, exacerbating HACI. Minocycline effectively restores brain lipid homeostasis and mitigates cognitive impairment. This study provides novel insights into HACI mechanisms and suggests potential therapeutic strategies.

AB  - Background: Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD) represents a rare condition marked by an abnormal mobility pattern of cilia and flagella, resulting in impaired mucociliary clearance. This deficiency leads to recurrent infections and persistent inflammation of the airways. While previous studies have indicated heightened oxidative stress levels in the exhaled breath condensate of pediatric PCD patients, the assessment of oxidative stress within the affected respiratory tissue remains unexplored. Aims: To assess the oxidative status of human nasal epithelial cells (NECs) in PCD patients. Methods: Thirty-five PCD patients and thirty-five healthy control subjects were prospectively included in the study. Levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), reactive nitrogen species (RNS), glutathione (GSH), intracellular Ca2+, plasma membrane potential, and oxidative damage in lipids and proteins were measured. In addition, apoptosis and mitochondrial function were analyzed by flow cytometry in NECs. Results: NECs from PCD patients showed reduced levels of apoptosis (p = 0.004), superoxide anion (O-2(-), p = 0.018), peroxynitrite (ONOO-, p = 0.007), nitric oxide (NO, p = 0.007), mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide (mtH(2)O(2), p < 0.0001), and mitochondrial superoxide anion (mtO(2)(-), p = 0.0004) and increased mitochondrial mass (p = 0.009) compared to those from healthy individuals. No significant differences were observed in oxidized proteins (p = 0.137) and the oxidized/reduced lipid ratio (p = 0.7973). The oxidative profile of NEC cells in PCD patients, according to their ciliary motility, recurrent otitis, recurrent pneumonia, atelectasis, bronchiectasis, and situs inversus, showed no statistically significant differences in the parameters studied. Conversely, patients with chronic rhinosinusitis exhibited lower levels of ONOO- than PCD patients without this condition, with no significant differences related to other symptoms. Conclusions: Our findings strongly suggest the presence of a redox imbalance, specifically leaning toward a reductive state, in PCD patients.

AB  - Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent cell death pathway that involves the depletion of intracellular glutathione (GSH) levels and iron-mediated lipid peroxidation. Ferroptosis is experimentally caused by the inhibition of the cystine/glutamate antiporter xCT, which depletes cells of GSH, or by inhibition of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4), a key regulator of lipid peroxidation. The events that occur between GPx4 inhibition and the execution of ferroptotic cell death are currently a matter of active research. Previous work has shown that calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) mediated by ryanodine receptor (RyR) channels contributes to ferroptosis-induced cell death in primary hippocampal neurons. Here, we used SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, which do not express RyR channels, to test if calcium release mediated by the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) channel plays a role in this process. We show that treatment with RAS Selective Lethal Compound 3 (RSL3), a GPx4 inhibitor, enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, increased cytoplasmic and mitochondrial calcium levels, increased lipid peroxidation, and caused cell death. The RSL3-induced calcium signals were inhibited by Xestospongin B, a specific inhibitor of the ER-resident IP3R calcium channel, by decreasing IP3R levels with carbachol and by IP(3)R1 knockdown, which also prevented the changes in cell morphology toward roundness induced by RSL3. Intracellular calcium chelation by incubation with BAPTA-AM inhibited RSL3-induced calcium signals, which were not affected by extracellular calcium depletion. We propose that GPx4 inhibition activates IP3R-mediated calcium release in SH-SY5Y cells, leading to increased cytoplasmic and mitochondrial calcium levels, which, in turn, stimulate ROS production and induce lipid peroxidation and cell death in a noxious positive feedback cycle.

AB  - Cells sense and respond to various mechanical forces from the extracellular matrix primarily by modulating the actin cytoskeleton. Mechanical forces can be translated into biochemical signals in a process called mechanotransduction. Yes-associated protein (YAP) is an effector of Hippo signaling and a mediator of mechanotransduction, but how mechanical forces regulate Hippo signaling is still an open question. We propose that retinoic acid-induced protein 14 (RAI14) responds to mechanical forces and regulates Hippo signaling. RAI14 positively regulates the activity of YAP. RAI14 interacts with NF2, a key component of the Hippo pathway, and the interaction occurs on filamentous actin. When mechanical forces are kept low in cells, NF2 dissociates from RAI14 and filamentous actin, resulting in increased interactions with LATS1 and activation of the Hippo pathway. Clinical data show that tissue stiffness and expression of RAI14 and YAP are upregulated in tumor tissues and that RAI14 is strongly associated with adverse outcome in patients with gastric cancer. Our data suggest that RAI14 links mechanotransduction with Hippo signaling and mediates Hippo-related biological functions such as cancer progression.
   Cells sense and respond to mechanical forces primarily by modulating the actin cytoskeleton. Retinoic acid-induced protein 14 (RAI14) is responsive to extracellular mechanical forces, thereby regulating cell proliferation by modulating the Hippo signaling pathway.The positive regulation of YAP/TAZ activity by RAI14 is mainly mediated through NF2.Interactions between RAI14, NF2, and LATS, in response to ECM stiffness and F-actin integrity, regulate YAP/TAZ activity.RAI14 promotes cell proliferation in a Hippo signaling-dependent manner.The RAI14-Hippo signaling axis plays a pivotal role in gastric cancer progression.

AB  - Adult neural stem cells (NSCs) in the hippocampal dentate gyrus continuously proliferate and generate new neurons throughout life. Although various functions of organelles are closely related to the regulation of adult neurogenesis, the role of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-related molecules in this process remains largely unexplored. Here we show that Derlin-1, an ER-associated degradation component, spatiotemporally maintains adult hippocampal neurogenesis through a mechanism distinct from its established role as an ER quality controller. Derlin-1 deficiency in the mouse central nervous system leads to the ectopic localization of newborn neurons and impairs NSC transition from active to quiescent states, resulting in early depletion of hippocampal NSCs. As a result, Derlin-1-deficient mice exhibit phenotypes of increased seizure susceptibility and cognitive dysfunction. Reduced Stat5b expression is responsible for adult neurogenesis defects in Derlin-1-deficient NSCs. Inhibition of histone deacetylase activity effectively induces Stat5b expression and restores abnormal adult neurogenesis, resulting in improved seizure susceptibility and cognitive dysfunction in Derlin-1-deficient mice. Our findings indicate that the Derlin-1-Stat5b axis is indispensable for the homeostasis of adult hippocampal neurogenesis.

AB  - An ability to build structured mental maps of the world underpins our capacity to imagine relationships between objects that extend beyond experience. In rodents, such representations are supported by sequential place cell reactivations during rest, known as replay. Schizophrenia is proposed to reflect a compromise in structured mental representations, with animal models reporting abnormalities in hippocampal replay and associated ripple activity during rest. Here, utilizing magnetoencephalography (MEG), we tasked patients with schizophrenia and control participants to infer unobserved relationships between objects by reorganizing visual experiences containing these objects. During a post-task rest session, controls exhibited fast spontaneous neural reactivation of presented objects that replayed inferred relationships. Replay was coincident with increased ripple power in hippocampus. Patients showed both reduced replay and augmented ripple power relative to controls, convergent with findings in animal models. These abnormalities are linked to impairments in behavioral acquisition and subsequent neural representation of task structure.

AB  - Knowing where we are, where we have been, and where we are going is critical to many behaviors, including navigation and memory. One potential neuronal mechanism underlying this ability is phase precession, in which spatially tuned neurons represent sequences of positions by activating at progressively earlier phases of local network theta oscillations. Based on studies in rodents, researchers have hypothesized that phase precession may be a general neural pattern for representing sequential events for learning and memory. By recording human single-neuron activity during spatial navigation, we show that spatially tuned neurons in the human hippocampus and entorhinal cortex exhibit phase precession. Furthermore, beyond the neural representation of locations, we show evidence for phase precession related to specific goal states. Our findings thus extend theta phase precession to humans and suggest that this phenomenon has a broad functional role for the neural representation of both spatial and non-spatial information.

AB  - Background: Epilepsy is a neurological disorder defined by the occurrence of epileptic seizures, which can significantly affect children, often leading to learning and cognitive impairments. Microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system, are essential in clearing damaged neurons through phagocytosis. Notably, GAB(B)R-associated microglia have been implicated in regulating phagocytic activity. Since the phagocytic function of microglia is critical in the pathogenesis of epilepsy, this study aims to investigate the role of GAB(B)R-associated microglia in the development of the immature brain following epileptic seizures. Methods: Epilepsy was induced in a mouse model by the intraperitoneal injection of KA. Changes in the expression of the GAB(B)R-related gene, GAB(B)R2, in hippocampal microglia were analyzed using single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq). Cognitive and emotional changes in the mice were assessed through behavioral analyses. The expression of GAB(B)R2 was semi-quantitatively measured using Western blotting, quantitative reverse transcription PCR, and immunofluorescence. Additionally, the spatial relationship between GAB(B)R2 and hippocampal neurons was evaluated using Imaris software. Results: The snRNA-seq analysis revealed that GAB(B)R2 expression was elevated in activated microglia in the hippocampus during chronic epilepsy compared to the early phase of seizures. Behavioral assessments demonstrated heightened anxiety levels and learning and memory impairments in the chronic epilepsy group compared to the control group. GAB(B)R2 expression was upregulated in chronic epilepsy. Three-dimensional reconstruction analyses revealed a significantly increased contact volume between GAB(B)R-associated microglia and neurons in the chronic epilepsy group compared to the control group. Conclusions: GAB(B)R-associated microglia significantly contribute to the progression of immature brain diseases by promoting neuronal phagocytic activity.

AB  - Lambda light chains (lambda-LCs) are frequently responsible for triggering the activation of inflammatory factors in autoimmune disorders, and an increase in their levels will cause various pathological changes in serum. The aim of this study was to determine the histological differences between the epididymis and testis of normal and cryptorchid Bactrian camels and the differences in lambda-LC expression in the epididymis and testis of normal and cryptorchid Bactrian camels. Haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was used to examine the pathological changes in cryptorchidism. The gene and protein levels of lambda-LC were determined using RT-qPCR and western blot. The distribution of lambda-LCs was assessed by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. Compared with that in normal Bactrian camels, the diameter of the epididymal lumen and the thickness of the epithelium were decreased in the epididymis of cryptorchidic animals. Additionally, no sperm was detected in the cavity of the cryptorchidic epididymis. Meanwhile, the expression of lambda-LC was significantly increased in the cryptorchidic epididymis at both the mRNA and protein levels (p < .05). The highest protein expression of lambda-LC was found in epididymal epithelial halo cells and testicular Sertoli cells. These findings suggested that the structural changes observed in the epididymal epithelium of cryptorchidic camels affect its secretory and absorptive functions. Additionally, the high level of lambda-LC expression recorded in halo cells suggested that these cells play an important role in epithelial immunity in cryptorchidic Bactrian camels. Furthermore, the high lambda-LC expression levels detected in normal testicular Sertoli cells indicated that lambda-LCs may be involved in spermatogenesis. The results of this study provide clues for an in-depth study of immunological sterility in cryptorchidic Bactrian camels.

AB  - Solifenacin (Vesicare(R), SOL), known to be a member of isoquinolines, is a muscarinic antagonist that has anticholinergic effect, and it has been beneficial in treating urinary incontinence and neurogenic detrusor overactivity. However, the information regarding the effects of SOL on membrane ionic currents is largely uncertain, despite its clinically wide use in patients with those disorders. In this study, the whole-cell current recordings revealed that upon membrane depolarization in pituitary GH(3) cells, the exposure to SOL concentration-dependently increased the amplitude of M-type K+ current (I-K(M)) with effective EC50 value of 0.34 mu M. The activation time constant of I-K(M) was concurrently shortened in the SOL presence, hence yielding the K-D value of 0.55 mu M based on minimal reaction scheme. As cells were exposed to SOL, the steady-state activation curve of I-K(M) was shifted along the voltage axis to the left with no change in the gating charge of the current. Upon an isosceles-triangular ramp pulse, the hysteretic area of I-K(M) was increased by adding SOL. As cells were continually exposed to SOL, further application of acetylcholine (1 mu M) failed to modify SOL-stimulated I-K(M); however, subsequent addition of thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH, 1 mu M) was able to counteract SOL-induced increase in I-K(M) amplitude. In cell-attached single-channel current recordings, bath addition of SOL led to an increase in the activity of M-type K+ (K-M) channels with no change in the single channel conductance; the mean open time of the channel became lengthened. In whole-cell current-clamp recordings, the SOL application reduced the firing of action potentials (APs) in GH(3) cells; however, either subsequent addition of TRH or linopirdine was able to reverse SOL-mediated decrease in AP firing. In hippocampal mHippoE-14 neurons, the I-K(M) was also stimulated by adding SOL. Altogether, findings from this study disclosed for the first time the effectiveness of SOL in interacting with K-M channels and hence in stimulating I-K(M) in electrically excitable cells, and this noticeable action appears to be independent of its antagonistic activity on the canonical binding to muscarinic receptors expressed in GH(3) or mHippoE-14 cells.

AB  - The processing of sea buckthorn generates a significant amount of pomace, seeds and skin considered valuable sources of health-promoting macromolecules, such as carotenoids, pectin, flavonoids, phytosterols, polyunsaturated fatty acids and tocopherols. In this study, the bioactives from sea buckthorn pomace (SBP) were extracted using supercritical carbon dioxide (SFE-CO2), at different temperatures and pressures, allowing for obtaining four fractions according to separators (S40 and S45). The highest carotenoid content of 396.12 & PLUSMN; 1.02 mg/g D.W. was found in the S40 fraction, at extraction parameters of 35 & DEG;C/45 MPa, yielding an antioxidant activity of 32.10 & PLUSMN; 0.17 mMol TEAC/g D.W. The representative carotenoids in the extract were zeaxanthin, beta-carotene and lycopene, whereas all enriched SFE-CO2 extracts contained alpha-, beta- and delta-tocopherol, with alpha-tocopherol representing around 82% of all fractions. beta-sitosterol was the major phytosterol in the fractions derived from S45. All fractions contained significant fatty acids, with a predominance of linoleic acid. Remarkably, the enriched extracts showed a significant palmitoleic acid content, ranging from 53 to 65 mu g/g. S40 extracts showed a good antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Aeromonas hydrophila ATCC 7966, whereas S45 extracts showed a growth inhibition rate of 100% against Aspergillus niger after three days of growth. Our results are valuable, and they allow identifying the different profiles of extracts with many different applications in food, pharmaceutics, nutraceuticals and cosmeceuticals.

AB  - Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common, complex disease with poorly understood pathogenesis. Disruption of glucose metabolism is implicated in the pathogenesis of depression. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has been shown to regulate the activity of several kinases, including pAKT, p38MAPK, and mTOR, which are important signaling pathways in the treatment of depression. This study tested the hypothesis that rosiglitazone (RGZ) has an antidepressant impact on dexamethasone (DEXA)-induced depression by analyzing the function of the pAKT/p38MAPK/mTOR pathway and NGF through regulation of AMPK. MDD-like pathology was induced by subcutaneous administration of DEXA (20 mg/kg) for 21 days in all groups except in the normal control group, which received saline. To investigate the possible mechanism of RGZ, the protein expression of pAMPK, pAKT, p38MAPK, and 4EBP1 as well as the levels of hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, and NGF were assessed in prefrontal cortex and hippocampal samples. The activities of pAMPK and NGF increased after treatment with RGZ. The administration of RGZ also decreased the activity of mTOR as well as downregulating the downstream signaling pathways pAKT, p38MAPK, and 4EBP1. Here, we show that RGZ exerts a potent inhibitory effect on the pAKT/p38MAPK/mTOR/4EBP1 pathway and causes activation of NGF in brain cells. This study has provided sufficient evidence of the potential for RGZ to ameliorate DEXA-induced depression. A new insight has been introduced into the critical role of NGF activation in brain cells in depression. These results suggest that RGZ is a promising antidepressant for the treatment of MDD.

AB  - Hexadentate tris(3,4-hydroxypyridinone) ligands (THP) complex Fe3+ at very low iron concentrations and their high affinities for oxophilic trivalent metal ions have led to their development for new applications as bifunctional chelators for the radiometal gallium-68 (Ga-68). THP-peptide bioconjugates rapidly and quantitatively complex Ga-68 at room temperature, neutral pH, and micromolar ligand concentrations, making them amenable to kit-based radiosynthesis of Ga-68 PET radiopharmaceuticals. With the aim to produce an N-hydroxysuccinimide-(NHS)-THP reagent for kit-based Ga-68-labeling and PET imaging, THP-derivatives were designed and synthesized to exploit the advantages of NHS chemistry for coupling with peptides, proteins, and antibodies. The more stable five-carbon atoms linker product was selected for a proof-of-concept conjugation and radiolabeling study with an anti-programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) camelid single domain antibody (sdAb) under mild conditions and further evaluated for site-specific amide bond formation with a synthesized glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) targeting peptide using solid-phase synthesis. The obtained THP-GLP-1 conjugate was tested for its Ga-68 chelating ability, demonstrating to be a promising candidate for the detection and monitoring of GLP-1 aberrant malignancies. The obtained sdAb-THP conjugate was radiolabeled with Ga-68 under mild conditions, providing sufficient labeling yields after 5 min, demonstrating that the novel NHS-THP bifunctional chelator can be widely used to easily conjugate the THP moiety to different targeting molecules (e.g., antibodies, anticalins, or peptides) under mild conditions, paving the way to the synthesis of different imaging probes with all the advantages of THP radiochemistry.

AB  - BACKGROUNDThe therapeutic properties of Hippophae rhamnoides L. were known in Ancient Greece and in Tibetan and Mongolian medicine, which commonly used it for the treatment of heart ailments, rheumatism, and brain disorders. Modern studies have indicated that Hippophae rhamnoides L. polysaccharide (HRP) can improve cognitive impairment in mice with Alzheimer's disease (AD) but the specific mechanisms of the protective effect of HRP have not been elucidated fully. RESULTSOur results showed that Hippophae rhamnoides L. polysaccharide I (HRPI) improved pathological behaviors related to memory and cognition, and reduced (1)Beta-amyloid (A beta) peptide deposition and neuronal cell necrosis. Pretreatment with Hippophae rhamnoides L. polysaccharide I (HRPI) also decreased the level of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and Myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), and reduced the release of inflammatory factors Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) in the brains of mice with AD. Treatment with HRPI also suppressed the expression level of Recombinant Kelch Like ECH Associated Protein 1 (KEAP1), and increased the levels of Nuclear factor erythroid 2-Related Factor 2 (Nrf2), antioxidant enzymes Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and Glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) in the brains of AD mice. CONCLUSIONSOn the whole, these findings revealed that HRPI could improve the learning and memory ability and attenuate pathologic impairment in AD mice, and the underlying mechanisms may involve mediating oxidative stress and inflammation, possibly through the regulation of the Keap1/Nrf2 and TLR4/MyD88 signaling pathways.

AB  - According to Cisco's Internet Report 2020 white paper, there will be 29.3 billion connected devices worldwide by 2023, up from 18.4 billion in 2018. 5G connections will generate nearly three times more traffic than 4G connections. While bringing a boom to the network, it also presents unprecedented challenges in terms of flow forwarding decisions. The path assignment mechanism used in traditional traffic scheduling methods tends to cause local network congestion caused by the concentration of elephant flows, resulting in unbalanced network load and degraded quality of service. Using the centralized control of software-defined networks, this study proposes a data center traffic scheduling strategy for minimization congestion and quality of service guaranteeing (MCQG). The ideal transmission path is selected for data flows while considering the network congestion rate and quality of service. Different traffic scheduling strategies are used according to the characteristics of different service types in data centers. Reroute scheduling for elephant flows that tend to cause local congestion. The path evaluation function is formed by the maximum link utilization on the path, the number of elephant flows and the time delay, and the fast merit-seeking capability of the sparrow search algorithm is used to find the path with the lowest actual link overhead as the rerouting path for the elephant flows. It is used to reduce the possibility of local network congestion occurrence. Equal cost multi-path (ECMP) protocols with faster response time are used to schedule mouse flows with shorter duration. Used to guarantee the quality of service of the net-work. To achieve isolated transmission of various types of data streams. The experimental results show that the proposed strategy has higher throughput, better network load balancing, and better robustness compared to ECMP under different traffic models. In addition, because it can fully utilize the resources in the network, MCQG also outperforms another traffic scheduling strategy that does rerouting for elephant flows (namely Hedera). Compared with ECMP and Hedera, MCQG improves average throughput by 11.73% and 4.29%, and normalized total throughput by 6.74% and 2.64%, respectively; MCQG improves link utilization by 23.25% and 15.07%; in addition, the average round-trip delay and packet loss rate fluctuate significantly less than the two compared strategies.

AB  - High-methionine diets induce impaired learning and memory function, dementia-like neurodegeneration, and Alzheimer's disease, while low-methionine diets improve learning and memory function. We speculated that variations in intestinal microbiota may mediate these diametrically opposed effects; thus, this study aimed to verify this hypothesis. The ICR mice were fed either a low-methionine diet (LM, 0.17% methionine), normal methionine diet (NM, 0.86% methionine), or high-methionine diet (HM, 2.58% methionine) for 11 weeks. We found that HM diets damaged nonspatial recognition memory, working memory, and hippocampus-dependent spatial memory and induced anxiety-like behaviors in mice. LM diets improved nonspatial recognition memory and hippocampus-dependent spatial memory and ameliorated anxiety-like behavior, but the differences did not reach a significant level. Moreover, HM diets significantly decreased the abundance of putative short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria (Roseburia, Blautia, Faecalibaculum, and Bifidobacterium) and serotonin-producing bacteria (Turicibacter) and significantly increased the abundance of proinflammatory bacteria Escherichia-Shigella. Of note, LM diets reversed the results. Consequently, the SCFA and serotonin levels were significantly decreased with HM diets and significantly increased with LM diets. Furthermore, HM diets induced hippocampal oxidative stress and inflammation and selectively downregulated the hippocampus-dependent memory-related gene expression, whereas LM diets selectively upregulated the hippocampus-dependent memory-related gene expression. In conclusion, dietary methionine via dose-dependent inhibition of SCFA production capacity contributed to a potential risk of cognitive dysfunction in mice.

AB  - This study was to explore the effect of nanoparticles on the cognitive function, learning and memory ability (LMA) of Alzheimer's disease (AD) rats, and to analyze the changes on magnetic resonance (MR) image. Specifically, the TGN nanoparticles loading H102 (TGN-NP-H102) were prepared, and characterized first. The sprague-dawley (SD) rats were selected as the research subjects, and the AD model was constructed. They were divided into a Sham group (normal SD rats, group A), an AD model group (group B), an H102 group (treated with H102 drugs based on AD model, group C), and a TGN-NP-H102 group (treated with TGNNP-H102 nanoparticles based on AD model, group D). The changes in T2 value in hippocampal CA1 area (T2-CA1) were analyzed, and the changes in cognitive function and LMA were tested with the Morris water maze experiment (Morris experiment). The results revealed that, the average PS (APS) of TGN-NP-H102 nanoparticles was 122.9 +/- 2.8 nm, and its average Zeta potential (AZP) was -28.8 +/- 0.2 mV. In group A, the TGN-NP-H102 nanoparticles still remained in the brain tissue homogenate by 74.3 +/- 4.8% after 10 hours, and the drug-release rate was 53.2 +/- 3.2%. After 30 days of treatment, the T2-CA1 value of group D was lower (P < 0.05), and the average escape latency (AEL) and swimming distance in the Morris experiment were shorter versus group B (P < 0.05). It indicated that, the brain-targeted TGN-NP-H102 nanoparticles prepared could act on the hippocampus of AD rats, and improve their LMA.

AB  - Because children have little temporal exposure to environment and aging, most pediatric neurological diseases are inherent, i.e. genetic. Since postnatal neurons and astrocytes are mostly non-replicating, gene therapy and genome editing present enormous promise in child neurology. Unlike in other organs, which are highly permissive to adeno-associated viruses (AAV), the mature blood-brain barrier (BBB) greatly limits circulating AAV distribution to the brain. Intrathecal administration improves distribution but to no more than 20% of brain cells. Focused ultrasound (FUS) opens the BBB transiently and safely. In the present work we opened the hippocampal BBB and delivered a Cas9 gene via AAV9 intrathecally. This allowed brain first-pass, and subsequent vascular circulation and re-entry through the opened BBB. The mouse model used was of Lafora disease, a neuroinflammatory disease due to accumulations of misshapen overlong-branched glycogen. Cas9 was targeted to the gene of the glycogen branch-elongating enzyme glycogen synthase. We show that FUS dramatically (2000-fold) improved hippocampal Cas9 distribution and greatly reduced the pathogenic glycogen accumulations and hippocampal inflammation. FUS is in regular clinical use for other indications. Our work shows that it has the potential to vastly broaden gene delivery or editing along with clearance of corresponding pathologic basis of brain disease.

AB  - The aim of the present study is to investigate the phytochemical composition of tiger nut (TN) (Cyperus esculentus L.) and its neuroprotective potential in scopolamine (Scop)-induced cognitive impairment in rats. The UHPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS analysis enabled the putative annotation of 88 metabolites, such as saccharides, amino acids, organic acids, fatty acids, phenolic compounds and flavonoids. Treatment with TN extract restored Scop-induced learning and memory impairments. In parallel, TN extract succeeded in lowering amyloid beta, beta-secretase protein expression and acetylcholine esterase (AChE) activity in the hippocampus of rats. TN extract decreased malondialdehyde levels, restored antioxidant levels and reduced proinflammatory cytokines as well as the Bax/Bcl2 ratio. Histopathological analysis demonstrated marked neuroprotection in TN-treated groups. In conclusion, the present study reveals that TN extract attenuates Scop-induced memory impairments by diminishing amyloid beta aggregates, as well as its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-apoptotic and anti-AChE activities.

AB  - Although histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) is considered a therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease (AD), its role in cholinergic dysfunction in AD patients remains unclear. This study investigated the effects of (E)-3-(2-(4-fluorostyryl)thiazol-4-yl)-N-hydroxy- propanamide (4-FHA), a new synthetic HDAC6 inhibitor, on cognitive and memory impairments in a scopolamine-induced-AD mouse model. Behaviorally, 4-FHA improved scopolamine-induced memory impairments in the Y-maze, passive avoidance, and Morris water maze tests. In addition, 4-FHA ameliorated scopolamine-induced cognitive impairments in the novel object recognition and place recognition tests. Furthermore, 4-FHA increased acetylation of alpha-tubulin (a major HDAC6 substrate); the expression of BDNF; and the phosphorylation of ERK 1/2, CREB, and ChAT in the hippocampus of scopolamine-treated mice. In summary, according to our data 4-FHA, an HDAC6 inhibitor, improved the cognitive and memory deficits of the AD mouse model by normalizing BDNF signaling and synaptic transmission, suggesting that 4-FHA might be a potential therapeutic candidate forAD.

AB  - The incretin system is an emerging new field that might provide valuable contributions to the research of both the pathophysiology and therapeutic strategies in the treatment of diabetes, obesity, and neurodegenerative disorders. This study aimed to explore the roles of central glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) on cell metabolism and energy in the brain, as well as on the levels of these incretins, insulin, and glucose via inhibition of the central incretin receptors following intracerebroventricular administration of the respective antagonists in healthy rats and a streptozotocin-induced rat model of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (sAD). Chemical ablation of the central GIP receptor (GIPR) or GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) in healthy and diseased animals indicated a region-dependent role of incretins in brain cell energy and metabolism and central incretin-dependent modulation of peripheral hormone secretion, markedly after GIPR inhibition, as well as a dysregulation of the GLP-1 system in experimental sAD.

AB  - Hearing loss is associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer disease (AD). However, the mechanisms of hearing loss promoting the onset of AD are poorly understood. Here we show that hearing loss aggravates cognitive impairment in both wild-type mice and mouse models of AD. Embryonic growth/differentiation factor 1 (GDF1) is downregulated in the hippocampus of deaf mice. Knockdown of GDF1 mimics the detrimental effect of hearing loss on cognition, while overexpression of GDF1 in the hippocampus attenuates the cognitive impairment induced by deafness. Strikingly, overexpression of GDF1 also attenuates cognitive impairment in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. GDF1 activates Akt, which phosphorylates asparagine endopeptidase and inhibits asparagine endopeptidase-induced synaptic degeneration and amyloid-beta production. The expression of GDF1 is downregulated by the transcription factor CCAAT-enhancer binding protein-beta. These findings indicate that hearing loss could promote AD pathological changes by inhibiting the GDF1 signaling pathway; thus, GDF1 may represent a therapeutic target for AD.
   Pan et al. demonstrate that hearing loss promotes cognitive decline in an APP/PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer disease via inhibition of the GDF1 signaling pathway, unveiling GDF1 as a therapeutic target for Alzheimer disease.

AB  - Atherosclerosis is a persistent inflammatory disorder influenced by oxidative stress and lipid imbalances, and it continues to be a major contributor to cardiovascular diseases. Rich in catechins and flavonoids, green tea pressurized hot water extract (GPHWE) demonstrated potent antioxidant activity through DPPH, ABTS, hydroxyl, and nitric oxide scavenging assays. In vitro, GPHWE protected RAW264.7 macrophages from oxidized LDL (Ox-LDL)-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis by mitigating oxidative stress and enhancing cell survival. Animal studies using mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) revealed notable improvements in lipid profiles, including decreases in total cholesterol, LDL, the atherosclerosis index (AI), the coronary risk index (CRI), and triglycerides, as well as lower levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), an indicator of oxidative stress. These results were comparable to those achieved with Simvastatin. Molecular docking studies indicated strong binding affinities of catechins to essential targets such as LOX-1, HMG-CoA reductase, caspase-3, and Nrf2, implying that the mechanisms of GPHWE involve antioxidant properties, regulation of lipids, and stabilization of plaques. The catechins of GPHWE, including epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), epicatechin gallate (ECG), and epigallocatechin (EGC), were tentatively identified through qualitative analysis performed by UHPLC-QTOF-MS. This comprehensive approach positions GPHWE as a promising natural remedy for preventing atherosclerosis and reducing cardiovascular risk.

AB  - The Hippo signalling pathway has been considered as potential therapeutic target in self-renewal and differentiation of stem and progenitor cells. Thus, mammalian Ste20-like kinase 1/2 (MST1/2) as the core serine-threonine kinases in the Hippo signalling pathway has been investigated for its role in immunological disease. However, little information of MST1/2 function in bone marrow suppression induced by ionizing radiation was fully investigated. Here, we reported that MST1/2 inhibitor XMU-MP-1 could rescue the impaired haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and progenitor cells (HPCs) function under oxidative stress condition. Also, XMU-MP-1 pretreatment markedly alleviated the small intestinal system injury caused by the total body irradiation 9 Gy and extended the average survival days of the mice exposed to the lethal dose radiation. Therefore, irradiation exposure causes the serious pathological changes of haematopoietic and intestinal system, and XMU-MP-1 could prevent the ROS production, the haematopoietic cells impairment and the intestinal injury. These detrimental effects may be associated with regulating NOX/ROS/P38MARK pathway by MST1/2.

AB  - Stress breaks body balance, which can cause diverse physiological disorders and worsen preexisting diseases. However, recent studies have reported that controllable stress and overcoming from stress reinforce resilience to resist against more intense stress afterwards. In this study, we investigated the protective effect of corticosterone (CORT), a representative stress hormone against hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced neuronal cell death and its underlying molecular mechanism in SH-SY5Y cells, a human neuroblastoma cell line. The decreased cell viability by H2O2 was effectively restored by the pretreatment with low concentration of CORT (0.03 mu M for 72 h) in the cells. H2O2-increased expression of apoptotic markers such as PUMA and Bim was decreased by CORT pretreatment. Furthermore, pretreatment of CORT attenuated H2O2-mediated oxidative damages by upregulation of antioxidant enzymes via activation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). These findings suggest that low concentration of CORT with eustressed condition enhances intracellular self-defense against H2O2-mediated oxidative cell death, suggesting a role of low concentration of CORT as one of key molecules for resilience and neuronal cell survival.

AB  - Cocaine, one of the most abused drugs worldwide, is capable of activating microglia in vitro and in vivo. Several neuroimmune pathways have been suggested to play roles in cocaine-mediated microglial activation. Previous work showed that cocaine activates microglia in a region-specific manner in the brains of self-administered mice. To further characterize the effects of cocaine on microglia and neuroimmune signaling in vivo, we utilized the brains from both sexes of outbred rats with cocaine self-administration to explore the activation status of microglia, NOD-, LRR-, and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activity, corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) signaling, and NF-& kappa;B levels in the striatum and hippocampus (HP). Age-matched rats of the same sex (drug naive) served as controls. Our results showed that cocaine increased neuroinflammation in the striatum and HP of both sexes with a relatively higher increases in male brains. In the striatum, cocaine upregulated NLRP3 inflammasome activity and CRF levels in males but not in females. In contrast, cocaine increased NLRP3 inflammasome activity in the HP of females but not in males, and no effects on CRF signaling were observed in this region of either sex. Interestingly, cocaine increased NF-& kappa;B levels in the striatum and HP with no sex difference. Taken together, our results provide evidence that cocaine can exert region- and sex-specific differences in neuroimmune signaling in the brain. Targeting neuroimmune signaling has been suggested as possible treatment for cocaine use disorders (CUDs). Our current results indicate that sex should be taken into consideration when determining the efficacy of these new therapeutic approaches.

All complexes have been characterized using different spectroscopic methods, viz. IR, UV-Vis, circular dichroism, one- (1H, 51V) and two-dimensional (COSY, NOESY) NMR spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. Furthermore, the catalytic ability of all compounds in the epoxidation of styrene, cyclohexene, and its naturally occurring monoterpene derivatives, i.e., S(-)-limonene and (-)-alpha-pinene has also been studied, using two different oxidants, i.e., aqueous 30% H2O2 or tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP). In addition, the biological properties of these chiral oxidovanadium(V) compounds, but also cis-dioxidomolybdenum(VI) complexes with the same chiral Schiff bases, were studied. Their cytotoxic and cytoprotective activity studies with the HT-22 hippocampal neuronal cells revealed a concentration-dependent effect in the range of 10-100 mu M. Moreover, vanadium(V) complexes, in contrast to cis-dioxidomolybdenum(VI) compounds, demonstrated higher cytotoxicity and lack of cytoprotective ability against H2O2-induced cytotoxicity.

AB  - Nasal polyps (NPs) are usually part of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP). However, the exact etiology of CRSwNP is still unknown. In addition, the suggested etiological causes are infection, allergy, and immunological disorders, among others, such as genetic predisposition. Moreover, it is also suggested that oxygen-free radicals play a vital role in the pathogenesis of nasal polyposis, and inflammatory cells produce free radicals during phagocytosis, which is the primary source of ROS, controlled by the glutathione S-transferase (GST) system. Although, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays an important role in angiogenesis, it is closely interwoven with the mobilization of inflammatory cells. This pilot study evaluated the association between genetic variant VEGF-A (rs28357093) and GSTM1/GSTT1 deletion polymorphism in susceptibility to CRSwNP. A case-control study was conducted with 61 individuals diagnosed with CRSwNP and 100 healthy subjects. VEGF-A (rs28357093) and GSTM1/GSTT1 deletion polymorphisms were genotyped by RFLP-PCR and SYBR Green real-time PCR, respectively. Individuals with allergic rhinitis carriers with AC genotype (rs28357093) presented a 4-fold increased risk to CRSwNP (OR = 4.20, 95% CI = 1.31 to 13.50; p = 0.015). This evidence shows that the increased vascular permeability probably causes an inflamed nasal area leading to extensive edema and polyp growth. On the other hand, no association was verified for each genetic variant by inheritance models. Interestingly, the GSTT1 present genotype showed a protective effect on CRSwNP. In conclusion, additional studies that have larger groups in different geographic localizations may be useful to verify and assess the association between genetic variants and CRSwNP.

AB  - Vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) is the second leading cause of dementia. There is currently no effective treatment for VCID. Resveratrol (RSV) is considered an antioxidant; however, our group has observed pleiotropic effects in stroke paradigms, suggesting more effects may contribute to mechanistic changes beyond antioxidative properties. The main goal of this study was to investigate if administering RSV twice a week could alleviate cognitive declines following the induction of a VCID model. Additionally, our aim was to further describe whether this treatment regimen could decrease cell death in brain areas vulnerable to changes in cerebral blood flow, such as the hippocampus and medial septum. We hypothesized RSV treatments in a mouse model of gradual cerebral hypoperfusion protect against cognitive impairment. We utilized gradual bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (GBCCAS) via the surgical implantation of ameroid constrictor devices. RSV treatment was administered on the day of implantation and twice a week thereafter. Cerebral perfusion was measured by laser speckle contrast imaging, and cognitive functions, including the recognition memory, the spatial working memory, and associative learning, were assessed by novel object recognition (NOR), Y-maze testing, and contextual fear conditioning (CFC), respectively. RSV treatment did not alleviate cerebral perfusion deficits but mitigated cognitive deficits in CFC and NOR after GBCCAS. Despite these deficits, no hippocampal pathology was observed; however, cholinergic cell loss in the medial septum was significantly increased after GBCCAS. This cholinergic cell loss was mitigated by RSV. This study describes a novel mechanism by which chronic RSV treatments protect against a VCID-induced cognitive decline through the preservation of cholinergic cell viability to improve memory performance.

AB  - Diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP), an organophosphate nerve agent (OPNA), exposure causes status epilepticus (SE) and epileptogenesis. In this study, we tested the protective effects of saracatinib (AZD0530), a Src kinase inhibitor, in mixed-sex or male-only Sprague Dawley rats exposed to 4-5 mg/kg DFP followed by 2 mg/kg atropine and 25 mg/kg 2-pralidoxime. Midazolam (3 mg/kg) was given to the mixed-sex cohort (1 h post-DFP) and male-only cohort (~30 min post-DFP). Saracatinib (20 mg/kg, oral, daily for 7 days) or vehicle was given two hours later and euthanized eight days or ten weeks post-DFP. Brain immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed increased microgliosis, astrogliosis, and neurodegeneration in DFP-treated animals. In the 10-week post-DFP male-only group, there were no significant differences between groups in the novel object recognition, Morris water maze, rotarod, or forced swim test. Brain IHC revealed significant mitigation by saracatinib in contrast to vehicle-treated DFP animals in microgliosis, astrogliosis, neurodegeneration, and nitro-oxidative stressors, such as inducible nitric oxide synthase, GP91(phox), and 3-Nitrotyrosine. These findings suggest the protective effects of saracatinib on brain pathology seem to depend on the initial SE severity. Further studies on dose optimization, including extended treatment regimen depending on the SE severity, are required to determine its disease-modifying potential in OPNA models.

AB  - Kynurenic acid (KYNA) is an endogenous tryptophan (Trp) metabolite known to possess neuroprotective property. KYNA plays critical roles in nociception, neurodegeneration, and neuroinflammation. A lower level of KYNA is observed in patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases or psychiatric disorders such as depression and autism spectrum disorders, whereas a higher level of KYNA is associated with the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Little is known about the optimal concentration for neuroprotection and the threshold for neurotoxicity. In this study the effects of KYNA on memory functions were investigated by passive avoidance test in mice. Six different doses of KYNA were administered intracerebroven-tricularly to previously trained CFLP mice and they were observed for 24 h. High doses of KYNA (i.e., 20-40 mu g/2 mu L) significantly decreased the avoidance latency, whereas a low dose of KYNA (0.5 mu g/2 mu L) significantly elevated it compared with controls, suggesting that the low dose of KYNA enhanced memory function. Furthermore, six different receptor blockers were applied to reveal the mechanisms underlying the memory enhancement induced by KYNA. The series of tests revealed the possible involvement of the serotonergic, dopaminergic, alpha and beta adrenergic, and opiate systems in the nootropic effect. This study confirmed that a low dose of KYNA improved a memory component of cognitive domain, which was mediated by, at least in part, four systems of neurotransmission in an animal model of learning and memory.

AB  - "Frailty" caused by a decline in physiological reserve capacity, chronic inflammation, and oxidative stress in the elderly has recently become a major social issue. The present study examined the effects of the peel of Citrus kawachiensis (CK), which exhibits anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and pro-neurogenesis activities in frailty-like model mice. Male C57BL/6 mice (15 weeks old) were fed an 18% protein diet (CON), a 2.5% protein diet (PM), and PM mixed with 1% dried CK peel powder for approximately 1 month. Mice were euthanized 2 or 8 days after a single intraperitoneal administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and tissues were dissected. Among peripheral tissues, muscle weight, liver weight, and blood glucose levels were significantly higher in the PM-LPS-CK group than in the PM-LPS group. In the behavioral analysis, locomotive activity was significantly lower in the PM-LPS group than in the PM group. The reduction in locomotive activity in the PM-LPS-CK group was significantly smaller than that in the PM-LPS group. The quantification of microglia in the hippocampal stratum lacunosum-moleculare revealed that increases in the PM-LPS group were significantly suppressed by the dried CK peel powder. Furthermore, the quantification of synaptic vesicle membrane proteins in the hippocampal CA3 region showed down-regulated expression in the PM-LPS group, which was significantly ameliorated by the administration of the dried CK peel powder. Collectively, these results suggest that CK inhibits inflammation and oxidative stress induced by PM and LPS in the central nervous system and peripheral tissue. Therefore, C. kawachiensis is highly effective against "frailty".

AB  - Light pollution is one of the most serious public problems, especially the night light. However, the effect of dim blue light at night (dLAN-BL) on cognitive function is unclear. In this study, we evaluated the effects of exposure to dLAN-BL in C57BL/6J mice for 4 consecutive weeks. Our results showed dLAN-BL significantly impaired spatial learning and memory and increased plasma corticosterone level in mice. Consistent with these changes, we observed dLAN-BL significantly increased the numbers and activation of microglia and the levels of oxidative stress product MDA in the hippocampus, decreased the levels of antioxidant enzymes Glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), Superoxide dismutase (SOD), Gluathione reductase (Gsr), total antioxidants (T-AOC) and the number of neurons in the hippocampus, up-regulated the mRNA expression levels of IL6, TNF-alpha and the protein expression levels of iNOS, COX2, TLR4, p-p65, Cleaved-Caspase3 and BAX, and down-regulated the mRNA expression levels of IL4, IL10, Psd95, Snap25, Sirt1, Dcx and the protein expression level of BCL2. In vitro results further showed corticosterone (10uM)-induced BV2 cell activation and up-regulated content of IL6, TNF-alpha in the cell supernatant and the protein expression levels of iNOS, COX2, p-p65 in BV2 cells. Our findings suggested dLAN-BL up-regulated plasma corticosterone level and hippocampal microglia activation, which in turn caused oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, leading to neuronal loss and synaptic dysfunction, ultimately leading to spatial learning and memory dysfunction in mice.

AB  - As a medicinal and edible resource, Hippophae rhamnoides Linn. subsp. sinensis Rousi is rich in bioactive secondary metabolites, including flavonoids and their derivatives, which offer protective effects against oxidative damage. This study reported the isolation of three new kaempferol derivatives from the seed residue of H. rhamnoides - Hippophandine A, B, and C (compounds 1-3). Their structures were elucidated by high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HR-ESI-MS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and chemical analyses. The compounds were evaluated for their ability to mitigate hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced cell death in SH-SY5Y cells. The results elucidated that Hippophandine A-C at concentrations of 1, 5, and 10 mu M reduced the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and increased the activity of antioxidative enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH), and catalase (CAT). Furthermore, they significantly altered the protein expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and its downstream heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), which is an indicator of redox detection in H2O2-induced SH-SY5Y.

AB  - Dendropanax morbifera leaves (DML) have long been used as traditional medicine to treat diverse symptoms in Korea. Ethyl acetate-soluble extracts of DML (DMLE) rescued HT22 mouse hippocampal neuronal cells from glutamate (Glu)-induced oxidative cell death; however, the protective compounds and mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we aimed to identify the neuroprotective ingredients and mechanisms of DMLE in the Glu-HT22 cell model. Five antioxidant compounds were isolated from DMLE and characterized as chlorogenic acid, hyperoside, isoquercitrin, quercetin, and rutin by spectroscopic methods. Isoquercitrin and quercetin significantly inhibited Glu-induced oxidative cell death by restoring intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and mitochondrial superoxide generation, Ca2+ dysregulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and nuclear translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor. These two compounds significantly increased the expression levels of nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) in the presence or absence of Glu treatment. Combinatorial treatment of the five compounds based on the equivalent concentrations in DMLE showed that significant protection was found only in the cells cotreated with isoquercitrin and quercetin, both of whom showed prominent synergism, as assessed by drug-drug interaction analysis. These findings suggest that isoquercitrin and quercetin are the active principles representing the protective effects of DMLE, and these effects were mediated by the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway.

AB  - Protein aggregates of cofilin and actin have been found in neurons under oxygen-glucose deprivation. However, the regulatory mechanism behind the expression of Cfl1 during oxygen-glucose deprivation remains unclear. Here, we found that heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNP) Q and hnRNP A1 regulate the translation of Cfl1 mRNA, and formation of cofilin-actin aggregates. The interaction between hnRNP A1 and Cfl1 mRNA was interrupted by hnRNP Q under normal conditions, while the changes in the expression and localization of hnRNP Q and hnRNP A1 increased such interaction, as did the translation of Cfl1 mRNA under oxygen-glucose deprived conditions. These findings reveal a new translational regulatory mechanism of Cfl1 mRNA in hippocampal neurons under oxygen-glucose deprivation.

AB  - Neuronal culture was used to investigate neuronal function in physiological and pathological conditions. Despite its inevitability, primary neuronal culture remained a gold standard method that requires laborious preparation, intensive training, and animal resources. To circumvent the shortfalls of primary neuronal preparations and efficiently give rise to functional neurons, we combine a neural stem cell culture method with a direct cell type-conversion approach. The lucidity of this method enables the efficient preparation of functional neurons from mouse neural progenitor cells on demand. We demonstrate that induced neurons (NPC-iNs) by this method make synaptic connections, elicit neuronal activity-dependent cellular responses, and develop functional neuronal networks. This method will provide a concise platform for functional neuronal assessments. This indeed offers a perspective for using these characterized neuronal networks for investigating plasticity mechanisms, drug screening assays, and probing the molecular and biophysical basis of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Hyperbilirubinaemia is a prevalent condition during the neonatal period, and if not promptly and effectively managed, it can lead to severe bilirubin-induced neurotoxicity. Sunflower seeds are a nutrient-rich food source, particularly abundant in linoleic acid. Here, we provide compelling evidence that lactating maternal mice fed a sunflower seed diet experience enhanced neurological outcomes and increased survival rates in hyperbilirubinemic offspring. We assessed histomorphological indices, including cerebellar Nissl staining, and Calbindin staining, and hippocampal hematoxylin and eosin staining. Furthermore, we observed the transmission of linoleic acid, enriched in sunflower seeds, to offspring through lactation. The oral administration of linoleic acid-rich sunflower seed oil by lactating mothers significantly prolonged the survival time of hyperbilirubinemic offspring mice. Mechanistically, linoleic acid counteracts the bilirubin-induced accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and neuronal cell death by activating autophagy. Collectively, these findings elucidate the novel role of a maternal linoleic acid-supplemented diet in promoting child health.

AB  - As photoautotrophic organisms, plants produce an incredible spectrum of pigments, anti-herbivory compounds, structural materials and energic intermediates. These biosynthetic routes help plants grow, reproduce and mitigate stress. HEXOKINASE1 (HXK1), a metabolic enzyme and glucose sensor, catalyzes the phosphorylation of hexoses, a key introductory step for many of these pathways. However, previous studies have largely focused on the glucose sensing and signaling functions of HXK1, and the importance of the enzyme's catalytic function is only recently being connected to plant development. In this brief Spotlight, we describe the developmental significance of plant HXK1 and its role in plant metabolic pathways, specifically in glucose-6-phosphate production. Furthermore, we describe the emerging connections between metabolism and development and suggest that HXK1 signaling and catalytic activity regulate discrete areas of plant development.

AB  - As a common malignant tumor, colorectal cancer (CRC) has a high incidence. Recent investigations have suggested that although great improvement has been achieved in the survival rate of early-stage CRC patients, the overall survival rate remains low. Mounting reports have proved that lncRNAs take part in the development of various cancers and possess the regulatory functions in cancers. For example, ASB16 antisense RNA 1 (ASB16-AS1) is a poorly researched novel lncRNA whose specific functions in CRC are still unknown. In our research, we discovered that ASB16-AS1 was with high expression in CRC cells. In addition, ASB16-AS1 silencing restrained the proliferation, migration, invasion, and stemness while accelerating cell apoptosis of CRC cells. Mechanism experiments were applied to explore the regulatory mechanism of ASB16-AS1. It turned out that miR-185-5p could interact with ASB16-AS1 and inhibited the progression of CRC cells. TEAD1 (TEA domain transcription factor1) - a major effector of the Hippo signaling was proved to serve as the target of miR-185-5p and promote CRC development. In short, ASB16-AS1 drove the progression of CRC through the regulation of miR-185-5p/TEAD1 axis.

AB  - In the adult mammalian brain, neural stem cells (NSCs) located in highly restricted niches sustain the generation of new neurons that integrate into existing circuits. A reduction in adult neurogenesis is linked to ageing and neurodegeneration, whereas dysregulation of proliferation and survival of NSCs have been hypothesized to be at the origin of glioma. Thus, unravelling the molecular underpinnings of the regulated activation that NSCs must undergo to proliferate and generate new progeny is of considerable relevance. Current research has identified cues promoting or restraining NSCs activation. Yet, whether NSCs depend on external signals to survive or if intrinsic factors establish a threshold for sustaining their viability remains elusive, even if this knowledge could involve potential for devising novel therapeutic strategies. Kidins220 (Kinase D-interacting substrate of 220 kDa) is an essential effector of crucial pathways for neuronal survival and differentiation. It is dramatically altered in cancer and in neurological and neurodegenerative disorders, emerging as a regulatory molecule with important functions in human disease. Herein, we discover severe neurogenic deficits and hippocampal-based spatial memory defects accompanied by increased neuroblast death and high loss of newly formed neurons in Kidins220 deficient mice. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that Kidins220-dependent activation of AKT in response to EGF restraints GSK3 activity preventing NSCs apoptosis. We also show that NSCs with Kidins220 can survive with lower concentrations of EGF than the ones lacking this molecule. Hence, Kidins220 levels set a molecular threshold for survival in response to mitogens, allowing adult NSCs growth and expansion. Our study identifies Kidins220 as a key player for sensing the availability of growth factors to sustain adult neurogenesis, uncovering a molecular link that may help paving the way towards neurorepair.

AB  - Chronic pain is one of the most significant medical problems throughout the world. Recent evidence has confirmed the hippocampus as an active modulator of pain chronicity, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Using in vivo electrophysiology, we identify a neural ensemble in the ventral hippocampal CA1 (vCA1) that shows inhibitory responses to noxious but not innocuous stimuli. Following peripheral inflammation, this ensemble becomes responsive to innocuous stimuli, representing hypersensitivity. Mimicking the inhibition of vCA1 neurons using chemogenetics induces chronic pain-like behaviors in naive mice, whereas activating vCA1 neurons in mice with peripheral inflammation results in a reduction of pain -related behaviors. Pathway-specific manipulation of vCA1 projections to basolateral amygdala (BLA) and infralimbic cortex (IL) shows that these pathways are differentially involved in pain modulation at different temporal stages of chronic inflammatory pain. These results confirm a crucial role of the vCA1 and its circuits in modulating the development of chronic pain.

AB  - Cocaine use is a major comorbidity of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). In this study, we show that cocaine exposure worsens the learning and memory of doxycycline-inducible and brain-specific HIV Tat transgenic mice (iTat) and results in 14,838 hypermethylated CpG-related differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and 15,800 hypomethylated CpG-related DMRs, which are linked to 52 down-and 127 upregulated genes, respectively, in the hippocampus of iTat mice. These genes are mostly enriched at the neuronal function-, cell morphology-, and synapse formation-related extracellular matrix (ECM) receptor-ligand interaction pathway and mostly impacted in microglia. The accompanying neuropathological changes include swollen dendritic spines, increased synaptophysin expression, and diminished glial activation. We also find that sex (female) and age additively worsen the behavioral and pathological changes. These findings together indicate that chronic cocaine and long-term Tat expression interactively contribute to HAND, likely involving changes of DNA methylation and ECM receptor-ligand interactions.

AB  - Malignant transformation of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) is correlated with poor prognosis; however, the underlying biological mechanism is not well understood. In the present study, low-risk (LR) GISTs, GISTs categorized as high-risk based on tumor size (HBS), and on mitotic rate (HBM) were collected for RNA sequencing. Candidate hub lncRNAs were selected by Oncomine analysis. Expression of a selected hub lncRNA, DNM3OS, and its correlation with patients' prognosis were analyzed using FISH staining, followed with the determination of function and underlying mechanism. Our results revealed a series of key pathways and hub lncRNAs involved in the malignant transformation of GISTs. Oncomine analysis revealed a tight association between clinical signatures and DNM3OS and suggested that DNM3OS is a hub lncRNA that is involved in the Hippo signaling pathway. In addition, DNM3OS was upregulated in HBS, HBM, and HBS/M GIST and correlated with worse prognosis in patients with GISTs. In addition, DNM3OS promoted GIST cell proliferation and mitosis by regulating the expression of GLUT4 and CD36. Collectively, these results improve our understanding of the malignant transformation of GISTs and unveil a series of hub lncRNAs in GISTs.

AB  - BackgroundDown syndrome (DS), the most frequently occurring human chromosomal disorder, is caused by trisomy 21. The exact molecular effects of trisomy on certain cell populations in the brain remain poorly understood.ObjectiveThe purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of trisomy on the transcriptomes of various types of neurons and nonneuronal cells in the hippocampus.MethodsA total of 8993 nuclei from the WT and 6445 nuclei from the Dp16 hippocampus were analyzed by single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq). Cell clustering was achieved by the Seurat program.ResultsHippocampal cells were grouped into multiple neuronal and nonneuronal populations. Only a limited number of trisomic genes were upregulated (q < 0.001) over 1.25-fold in a specific type of hippocampal cell. Specifically, deregulation of genes associated with synaptic signaling and organization was observed in multiple cell populations, including excitatory neurons, oligodendrocytes, and microglia. This observation suggests the potential importance of synapse deficits in DS. Interestingly, GO annotation of the upregulated genes suggested potential activation of the immune system by hippocampal excitatory neurons. Fewer trisomic genes were altered in nonneuronal cells than in neurons. Notably, microglial transcriptome analysis revealed significantly (q < 0.001) increased expression of C1qb and C1qc, which suggested potential involvement of complement-mediated synapse loss mediated by microglia in DS.ConclusionThe trisomy-related hippocampal deficits should be driven by a small amount, not all, of the trisomic genes in a specific type of cell. Our work may help to narrow down both the molecular and cellular targets for future gene therapies in DS.

AB  - Maintaining periodontal and peri-implant soft tissues health is crucial for the long-term health of teeth and dental implants. New biomedical strategies aimed at avoiding connective tissue alterations and related diseases (e.g., periodontitis and peri-implantitis) are constantly evolving. Among these, collagen-based medical products have proven to be safe and effective. Accordingly, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of Dental SKIN BioRegulation (Guna S.p.a., Milan, Italy), a new injectable medical device composed of type I collagen of porcine origin, on primary cultures of human gingival fibroblasts (hGF). To this end, hGF were cultured on collagen-coated (COL, 100 mu g/2 mL) or uncoated plates (CTRL) before evaluating cell viability (24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 7 d), wound healing properties (3 h, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, and 48 h), and the activation of mechanotransduction markers, such as FAK, YAP, and TAZ (48 h). The results proved a significant increase in cell viability at 48 h (p < 0.05) and wound closure at 24 h (p < 0.001) of hGF grown on COL, with an increasing trend at all time-points. Furthermore, COL significantly induced the expression of FAK and YAP/TAZ (p < 0.05), thereby promoting the activation of mechanotransduction signaling pathways. Overall, these data suggest that COL, acting as a mechanical bio-scaffold, could represent a useful treatment for gingival rejuvenation and may possibly help in the resolution of oral pathologies.

AB  - BackgroundSarcoglycanopathies are muscle dystrophies caused by mutations in the genes encoding sarcoglycans (alpha, beta, gamma, and delta) that can destabilize the dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex at the sarcolemma, leaving muscle fibers vulnerable to damage after contraction, followed by inflammatory and fibrotic responses and resulting in muscle weakness and atrophy. Two signaling pathways have been implicated in fibrosis and inflammation in various tissues: autotaxin/lysophosphatidic acid (ATX-LPA) and yes-associated protein 1/transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (YAP/TAZ). LPA, synthesized by ATX, can act as a pleiotropic molecule due to its multiple receptors. Two Hippo pathway effectors, YAP/TAZ, can be dephosphorylated by LPA and translocated to the nucleus. They induce several target genes, such as CCN2/CTGF, involved in fibrosis and inflammation. However, no detailed characterization of these processes or whether these pathways change early in the development of sarcoglycanopathy has been evaluated in skeletal muscle.MethodsUsing the delta-sarcoglycan knockout mouse model (Sgcd-/-), we investigated components of these pathways, inflammatory and fibrotic markers, and contractile properties of different skeletal muscles (triceps-TR, gastrocnemius-GST, diaphragm-DFG, tibialis anterior-TA, and extensor digitorum longus-EDL) at one and two months of age.ResultsWe found that Sgcd-/- mice show early dystrophic features (fiber damage/necrosis, centrally nucleated fibers, inflammatory infiltrate, and regenerated fibers) followed by later fiber size reduction in TR, GST, and DFG. These changes are concomitant with an early inflammatory and fibrotic response in these muscles. Sgcd-/- mice also have early impaired force generation in the TA and EDL, and resistance to mechanical damage in the EDL. In addition, an early dysregulation of the ATX-LPA axis and the YAP/TAZ signaling pathway in the TR, GST, and DFG was observed in these mice.ConclusionsThe ATX-LPA axis and the YAP/TAZ signaling pathway, which are involved in inflammation and fibrosis, are dysregulated in skeletal muscle from an early age in Sgcd-/- mice. These changes are concomitant with a fibrotic and inflammatory response in these mice. Unraveling the role of the LPA axis and YAP/TAZ in sarcoglycanopathy holds great promise for improving our understanding of disease pathogenesis and identifying novel therapeutic targets for this currently incurable group of muscle disorders.

AB  - Cd99 molecule-like 2 (Cd99l2) is a type I transmembrane protein that plays a role in the transmigration of leukocytes across vascular endothelial cells. Despite its high expression in the brain, the role of Cd99l2 remains elusive. We find that Cd99l2 is expressed primarily in neurons and positively regulates neurite outgrowth and the development of excitatory synapses. We demonstrate that Cd99l2 inversely regulates the expression of immediate-early genes (IEGs), including Arc, Egr1, and c-Fos, by inhibiting the activity of the transcription factors CREB and SRF. Neuronal inactivation increases the transport of Cd99l2 to the cell surface from recycling endosomes, thereby enhancing Cd99l2-mediated inhibitory signaling. Additionally, Cd99l2 knockout mice exhibit impaired excitatory synaptic transmission and plasticity in the hippocampus, along with deficits in spatial memory and contextual fear conditioning. Based on these findings, we propose that neuronal Cd99l2 functions as a synaptic cell adhesion molecule that inversely controls neuronal activation.

AB  - A nearly complete frontal bone of a racerunner lizard (Lacertidae: Eremias) is described from the Lower Pleistocene deposits of the Taurida cave - a famous site of fossil vertebrate fauna in Crimea, north Black Sea region. A comparative study of the frontals in the genus Eremias by micro-CT highlighted a few diagnostic features and suggested that the Eremias from the Taurida cave cannot be attributed to any modern species, including Eremias arguta, which inhabited Crimea currently. The specimen from the Taurida cave represents the first Early Pleistocene record of the genus and the oldest European record of the genus to date. Our data suggests that Eremias dispersed into Crimea already in the Early Pleistocene, not in the Holocene as was suggested earlier. The past range of Eremias in Crimea was wider than today and included midland areas. This record extends the distribution range of Eremias during the Pleistocene.

AB  - Disruption of retromer-dependent endosomal trafficking is considered pathogenic in late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, to investigate this disruption in the intact brain, we turn to a genetic mouse model where the retromer core protein VPS35 is depleted in hippocampal neurons, and then we replete VPS35 using an optimized viral vector protocol. The VPS35 depletion-repletion studies strengthen the causal link between the neuronal retromer and AD-associated neuronal phenotypes, including the acceleration of amyloid precursor protein cleavage and the loss of synaptic glutamate receptors. Moreover, the studies show that the neuronal retromer can regulate a distinct, dystrophic, microglia morphology, phenotypic of hippocampal microglia in AD. Finally, the neuronal and, in part, the microglia responses to VPS35 depletion were found to occur independent of tau. Showing that the neuronal retromer can regulate AD-associated pathologies in two of AD's principal cell types strengthens the link, and clarifies the mechanism, between endosomal trafficking and late-onset sporadic AD.

AB  - Heavy metals are both integral parts of cells and environmental toxicants, and their deregulation is associated with severe cellular dysfunction and various diseases. Here we show that the Hippo pathway plays a critical role in regulating heavy metal homeostasis. Hippo signalling deficiency promotes the transcription of heavy metal response genes and protects cells from heavy metal-induced toxicity, a process independent of its classic downstream effectors YAP and TAZ. Mechanistically, the Hippo pathway kinase LATS phosphorylates and inhibits MTF1, an essential transcription factor in the heavy metal response, resulting in the loss of heavy metal response gene transcription and cellular protection. Moreover, LATS activity is inhibited following heavy metal treatment, where accumulated zinc directly binds and inhibits LATS. Together, our study reveals an interplay between the Hippo pathway and heavy metals, providing insights into this growth-related pathway in tissue homeostasis and stress response.
   Han et al. report that the Hippo pathway kinases LATS1 and LATS2 phosphorylate the heavy metal response transcription factor MTF1, leading to attenuation of heavy metal response gene transcription and cellular detoxification.

AB  - In this paper, we investigate whether Wnt5A is associated with the TGF-beta 1/Smad2/3 and Hippo-YAP1/TAZ-TEAD pathways, implicated in epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in epithelial ovarian cancer. We used 3D and 2D cultures of human epithelial ovarian cancer cell lines SKOV-3, OVCAR-3, CAOV-4, and different subtypes of human serous ovarian cancer compared to normal ovary specimens. Wnt5A showed a positive correlation with TAZ and TGF beta 1 in high- and low-grade serous ovarian cancer specimens compared to borderline serous and normal ovaries. Silencing Wnt5A by siRNAs significantly decreased Smad2/3 activation and YAP1 expression and nuclear shuttling in ovarian cancer (OvCa) cells. Furthermore, Wnt5A was required for TGF beta 1-induced cell migration and invasion. In addition, inhibition of YAP1 transcriptional activity by Verteporfin (VP) altered OvCa cell migration and invasion through decreased Wnt5A expression and inhibition of Smad2/3 activation, which was reverted in the presence of exogenous Wnt5A. We found that the activation of TGF beta 1 and YAP1 nuclear shuttling was promoted by Wnt5A-induced integrin alpha v. Lastly, Wnt5A was implicated in activating human primary omental mesothelial cells and subsequent invasion of ovarian cancer cells. Together, we propose that Wnt5A could be a critical mediator of EMT-associated pathways.

AB  - Endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) is the biological process through which endothelial cells transdifferentiate into mesenchymal cells. During embryo development, EndMT regulates endocardial cushion formation via TGF beta/BMP signaling. In adults, EndMT is mainly activated during pathological conditions. Hence, it is necessary to characterize molecular regulators cooperating with TGF beta signaling in driving EndMT, to identify potential novel therapeutic targets to treat these pathologies. Here, we studied YAP, a transcriptional co-regulator involved in several biological processes, including epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). As EndMT is the endothelial-specific form of EMT, and YAP (herein referring to YAP1) and TGF beta signaling cross-talk in other contexts, we hypothesized that YAP contributes to EndMT by modulating TGF beta signaling. We demonstrate that YAP is required to trigger TGF beta-induced EndMT response, specifically contributing to SMAD3-driven EndMT early gene transcription. We provide novel evidence that YAP acts as SMAD3 transcriptional co-factor and prevents GSK3 beta-mediated SMAD3 phosphorylation, thus protecting SMAD3 from degradation. YAP is therefore emerging as a possible candidate target to inhibit pathological TGF beta-induced EndMT at early stages.

AB  - Amyloid beta (A beta) peptide is deposited in the brains of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) due to impaired vessel-dependent clearance. To understand the mechanisms, we investigated time-dependent cerebrovascular changes in AD model mice. Cerebrovascular and other pathological changes were analyzed in AD model mice (J20 strain) aging from 2 to 9 months by immunostaining. At 2 months, A beta was only intraneuronal, whereas vessels were positive from 3 months in J20 mice. Compared to wild-type (WT), vessel density was increased at 2 months but decreased at 9 months in J20 mice, claudin-5 levels were decreased, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels were increased in the cortex and hippocampus of J20 mice brain at all time points. Albumin extravasation was evident from 3 months in J20 brains. Collagen 4 was increased at 2 and 3 months. Aquaporin 4 was spread beyond the vessels starting from 3 months in J20, which was restricted around the vessel in wild-type mice. In conclusion, the study showed that an early decrease in claudin-5 was associated with VEGF expression, indicating dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier. Decreased claudin-5 might cause the leakage of blood constituents into the parenchyma that alters astrocyte polarity and its functions.

AB  - Background: Rates of major depressive disorder (MDD) increase with living at altitude. In our model, rats housed at moderate altitude (in hypobaric hypoxia) exhibit increased depression-like behavior, altered brain serotonin and a lack of antidepressant response to most selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). A forebrain deficit in the bioenergetic marker creatine is noted in people living at altitude or with MDD. Methods: Rats housed at 4500 ft were given dietary creatine monohydrate (CRMH, 4% w/w, 5 weeks) vs. un-supplemented diet, and impact on depression-like behavior, brain bioenergetics, serotonin and SSRI efficacy assessed. Results: CRMH significantly improved brain creatine in a sex-based manner. At altitude, CRMH increased serotonin levels in the female prefrontal cortex and striatum but reduced male striatal and hippocampal serotonin. Dietary CRMH was antidepressant in the forced swim test and anti-anhedonic in the sucrose preference test in only females at altitude, with motor behavior unchanged. CRMH improved fluoxetine efficacy (20 mg/kg) in only males at altitude: CRMH + SSRI significantly improved male striatal creatine and serotonin vs. CRMH alone. Conclusions: Dietary CRMH exhibits sex-based efficacy in resolving altitude-related deficits in brain biomarkers, depression-like behavior and SSRI efficacy, and may be effective clinically for SSRI-resistant depression at altitude. This is the first study to link CRMH treatment to improving brain serotonin.

AB  - Adenosine (Ado) receptors have been instrumental in the detection of heteromers and other higher-order receptor structures, mainly via interactions with other cell surface G-protein-coupled receptors. Apart from the first report of the A(1) Ado receptor interacting with the A(2A) Ado receptor, there has been more recent data on the possibility that every Ado receptor type, A(1), A(2A), A(2B), and A(3), may interact with each other. The aim of this paper was to look for the expression and function of the A(2A)/A(3) receptor heteromer (A(2A)A(3)Het) in neurons and microglia. In situ proximity ligation assays (PLA), performed in primary cells, showed that A(2A)A(3)Het expression was markedly higher in striatal than in cortical and hippocampal neurons, whereas it was similar in resting and activated microglia. Signaling assays demonstrated that the effect of the A(2A)R agonist, PSB 777, was reduced in the presence of the A(3)R agonist, 2-Cl-IB-MECA, whereas the effect of the A(3)R agonist was potentiated by the A(2A)R antagonist, SCH 58261. Interestingly, the expression of the heteromer was markedly enhanced in microglia from the APP(Sw,Ind) model of Alzheimer's disease. The functionality of the heteromer in primary microglia from APP(Sw,Ind) mice was more similar to that found in resting microglia from control mice.

AB  - Epilepsy is characterized by recurrent seizures due to a perturbed balance between glutamate and GABA neurotransmission. Our goal is to reveal the molecular mechanisms of the changes upon repeated challenges of this balance, suggesting knowledge-based neuroprotection. To address this goal, a set of metabolic indicators in the post-seizure rat brain cortex is compared before and after pharmacological kindling with pentylenetetrazole (PTZ). Vitamins B1 and B6 supporting energy and neurotransmitter metabolism are studied as neuroprotectors. PTZ kindling increases the seizure severity (1.3 fold, p < 0.01), elevating post-seizure rearings (1.5 fold, p = 0.03) and steps out of the walls (2 fold, p = 0.01). In the kindled vs. non-kindled rats, the post-seizure p53 level is increased 1.3 fold (p = 0.03), reciprocating a 1.4-fold (p = 0.02) decrease in the activity of 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (OGDHC) controlling the glutamate degradation. Further, decreased expression of deacylases SIRT3 (1.4 fold, p = 0.01) and SIRT5 (1.5 fold, p = 0.01) reciprocates increased acetylation of 15 kDa proteins 1.5 fold (p < 0.01). Finally, the kindling abrogates the stress response to multiple saline injections in the control animals, manifested in the increased activities of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, malic enzyme, glutamine synthetase and decreased malate dehydrogenase activity. Post-seizure animals demonstrate correlations of p53 expression to the levels of glutamate (r = 0.79, p = 0.05). The correlations of the seizure severity and duration to the levels of GABA (r = 0.59, p = 0.05) and glutamate dehydrogenase activity (r = 0.58, p = 0.02), respectively, are substituted by the correlation of the seizure latency with the OGDHC activity (r = 0.69, p < 0.01) after the vitamins administration, testifying to the vitamins-dependent impact of the kindling on glutamate/GABA metabolism. The vitamins also abrogate the correlations of behavioral parameters with seizure duration (r 0.53-0.59, p < 0.03). Thus, increased seizures and modified post-seizure behavior in rats after PTZ kindling are associated with multiple changes in the vitamin-dependent brain metabolism of amino acids, linked to key metabolic regulators: p53, OGDHC, SIRT3 and SIRT5.

AB  - Innate immunity, the primary defence mechanism, encompasses a range of protective processes like anatomical barriers, cytokine secretion, and the action of various immune cells. Cattle breeds might differ in these processes because of their genetic differences such as copy number variations (CNVs). Therefore, the present investigation employed an array comparative genomic hybridisation (aCGH) approach on breed representative pooled DNA samples to evaluate CNVs across six cattle breeds: four indigenous Indian breeds, Kangayam (KNG), Tharparkar (TP), Sahiwal (SW), Gir (GIR), one crossbred Karan Fries (KF), and one exotic breed, Holstein Friesian (HF). In aCGH, HF DNA was used as control, while test DNA was from the other breeds. Each pooled test DNA sample was a representative of 18 animals belonging to three distinct geographical locations of India. The study using Aberration Detection Method 2 (ADM-2) of Agilent Genomic Workbench revealed the highest number of duplications in KNG (1189 genes), followed by TP (534 genes), and the greatest number of deletions in SW (774 genes). Among these genes, 183 and 76 innate immune genes with hub genes TGF-beta 1, CD79A, and IL4 showed duplications in KNG and TP, respectively. In SW, 113 innate immune genes with hub genes PSMC5, MAPK1, and AXIN1 showed deletions. In contrast, KF and HF showed no genes with deletions and fewer duplicated innate immunity genes, reflecting either lower genetic variability in their immune gene repertoire or a potential bias due to HF DNA as a control in aCGH. Functional enrichment of innate immune genes revealed duplications in KNG enriched in interleukin-1 receptor (IL1R) activity (p = 9.9 x 10-3) and nucleobase metabolism (p = 2.88 x 10(-)11), while duplications in TP were linked to DNA-binding transcription factor activity (p = 2.34 x 10(-)14). The KEGG pathway analysis highlighted Th17 cell differentiation (p = 1.3 x 10(-)4) in KNG and Hippo signalling (p = 3.7 x 10-2) in TP. Overall, these findings highlight the importance of genetic diversity in shaping innate immunity in indigenous Indian cattle breeds, favouring a balanced crossbreeding to sustain the Indian dairy sector.

AB  - Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons within the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVH) play a crucial role in initiating the neuroendocrine response to stress and are also pivotal in coordination of autonomic, metabolic, and behavioral stress reactions. Although the role of parvocellular CRHPVH neurons in activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is well established, the distribution and function of CRH-expressing neurons across the whole central nervous system are less understood. Stress responses activate complex neural networks, which differ depending on the type of stressor and on the sex of the individual. Because of the technical difficulties of localizing CRH neurons throughout the rodent brain, several CRH reporter mouse lines have recently been developed. In this study, we used Crh-IRES-Cre;Ai9 reporter mice to examine whether CRH neurons are recruited in a stressor- or sex-specific manner, both within and outside the hypothalamus. In contrast to the clear sexual dimorphism of CRH-mRNA-expressing neurons, quantification of CRH-reporting, tdTomato-positive neurons in different stress-related brain areas revealed only subtle differences between male and female subjects. These results strongly imply that sex differences in CRH mRNA expression occur later in development under the influence of sex steroids and reflects the limitations of using genetic reporter constructs to reveal the current physiological/transcriptional status of a specific neuron population. Next, we compared the recruitment of stress-related, tdTomato-expressing (putative CRH) neurons in male and female Crh-IRES-Cre;Ai9 reporter mice that had been exposed to predator odor. In male mice, fox odor triggered more c-Fos in the CRH neurons of the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, central amygdala, and anterolateral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis compared to females. These results indicate that male mice are more sensitive to predator exposure due to a combination of hormonal, environmental, and behavioral factors.

AB  - Our previous study showed that COPPER-CONTAINING AMINE OXIDASE (CuAO) and AMINOALDEHYDE DEHYDROGENASE (AMADH) could regulate the accumulation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in tea through the polyamine degradation pathway. However, their biological function in drought tolerance has not been determined. In this study, Camellia sinensis (Cs) CsCuAO1 associated with CsAMADH1 conferred drought tolerance, which modulated GABA levels in tea plants. The results showed that exogenous GABA spraying effectively alleviated the drought-induced physical damage. Arabidopsis lines overexpressing CsCuAO1 and CsAMADH1 exhibited enhanced resistance to drought, which promoted the synthesis of GABA and putrescine by stimulating reactive oxygen species' scavenging capacity and stomatal movement. However, the suppression of CsCuAO1 or CsAMADH1 in tea plants resulted in increased sensitivity to drought treatment. Moreover, co-overexpressing plants increased GABA accumulation both in an Agrobacterium-mediated Nicotiana benthamiana transient assay and transgenic Arabidopsis plants. In addition, a GABA transporter gene, CsGAT1, was identified, whose expression was strongly correlated with GABA accumulation levels in different tissues under drought stress. Taken together, CsCuAO1 and CsAMADH1 were involved in the response to drought stress through a dynamic GABA-putrescine balance. Our data will contribute to the characterization of GABA's biological functions in response to environmental stresses in plants.

AB  - Pathogenesis-related 1 (PR-1) proteins, which are defense proteins in plant-pathogen interactions, play an important role in the resistance and defense of plants against diseases. Blister blight disease is caused by Exobasidium vexans Massee and a major leaf disease of tea plants (Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze). However, the systematic characterization and analysis of the PR-1 gene family in tea plants is still lacking, and the defense mechanism of this family remains unknown. In this study, 17 CsPR-1 genes were identified from the tea plant genome and classified into five groups based on their signal peptide, isoelectric point, and C-terminus extension. Most of the CsPR-1 proteins contained an N-terminal signal peptide and a conserved PR-1 like domain. CsPR-1 genes comprised multiple cis-acting elements and were closely related to the signal-transduction pathways involving TCA, NPR1, EDS16, BGL2, PR4, and HCHIB. These characteristics imply an important role of the genes in the defense of the tea plant. In addition, the RNA-seq data and real-time PCR analysis demonstrated that the CsPR-1-2, -4, -6, -7, -8, -9, -10, -14, -15, and -17 genes were significantly upregulated under tea blister-blight stress. This study could help to increase understanding of CsPR-1 genes and their defense mechanism in response to tea blister blight.

AB  - WRKY transcription factors comprise one of the largest gene families and serve as key regulators of plant defenses against herbivore attack. However, studies related to the roles of WRKY genes in response to herbivory are limited in maize. In this study, a total of 128 putative maize WRKY genes (ZmWRKYs) were identified from the new maize genome (v4). These genes were divided into seven subgroups (groups I, IIa-e, and III) based on phylogenomic analysis, with distinct motif compositions in each subgroup. Syntenic analysis revealed that 72 (56.3%) of the genes were derived from either segmental or tandem duplication events (69 and 3, respectively), suggesting a pivotal role of segmental duplication in the expansion of the ZmWRKY family. Importantly, transcriptional regulation prediction showed that six key WRKY genes contribute to four major defense-related pathways: L-phenylalanine biosynthesis II and flavonoid, benzoxazinoid, and jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis. These key WRKY genes were strongly induced in commercial maize (Jingke968) infested with the Asian corn borer, Ostrinia furnacalis, for 0, 2, 4, 12 and 24 h in the field, and their expression levels were highly correlated with predicted target genes, suggesting that these genes have important functions in the response to O. furnacalis. Our results provide a comprehensive understanding of the WRKY gene family based on the new assembly of the maize genome and lay the foundation for further studies into functional characteristics of ZmWRKY genes in commercial maize defenses against O. furnacalis in the field.

AB  - Mental disorders are highly comorbid and occur together with physical diseases, which are often considered to arise from separate pathogenic pathways. We observed in alcohol-dependent patients increased serum activity of neutral sphingomyelinase. A genetic association analysis in 456,693 volunteers found associations of haplotypes of SMPD3 coding for NSM-2 (NSM) with alcohol consumption, but also with affective state, and bone mineralisation. Functional analysis in mice showed that NSM controls alcohol consumption, affective behaviour, and their interaction by regulating hippocampal volume, cortical connectivity, and monoaminergic responses. Furthermore, NSM controlled bone-brain communication by enhancing osteocalcin signalling, which can independently supress alcohol consumption and reduce depressive behaviour. Altogether, we identified a single gene source for multiple pathways originating in the brain and bone, which interlink disorders of a mental-physical co-morbidity trias of alcohol abuse-depression/anxiety-bone disorder. Targeting NSM and osteocalcin signalling may, thus, provide a new systems approach in the treatment of a mental-physical co-morbidity trias.

AB  - Cysteine plays a pivotal role in the sulfur metabolism network of plants, intimately influencing the conversion rate of organic sulfur and the plant's capacity to withstand abiotic stresses. In tea plants, the serine acetyltransferase (SAT) genes emerge as a crucial regulator of cysteine metabolism, albeit with a notable lack of comprehensive research. Utilizing Hidden Markov Models, we identified seven CssSATs genes within the tea plant genome. The results of the bioinformatics analysis indicate that these genes exhibit an average molecular weight of 33.22 kD and cluster into three distinct groups. Regarding gene structure, CssSAT1 stands out with ten exons, significantly more than its family members. In the promoter regions, cis-acting elements associated with environmental responsiveness and hormone induction predominate, accounting for 34.4% and 53.1%, respectively. Transcriptome data revealed intricate expression dynamics of CssSATs under various stress conditions (e.g., PEG, NaCl, Cold, MeJA) and their tissue-specific expression patterns in tea plants. Notably, qRT-PCR analysis indicated that under salt stress, CssSAT1 and CssSAT3 expression levels markedly increased, whereas CssSAT2 displayed a downregulatory trend. Furthermore, we cloned CssSAT1-CssSAT3 genes and constructed corresponding prokaryotic expression vectors. The resultant recombinant proteins, upon induction, significantly enhanced the NaCl tolerance of Escherichia coli BL21, suggesting the potential application of CssSATs in bolstering plant stress resistance. These findings have enriched our comprehension of the multifaceted roles played by CssSATs genes in stress tolerance mechanisms, laying a theoretical groundwork for future scientific endeavors and research pursuits.

AB  - The most frequently used biomarkers to support the diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) are A beta 42, total-Tau, and phospho-tau protein levels in CSF. Moreover, magnetic resonance imaging is used to assess hippocampal atrophy, 18F-FDG PET to identify abnormal brain metabolism, and PET imaging for amyloid deposition. These tests are rather complex and invasive and not easily applicable to clinical practice. Circulating non-coding RNAs, which are inherently stable and easy to manage, have been reported as promising biomarkers for central nervous system conditions. Recently, circular RNAs (circRNAs) as a novel class of ncRNAs have gained attention. We carried out a pilot study on five participants with AD and five healthy controls (HC) investigating circRNAs by Arraystar Human Circular RNA Microarray V2.0. Among them, 26 circRNAs were differentially expressed (FC >= 1.5, p < 0.05) in participants with AD compared to HC. From a top 10 of differentially expressed circRNAs, a validation study was carried out on four up-regulated (hsa_circRNA_050263, hsa_circRNA_403959, hsa_circRNA_003022, hsa_circRNA_100837) and two down-regulated (hsa_circRNA_102049, hsa_circRNA_102619) circRNAs in a larger population. Moreover, five subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) were investigated. The analysis confirmed the upregulation of hsa_circRNA_050263, hsa_circRNA_403959, and hsa_circRNA_003022 both in subjects with AD and in MCI compared to HCs. We also investigated all microRNAs potentially interacting with the studied circRNAs. The GO enrichment analysis shows they are involved in the development of the nervous system, and in the cellular response to nerve growth factor stimuli, protein phosphorylation, apoptotic processes, and inflammation pathways, all of which are processes related to the pathology of AD.

AB  - Drought stress is considered the main obstacle restricting Camellia vietnamensis Huang (C. vietnamensis) yield. Hainan is the southernmost distribution region of C. vietnamensis in China and experiences a drought period annually. To study the drought-stress-response mechanism of C. vietnamensis, we treated seedlings of drought-tolerant (HD1) and drought-sensitive (WH1) cultivars with PEG-6000 (PEG) to simulate drought stress and compared the physiology and transcriptome of their leaves at 0 d, 3 d and 6 d posttreatment. Under drought stress, the growth of C. vietnamensis was inhibited, the relative water content (RWC) of leaves decreased and the contents of malondialdehyde (MDA), antioxidant enzyme activities, osmotic regulatory substances and secondary metabolites increased. Compared with those of WH1, the leaf RWC, osmotic-regulation substance content (proline, soluble protein and soluble sugar) and antioxidant enzyme activity (superoxide dismutase, peroxidase and catalase) of HD1 were significantly increased, while the relative electrical conductivity and MDA content were significantly decreased. Compared with WH1, 2812, 2070 and 919, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected in HD1 0 d, 3 d and 6 d posttreatment, respectively, and the number of DEGs increased with increasing treatment time. The detected DEGs are involved in the drought stress response of C. vietnamensis mainly through plant-hormone signal transduction and lignin and flavonoid biosynthesis pathways. Drought stress significantly activated the expression of several lignin and flavonoid biosynthesis genes in HD1. Moreover, total flavonoid and total polyphenol contents in HD1 were significantly increased, suggesting that the accumulation of flavonoids may be a key factor in the drought stress response of C. vietnamensis. Additionally, 191 DEGs were associated with coding transcription factors (TFs). This study provides insight into the molecular mechanism of the drought stress response of C. vietnamensis and provides a theoretical basis for the development and cultivation of new drought-resistant cultivars.

AB  - Recent fieldwork at fossiliferous levels of the Sarmiento Formation in the Ca & ntilde;ad & oacute;n Pelado and La Gran Hondonada sites (Chubut Province, Argentina) has yielded both key insights into the geographic location of a historical site and new specimens of two poorly known South American Native Ungulates from the middle-late Eocene. First, we identified the current Ca & ntilde;ad & oacute;n Pelado locality corresponding to the long-unused 'Mall & iacute;n del Gato', which had not been referenced for over 60 years. Second, we report for the first time the presence of Didolodus multicuspis, D. magnus and Victorlemoinea sp. in Ca & ntilde;ad & oacute;n Pelado, and D. magnus at La Gran Hondonada. Notably, for D. magnus, we describe the most complete mandibular fragment recovered to date, preserving m2-m3, as well as the first p4, P3 and M1 for this species, thereby refining its diagnosis. The occurrence of D. magnus highlights taxonomic similarities not only between the upper levels of Ca & ntilde;ad & oacute;n Pelado and La Gran Hondonada, but also between these and the La Gran Barranca (GBV-60 level). Additionally, the co-occurrence of D. multicuspis and Victorlemoinea sp. in Ca & ntilde;ad & oacute;n Pelado supports taxonomic affinities with other Barrancan faunas from Chubut Province.

AB  - Numerous regulators of cardiomyocyte (CM) proliferation have been identified, yet how they coordinate during cardiac development or regeneration is poorly understood. Here, we developed a computational model of the CM proliferation regulatory network to obtain key regulators and systems-level understanding. The model defines five pathway) and integrates them into a network of 72 nodes and 88 reactions that correctly predicts 74 of 81 (91.35%) independent experiments from the literature. The model predicts that in response to YAP activation, the Hippo module crosstalks to the growth factor module via PI3K and cMyc to drive cell cycle activity. This predicted YAP-cMyc axis is validated experimentally in rat CMs and further supported by YAP-stimulated cMyc open chromatin and mRNA in mouse hearts. This validated computational model predicts how individual regulators and modules coordinate to control CM proliferation.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury usually triggers glial scar formation, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these pathological features are largely unknown. Using a mouse model of hippocampal stab injury (HSI), we observed that miR-331, a brain-enriched microRNA, was significantly downregulated in the early stage (0-7 days) of HSI. Intranasal administration of agomir-331, an upgraded product of miR-331 mimics, suppressed reactive gliosis and neuronal apoptosis and improved cognitive function in HSI mice. Finally, we identified IL-1 beta as a direct downstream target of miR-331, and agomir-331 treatment significantly reduced IL-1 beta levels in the hippocampus after acute injury. Our findings highlight, for the first time, agomir-331 as a pivotal neuroprotective agent for early rehabilitation of HSI.

AB  - The seahorse is one of the most unique teleost fishes in its morphology. The body is surrounded by bony plates and spines, and the male fish possess a brooding organ, called the brood pouch, on their tail. The surfaces of the brood pouch and the spines are surrounded by characteristic so-called flame cone cells. Based on our histological observations, flame cone cells are present in the seahorse Hippocampus abdominalis, but not in the barbed pipefish Urocampus nanus or the seaweed pipefish Syngnathus schlegeli, both of which belong to the same family as the seahorse. In the flame cone cells, we observed expression of an "orphan gene" lacking homologs in other lineages. This gene, which we named the proline-glycine rich (pgrich) gene, codes for an amino acid sequence composed of repetitive units. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analyses detected pgrich-positive signals from the flame cone cells. Based on a survey of the genome sequences of 15 teleost species, the pgrich gene is only found from some species of Syngnathiformes (namely, the genera Syngnathus and Hippocampus). The amino acid sequence of the seahorse PGrich is somewhat similar to the sequence deduced from the antisense strand of elastin. Furthermore, there are many transposable elements around the pgrich gene. These results suggest that the pgrich gene may have originated from the elastin gene with the involvement of transposable elements and obtained its novel function in the flame cone cells during the evolution of the seahorse.

AB  - Transient memories are converted to persistent memories at the synapse and circuit/systems levels. The synapse-level consolidation parallels electrophysiological transition from early-to late-phase long-term potentiation of synaptic transmission (E-/L-LTP). While glutamate signaling upregulations coupled with dendritic spine enlargement are common underpinnings of E-LTP and L-LTP, synaptic mechanisms conferring persistence on L-LTP remain unclear. Here, we show that L-LTP induced at the perforant path-hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) synapses accompanies cytoskeletal remodeling that involves actin and the septin subunit SEPT3. L-LTP in DG neurons causes fast spine enlargement, followed by SEPT3-dependent smooth endoplasmic reticulum (sER) extension into enlarged spines. Spines containing sER show greater Ca2+ responses upon synaptic input and local synaptic activity. Consistently, Sept3 knockout in mice (Sept3-/-) impairs memory consolidation and causes a scarcity of sER-containing spines. These findings indicate a concept that sER extension into active spines serves as a synaptic basis of memory consolidation.

AB  - Understanding the mechanisms of breast cancer cell communication underlying cell spreading and metastasis formation is fundamental for developing new therapies. ID4 is a proto-oncogene overexpressed in the basal-like subtype of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), where it promotes angiogenesis, cancer stem cells, and BRACA1 misfunction. Here, we show that ID4 expression in BC cells correlates with the activation of motility pathways and promotes the production of VEGFA, which stimulates the interaction of VEGFR2 and integrin beta 3 in a paracrine fashion. This interaction induces the downstream focal adhesion pathway favoring migration, invasion, and stress fiber formation. Furthermore, ID4/ VEGFA/ VEGFR2/ integrin beta 3 signaling stimulates the nuclear translocation and activation of the Hippo pathway member's YAP and TAZ, two critical executors for cancer initiation and progression. Our study provides new insights into the oncogenic roles of ID4 in tumor cell migration and YAP/TAZ pathway activation, suggesting VEGFA/ VEGFR2/ integrin beta 3 axis as a potential target for BC treatment.

AB  - Recognizing familiar faces and learning new faces play an important role in social cognition. However, the underlying neural computational mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we record from single neurons in the human amygdala and hippocampus and find a greater neuronal representational distance between pairs of familiar faces than unfamiliar faces, suggesting that neural representations for familiar faces are more distinct. Representational distance increases with exposures to the same identity, suggesting that neural face representations are sharpened with learning and familiarization. Furthermore, representational distance is positively correlated with visual dissimilarity between faces, and exposure to visually similar faces increases representational distance, thus sharpening neural representations. Finally, we construct a computational model that demonstrates an increase in the representational distance of artificial units with training. Together, our results suggest that the neuronal population geometry, quantified by the representational distance, encodes face familiarity, similarity, and learning, forming the basis of face recognition and memory.

AB  - Dysregulated abundance, location and transcriptional output of Hippo signaling effector TAZ have been increasingly linked to human cancers including head neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). TAZ is subjected to ubiquitination and degradation mediated by E3 ligase beta-TRCP. However, the deubiquitinating enzymes and mechanisms responsible for its protein stability remain underexplored. Here, we exploited customized deubiquitinases siRNA and cDNA library screen strategies and identified USP7 as a bona fide TAZ deubiquitinase in HNSCC. USP7 promoted cell proliferation, migration, invasion in vitro and tumor growth by stabilizing TAZ. Mechanistically, USP7 interacted with, deubiquitinated and stabilized TAZ by selectively removing its K48-linked ubiquitination chain independent of canonical Hippo kinase cascade. USP7 potently antagonized beta-TRCP-mediated ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation of TAZ and enhanced its nuclear retention and transcriptional output. Importantly, overexpression of USP7 correlated with TAZ upregulation, tumor aggressiveness and unfavorable prognosis in HNSCC patients. Pharmacological inhibition of USP7 significantly suppressed tumor growth in both xenograft and PDX models. Collectively, these findings identify USP7 as an essential regulator of TAZ and define USP7-TAZ signaling axis as a novel biomarker and potential therapeutic target for HNSCC.

AB  - The role of nasal symptoms in continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) tolerance is not completely clear. This study aimed to investigate the association between CPAP usage and nasal symptoms, either prior to, or developing during, CPAP use in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). Two hundred thirty patients were studied and divided into high-, low-, and non-CPAP users. Nasal symptoms and related quality of life parameters were evaluated prior to CPAP initiation and after three months. We also investigated predictive factors for CPAP usage. Non-CPAP users had significantly worse baseline scores for runny nose compared with high and low users (1.34 vs. 0.68 and 0.75, respectively, p = 0.006). There were no other significant differences between the groups. Runny nose was an independent predictive factor for lower CPAP usage (p = 0.036). An evaluation after three months showed worsening in runny nose score in high-CPAP users (p = 0.025) but not in low- and non-users. There were no significant changes in other nasal symptoms. Our study demonstrates that nasal symptoms were very common in this population but rhinorrhoea was the only symptom associated with poorer CPAP adherence. Moreover, rhinorrhoea worsened after a three-month trial of high-CPAP usage.

AB  - Chromosome 21 DYRK1A kinase is associated with a variety of neuronal diseases including Down syndrome. However, the functional impact of this kinase at the synapse level remains unclear. We studied a mouse model that incorporated YAC 152F7 (570 kb), encoding six chromosome 21 genes including DYRK1A. The 152F7 mice displayed learning difficulties but their N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-dependent synaptic long-term potentiation is indistinguishable from non-transgenic animals. We have demonstrated that a presynaptic form of NMDA-independent long-term potentiation (LTP) at the hippocampal mossy fiber was impaired in the 152F7 animals. To obtain insights into the molecular mechanisms involved in such synaptic changes, we analyzed the Dyrk1a interactions with chromatin remodelers. We found that the number of DYRK1A-EP300 and DYRK1A-CREBPP increased in 152F7 mice. Moreover, we observed a transcriptional decrease in genes encoding presynaptic proteins involved in glutamate vesicle exocytosis, namely Rims1, Munc13-1, Syn2 and Rab3A.To refine our findings, we used a mouse BAC 189N3 (152 kb) line that only triplicates the gene Dyrk1a. Again, we found that this NMDA-independent form of LTP is impaired in this mouse line. Altogether, our results demonstrate that Dyrk1a up-regulation is sufficient to specifically inhibit the NMDA-independent form of LTP and suggest that this inhibition is linked to chromatin changes that deregulate genes encoding proteins involved in glutamate synaptic release.

AB  - Metastasis is the hallmark of cancer that is responsible for the greatest number of cancer-related deaths. As a critical regulator of the Hippo pathway, the phosphorylation status of Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1), mainly at S127, is critical for its oncogenic function. Herein, we aim to investigate the precise molecular mechanism between long noncoding RNA HOX transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR) and YAP1 phosphorylation in regulating tumor migration and invasion. In this study, we showed that inhibition of HOTAIR significantly decreased the migration and invasion of cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo through elevating the phosphorylation level of YAP1 on serine 127, demonstrating a tumor suppressive role of YAP1 S127 phosphorylation. Through bisulfite sequencing PCR (BSP), we found that inhibition of HOTAIR dramatically increased Large Tumor Suppressor Kinase 1 (LATS1) expression by regulating LATS1 methylation via DNA methyltransferase 3 beta (DNMT3B). In accordance with this observation, DNMT3B just only altered the distribution of YAP1 in the cytoplasm and the nucleus by inhibiting its phosphorylation, but did not change its total expression. Mechanistically, we discovered that HOTAIR suppressed YAP1 S127 phosphorylation by regulating the methylation of LATS1 via DNMT3B, the consequence of which is the translocation of YAP1 into the nucleus, reinforcing its coactivating transcriptional function, which in turn promotes the migration and invasion of cancer cells. Collectively, our data reveal that the phosphorylation of YAP1 S127 plays a vital role in the function of HOTAIR in tumorigenicity, and should be taken into consideration in future therapeutic strategies for cervical cancer.

AB  - The central nervous system contains a myriad of different cell types produced from multipotent neural progenitors. Neural progenitors acquire distinct cell identities depending on their spatial position, but they are also influenced by temporal cues to give rise to different cell populations over time. For instance, the progenitors of the cerebral neocortex generate different populations of excitatory projection neurons following a well-known sequence. The Notch signaling pathway plays crucial roles during this process, but the molecular mechanisms by which Notch impacts progenitor fate decisions have not been fully resolved. Here, we show that Notch signaling is essential for neocortical and hippocampal morphogenesis, and for the development of the corpus callosum and choroid plexus. Our data also indicate that, in the neocortex, Notch controls projection neuron fate determination through the regulation of two microRNA clusters that include let-7, miR-99a/100 and miR-125b. Our findings collectively suggest that balanced Notch signaling is crucial for telencephalic development and that the interplay between Notch and miRNAs is essential for the control of neocortical progenitor behaviors and neuron cell fate decisions.

AB  - Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) have aroused a lot of interest as reliable blood diagnostic biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we investigated the panel of expressed blood miRNAs in response to aggregated A beta(1-42) peptides infused in the hippocampus of adult rats to mimic events of the early onset of non-familial AD disorder. A beta(1-42) peptides in the hippocampus led to cognitive impairments associated with an astrogliosis and downregulation of circulating miRNA-146a-5p, -29a-3p, -29c-3p, -125b-5p, and-191-5p. We established the kinetics of expression of selected miRNAs and found differences with those detected in the APP(swe)/PS1(dE9) transgenic mouse model. Of note, miRNA-146a-5p was exclusively dysregulated in the A beta-induced AD model. The treatment of primary astrocytes with A beta(1-42) peptides led to miRNA-146a-5p upregulation though the activation of the NF-kappa B signaling pathway, which in turn downregulated IRAK-1 but not TRAF-6 expression. As a consequence, no induction of IL-1 beta, IL-6, or TNF-alpha was detected. Astrocytes treated with a miRNA-146-5p inhibitor rescued IRAK-1 and changed TRAF-6 steady-state levels that correlated with the induction of IL-6, IL-1 beta, and CXCL1 production, indicating that miRNA-146a-5p operates anti-inflammatory functions through a NF-kappa B pathway negative feedback loop. Overall, we report a panel of circulating miRNAs that correlated with A beta(1-42) peptides' presence in the hippocampus and provide mechanistic insights into miRNA-146a-5p biological function in the development of the early stage of sporadic AD.

AB  - Metabotropic glutamate 5 receptors (mGlu(5)) are thought to play an important role in mediating emotional information processing. In particular, negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) of mGlu(5) have received a lot of attention as potential novel treatments for several neuropsychiatric diseases, including anxiety-related disorders. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of pre- and post-training mGlu(5) inactivation in cued fear conditioned mice on neuronal oscillatory activity during fear retrieval. For this study we used the recently developed mGlu(5) NAM Alloswicth-1 administered systemically. Injection of Alloswicth-1 before, but not after, fear conditioning resulted in a significant decrease in freezing upon fear retrieval. Mice injected with Alloswicth-1 pre-training were also implanted with recording microelectrodes into both the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and ventral hippocampus (vHPC). The recordings revealed a reduction in theta rhythmic activity (4-12 Hz) in both the mPFC and vHPC during fear retrieval. These results indicate that inhibition of mGlu(5) signaling alters local oscillatory activity in principal components of the fear brain network underlying a reduced response to a predicted threat.

AB  - Prokineticin 2 (PROK2) is a secreted bioactive peptide that regulates a variety of biological responses via two GPCRs, the prokineticin receptors (PROKRs). The aim of this study was to characterize a new alternatively spliced product of the prok2 gene consisting of four exons. The 40-amino acid peptide, designated PROK2C, is encoded by exon 1 and exon 4, and its expression was detected in the hippocampus and spinal cord of mice. PROK2C was expressed in a heterologous system, Pichia pastoris, and its binding specificity to the amino-terminal regions of PROKR1 and PROKR2 was investigated by GST pull-down experiments. In addition, the introduction of the unnatural amino acid p-benzoyl-L-phenylalanine using amber codon suppression technology demonstrated the role of tryptophan at position 212 of PROKR2 for PROK2C binding by photoactivatable cross-linking. The functional significance of this new isoform was determined in vivo by nociceptive experiments, which showed that PROK2C elicits strong sensitization of peripheral nociceptors to painful stimuli. In order to analyze the induction of PROK2C signal transduction, STAT3 and ERK phosphorylation levels were determined in mammalian CHO cells expressing PROKR1 and PROKR2. Our data show by in vivo and in vitro experiments that PROK2C can bind and activate both prokineticin receptors.

AB  - Glutathione transferases (GSTs; EC. 2.5.1.18) are a large family of multifunctional enzymes that play crucial roles in the metabolism and inactivation of a broad range of xenobiotic compounds. In the present work, we report the kinetic and structural characterization of the isoenzyme GSTM1-1 from Camelus dromedarius (CdGSTM1-1). The CdGS tau M1-1 was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) and was purified by affinity chromatography. Kinetics analysis showed that the enzyme displays a relative narrow substrate specificity and restricted ability to bind xenobiotic compounds. The crystal structures of CdGS tau M1-1 were determined by X-ray crystallography in complex with the substrate (GSH) or the reaction product (S-p-nitrobenzyl-GSH), providing snapshots of the induced-fit catalytic mechanism. The thermodynamic stability of CdGSTM1-1 was investigated using differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) in the absence and in presence of GSH and S-p-nitrobenzyl-GSH and revealed that the enzyme's structure is significantly stabilized by its ligands. The results of the present study advance the understanding of camelid GST detoxification mechanisms and their contribution to abiotic stress adaptation in harsh desert conditions.

AB  - Microglia, the resident macrophages in the central nervous system, express receptors for classical neurotransmitters, such as gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate, suggesting that they sense synaptic activity, To detect microglial Ca(2+ )responses to neuronal activity, we generate transgenic mouse lines expressing the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator GCaMP6m, specifically in microglia and demonstrate that electrical stimulation of the Schaffer collateral pathway results in microglial Ca2+ responses in early postnatal but not adult hippocampus. Preceding the microglial responses, we also observe similar Ca2+ responses in astrocytes, and both are sensitive to tetrodotoxin. Blocking astrocytic glutamate uptake or GABA transport abolishes stimulation-induced microglial responses as well as antagonizing the microglial GABA(B) receptor Our data, therefore, suggest that the neuronal activity-induced glutamate uptake and the release of GABA by astrocytes trigger the activation of GABA(B) receptors in microglia. This neuron, astrocyte, and microglia communication pathway might modulate microglial activity in developing neuronal networks.

AB  - The genus Hippopotamus dispersed from Africa to Europe during the Pleistocene and the taxon is testified from different Italian localities. Despite the large number of available specimens, Hippopotamus is mainly documented by fragmentary remains and detailed stratigraphic and/or geographic data are often absent or uncertain. In Italy, hippopotamuses are recorded in at least 100 fossiliferous localities spanning from the late Early Pleistocene to the Late Pleistocene. At present, three different Pleistocene species are recognised: H. antiquus from Early to Middle Pleistocene, H. amphibius from Middle to Late Pleistocene and H. pentlandi from late Middle-early Late Pleistocene Sicilian localities. Upper Valdarno basin (Tuscany), Chiusi basin (Tuscany), Colfiorito basin (Umbria), Sant'Oreste (Latium), Puntali Cave (Sicily) and Acquedolci (Sicily) are just a few fossiliferous Italian sites where significative findings of Hippopotamus were collected during the 19th and 20th centuries.

AB  - The population decline of the common hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius) has necessitated the preservation of their genetic resources for species conservation and research. Of all actions, cryopreservation of fibroblast cell cultures derived from an animal biopsy is considered a simple but efficient means. Nevertheless, preserving viable cell cultures of the common hippopotamus has not been achieved to our knowledge. To this end, we established and characterized fibroblast cell cultures from the skin sample of a newborn common hippopotamus in this study. By combining the tissue explant direct culture and enzymatic digestion methods, we isolated a great number of cells with typical fibroblastic morphology and high viability. Neither bacteria/fungi nor mycoplasma was detectable in the cell cultures throughout the study. The population doubling time was 34 h according to the growth curve. Karyotyping based on Giemsa staining showed that the cultured cells were diploid with 36 chromosomes in all, one pair of which was sex chromosomes. The amplified mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase subunit I gene sequence of the cultured cells was 99.26% identical with that of the registered H. amphibius complete mitochondrial DNA, confirming the species of origin of the cells. Flow cytometry and immunofluorescence staining results revealed that the detected cells were positive for fibroblast markers, S100A4, and vimentin. In conclusion, we generated the fibroblast cell cultures from a common hippopotamus and identified their characteristics using multiple techniques. We believe the cryopreserved cells could be useful genetic materials for future research.

AB  - Background: Brain oxidative lipid damage and inflammation are common in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Paraoxonase-1 and -3 (PON1 and PON3) protein expression was demonstrated in tissue with no PON1 or PON3 gene expression. In the present study, we examine differences in PON1 and PON3 protein expression in the brain of a mouse model of AD. Methods: we used peroxidase- and fluorescence-based immunohistochemistry in five brain regions (olfactory bulb, forebrain, posterior midbrain, hindbrain and cerebellum) of transgenic (Tg2576) mice with the Swedish mutation (KM670/671NL) responsible for a familial form of AD and corresponding wild-type mice. Results: We found intense PON1 and PON3-positive staining in star-shaped cells surrounding A beta plaques in all the studied Tg2576 mouse-brain regions. Although we could not colocalize PON1 and PON3 with astrocytes (star-shaped cells in the brain), we found some PON3 colocalization with microglia. Conclusions: These results suggest that (1) PON1 and PON3 cross the blood-brain barrier in discoidal high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) and are transferred to specific brain-cell types; and (2) PON1 and PON3 play an important role in preventing oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation in particular brain-cell types (likely to be glial cells) in AD pathology and potentially in other neurodegenerative diseases as well.

AB  - The tumor suppressor PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted in chromosome 10) is genetically deleted or downregulated in many cancer types. Loss of PTEN protein expression is frequently found in lung cancer while genetic alterations are less abundant. PTEN expression is regulated at multiple genetic and epigenetic levels and even partial reduction of its expression increases cancer occurrence. We show that YAP and TAZ cooperate with EZH2, and MYC to transcriptionally repress onco-suppressor genes, including PTEN, in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. YAP/TAZ-EZH2-MYC transcriptional regulators form a nuclear complex that represses PTEN transcription, while their combinatorial targeting restores PTEN expression, attenuates NSCLC cell growth, and prevents compensatory responses induced by single treatments. Datasets analysis of NSCLC patients revealed that PTEN expression is negatively correlated to YAP/TAZ, EZH2 and MYC and that low expression of PTEN is predictive of poor prognosis, especially at earlier stages of the disease. These findings highlight the repressive role of the YAP/TAZ-EZH2-MYC axis on tumor-suppressor genes and offer a potential therapeutic strategy for lung cancer patients with low PTEN levels.

AB  - Endosomal trafficking of TrkA is a critical process for nerve growth factor (NGF)-dependent neuronal cell survival and differentiation. The small GTPase ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (Arf6) is implicated in NGF-dependent processes in PC12 cells through endosomal trafficking and actin cytoskeleton reorganization. However, the regulatory mechanism for Arf6 in NGF signaling is largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that EFA6A, an Arf6-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor, was abundantly expressed in PC12 cells and that knockdown of EFA6A significantly inhibited NGF-dependent Arf6 activation, TrkA recycling from early endosomes to the cell surface, prolonged ERK1/2 phosphorylation, and neurite outgrowth. We also demonstrated that EFA6A forms a protein complex with TrkA through its N-terminal region, thereby enhancing its catalytic activity for Arf6. Similarly, we demonstrated that EFA6A forms a protein complex with TrkA in cultured dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. Furthermore, cultured DRG neurons from EFA6A knockout mice exhibited disturbed NGF-dependent TrkA trafficking compared with wild-type neurons. These findings provide the first evidence for EFA6A as a key regulator of NGF-dependent TrkA trafficking and signaling.

AB  - Sudden unexpected environmental changes capture attention and, when perceived as potentially dang-erous, evoke defensive behavioral states. Perturbations of the lateral septum (LS) can produce extreme hyperdefensiveness even to innocuous stimuli, but how this structure influences stimulus-evoked defensive responses and threat perception remains unclear. Here, we show that Crhr2-expressing neurons in mouse LS exhibit phasic activation upon detection of threatening but not rewarding stimuli. Threat-stimulus-driven ac-tivity predicts the probability but not vigor or type of defensive behavior evoked. Although necessary for and sufficient to potentiate stimulus-triggered defensive responses, LSCrhr2 neurons do not promote specific be-haviors. Rather, their stimulation elicits negative valence and physiological arousal. Moreover, LSCrhr2 activity tracks brain state fluctuations and drives cortical activation and rapid awakening in the absence of threat. Together, our findings suggest that LS directs bottom-up modulation of cortical function to evoke prepara-tory defensive internal states and selectively enhance responsivity to threat-related stimuli.

AB  - Basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) is a highly aggressive breast cancer subtype frequently associated with poor prognosis. Due to the scarcity of targeted treatment options, conventional cytotoxic chemotherapies frequently remain the standard of care. Unfortunately, their efficacy is limited as BLBC malignancies rapidly develop resistant phenotypes. Using transcriptomic and proteomic approaches in human and murine BLBC cells, we aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the acquisition of aggressive and chemotherapy-resistant phenotypes in these mammary tumors. Specifically, we identified and characterized a novel short isoform of Roundabout Guidance Receptor 3 (ROBO3s), upregulated in BLBC in response to chemotherapy and encoding for a protein variant lacking the transmembrane domain. We established an important role for the ROBO3s isoform, mediating cancer stem cell properties by stimulating the Hippo-YAP signaling pathway, and thus driving resistance of BLBC cells to cytotoxic drugs. By uncovering the conservation of ROBO3s expression across multiple cancer types, as well as its association with reduced BLBC-patient survival, we emphasize its potential as a prognostic marker and identify a novel attractive target for anti-cancer drug development.

AB  - Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the main reason of irreversible vision loss in the elderly. The subretinal fibrosis subsequent to choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is an important feature in the late stage of wet AMD and is considered to be one reason for incomplete response to anti-VEGF drugs. Recent studies have shown that pericyte-myofibroblast transition (PMT) is an important pathological process involving fibrotic diseases of various organs. However, the specific role and mechanism of PMT in the subretinal fibrosis of CNV have not been clarified. It has been clear that the Hippo pathway along with its downstream effector Yes-associated protein (YAP) plays an important role in both epithelial and endothelial myofibroblast development. Therefore, we speculate whether YAP participates in PMT of pericytes and promotes fibrosis of CNV. In this study, experimental CNV was induced by laser photocoagulation in C57BL/6J (B6) mice, and aberrant YAP overexpression was detected in the retinal pigment epithelial/choroid/sclera tissues of the laser-injured eyes. YAP knockdown reduced the proliferation, migration, and differentiation of human retinal microvascular pericytes in vitro. It also reduced subretinal fibrosis of laser-induced CNV in vivo. Moreover, by proteomics-based analysis of pericyte conditioned medium (PC-CM) and bioinformatic analyses, we identified that the crosstalk between Hippo/YAP and MAPK/Erk was involved in expression of filamin A in hypoxic pericytes. These findings suggest that Hippo/YAP and MAPK/Erk are linked together to mediate pericyte proliferation, migration as well as differentiation, which may embody potential implications for treatment in diseases related to CNV.

AB  - Spatial chromatin organization is crucial for transcriptional regulation and might be particularly important in neurons since they dramatically change their transcriptome in response to external stimuli. We show that stimulation of neurons causes condensation of large chromatin domains. This phenomenon can be observed in vitro in cultured rat hippocampal neurons as well as in vivo in the amygdala and hippocampal neurons. Activity-induced chromatin condensation is an active, rapid, energy-dependent, and reversible process. It involves calcium-dependent pathways but is independent of active transcription. It is accompanied by the redistribution of posttranslational histone modifications and rearrangements in the spatial organization of chromosome territories. Moreover, it leads to the reorganization of nuclear speckles and active domains located in their proximity. Finally, we find that the histone deacetylase HDAC1 is the key regulator of this process. Our results suggest that HDAC1-dependent chromatin reorganization constitutes an important level of transcriptional regulation in neurons.

AB  - Tea plant (Camellia sinensis L.), whose leaves are the major reproductive organs, has been cultivated and consumed widely for its economic and health benefits. The Knotted1-like Homeobox (KNOX) proteins play significant roles in leaf morphology formation and development. However, the functions of KNOX proteins in tea plants are still unknown. Here, 11 CsKNOX genes from the tea plants were cloned and divided into Class I, II, and KNATM clades based on their protein sequences. These 11 CsKNOX genes were mapped on 8 out of 15 tea plant chromosomes, all localized in the nucleus. Specific spatiotemporal expression patterns of CsKNOX genes were found in various tissues and different development periods of buds, flowers, and roots of tea plants. Meanwhile, transcript levels of CsKNOX in tea leaves were strongly correlated with the accumulation of flavan-3-ols and proanthocyanidins. It was found that most of the CsKNOX genes could respond to drought, salt, cold, and exogenous MeJA and GA3 by analysis of transcriptomics data and promoter elements. The protein interaction analysis showed that CsKNOX could cooperate with CsAS1 and other critical functional proteins. In conclusion, this research provided the basic information for the functions of the CsKNOX family during organogenesis and stress response in tea plants, which was necessary for further functional characterization verification.

AB  - One of the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) associated with its progression that contributes to beta-amyloid (A beta) generation is oxidative stress (OS). Clinical data suggest that melatonin is a potent antioxidant that might be effective in the adjunctive therapy of this neurodegenerative disease. The present study aimed to explore the role of melatonin on behavioral changes and markers of OS in three rat models, namely, pinealectomy (pin) model of melatonin deficit, intracerebroventricular (icv)A beta(1-42) model of AD, and combination of both pin and A beta(1-42) model (pin+icvA beta(1-42)). The chronic injection with vehicle/melatonin (50 mg/kg, i.p. for 40 days) started on the same day of sham/pin and icv vehicle/A beta(1-42) infusion procedures. Anxiety in the open field and the elevated plus-maze test and cognitive responses in the object recognition test were tested between the 30th-35th day after the surgical procedures. Markers of OS in the frontal cortex (FC) and hippocampus were detected by the ELISA method. Melatonin treatment corrected the exacerbated anxiety response only in the pin+icvA beta(1-42) model while it alleviated the cognitive impairment in the three models. Pinealectomy disturbed the antioxidant system via enhanced SOD activity and decreased GSH levels both in the FC and hippocampus. The A beta(1-42) model decreased the SOD activity in the FC and elevated the MDA level in the two brain structures. The pin+icvA beta(1-42) model impaired the antioxidant system and elevated lipid peroxidation. Melatonin supplementation restored only the elevated MDA level of icvA beta(1-42) and pin+icvA beta(1-42) model in the hippocampus. In conclusion, our study reveals that the pin+icvA beta(1-42) rat model triggers more pronounced anxiety and alterations in markers of OS that may be associated with melatonin deficit concomitant to icvA beta(1-42)-induced AD pathology.

AB  - Cognitive impairment in the elderly is associated with alterations in bile acid (BA) metabolism. In this study, we observe elevated levels of serum conjugated primary bile acids (CPBAs) and ammonia in elderly individuals, mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, and aging rodents, with a more pronounced change in females. These changes are correlated with increased expression of the ileal apical sodium -bile acid transporter (ASBT), hippocampal synapse loss, and elevated brain CPBA and ammonia levels in rodents. In vitro experiments confirm that a CPBA, taurocholic acid, and ammonia induced synaptic loss. Manipulating intestinal BA transport using ASBT activators or inhibitors demonstrates the impact on brain CPBA and ammonia levels as well as cognitive decline in rodents. Additionally, administration of an intestinal BA sequestrant, cholestyramine, alleviates cognitive impairment, normalizing CPBAs and ammonia in aging mice. These findings highlight the potential of targeting intestinal BA absorption as a therapeutic strategy for age -related cognitive impairment.

AB  - Tissue homeostasis is critical for maintaining organ shape, size, and function. The condition is regulated by the balance between the generation of new cells and the loss of senescent cells, and it involves many factors and mechanisms. The midgut, an important part of the intestinal tract, is responsible for digestion and nutrient absorption in insects. LmDDX47, the ortholog of DEAD-box helicase 47 from Locusta migratoria, is indispensable for sustaining a normal midgut in the nymphs. However, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms remain to be elucidated. In this study, LmDDX47 knockdown resulted in atrophy of the midgut and gastric cecum in both nymph and adult locusts. After LmDDX47 knockdown, the number of regenerative and columnar cells in the midgut was significantly reduced, and cell death was induced in columnar tissue. LmDDX47 was localized to the nucleolus; this was consistent with the reduction in 18S rRNA synthesis in the LmDDX47 knockdown group. In addition, the acetylation and crotonylation levels of midgut proteins were significantly increased. Therefore, LmDDX47 could be a key regulator of midgut homeostasis, regulating 18S rRNA synthesis as well as protein acetylation and crotonylation in the migratory locust.

AB  - Diacylglycerol-O-acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1, EC 2.3.1.20) is a pivotal enzyme in plant triacylglycerol (TAG) biosynthesis. Previous work identified conserved di-arginine (R) motifs (R-R, R-X-R, and R-X-X-R) in its N-terminal cytoplasmic acyl-CoA binding domain. To elucidate their functional significance, we engineered R-rich sequences in the N-termini of Tropaeolum majus and Zea mays DGAT1s. Comparative analysis with their respective non-mutant constructs showed that deleting or substituting R with glycine in the N-terminal region of DGAT1 markedly reduced lipid accumulation in both Camelina sativa seeds and Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. Immunofluorescence imaging revealed co-localization of non-mutant and R-substituted DGAT1 with lipid droplets (LDs). However, disruption of an N-terminal di-R motif destabilizes DGAT1, alters LD organization, and impairs recombinant oleosin retention on LDs. Further evidence suggests that the di-R motif mediates DGAT1 retrieval from LDs to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), implicating its role in dynamic LD-ER protein trafficking. These findings establish the conserved di-R motifs as important regulators of DGAT1 function and LD dynamics, offering insights for the engineering of oil content in diverse biological systems.

AB  - A major risk factor for glaucomatous optic neuropathy is the level of intraocular pressure (IOP), which can lead to retinal ganglion cell axon injury and cell death. The optic nerve has a rostral unmyelinated portion at the optic nerve head followed by a caudal myelinated region. The unmyelinated region is differentially susceptible to IOP-induced damage in rodent models and human glaucoma. While several studies have analyzed gene expression changes in the mouse optic nerve following optic nerve injury, few were designed to consider the regional gene expression differences that exist between these distinct areas. We performed bulk RNA-sequencing on the retina and separately micro-dissected unmyelinated and myelinated optic nerve regions from naive C57BL/6 mice, mice after optic nerve crush, and mice with microbead-induced experimental glaucoma (total = 36). Gene expression patterns in the naive unmyelinated optic nerve showed significant enrichment of the Wnt, Hippo, PI3K-Akt, and transforming growth factor beta pathways, as well as extracellular matrix-receptor and cell membrane signaling pathways, compared to the myelinated optic nerve and retina. Gene expression changes induced by both injuries were more extensive in the myelinated optic nerve than the unmyelinated region, and greater after nerve crush than glaucoma. Changes present three and fourteen days after injury largely subsided by six weeks. Gene markers of reactive astrocytes did not consistently differ between injury states. Overall, the transcriptomic phenotype of the mouse unmyelinated optic nerve was significantly different from immediately adjacent tissues, likely dominated by expression in astrocytes, whose junctional complexes are inherently important in responding to IOP elevation.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the fermentation characteristics and nutritive value of two interesting forage species (maralfalfa and tagasaste) ensiled with molasses and beet pulp as additives. Ensilability parameters and chemical composition were analysed in two different stages of growth in maralfalfa (flowering and vegetative growing) and two different branch diameters in tagasaste (branches > 5mm, branches <= 5mm). According to ensilability results, four combinations with additives (two for tagasaste and two for maralfalfa) were ensiled at laboratory scale microsilos, in order to evaluate fermentative and nutritive parameters in two different conservation periods (35d and 70d). Tagasaste showed high dry matter (DM) content and fermentability ratio (FR) but a very low sugar content (WSC). Maralfalfa showed poor initial ensiling characteristics, low DM and WSC and high BC (buffering capacity). Supplementing tagasaste with molasses improves the fermentative composition in mini-silos with adequate ammonia-N and lactic acid concentrations detected. Moreover, the addition of beet pulp and molasses to the ensiled maralfalfa allows achieving the pH value under 4 and NH3-N content below 10%, with an interesting content of lactic acid improving the fermentation quality of silage.

AB  - This study investigates the content of some metals and metalloids in the flowers of three Aesculus cultivars (AHP, Aesculus hippocastanum pure species, with white flowers; AHH, Aesculus hippocastanum hybrid species, with pink flowers; and AXC, Aesculus x carnea, with red flowers) over a four-year period (2016-2019) using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP OES) and principal component analysis (PCA). The research focuses on assessing macro- and micro-elemental compositions, identifying variations in mineral uptake, and exploring potential correlations with soil composition. Results highlight significant differences in elemental profiles among the three species, despite similar total ash content. Potassium and phosphorus emerged as dominant macroelements, with AXC showing lower magnesium levels compared to AHP and AHH. Particularly intriguing was the detection of antimony in all cultivars, raising questions about its role and bioaccumulation pathways in floral tissues. Iron and aluminum concentrations varied significantly across species, indicating species-specific metal transport mechanisms. Nickel content showed temporal fluctuations, potentially influenced by climatic conditions and soil properties. PCA revealed distinct clustering patterns, linking elemental concentrations to specific species and years. This comprehensive analysis enhances understanding of metal absorption and distribution in ornamental plants, providing insights into their metabolic processes and potential implications for environmental monitoring and phytoremediation strategies.

AB  - Body size is one of the main proxies for understanding the biological aspects of fossil vertebrates. Body masses of five species of Cynognathia were obtained from 3D configurations of cranial and mandibular landmarks from 29 specimens. Equations based on centroid size from the literature of ungulates and calculated from carnivorous mammal database were used. In addition, the maximum size per species was obtained by geometric similarity and compared with estimates based on postcranial elements from recent literature. The values of body mass obtained from the centroid size do not present major discrepancies with those obtained from the postcranium, except in the larger specimens of Massetognathus and Exaeretodon. Geometric similarity is useful as a comparative method and for detecting over- or underestimates. Larger size ranges than previously reported were recorded for each cynognathian species. Among the small species, Andescynodon ranged from 1 to 6.5 kg and Pascualgnathus, 2.5 to 6 kg; medium-sized Massetognathus, 10 to 30 kg; and the large species, Cynognathus ranged 100 to 150 kg and Exaeretodon, 100 to 280 kg. The relationship between diet and body mass observed in extant mammals was used as a comparison to determine the possible ecological niche of cynognathians.

AB  - PDE11A is a little-studied phosphodiesterase sub-family that breaks down cAMP/cGMP, with the PDE11A4 isoform enriched in the memory-related hippocampal formation. Age-related increases in PDE11A expression occur in human and rodent hippocampus and cause age-related cognitive decline of social memories. Interestingly, age-related increases in PDE11A4 protein ectopically accumulate in spherical clusters that group together in the brain to form linear filamentous patterns termed "PDE11A4 ghost axons". The biophysical/physiochemical mechanisms underlying this age-related clustering are not known. Here, we determine if age-related clustering of PDE11A4 reflects liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS; biomolecular condensation), and if PDE11A inhibitors can reverse this LLPS. We show human and mouse PDE11A4 exhibit several LLPS-promoting sequence features, including intrinsically disordered regions, non-covalent pi-pi interactions, and prion-like domains that were particularly enriched in the N-terminal regulatory region. Further, multiple bioinformatic tools predict PDE11A4 undergoes LLPS. Consistent with these predictions, aging-like PDE11A4 clusters in HT22 hippocampal neuronal cells were membraneless spherical droplets that progressively fuse over time in a concentration-dependent manner. Deletion of the N-terminal intrinsically disordered region prevented PDE11A4 LLPS despite equal protein expression between WT and mutant constructs. 1,6-hexanediol, along with tadalafil and BC11-38 that inhibit PDE11A4, reversed PDE11A4 LLPS in HT22 hippocampal neuronal cells. Interestingly, PDE11A4 inhibitors reverse PDE11A4 LLPS independently of increasing cAMP/cGMP levels via catalytic inhibition. Importantly, orally dosed tadalafil reduced PDE11A4 ghost axons in old mouse ventral hippocampus by 50%. Thus, PDE11A4 exhibits the four defining criteria of LLPS, and PDE11A inhibitors reverse this age-related phenotype both in vitro and in vivo.

AB  - Currently, only birds have a pneumatic system, but in the past, this was common among several ornithodirans. Within Titanosauria, it was the saltasaurines that showed a high degree of postcranial pneumaticity. The objective of this work is analysing the extent of postcranial pneumaticity in saltasaurines and compare it with other derived titanosaurs. To carry out this work, presacral vertebrae, dorsal ribs, scapulae, coracoids and ilia of saltasaurines were analysed. The presacral vertebrae present a high degree of pneumatisation with a highly variable distribution of foramina, with some 'foramina zones', there is a homoplastic pattern of pneumaticity: presence of foramina connected to camellated tissue. With respect to the ilia, camellated tissue was recorded in all taxa. Instead, scapulae and coracoids, present camellated tissue in Saltasaurus and they cannot be pneumatised in Neuquensaurus. Comparing with other titanosaurs, we observe that there are 'foramina zones' for presacral and caudal vertebrae. It is also possible to establish that the pneumatisation of the dorsal ribs has a conservative pattern, not only in saltasaurines but also in the Saurischia clade, and the presence of pneumaticity in the ilia is frequent in the Lithostrotia and even outside, in rebbachisaurs.

AB  - The alpha-arrestin ARRDC3 is a recently discovered tumor suppressor in invasive breast cancer that functions as a multifaceted adaptor protein to control protein trafficking and cellular signaling. However, the molecular mechanisms that control ARRDC3 function are unknown. Other arrestins are known to be regulated by posttranslational modifications, suggesting that ARRDC3 may be subject to similar regulatory mechanisms. Here we report that ubiquitination is a key regulator of ARRDC3 function and is mediated primarily by two proline-rich PPXY motifs in the ARRDC3 C-tail domain. Ubiquitination and the PPXY motifs are essential for ARRDC3 function in regulating GPCR trafficking and signaling. Additionally, ubiquitination and the PPXY motifs mediate ARRDC3 protein degradation, dictate ARRDC3 subcellular localization, and are required for interaction with the NEDD4-family E3 ubiquitin ligase WWP2. These studies demonstrate a role for ubiquitination in regulating ARRDC3 function and reveal a mechanism by which ARRDC3 divergent functions are controlled.

AB  - Traditionally, the brain has been regarded as a relatively insensitive late-reacting tissue, with radiologically detectable damage not being reported at doses < 60 Gy. When NASA proposed interplanetary exploration missions, it was required to conduct an intensive health and safety evaluation of cancer, cardiovascular, and cognitive risks associated with exposure to deep space radiation (SR). The SR dose that astronauts on a mission to Mars are predicted to receive is similar to 300 mGy. Even after correcting for the higher RBE of the SR particles, the biologically effective SR dose (<1 Gy) would still be 60-fold lower than the threshold dose for clinically detectable neurological damage. Unexpectedly, the NASA-funded research program has consistently reported that low (<250 mGy) doses of SR induce deficits in multiple cognitive functions. This review will discuss these findings and the radical paradigm shifts in radiobiological principles for the brain that were required in light of these findings. These included a shift from cell killing to loss of function models, an expansion of the critical brain regions for radiation-induced cognitive impediments, and the concept that the neuron may not be the sole critical target for neurocognitive impairment. The accrued information on how SR exposure impacts neurocognitive performance may provide new opportunities to reduce neurocognitive impairment in brain cancer patients.

AB  - The application of traditional medicines for the treatment of diseases, including diabetic neuropathy (DN), has received great attention. The aim of this study was to investigate the ameliorative potential of naringin, a flavanone, to treat streptozotocin-induced DN in rat models. After the successful induction of diabetes, DN complications were measured by various behavioral tests after 4 weeks of post-induction of diabetes with or without treatment with naringin. Serum biochemical assays such as fasting blood glucose, HbA1c%, insulin, lipid profile, and oxidative stress parameters were determined. Proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha and IL-6, and neuron-specific markers such as BDNF and NGF, were also assessed. In addition, pancreatic and brain tissues were subjected to histopathology to analyze structural alterations. The diabetic rats exhibited increased paw withdrawal frequencies for the acetone drop test and decreased frequencies for the plantar test, hot plate test, and tail flick test. The diabetic rats also showed an altered level of proinflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress parameters, as well as altered levels of proinflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress parameters. Naringin treatment significantly improved these parameters and helped in restoring the normal architecture of the brain and pancreatic tissues. The findings show that naringin's neuroprotective properties may be linked to its ability to suppress the overactivation of inflammatory molecules and mediators of oxidative stress.

AB  - To understand complex diseases, high-throughput data are generated at large and multiple levels. However, extracting meaningful information from large datasets for comprehensive understanding of cell phenotypes and disease pathophysiology remains a major challenge. Despite tremendous advances in understanding molecular mechanisms of cancer and its progression, current knowledge appears discrete and fragmented. In order to render this wealth of data more integrated and thus informative, we have developed a GECIP toolbox to investigate the crosstalk and the responsible genes'/proteins' connectivity of enriched pathways from gene expression data. To implement this toolbox, we used mainly gene expression datasets of prostate cancer, and the three datasets were GSE17951, GSE8218, and GSE1431. The raw samples were processed for normalization, prediction of differentially expressed genes, and the prediction of enriched pathways for the differentially expressed genes. The enriched pathways have been processed for crosstalk degree calculations for which number connections per gene, the frequency of genes in the pathways, sharing frequency, and the connectivity have been used. For network prediction, protein-protein interaction network database FunCoup2.0 was used, and cytoscape software was used for the network visualization. In our results, we found that there were enriched pathways 27, 45, and 22 for GSE17951, GSE8218, and GSE1431, respectively, and 11 pathways in common between all of them. From the crosstalk results, we observe that focal adhesion and PI3K pathways, both experimentally proven central for cellular output upon perturbation of numerous individual/distinct signaling pathways, displayed highest crosstalk degree. Moreover, we also observe that there were more critical pathways which appear to be highly significant, and these pathways are HIF1a, hippo, AMPK, and Ras. In terms of the pathways' components, GSK3B, YWHAE, HIF1A, ATP1A3, and PRKCA are shared between the aforementioned pathways and have higher connectivity with the pathways and the other pathway components. Finally, we conclude that the focal adhesion and PI3K pathways are the most critical pathways, and since for many other pathways, high-rank enrichment did not translate to high crosstalk degree, the global impact of one pathway on others appears distinct from enrichment.

AB  - Hippocampus is one of the neurogenic zones where adult neurogenesis takes place. This process is quite complex and has a multicomponent regulation. A family of G protein-coupled trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs) was discovered only in 2001, and most of them (TAAR2-TAAR9) were primarily considered olfactory. Recent studies have shown, however, that they are also expressed in the mouse brain, particularly in limbic formations, and can play a role in the regulation of emotional behaviors. The observations in knockout mice indicate that at least two members of the family, TAAR2 and TAAR5, have an impact on the regulation of adult neurogenesis. In the present study, we analyzed the expression of TAARs in the murine and human hippocampus using public RNAseq datasets. Our results indicate a low but detectable level of certain TAARs expression in the hippocampal cells in selected high-quality transcriptomic datasets from both mouse and human samples. At the same time, we observed the difference between humans, where TAAR6 expression was the highest, and murine samples, where TAAR1, TAAR2, TAAR3, TAAR4 and TAAR5 are more pronouncedly expressed. These observations provide further support to the data gained in knockout mice, indicating a role of TAARs in the regulation of adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus.

AB  - Neurons transmit and receive information at specialized junctions called synapses. Excitatory synapses form at the junction between a presynaptic axon terminal and a postsynaptic dendritic spine. Supporting the shape and function of these junctions is a complex network of actin filaments and its regulators. Advances in microscopic techniques have enabled studies of the organization of actin at synapses and its dynamic regulation. In addition to highlighting recent advances in the field, we will provide a brief historical perspective of the understanding of synaptic actin at the synapse. We will also highlight key neuronal functions regulated by actin, including organization of proteins in the pre- and post- synaptic compartments and endocytosis of ion channels. We review the evidence that synapses contain distinct actin pools that differ in their localization and dynamic behaviors and discuss key functions for these actin pools. Finally, whole exome sequencing of humans with neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders has identified synaptic actin regulators as key disease risk genes. We briefly summarize how genetic variants in these genes impact neurotransmission via their impact on synaptic actin.

AB  - Intracellular calcium signaling underlies the astroglial control of synaptic transmission and plasticity. Mitochondria-endoplasmic reticulum contacts (MERCs) are key determinants of calcium dynamics, but their functional impact on astroglial regulation of brain information processing is unexplored. We found that the activation of astrocyte mitochondrial-associated type-1 cannabinoid (mtCB(1)) receptors determines MERC-dependent intracellular calcium signaling and synaptic integration. The stimulation of mtCB(1) receptors promotes calcium transfer from the endoplasmic reticulum to mitochondria through a specific molecular cascade, involving the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU). Physiologically, mtCB(1)-dependent mitochondrial calcium uptake determines the dynamics of cytosolic calcium events in astrocytes upon endocannabinoid mobilization. Accordingly, electrophysiological recordings in hippocampal slices showed that conditional genetic exclusion of mtCB(1) receptors or dominant-negative MCU expression in astrocytes blocks lateral synaptic potentiation, through which astrocytes integrate the activity of distant synapses. Altogether, these data reveal an endocannabinoid link between astroglial MERCs and the regulation of brain network functions.

AB  - Human organoids stand at the forefront of basic and translational research, providing experimentally tractable systems to study human development and disease. These stem cell-derived, in vitro cultures can generate a multitude of tissue and organ types, including distinct brain regions and sensory systems. Neural organoid systems have provided fundamental insights into molecular mechanisms governing cell fate specification and neural circuit assembly and serve as promising tools for drug discovery and understanding disease pathogenesis. In this review, we discuss several human neural organoid systems, how they are generated, advances in 3D imaging and bioengineering, and the impact of organoid studies on our understanding of the human nervous system.

AB  - Uterine leiomyoma is the most common tumor of the female reproductive system and originates from a single transformed myometrial smooth muscle cell. Despite the immense medical, psychosocial, and financial impact, the exact underlying mechanisms of leiomyoma pathobiology are poorly understood. Alterations of signaling pathways are thought to be instrumental in leiomyoma biology. Wnt/beta-catenin pathway appears to be involved in several aspects of the genesis of leiomyomas. For example, Wnt5b is overexpressed in leiomyoma, and the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway appears to mediate the role of MED12 mutations, the most common mutations in leiomyoma, in tumorigenesis. Moreover, Wnt/beta-catenin pathway plays a paracrine role where estrogen/progesterone treatment of mature myometrial or leiomyoma cells leads to increased expression of Wnt11 and Wnt16, which induces proliferation of leiomyoma stem cells and tumor growth. Constitutive activation of beta-catenin leads to myometrial hyperplasia and leiomyoma-like lesions in animal models. Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is also closely involved in mechanotransduction and extracellular matrix regulation and relevant alterations in leiomyoma, and crosstalk is noted between Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and other pathways known to regulate leiomyoma development and growth such as estrogen, progesterone, TGF beta, PI3K/Akt/mTOR, Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK, IGF, Hippo, and Notch signaling. Finally, evidence suggests that inhibition of the canonical Wnt pathway using beta-catenin inhibitors inhibits leiomyoma cell proliferation. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of leiomyoma development is essential for effective treatment. The specific Wnt/beta-catenin pathway molecules discussed in this review constitute compelling candidates for therapeutic targeting.

AB  - Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the most common histological category of thyroid cancer. In recent years, there has been an increasing number of studies on lncRNAs in PTC. Long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 887 (LINC00887) is a critical oncogene in developing other cancers. LINC00887 is upregulated in PTC samples but its role in PTC is currently unclear. This study aimed to investigate the impact the disruption of LINC00887 expression has on PTC progression. We performed a CRISPR/Cas9 strategy for the truncation of LINC00887 in BCPAP and TPC1 cell lines. Functional assays showed that LINC00887 knockdown in both TPC1 and BCPAP cells reduced cell proliferation, colony formation and migration, delayed the cell cycle, and increased apoptosis. These results strengthened the role of LINC00887 in cancer and showed for the first time that this lncRNA could be a potential oncogene in PTC, acting as a tumor promoter. Modulation of the immune system may be one of the etiopathogenic mechanisms of LINC00887 in PTC, as shown by the observed influence of this lncRNA on PD-L1 expression. In addition, the biological pathways of LINC00887 identified to date, such as EMT, the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway or the FRMD6-Hippo signaling pathway may also be relevant regulatory mechanisms operating in PTC.

AB  - Postpartum depression (PPD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among women. Clinically, the administration and withdrawal of supraphysiologic estradiol and progesterone (E2 + P) can cause affective symptom reoccurrence in women with a history of PPD, but not matched controls. To investigate the cellular basis underlying this differential affective response, lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) were derived from women with and without past PPD and compared transcriptomically in hormone conditions mimicking pregnancy and parturition: supraphysiologic E2 + P-addback; supraphysiologic E2 + P-withdrawal; and no added E2 + P (Baseline). RNA-sequencing identified unique differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in all hormone conditions, but the majority tended to be downregulated in PPD and observed in E2 + P-addback. Two of these DEGs were evolutionarily conserved cellular stress regulators: IMPACT, an integrative response protein maintaining translational homeostasis, and WWTR1, a transcriptional coactivator in the 'Hippo' pathway mediating cell proliferation and survival. Correspondingly, significant gene network modules were linked to cell cycle progression, estrogen response, and immune dysregulation, suggesting innate differences in intracellular signaling in PPD. In certain hormone conditions, PPD LCLs displayed increased GATA3 expression (an upstream regulator of IMPACT and WWTR1) and differentially phosphorylated eiF2 alpha (the ultimate downstream target of IMPACT). Taken together, these transcriptomic data primarily implicate innately dysregulated cellular responses as potentially influencing mood and/or escalating PPD risk. Furthermore, the intrinsic downregulation of IMPACT's translation and WWTR1's transcription networks may suggest a novel link between PPD and a compromised ability to maintain homeostasis in the context of cellular stress occurring during pregnancy and parturition.

AB  - Extensive studies indicate that mitochondria dysfunction is pivotal for Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis; while cumulative evidence suggests that increased mitochondrial stress response (MSR) may mitigate neurodegeneration in AD, explorations to develop a MSR-targeted therapeutic strategy against AD are scarce. We combined cell biology, molecular biology, and pharmacological approaches to unravel a novel molecular pathway by which NAD(+)-boosting agent nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) regulates MSR in AD models. Here, we report dyshomeostasis plasma UPRmt-mitophagy-mediated MSR profiles in AD patient samples. NMN restores NAD(+) metabolic profiles and improves MSR through the ATF4-dependent UPRmt pathway in AD-related cross-species models. At the organismal level, NAD(+) repletion with NMN supplementation ameliorates mitochondrial proteotoxicity, decreases hippocampal synaptic disruption, decreases neuronal loss, and brain atrophy in mice model of AD. Remarkably, omics features of the hippocampus with NMN show that NMN leads to transcriptional changes of genes and proteins involved in MSR characteristics, principally within the astrocyte unit rather than microglia and oligodendrocytes. In brief, our work provides evidence that MSR has an active role in the pathogenesis of AD, as reducing mitochondrial homeostasis via atf4 depletion in AD mice aggravates the hallmarks of the disease; conversely, bolstering mitochondrial proteostasis by NMN decreases protein aggregation, restores memory performance, and delays disease progression, ultimately translating to increased healthspan.

AB  - Clarifying the mechanisms underlying shape alterations during insect metamorphosis is important for understanding exoskeletal morphogenesis. The large horn of the Japanese rhinoceros beetle Trypoxylus dichotomus is the result of drastic metamorphosis, wherein it appears as a rounded shape during pupation and then undergoes remodeling into an angular adult shape. However, the mechanical mechanisms underlying this remodeling process remain unknown. In this study, we investigated the remodeling mechanisms of the Japanese rhinoceros beetle horn by developing a physical simulation. We identified three factors contributing to remodeling by biological experiments - ventral adhesion, uneven shrinkage, and volume reduction -which were demonstrated to be crucial for transformation using a physical simulation. Furthermore, we corroborated our findings by applying the simulation to the mandibular remodeling of stag beetles. These results indicated that physical simulation applies to pupal remodeling in other beetles, and the morphogenic mechanism could explain various exoskeletal shapes.

AB  - Neurotransmitter receptors partition into nanometer-scale subdomains within the postsynaptic membrane that are precisely aligned with presynaptic neurotransmitter release sites. While spatial coordination between pre-and postsynaptic elements is observed at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses, the functional signif-icance of this molecular architecture has been challenging to evaluate experimentally. Here we utilized an op-togenetic clustering approach to acutely alter the nanoscale organization of the postsynaptic inhibitory scaf-fold gephyrin while monitoring synaptic function. Gephyrin clustering rapidly enlarged postsynaptic area, laterally displacing GABAA receptors from their normally precise apposition with presynaptic active zones. Receptor displacement was accompanied by decreased synaptic GABAA receptor currents even though pre -synaptic release probability and the overall abundance and function of synaptic GABAA receptors remained unperturbed. Thus, acutely repositioning neurotransmitter receptors within the postsynaptic membrane pro-foundly influences synaptic efficacy, establishing the functional importance of precision pre-/postsynaptic molecular coordination at inhibitory synapses.

AB  - Immortalized cell lines with many advantages are widely used in various experimental contexts by many different labs. However, the absence of available cell lines poses difficulties for research in some species, such as camels. To establish an immortalized Bactrian camel fibroblast (iBCF) cell line and understand its biological characteristics, primary fibroblast cells from Bactrian camels were isolated and purified using enzymatic digestion in this study, and telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) vectors were introduced into primary BCF (pBCF) for continuous passage to 80 generations after screening with G418. The cell morphology of different generations was examined under a microscope. Cell cycle and viability were evaluated by flow cytometry and CCK-8 assay, respectively. Cellular genes expression was monitored by qPCR, immunofluorescence, and Western blot, respectively. Chromosomes were determined by karyotyping. The results showed that like most other cells, both pBCF and iBCF were sensitive to nutrient concentrations and adapted to culture in the medium with 4.5 g/L glucose and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) concentration. hTERT gene was introduced and stably expressed in iBCF cells, which promoted BCF cell immortalization. The fibroblast specific marker vimentin (VIM) is expressed in both pBCF and iBCF, but epithelial marker cytokeratin18 (CK18) expression is weak in BCF cells. Proliferation and viability detection showed that hTERT-induced iBCF exhibits faster growth rates and higher viability than pBCF. Karyotyping showed that iBCF maintained the same number and morphology of chromosomes as the pBCF. This study demonstrated that we have successfully constructed an immortalized Bactrian camel fibroblast cell line, which was named BCF23. The establishment of the BCF23 cell line provides a foundation for expanding camel-related research.

AB  - Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that neural stem cells (NSCs) have regenerative capacity after brain injuries, such as in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced NOD-like receptor thermal protein domain associated protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome triggers inflammatory responses and pyroptosis of cells; however, whether ROS-induced neuroinflammation modulates the fate of endogenous NSCs after SAH remains largely unknown. In this study, the level of IL-1 beta was increased in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with SAH. In an endovascular perforation model of SAH in mice, the secretion of IL-1 beta increased to a peak at 24 h following SAH, and the expression of Caspase1 and NLRP3 was elevated in the hippocampus. Primary cultured NSCs were incubated with hemoglobin (Hb) to mimic SAH in vitro. The cell viability, LDH release, intracellular ROS levels, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the expression of NLRP3 and pyroptosis indicators (GSDMD, ASC, and Caspase-1) in NSCs after SAH were examined to investigate the process of pyroptosis. We found that pyroptotic death featuring cellular swelling, cell membrane pore formation and elevated IL-1 beta was increased in cultured primary NSCs after Hb treatment, as was the expression of NLRP3, ASC, Caspase-1, and GSDMD. In addition, we found that ROS-induced pyroptosis of NSCs by activating the NLRP3/GSDMD pathway. These findings suggest that pyroptosis of NSCs induced by Hb can impede neural regeneration after SAH.

AB  - Myriads forces are at play during morphogenesis. Their concerted activity shapes individual cells, tissues and the whole embryo, representing the most awe-inspiring marvel of developmental biology. In spite of their prevalence, the potential instructive role of cell mechanics in fate determination and patterning has remained long neglected, in part due to the difficulties in translating the physical world of cells in molecular terms. The recent discovery of the principles of mechanotransduction, of how these impact on gene expression, is however starting to change this scenario, making mechanotransduction finally amenable to experimental dissection through genetics, molecular and bioengineering approaches. Here we review this emerging field, and a series of discoveries that potently bring back cell mechanics at the centerstage of vertebrate developmental biology. We discuss the role of actomyosin contractility as integrating platform between morphogens, lateral inhibition and mechanosignaling. We also review data indicating that supracellular pulling forces, coupled with solid-to -fluid changes in the material contexture of embryonic fields, may act as overarching mechanical "organizers ". The evidence also indicates that a continuum of forces is what ultimately locks "self-organizing " movements with cell fate, from the earliest pre-implantation decisions to the fine details of organogenesis. Notably, similar mechanisms are reawakened in organoids and in adult tissues during regeneration. Developmental biology has been correctly depicted, but recently often forgotten, as the "mother " of all biological disciplines. Investigations in developmental mechanics may revamp interest, and have a broad impact in the fields of regenerative medicine, stem cells and cancer biology.

AB  - The recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has refocused attention to the betacoronaviruses, only eight years after the emergence of another zoonotic betacoronavirus, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). While the wild source of SARS-CoV-2 may be disputed, for MERS-CoV, dromedaries are considered as source of zoonotic human infections. Testing 100 immune-response genes in 121 dromedaries from United Arab Emirates (UAE) for potential association with present MERS-CoV infection, we identified candidate genes with important functions in the adaptive, MHC-class I (HLA-A-24-like) and II (HLA-DPB1-like), and innate immune response (PTPN4, MAGOHB), and in cilia coating the respiratory tract (DNAH7). Some of these genes previously have been associated with viral replication in SARS-CoV-1/-2 in humans, others have an important role in the movement of bronchial cilia. These results suggest similar host genetic pathways associated with these betacoronaviruses, although further work is required to better understand the MERS-CoV disease dynamics in both dromedaries and humans.

AB  - Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs) are a group of autosomal recessive neurogenetic disorders caused by mutations in 14 different genes. CLN6 disease manifests as variant late-infantile NCL (vLINCL) or as an adult variant. In childhood, symptoms include speech delay, vision loss, cognitive and motor decline, seizures, and early death. An in-depth characterization of a naturally occurring Cln6 mutant mouse (Cln6nclf) is presented, with implications for translational research. The expanded phenotype provides data showing early death, vision loss, and motor deficits in male and female Cln6nclf mice. Diminished visual acuity in Cln6nclf mice was noted at 28 weeks of age, but the pathological loss of retinal layers began as early as 2 weeks or postnatal day 14 (P14). Apoptosis was confirmed by TUNEL staining in the Cln6nclf mouse brain at P8 and in the retina at P12. A peak in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression was established as a normal developmental phenomenon in the wild-type and Cln6nclf mouse brain cerebellum and the CA2-CA3 regions of the hippocampus at P8. In Cln6nclf mice, GFAP levels were elevated at P12 in the cerebellum and hippocampus. In the retina, a developmental peak in gliosis was absent, with increased astrogliosis noted at P6 and P8 in female and male Cln6nclf mice, respectively. This highlights the lack of a sex-dependent response in wild-type mice. These novel data position the Cln6nclf mouse model as a useful tool for screening potential therapeutics for human CLN6 disease.

AB  - In subjects implanted with intracranial electrodes, we use two different stories involving the same person (or place) to evaluate whether and to what extent context modulates human single-neuron responses. Nearly all neurons (97% during encoding and 100% during recall) initially responding to a person/place do not modulate their response with context. Likewise, nearly none (<1%) of the initially non-responsive neurons show conjunctive coding, responding to particular persons/places in a particular context during the tasks. In line with these findings, taking all neurons together it is possible to decode the person/place being depicted in each story, but not the particular story. Moreover, the neurons show consistent results across encoding and recall of the stories and during passive viewing of pictures. These results suggest a context invariant, non-conjunctive coding of memories at the single-neuron level in the human hippocampus and amygdala, in contrast to what has been described in other species.

KW  - NEURAL ACTIVITY
KW  - DISTRIBUTIONS
AB  - The spontaneous firing of neurons is modulated by brain state. Here, we examine how such modulation impacts the overall distribution of firing rates in neuronal populations of neocortical, hippocampal, and thalamic areas across natural and pharmacologically driven brain state transitions. We report that across all the examined combinations of brain area and state transition category, the structure of rate modulation is similar, with almost all fast-firing neurons experiencing proportionally weak modulation, while slow-firing neurons exhibit high inter-neuron variability in the modulation magnitude, leading to a stronger modulation on average. We further demonstrate that this modulation structure is linked to the left-skewed distribution of firing rates on the logarithmic scale and is recapitulated by bivariate log-gamma, but not Gaussian, distributions. Our findings indicate that a preconfigured log-rate distribution with rigid fast-firing neurons and a long left tail of malleable slow-firing neurons is a generic property of forebrain neuronal circuits.

AB  - Poor response of tumors to radiotherapy is a major clinical obstacle. Because of the dynamic characteristics of the epigenome, identification of possible epigenetic modifiers may be beneficial to confer radio-sensitivity. This research was set to examine the modulation of ectodermal-neural cortex 1 (ENC1) in radio-resistance in breast carcinoma (BC). In silico identification and immunohistochemical staining revealed that overexpression of ENC1 promoted BC metastasis to the bone and brain. Moreover, its overexpression promoted the translocation of YAP1/TAZ into the nucleus and enhanced expression of GLI1, CTGF, and FGF1 through the Hippo pathway. ENC1 expression was controlled by a similar to 10-kb long SE. ENC1-SEdistal deletion reduced ENC1 expression and inhibited the malignant behavior of BC cells and their resistance to radiotherapy. The binding sites on the ENC1-SE region enriched the shared sequence between TCF4 and ENC1 promoter. Knocking-down TCF4 inhibited luciferase activity and H3K27ac-enriched binding of the ENC1-SE region. Additionally, SE-driven ENC1 overexpression mediated by TCF4 may have clinical implications in radio-resistance in BC patients. Our findings indicated that ENC1 overexpression is mediated by SE and the downstream TCF4 to potentiate the Hippo/YAP1/TAZ pathway. Targeting this axis might be a therapeutic strategy for overcoming BC radio-resistance.

AB  - The exocyst is an evolutionarily conserved protein complex that regulates vesicular trafficking and scaffolds signal transduction. Key upstream components of the exocyst include monomeric RAL GTPases, which help mount cell-autonomous responses to trophic and immunogenic signals. Here, we present a quantitative proteomics-based characterization of dynamic and signal-dependent exocyst protein interactomes. Under viral infection, an Exo84 exocyst subcomplex assembles the immune kinase Protein Kinase R (PKR) together with the Hippo kinase Macrophage Stimulating 1 (MST1). PKR phosphorylates MST1 to activate Hippo signaling and inactivate Yes Associated Protein 1 (YAP1). By contrast, a Sec5 exocyst subcomplex recruits another immune kinase, TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1), which interacted with and activated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). RALB was necessary and sufficient for induction of Hippo and mTOR signaling through parallel exocyst subcomplex engagement, supporting the cellular response to virus infection and oncogenic signaling. This study highlights RALB-exocyst signaling subcomplexes as mechanisms for the integrated engagement of Hippo and mTOR signaling in cells challenged by viral pathogens or oncogenic signaling.

AB  - Diamondback moth (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae; Plutella xylostella L.) is a specialist insect of the Brassicaceae family, damaging economically important crops, such as cabbage and cauliflower. Glucosinolates, also known as 'mustard oil bombs' are present in all Brassicaceae members, of which sinigrin (allyl-glucosinolate or 2-propenylglucosinolate) is a major aliphatic compound. During herbivory, glucosinolates are converted to toxic isothiocyanates that deter insect pests. P. xylostella possesses glucosinolate sulfatases that desulfate them. Such a conversion renders them unfit for degradation to toxic products. Changes in the larval performance prompted us for RNA sequencing to understand probable adaptation mechanism under sinigrin stress. Differentially expressed genes were found to be related to larval cuticle proteins. Further, gene ontology and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) analyses depict genes belonging to the categories, integral component of membrane, cellular processes and those involved in biosynthesis of fatty acids. Upregulation of cuticular genes viz. larval cuticle protein-17 (LCP-17), cuticular protein-19 (2CP-19) and ATP binding cassette transporter C7 (ABCC7), ABCC16 was validated by qRT-PCR. Liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry analysis of whole larvae feeding on sinigrin and their separated cuticle, depicted abundance of fatty acids. Changes in the topography of the larval cuticle were evident by scanning electron microscopy. Expression of PxABCH1 was corroborated to its role in the transport of cuticular lipids. Notably, molecular docking of PxABCH1 with cuticular fatty acids showed favorable binding interactions. To summarize, integrated transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses suggest that in response to a diet containing a high dose of sinigrin, P. xylostella re-programs metabolic pathways related to fatty acid biosynthesis that directly influence insect development.

AB  - Squalene synthase (SQS) is the most direct key enzyme regulating squalene synthesis. To better understand the regulatory mechanisms of squalene biosynthesis, a 1423-bp long promoter region of the CoSQS gene was isolated from Camellia oleifera. Plant CARE and PLACE analysis affirmed the existence of the core promoter elements such as TATA and CAAT boxes and transcription factor binding sites like W-box and MYB in the isolated sequence. Exogenous factors regulating the CoSQS promoter were obtained by using Yeast one-hybrid screening, and the key transcription factor CoWRKY15 was found. AOS (Antibody Optimization System) analysis showed that CoWRKY15 had the highest interactions with a confidence level of 0.9026. Bioinformatics analysis showed that CoWRKY15 belonged to class 2 of the WRKY gene family. The results of subcellular localization showed that CoWRKY15 functioned in the nucleus. The results of CoWRKY15 promoter analysis showed that 8 out of 14 cis-elements with annotatable functions were related to the light response. The region of the CoSQS promoter that interacts with CoWRKY15 is -186 bp similar to-536 bp. The histochemical assay and squalene content suggested that the CoSQS promoter could drive the expression of GUS gene and specific promotion of CoSQS expression. It was found that CoWRKY15 could act on the -186 bp similar to-536 bp CoSQS promoter to regulate the expression of CoSQS and the content of squalene in C. oleifera seed kernels.

AB  - To avoid the activation of plant defenses and ensure sustained feeding, aphids are assumed to use their mouthparts to deliver effectors into plant cells. A recent study has shown that effectors detected near feeding sites are differentially distributed in plant tissues. However, the precise process of effector delivery into specific plant compartments is unknown. The acrostyle, a cuticular organ located at the tip of maxillary stylets that transiently binds plant viruses via its stylin proteins, may participate in this specific delivery process. Here, we demonstrate that Mp10, a saliva effector released into the plant cytoplasm during aphid probing, binds to the acrostyles of Acyrthosiphon pisum and Myzus persicae. The effector probably interacts with Stylin-03 as a lowered Mp10-binding to the acrostyle was observed upon RNAi-mediated reduction in Stylin-03 production. In addition, Stylin-03 and Stylin-01 RNAi aphids exhibited changes in their feeding behavior as evidenced by electrical penetration graph experiments showing longer aphid probing behaviors associated with watery saliva release into the cytoplasm of plant cells. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the acrostyle also has effector binding capacity and supports its role in the delivery of aphid effectors into plant cells.

AB  - Individuals with autism often experience gastrointestinal issues but the cause is unknown. Many gene mutations that modify neuronal synapse function are associated with autism and therefore may impact the enteric nervous system that regulates gastrointestinal function. A missense mutation in the Nlgn3 gene encoding the cell adhesion protein Neuroligin-3 was identified in two brothers with autism who both experienced severe gastrointestinal dysfunction. Mice expressing this mutation (Nlgn3(R451C) mice) are a well-studied preclinical model of autism and show autism-relevant characteristics, including impaired social interaction and communication, as well as repetitive behaviour. We previously showed colonic dysmotility in response to GABAergic inhibition and increased myenteric neuronal numbers in the small intestine in Nlgn3(R451C) mice bred on a mixed genetic background. Here, we show that gut dysfunction is a persistent phenotype of the Nlgn3 R451C mutation in mice backcrossed onto a C57BL/6 background. We report that Nlgn3(R451C) mice show a 30.9% faster gastrointestinal transit (p = 0.0004) in vivo and have 6% longer small intestines (p = 0.04) compared to wild-types due to a reduction in smooth muscle tone. In Nlgn3(R451C) mice, we observed a decrease in resting jejunal diameter (proximal jejunum: 10.6% decrease, p = 0.02; mid: 9.8%, p = 0.04; distal: 11.5%, p = 0.009) and neurally regulated dysmotility as well as shorter durations of contractile complexes (mid: 25.6% reduction in duration, p = 0.009; distal: 30.5%, p = 0.004) in the ileum. In Nlgn3(R451C) mouse colons, short contractions were inhibited to a greater extent (57.2% by the GABA(A) antagonist, gabazine, compared to 40.6% in wild-type mice (p = 0.007). The inhibition of nitric oxide synthesis decreased the frequency of contractile complexes in the jejunum (WT p = 0.0006, Nlgn3(R451C) p = 0.002), but not the ileum, in both wild-type and Nlgn3(R451C) mice. These findings demonstrate that changes in enteric nervous system function contribute to gastrointestinal dysmotility in mice expressing the autism-associated R451C missense mutation in the Neuroligin-3 protein.

AB  - Thermal treatments of milk induce changes in the properties of milk whey proteins. The aim of this study was to investigate the specific changes related to nutrients in the whey proteins of dairy cow milk after pasteurization at 85 degrees C for 15 s or ultra-high temperature (UHT) at 135 degrees C for 15 s. A total of 223 whey proteins were confidently identified and quantified by TMT-based global discovery proteomics in this study. We found that UHT thermal treatment resulted in an increased abundance of 17 proteins, which appeared to show heat insensitivity. In contrast, 15 heat-sensitive proteins were decreased in abundance after UHT thermal treatment. Some of the heat-sensitive proteins were connected with the biological immune functionality, suggesting that UHT thermal treatment results in a partial loss of immune function in the whey proteins of dairy cow milk. The information reported here will considerably expand our knowledge about the degree of heat sensitivity in the whey proteins of dairy cow milk in response to different thermal treatments and offer a knowledge-based reference to aid in choosing dairy products. It is worth noting that the whey proteins (lactoperoxidase and lactoperoxidase) in milk that were significantly decreased by high heat treatment in a previous study (142 degrees C) showed no significant difference in the present study (135 degrees C). These results may imply that an appropriately reduced heating intensity of UHT retains the immunoactive proteins to the maximum extent possible.

AB  - Metabolic reprogramming is considered one of the hallmarks of cancer in which cancer cells reprogram some of their metabolic cascades, mostly driven by the specific chemical microenvironment in cancer tissues. The altered metabolic pathways are increasingly being considered as potential targets for cancer therapy. In this view, Aldolase A (ALDOA), a key glycolytic enzyme, has been validated as a candidate oncogene in several cancers. The current study aimed to investigate the role of ALDOA in the initiation and development of colorectal cancer (CRC). In this study, we observed an elevated expression of ALDOA in human CRC tissues and a positive correlation of elevated ALDOA expression with tumor size, invasion depth, LNM, and TNM stage. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that elevated ALDOA levels correlated with a poor prognosis in CRC patients with stage I-III, whereas the prognosis tends to be favorable in patients with advanced CRC. In addition, loss of function and gain of function experiments showed that ALDOA promoted CRC cell proliferation and migration in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, high ALDOA expression inhibited AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation possibly through regulating cellular glycolysis or the formation of v-ATPase-regulator-AXIN/LKB1 complex, which led to Yes-associated protein (YAP) unphosphorylation and enhanced the proliferative and migratory potential of CRC cells. Finally, the positive correlation between ALDOA and YAP signaling was also confirmed in clinical CRC tissues and the public data. Herein, ALDOA was identified to be a new metabolic regulator of YAP that suppresses the activation of AMPK signaling.

AB  - Myotragus balearicus is the terminal species of a Caprinae lineage that inhabited the Balearic Islands since the Messinian. Myotragus balearicus had a relatively small brain, reported to be half the size of a contemporary bovid of similar size. This study presents a reassessment of its brain size and anatomy. We demonstrate that the brain of M. balearicus is only 17% smaller when compared to Late Miocene taxa. Since the ancestors of M. balearicus were isolated on the Balearics in the Late Miocene, we deduce that the small brain size of M. balearicus is a feature largely retained from its continental ancestor and only partially the result of geographic isolation. The reduction in brain size can be attributed to reduction of the occipital region. We hypothesise that neuroanatomical changes during the evolutionary process of dwarfism were likely influenced by the absence of ecologically relevant predators.

AB  - Palaeogene South American faunas include enigmatic ungulates that cannot be classified unequivocally within any of the main South American (SA) Native Ungulates clades (Litopterna, Notoungulata, Astrapotheria, Pyrotheria and Xenungulata) because they retain plesiomorphic features, resembling Laurasian 'archaic ungulates' traditionally classified within the order 'Condylarthra'. Most SA 'condylarths' are known by partial dental series and isolated teeth and unassociated postcranial remains, hampering comparisons with better-known ungulates. Here, we describe a nearly complete skull and associated mandible of an SA 'condylarth', Talquinodus puertai gen. et sp. nov., preserving most of the dentition and basicranium, derived from middle Eocene rocks of the Sarmiento Formation at Central Patagonia. Talquinodus shows a combination of plesiomorphic traits (complete dentition with bunolophodont cheek teeth, ring like ectotympanic, retention of stapedial system, etc.), combined with some autapomorphies, as the reduction of the m3 talonid. Our phylogenetic analyses support consistently that Talquinodus belongs to the SA radiation of Euungulata along with Litopterna, Notoungulata and Astrapotheria. However, the internal relationships could not be resolved unambiguously: Talquinodus could be a didolodontid related to the origin of Litopterna, or could be part of a separate radiation of South American archaic ungulates, along Depaulacoutoia, Lamegoia and Escribania, with no descendants in post-Eocene faunas.

AB  - The internalization and degradation of myelin in glia contributes to the resolution of neuroinflammation and influences disease progression. The identification of a three-dimensional experimental model to study myelin processing under neuroinflammation will offer a novel approach for studying treatment strategies favoring inflammation resolution and neuroprotection. Here, by using a model of neuroinflammation in hippocampal explants, we show that myelin debris accumulated immediately after insult and declined at 3 days, a time point at which tentative repair processes were observed. Olig2+ oligodendrocytes upregulated the LRP1 receptor and progressively increased MBP immunoreactivity both at peri-membrane sites and within the cytosol. Oligodendrocyte NG2+ precursors increased in number and immunoreactivity one day after insult, and moderately internalized MBP particles. Three days after insult MBP was intensely coexpressed by microglia and, to a much lesser extent, by astrocytes. The engulfment of both MBP+ debris and whole MBP+ cells contributed to the greatest microglia response. In addition to improving our understanding of the spatial-temporal contribution of glial scarring to myelin uptake under neuroinflammation, our findings suggest that the exposure of hippocampal explants to LPS + IFN-& gamma;-induced neuroinflammation may represent a valuable demyelination model for studying both the extrinsic and intrinsic myelin processing by glia under neuroinflammation.

AB  - Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains a significant risk factor for post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE). The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the injury-induced epileptogenesis are under investigation. The dentate gyrus-a structure that is highly susceptible to injury-has been implicated in the evolution of seizure development. Methods: Utilizing the murine unilateral focal control cortical impact (CCI) injury, we evaluated seizure onset using 24/7 EEG video analysis at 2-4 months post-injury. Cellular changes in the dentate gyrus and hilus of the hippocampus were quantified by unbiased stereology and Imaris image analysis to evaluate Prox1-positive cell migration, astrocyte branching, and morphology, as well as neuronal loss at four months post-injury. Isolation of region-specific astrocytes and RNA-Seq were performed to determine differential gene expression in animals that developed post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE+) vs. those animals that did not (PTE-), which may be associated with epileptogenesis. Results: CCI injury resulted in 37% PTE incidence, which increased with injury severity and hippocampal damage. Histological assessments uncovered a significant loss of hilar interneurons that coincided with aberrant migration of Prox1-positive granule cells and reduced astroglial branching in PTE+ compared to PTE- mice. We uniquely identified Cst3 as a PTE+-specific gene signature in astrocytes across all brain regions, which showed increased astroglial expression in the PTE+ hilus. Conclusions: These findings suggest that epileptogenesis may emerge following TBI due to distinct aberrant cellular remodeling events and key molecular changes in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus.

AB  - From in situ growth to invasive dissemination is the most lethal attribute of various tumor types. This transition is majorly mediated by the dynamic interplay between two cancer hallmarks, EMT and cell cycle. In this study, we applied nonlinear association analysis in 33 cancer types and found that most signaling receptors simultaneously associating with EMT and cell cycle are potential tumor suppressors. Here we find that a top co-associated receptor, Neogenin (NEO1), inhibits colorectal cancer (CRC) and Glioma in situ growth and metastasis by forming a complex with Merlin (NF2), and subsequent simultaneous promoting the phosphorylation of YAP. Furthermore, Neogenin protein level is associated with good prognosis and correlates with Merlin status in CRC and Glioma. Collectively, our results define Neogenin as a tumor suppressor in CRC and Glioma that acts by restricting oncogenic signaling by the Merlin-YAP pathway, and suggest Neogenin as a candidate therapeutic agent for CRC and Glioma.

AB  - The hippocampus, well known for its role in episodic memory, might also be an important brain region for extracting structure from our experiences in order to guide future decisions. Recent evidence in rodents suggests that the hippocampus supports decision making by representing task structure in cooperation with the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Here, we examine how the human hippocampus and OFC represent task structure during an associative learning task that required learning of both context-determined and context-invariant probabilistic associations. We find that after learning, hippocampal and lateral OFC representations differentiated between context-determined and context-invariant task structures. The degree of this differentiation within the hippocampus and lateral OFC is highly correlated. These results advance our understanding of the hippocampus and suggest that the hippocampus and OFC support goal-directed behavior by representing

T2  - CELL REPORTS
LA  - English
KW  - REMOVES H2A.Z
AB  - Rapid removal of histone H2A.Z from neuronal chromatin is a key step in learning-induced gene expression and memory formation, but mechanisms underlying learning-induced H2A.Z removal are unclear. Anp32e was recently identified as an H2A.Z-specific histone chaperone that removes H2A.Z from nucleosomes in dividing cells, but its role in non-dividing neurons is unclear. Moreover, prior studies investigated Anp32e function under steady-state rather than stimulus-induced conditions. Here, we show that Anp32e regulates H2A.Z binding in neurons under steady-state conditions, with lesser impact on stimulus-induced H2A.Z removal. Functionally, Anp32e depletion leads to H2A.Z-dependent impairment in transcription and dendritic arborization in cultured hippocampal neurons, as well as impaired recall of contextual fear memory and transcriptional regulation. Together, these data indicate that Anp32e regulates behavioral and morphological outcomes by preventing H2A.Z accumulation in chromatin rather than by regulating activity-mediated H2A.Z dynamics.

AB  - The Picornavirales include viruses that infect vertebrates, insects, and plants. It was believed that they pack only their genomic mRNA in the particles; thus, we envisaged these viruses as excellent model systems for studies of mRNA modifications. We used LC-MS to analyze digested RNA isolated from particles of the sacbrood and deformed wing iflaviruses as well as of the echovirus 18 and rhinovirus 2 picornaviruses. Whereas in the picornavirus RNAs we detected only N-6-methyladenosine and 2'-O-methylated nucleosides, the iflavirus RNAs contained a wide range of methylated nucleosides, such as 1-methyladenosine (m(1)A) and 5-methylcytidine (m(5)C). Mapping of m(1)A and m(5)C through RNA sequencing of the SBV and DWV RNAs revealed the presence of tRNA molecules. Both modifications were detected only in tRNA. Further analysis revealed that tRNAs are present in form of 3' and 5' fragments and they are packed selectively. Moreover, these tRNAs are typically packed by other viruses.

AB  - Microglia are critical in brain development and Alzheimer???s disease (AD) etiology. Down syndrome (DS) is the most common genetic developmental disorder and risk factor for AD. Surprisingly, little information is avail-able on the impact of trisomy of human chromosome 21 (Hsa21) on microglial functions during DS brain development and in AD in DS. Using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-based organoid and chimeric mouse models, we report that DS microglia exhibit an enhanced synaptic pruning function, which alters neuronal synaptic functions. In response to human brain tissue-derived pathological tau, DS microglia un-dergo cellular senescence and exhibit elevated type-I-interferon signaling. Mechanistically, knockdown of Hsa21-encoded type I interferon receptors, IFNARs, rescues the DS microglial phenotypes both during brain development and in response to pathological tau. Our findings provide in vivo evidence that human microglia respond to pathological tau by exhibiting dystrophic phenotypes. Targeting IFNARs may improve DS micro-glial functions and prevent senescence.

AB  - Soil is a main source of fluoride for plants. The tea plants (Camellia sinensis) accumulate excessive amounts of fluoride in their leaves compared to other plants, but their fluoride tolerance mechanism is poorly understood. A chloroplast fluoride efflux gene (CsABCB9) was newly discovered by using transcriptome analysis, cloned from Camellia sinensis, and its function was demonstrated in the fluoride detoxication mechanism in Escherichia coli/Xenopus laevis oocytes and Arabidopsis thaliana. CsABCB9 is expressed in tea leaves upon F- treatment. The growth of tea, E. coli, and Arabidopsis were inhibited by F- treatment. However, growth of CsABCB9-overexpression in E. coli was shown to increase with lower fluoride content under F- treatment compared to the control. Furthermore, chlorophyll, xanthophyll and soluble sugar contents of CsABCB9-overexpression in Arabidopsis were improved under F- treatment compared to the wild type. CsABCB9 functions in fluoride transport, and the mechanism by which CsABCB9 improves fluoride resistance in tea is mainly chloroplast protection through fluoride efflux.

AB  - Previously, we found that basal corticosterone pulsatility significantly impacts the vulnerability for developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Rats that exhibited PTSD-phenotype were characterized by blunted basal corticosterone pulsatility amplitude and a blunted corticosterone response to a stressor. This study sought to identify the mechanisms underlining both the loss of pulsatility and differences in downstream responses. Serial blood samples were collected manually via jugular vein cannula at 10-min intervals to evaluate suppression of corticosterone following methylprednisolone administration. The rats were exposed to predator scent stress (PSS) after 24 h, and behavioral responses were assessed 7 days post-exposure for retrospective classification into behavioral response groups. Brains were harvested for measurements of the glucocorticoid receptor, mineralocorticoid receptor, FK506-binding protein-51 and arginine vasopressin in specific brain regions to assess changes in hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) regulating factors. Methylprednisolone produced greater suppression of corticosterone in the PTSD-phenotype group. During the suppression, the PTSD-phenotype rats showed a significantly more pronounced pulsatile activity. In addition, the PTSD-phenotype group showed distinct changes in the ventral and dorsal CA1, dentate gyrus as well as in the paraventricular nucleus and supra-optic nucleus. These results demonstrate a pre-trauma vulnerability state that is characterized by an over-reactivity of the HPA and changes in its regulating factors.

AB  - A high-fructose intake is metabolically analogous to a high-fat diet. The impact of highfructose intake was investigated in spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) and hypertriacylglycerolemic (HTG) rats to find out the impact of which risk factor of metabolic syndrome - hypertension or hypertriacylglycerolemia - will cause more complications. Rats were fed a standard or a fructose diet (F60) with 60% of added fructose for 5 weeks. The F60 diet increased the total serum cholesterol content of both HTG-F60 and SHR-F60 rats. Further, in SHR-F60 it increased serum triacylglycerols, TBARS in the liver, a specific activity of NAGA in the kidney, aggravated glucose tolerance, deteriorated synaptic plasticity, and reduced somatic and dendritic responses in the hippocampus. SHR rats were more sensitive to the F60 diet, suggesting that hypertension along with a high-fructose intake result in a more pronounced disorder compared to hypertriacylglycerolemia. This work wants to draw attention to fructose-induced health risks associated with hypertension.

AB  - Combined hepatocellular carcinoma-cholangiocarcinoma (cHCC-CCA) is a challenging primary liver cancer subtype with limited treatment options and a devastating prognosis. Recent studies have underscored the context-dependent roles of SOX9 in liver cancer formation in a preventive manner. Here, we revealed that liver-specific developmental Sox9 elimination using Alb-Cre;Sox9(flox/flox) (LKO) and CRISPR/Cas9-based tumor-specific acute Sox9 elimination (CKO) in SB-HDTVI-based Akt-YAP1 (AY) and Akt-NRAS (AN) cHCC-CCA models showed contrasting responses. LKO abrogates the AY CCA region while stimulating poorly differentiated HCC proliferation, whereas CKO prevents AY and AN cHCC-CCA development irrespective of tumor cell fate. Additionally, AN, but not AY, tumor formation partially depends on the Sox9-Dnmt1 cascade. SOX9 is dispensable for AY-mediated, HC-derived, LPC-like immature CCA formation but is required for their maintenance and transformation into mature CCA. Therapeutic Sox9 elimination using the OPN-CreERT2 strain combined with inducible Sox9 iKO specifically reduces AY but not AN cHCC-CCA tumors. This necessitates the careful consideration of genetic liver cancer studies using developmental Cre and somatic mutants, particularly for genes involved in liver development. Our findings suggest that SOX9 elimination may hold promise as a therapeutic approach for a subset of cHCC-CCA and highlight the need for further investigation to translate these preclinical insights into personalized clinical applications.

AB  - Liver fibrosis is an aberrant wound healing response to tissue injury characterized by excessive extracellular matrix deposition and loss of normal liver architecture. Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) activation is regards to be the major process in liver fibrogenesis which is dynamic and reversible. Both Hippo signaling core factor Yap and Hedgehog (Hh) signaling promote HSCs transdifferentiation thereby regulating the repair process of liver injury. However, the molecular function of YAP and the regulation between Yap and Hh during fibrogenesis remain uncertain. In this study, the essential roles of Yap in liver fibrosis were investigated. Yap was detected to be increased in liver fibrotic tissue by the thioacetamide (TAA)-induced zebrafish embryonic and adult models. Inhibition of Yap by both embryonic morpholino interference and adult's inhibitor treatment was proved to alleviate TAA-induced liver lesions by and histology and gene expression examination. Transcriptomic analysis and gene expression detection showed that Yap and Hh signaling pathway have a cross talking upon TAA-induced liver fibrosis. In addition, TAA induction promoted the nuclear colocalization of YAP and Hh signaling factor GLI2 alpha. This study demonstrates that Yap and Hh play synergistic protective roles in liver fibrotic response and provides new theoretical insight concerning the mechanisms of fibrosis progression.

AB  - Neuronal apoptosis has been well-recognized as a critical mediator in the pathogenesis of depressive disorders. Tissue kallikrein-related peptidase 8 (KLK8), a trypsin-like serine protease, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several psychiatric disorders. The present study aimed to explore the potential function of KLK8 in hippocampal neuronal cell apoptosis associated with depressive disorders in rodent models of chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced depression. It was found that depression-like behavior in CUMS-induced mice was associated with hippocampal KLK8 upregulation. Transgenic overexpression of KLK8 exacerbated, whereas KLK8 deficiency attenuated CUMS-induced depression-like behaviors and hippocampal neuronal apoptosis. In HT22 murine hippocampal neuronal cells and primary hippocampal neurons, adenovirus-mediated overexpression of KLK8 (Ad-KLK8) was sufficient to induce neuron apoptosis. Mechanistically, it was identified that the neural cell adhesion molecule 1 (NCAM1) may associate with KLK8 in hippocampal neurons as KLK8 proteolytically cleaved the NCAM1 extracellular domain. Immunofluorescent staining exhibited decreased NCAM1 in hippocampal sections obtained from mice or rats exposed to CUMS. Transgenic overexpression of KLK8 exacerbated, whereas KLK8 deficiency largely prevented CUMS-induced loss of NCAM1 in the hippocampus. Both adenovirus-mediated overexpression of NCAM1 and NCAM1 mimetic peptide rescued KLK8-overexpressed neuron cells from apoptosis. Collectively, this study identified a new pro-apoptotic mechanism in the hippocampus during the pathogenesis of CUMS-induced depression via the upregulation of KLK8, and raised the possibility of KLK8 as a potential therapeutic target for depression.

AB  - The Vacan fauna was defined by the fossil mammalian content of the Vacan Member (Sarmiento Formation) at Canadon Vaca fossil locality (Chubut Province, Argentina), although several other local faunas from nearby areas (e.g. Rio Chico oeste) were also attributed to the Vacan age estimated ca. 45-42 Ma time interval. This fauna contains poorly understood native South American ungulates, such as the Henricosborniidae. This group includes Henricosbornia, Peripantostylops, Othnielmarshia, Simpsonotus, Orome, and Nanolophodon, but both its definition and phylogenetic relationships remain unclear. In particular, Othnielmarshia and Peripantostylops were established as guide taxa of the Vacan fauna, but their knowledge has remained obscure since more than 50 years. The re-study of the Ameghino's collection and the specimens collected by the Scarritt Pocket Expeditions in Canadon Vaca and other nearby localities allows us to 1) provide an update on the systematic status of Othnielmarshia and Peripantostylops; 2) emend their diagnoses; 3) establish comparisons with other related taxa from the same period, proposing synonymies; and 4) recognise both taxa in several local faunas from the Sarmiento and Las Flores formations. We also highlight the variability in certain controversial characters of henricosborniids, which should be evaluated for the definition of the group.

AB  - Microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, play important roles during development. Although bi-direc-tional communication between microglia and neuronal progenitors or immature neurons has been demon-strated, the main sites of interaction and the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. By using advanced methods, here we provide evidence that microglial processes form specialized contacts with the cell bodies of developing neurons throughout embryonic, early postnatal, and adult neurogenesis. These early develop-mental contacts are highly reminiscent of somatic purinergic junctions that are instrumental for microglia-neuron communication in the adult brain. The formation and maintenance of these junctions is regulated by functional microglial P2Y12 receptors, and deletion of P2Y12Rs disturbs proliferation of neuronal precur-sors and leads to aberrant cortical cytoarchitecture during development and in adulthood. We propose that early developmental formation of somatic purinergic junctions represents an important interface for microglia to monitor the status of immature neurons and control neurodevelopment.

AB  - Candida albicans is both a commensal and an opportunistic fungal pathogen. Invading hyphae of C. albicans secrete candidalysin, a pore-forming peptide toxin. To prevent cell death, epithelial cells must protect themselves from direct damage induced by candidalysin and by the mechanical forces exerted by expanding hyphae. We identify two key Ca2+-dependent repair mechanisms employed by epithelial cells to withstand candidalysin-producing hyphae. Using camelid nanobodies, we demonstrate candidalysin secretion directly into the invasion pockets induced by elongating C. albicans hyphae. The toxin induces oscillatory increases in cytosolic [Ca2+], which cause hydrolysis of PtdIns(4,5)P-2 and loss of cortical actin. Epithelial cells dispose of damaged membrane regions containing candidalysin by an Alg-2/Alix/ESCRT-III-dependent blebbing process. At later stages, plasmalemmal tears induced mechanically by invading hyphae are repaired by exocytic insertion of lysosomal membranes. These two repair mechanisms maintain epithelial integrity and prevent mucosal damage during both commensal growth and infection by C. albicans.

AB  - ObjectiveTricho-rhino-phalangeal syndrome-1 (TRPS1), an atypical GATA transcription factor, plays a critical role in diverse physiological and pathological processes and holds potential as a biomarker for diseases and targeted tumor therapies. This study explores TRPS1 expression in ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC), its correlation with patient prognosis, and its involvement in OCCC pathogenesis.Research objectives and methodsTo investigate TRPS1 expression, we analyzed ovarian tissues from 50 OCCC patients and 25 normal tissues (from patients with uterine leiomyoma) via immunohistochemistry. Statistical methods, including Chi-square tests, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, and Cox regression, were employed to evaluate the correlation between TRPS1 expression and clinicopathological parameters. In OCCC cell lines (TOV21G and ES-2), TRPS1 expression was quantified using qRT-PCR and Western blot. Functional studies were conducted by silencing TRPS1 in TOV21G cells with small interfering RNA and inducing overexpression in ES-2 cells using a plasmid. Cellular proliferation and migration were assessed through CCK-8, colony formation, and Transwell assays. Finally, Western blot analysis was performed to investigate the link between TRPS1 and EMT-related molecular pathways.ResultsTRPS1 protein expression was significantly higher in OCCC tissues compared to normal tissues and was positively associated with lymph node metastasis and advanced clinical stage. High TRPS1 expression was linked to shorter overall and recurrence-free survival in OCCC patients. In vitro, TRPS1 knockdown suppressed cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, accompanied by reduced levels of invasion-promoting proteins (N-cadherin, MMP2, MMP9) and increased expression of the invasion-inhibiting protein E-cadherin. Conversely, TRPS1 overexpression promoted the expression of invasion-promoting proteins.ConclusionsTRPS1 is overexpressed in OCCC and is associated with poor prognosis, serving as an independent predictor of patient outcomes. Its elevated expression enhances OCCC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by regulating proteins involved in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway. These findings highlight TRPS1 as a critical player in OCCC pathogenesis and a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for disease management.

AB  - BackgroundPhosphodiesterase type 4D (PDE4D) breaks down cyclic AMP (cAMP) reducing the signaling of this intracellular second messenger which plays a major role in melanocyte pathophysiology. In advanced melanoma, expression of PDE4D is increased, plays a role in tumor invasion and is negatively associated with survival. In the current work, we investigated the role of PDE4D in the resistance of BRAF-mutated melanoma to mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway-targeted therapy.MethodsEstablished human melanoma cell line sensitive and resistant to BRAF and MEK inhibitors and tumor tissues from melanoma patients were used in this study. Immunoblotting was used to analyze protein expression and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR was used to analyze mRNA expression. DNA methylation analysis was evaluated via bisulfite treatment followed by quantitative PCR. Cell viability was measured by clonogenic assays or spheroid cultures. Cell xenograft experiments in immunodeficient mice were used to validate the results in vivo.ResultsAnalysis of baseline tumors from patients with BRAFV600E-mutated melanoma treated with MAPK inhibitors showed that higher PDE4D expression in situ predicted worse survival in patients. Furthermore, acquired resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors was associated with overexpression of PDE4D in situ and ex vivo. The overexpression of the PDE4D5 isoform in melanoma cells resistant to targeted therapies was explained by demethylation or deletion of a CpG island located upstream of the PDE4D5 promoter. We further showed that PDE4D overexpression allowed RAF1 activation, promoting a switch from BRAF to RAF1 isoform in BRAF-mutated melanoma, favoring resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors. As a result, pharmacological inhibition of PDE4 activity impeded the proliferation of resistant cells ex vivo and in vivo. The anti-tumorigenic activity of PDE4 inhibitor was achieved via inhibition of the Hippo pathway which plays an important role in resistance to targeted therapies.ConclusionsIn summary, our research showed that PDE4D drives rewiring of the MAPK pathway in BRAF-mutated melanoma resistant to MAPK inhibitors and suggests that PDE4 inhibition is a novel therapeutic option for treatment of BRAF-mutated melanoma patients.

AB  - Sarcoptes scabiei is an ectoparasite of humans and animals that causes scabies. The Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus is a blood-sucking ectoparasite that transmits various pathogens. These two parasites have caused great losses to a country's dairy and agriculture sectors. The aim of this study was to determine the in vitro and in silico efficacy of Camellia sinensis plant extracts. Different concentrations of C. sinensis ethanolic plant extracts were prepared using the maceration method and were used against mites and ticks (in adult immersion test AIT and larval packet test LPT) to evaluate their in vitro acaricidal activity. Additionally, in silico molecular docking was performed to investigate the inhibitory interactions between the phytochemicals of the plant and S. scabiei and R. microplus glutathione transferase proteins (SsGST and RmGST). This study observed that the plant extract showed high efficacy in vitro against mites and different tick stages in adult immersion and larval packet tests. Additionally, the in silico study revealed a strong binding interaction between ellagic acid and SsGST protein, with a binding energy of -7.3 kcal/mol, with respect to permethrin (-6.7 kcal/mol), whereas quercetin and RmGST resulted in a docking score of -8.6 kcal/mol compared to deltamethrin (-8.2 kcal/mol). Overall, this study explored the potential of C. sinensis as a natural alternative for controlling tick and mite infestations and provided insights into the inhibitory mechanisms of its phytochemicals.

AB  - We previously demonstrated that osteopontin (OPN) is closely associated with calcium precipitation in response to ischemic brain insults. The present study was designed to elucidate the possible association between deposition of OPN and progressive neurodegeneration in the ischemic hippocampus. To address this, we analyzed the OPN deposits in the rat hippocampus after global cerebral ischemia in the chronic phase (4 to 12 weeks) after reperfusion using immunoelectron microscopy and correlative light and electron microscopy. We identified three different types of OPN deposits based on their morphological characteristics, numbered according to the order in which they evolved. Dark degenerative cells that retained cellular morphology were frequently observed in the pyramidal cell layer, and type I OPN deposits were degenerative mitochondria that accumulated among these cells. Type II deposits evolved into more complex amorphous structures with prominent OPN deposits within their periphery and within degenerative mitochondria-like structures. Finally, type III had large concentric laminated structures with irregularly shaped bodies in the center of the deposits. In all types, OPN expression was closely correlated with calcification, as confirmed by calcium fixation and Alizarin Red staining. Notably, type II and III deposits were highly reminiscent of corpora amylacea, glycoprotein-rich aggregates found in aged brains, or neurodegenerative disease, which was further confirmed by ubiquitin expression and periodic acid-Schiff staining. Overall, our data provide a novel link between ongoing neurodegeneration and the formation of corpora amylacea-like structures and calcium deposits in the ischemic hippocampus, suggesting that OPN may play an important role in such processes.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent age-associated neurodegenerative disease. A decrease in autophagy during aging contributes to brain disorders by accumulating potentially toxic substrates in neurons. Rubicon is a well-established inhibitor of autophagy in all cells. However, Rubicon participates in different pathways depending on cell type, and little information is currently available on neuronal Rubicon's role in the AD context. Here, we investigated the cell-specific expression of Rubicon in postmortem brain samples from AD patients and 5xFAD mice and its impact on amyloid beta burden in vivo and neuroblastoma cells. Further, we assessed Rubicon levels in human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), derived from early-to-moderate AD and in postmortem samples from severe AD patients. We found increased Rubicon levels in AD-hiPSCs and postmortem samples and a notable Rubicon localization in neurons. In AD transgenic mice lacking Rubicon, we observed intensified amyloid beta burden in the hippocampus and decreased Pacer and p62 levels. In APP-expressing neuroblastoma cells, increased APP/amyloid beta secretion in the medium was found when Rubicon was absent, which was not observed in cells depleted of Atg5, essential for autophagy, or Rab27a, required for exosome secretion. Our results propose an uncharacterized role of Rubicon on APP/amyloid beta homeostasis, in which neuronal Rubicon is a repressor of APP/amyloid beta secretion, defining a new way to target AD and other similar diseases therapeutically.

AB  - Despite the improvements in biotechnological approaches and the selection of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation protocols, the resulting pregnancy rate from in vitro fertilization (IVF) protocols still does not exceed 30-40%. In this connection, there is an acute question of the development of a non-invasive, sensitive, and specific method for assessing the implantation potential of an embryo. A total of 110 subfertile couples were included in the study to undergo the IVF/ICSI program. Obtained embryos for transfer into the uterine cavity of patient cohort 1 (n = 60) and cohort 2 (n = 50) were excellent/good-quality blastocysts, and small noncoding RNA (sncRNA) content in the corresponding spent culture medium samples at the morula stage (n = 43) or at the blastocyst stage (n = 31) was analyzed by deep sequencing followed by qRT-PCR in real time. Two logistic regression models were developed to predict the implantation potential of the embryo with 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity: model 1 at the morula stage, using various combinations of hsa_piR_022258, hsa-let-7i-5p, hsa_piR_000765, hsa_piR_015249, hsa_piR_019122, and hsa_piR_008112, and model 2 at the blastocyst stage, using various combinations of hsa_piR_020497, hsa_piR_008113, hsa-miR-381-3p, hsa_piR_022258, and hsa-let-7a-5p. Protein products of sncRNA potential target genes participate in the selective turnover of proteins through the ubiquitination system and in the organization of the various cell cytoskeleton and nucleoskeleton structures, regulating the activity of the Hippo signaling pathway, which determines the fate specification of the blastomers.

AB  - Despite the fact that accumulation of microglia, the resident macrophages of the central nervous system (CNS) are the main feature of glioblastoma, the role of microglia in the progression of glioma is still arguable. Based on the correlation of inflammation with tumor progression, in this study, we attempt to determine if peripheral inflammation aggravates glioma expansion and the activation of microglia associated with the tumor. Experimental animals were administered intraperitoneally by inflammagen lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 7 days (LPS priming) before intracerebral implantation of glioma cells. Moreover, a reduced level of tumor necrosis factor receptor type 2 (TNFR2) that is restricted to immune cells, neurons, and microglia has been found in patients with glioblastoma through the clinic analysis of monocyte receptor expression. Thus, in addition to wildtype (WT) mice, heterogeneous TNFR2 gene deficiency (TNFR2(+/-)) mice and homogeneous TNFR2 gene knockout (TNFR2(-/-)) mice were used in this study. The results show that peripheral challenge by LPS, Iba1(+)- or CD11b(+)-microglia increase in numbers in the cortex and hippocampus of TNFR2(-/-) mice, when compared to WT or TNFR2(+/-) mice. We further conducted the intracerebral implantation of rodent glioma cells into the animals and found that the volumes of tumors formed by rat C6 glioma cells or mouse GL261 glioma cells were significantly larger in the cortex of TNFR2(-/-) mice when compared to that measured in LPS-primed WT or LPS-primed TNFR2(+/-) mice. Ki67(+)-cells were exclusively clustered in the tumor of LPS-primed TNFR2(-/-) mice. Microglia were also extensively accumulated in the tumor formed in LPS-primed TNFR2(-/-) mice. Accordingly, our findings demonstrate that aggravation of microglia activation by peripheral inflammatory challenge and a loss of TNFR2 function might lead to the promotion of glioma growth.

AB  - Alhagi camelorum, a desert shrub known for its impressive drought tolerance, exhibits notable resilience under arid conditions. However, the underlying mechanisms driving its drought resistance remain largely unexplored. This study aims to investigate these mechanisms by exposing A. camelorum to osmotic stress using varying polyethylene glycol (PEG) concentrations (1%, 5%, 10%) in a controlled laboratory setting. Growth analysis revealed significant inhibition and phenotypic changes with increasing PEG levels. Transcriptomic analysis, including differentially expressed gene identification, GO enrichment analysis, and hierarchical cluster analysis of genes in roots and shoots, identified key pathways associated with drought adaptation, such as ABA-activated signaling, cell wall biogenesis, photosynthesis, and secondary metabolite biosynthesis. Notably, some genes involved in these pathways exhibited tissue-specific expression patterns and showed PEG concentration-dependent regulation. Key findings include the dose-dependent (R-2 > 0.8) upregulation of a proline-rich protein (Asp01G030840) and a BURP domain-containing protein (Asp02G039780), as well as critical genes involved in cell wall biogenesis (encoding Pectinesterase inhibitor domain-containing and Fasciclin-like arabinogalactan protein), and secondary metabolite biosynthesis (encoding enzymes for terpenoid and flavonoid biosynthesis). The regulation of these genes is likely influenced by phytohormones such as ABA and other stress-related hormones, along with significant transcription factors like ABI4, TALE, MYB61, GRAS, and ERF. These insights lay the groundwork for further research into the functional roles of these genes, their regulatory networks, and their potential applications in enhancing drought resistance in desert plants and agricultural crops.

AB  - Agricultural crops are targeted by various pathogens (fungi, bacteria, and viruses) and pests (herbivorous arthropods). Antimicrobial and insecticidal peptides are increasingly recognized as eco-friendly tools for crop protection due to their low propensity for resistance development and the fact that they are fully biodegradable. However, historical challenges have hindered their development, including poor stability, limited availability, reproducibility issues, high production costs, and unwanted toxicity. Toxicity is a primary concern because crop-protective peptides interact with various organisms of environmental and economic significance. This review focuses on the potential of genetically encoded peptide libraries like the use of two-hybrid-based methods for antimicrobial peptides identification and insecticidal spider venom peptides as two main approaches for targeting plant pathogens and pests. We discuss some key findings and challenges regarding the practical application of each strategy. We conclude that genetically encoded peptide library- and spider venom-derived crop protective peptides offer a sustainable and environmentally responsible approach for addressing modern crop protection needs in the agricultural sector.
   This review examines the advantages and disadvantages of two strategies employing peptides for protecting crops from microbial and arthropod pathogens and pests. One approach utilizes genetically encoded peptide libraries (GEPLs) for de novo identification of novel antimicrobial peptides, while the other strategy relies on natural resources such as spider venoms for sourcing insecticidal venom peptides. image

AB  - The primary neuronal and astrocyte culture described here is from the stress-hyperreactive Wistar Kyoto (WKY) More Immobile (WMI) rat with premature aging-related memory deficit, and its nearly isogenic control, the Less Immobile (WLI) strain. Primary WMI hippocampal neurons and cortical astrocytes are significantly more sensitive to oxidative stress (OS) generated by administration of H2O2 compared to WLI cells as measured by the trypan blue cell viability assay. Intrinsic genetic vulnerability is also suggested by the decreased gene expression in WMI neurons of catalase (Cat), and in WMI cortical astrocytes of insulin-like growth factor 2 (Igf2), synuclein gamma (Sncg) and glutathione peroxidase 2 (Gpx2) compared to WLI. The expressions of several mitochondrial genes are dramatically increased in response to H2O2 treatment in WLI, but not in WMI cortical astrocytes. We propose that the vulnerability of WMI neurons to OS is due to the genetic differences between the WLI and WMI. Furthermore, the upregulation of mitochondrial genes may be a compensatory response to the generation of free radicals by OS in the WLIs, and this mechanism is disturbed in the WMIs. Thus, this pilot study suggests intrinsic vulnerabilities in the WMI hippocampal neurons and cortical astrocytes, and affirm the efficacy of this bimodal in vitro screening system for finding novel drug targets to prevent oxidative damage in illnesses.

AB  - As a privileged scaffold, chromanone has been extensively introduced in the design of drug leads with diverse pharmacological features, particularly in the area of inflammatory diseases. Herein, the preparation of chromanone-based derivatives (4a-4i) was smoothly achieved, and their structures were characterized using H-1 NMR, C-13 NMR, and ESI-HRMS spectroscopy techniques. Out of them, analogue 4e exhibited the most potent inhibitory capacity against the NO release and iNOS expression, without apparent cytotoxicity. Our observations showed that 4e could dramatically prevent the translocation of NF-kappa B from the cytoplasm to nucleus, and decrease the production of proinflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-1 beta in LPS-induced BV-2 cells. Mechanistically, 4e significantly deactivated NF-kappa B by disturbing TLR4-mediated TAK1/NF-kappa B and PI3K/Akt signaling cascades. Consistent with the in vitro study, 4e could effectively mitigate the inflammation response of hippocampal tissue in LPS-induced mouse model by inhibiting microglial activation. Collectively, these results revealed 4e as a prospective neuroprotective candidate for the therapy of neuroinflammation-related disorders.

AB  - Molecular phenotypes induced by environmental stimuli can be transmitted to offspring through epigenetic inheritance. Using transcriptome profiling, we show that the adaptation of Helicoverpa armigera larvae to soybean peptidase inhibitors (SPIs) is associated with large-scale gene expression changes including the upregulation of genes encoding serine peptidases in the digestive system. Furthermore, approximately 60% of the gene expression changes induced by SPIs persisted in the next generation of larvae fed on SPI-free diets including genes encoding regulatory, oxidoreductase, and protease functions. To investigate the role of epigenetic mechanisms in regulating SPI adaptation, the methylome of the digestive system of first-generation larvae (fed on a diet with and without SPIs) and of the progeny of larvae exposed to SPIs were characterized. A comparative analysis between RNA-seq and Methyl-seq data did not show a direct relationship between differentially methylated and differentially expressed genes, while trypsin and chymotrypsin genes were unmethylated in all treatments. Rather, DNA methylation potential epialleles were associated with transcriptional and translational controls; these may play a regulatory role in the adaptation of H. armigera to SPIs. Altogether, our findings provided insight into the mechanisms of insect adaptation to plant antiherbivore defense proteins and illustrated how large-scale transcriptional reprograming of insect genes can be transmitted across generations.

AB  - Two classical surgical approaches for intraluminal filament middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), the Longa et al. (LM) and Koizumi et al. methods (KM), are used as alternatives in preclinical studies to induce stroke in rodents. Comparisons of these MCAO models in mice showed critical differences between them along with similarities (Smith et al. 2015; Morris et al. 2016). In this study, a direct comparison of MCAO-KM and MCAO-LM in rats was performed. Three days after MCAO, infarct volume, mortality rate, neurological deficit, and weight loss were similar in these models. MCAO-LM rats showed an increase in ACTH levels, while MCAO-KM rats demonstrated elevated corticosterone and interleukin-1 beta in blood serum. Corticosterone accumulation was detected in the frontal cortex (FC) and the hippocampus of the MCAO-KM group. IL1 beta beta increased in the ipsilateral hippocampus in the MCAO-KM group and decreased in the contralateral FC of MCAO-LM rats. Differences revealed between MCAO-KM and MCAO-LM suggest that corticosterone and interleukin-1 beta release as well as hippocampal accumulation is more expressed in MCAO-KM rats, predisposing them to corticosterone-dependent distant neuroinflammatory hippocampal damage. The differences between two models, particularly, malfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, should be considered in the interpretation, comparison, and translation of pre-clinical experimental results.

AB  - Ferroptosis is a new form of cell death, and inhibition of ferroptosis is a promising strategy to treat neurological diseases. In this work, sixteen compounds were isolated from Ajuga nipponensis and assayed for anti-ferroptosis activity in HT22 mouse hippocampal neuronal cells. Ajudecunoid C (1, ADC), a new neoclerodane diterpenoid, showed significant inhibitory activity against erastin and RSL3-induced ferroptosis with EC50 values of 4.1 +/- 1.0 and 3.6 +/- 0.3 mu M, respectively. Experimental results demonstrated that ADC effectively prevented ferroptosis through scavenging free radical and activating NRF2-antioxidant response elements (AREs) pathway. This study reveals that ADC, as a new ferroptosis inhibitor, is a promising lead compound for the development of drugs against ferroptosis-related neurological diseases.

AB  - Adult neurogenesis is defined as the ability of specialized cells in the postnatal brain to produce new functional neurons and to integrate them into the already-established neuronal network. This phenomenon is common in all vertebrates and has been found to be extremely relevant for numerous processes, such as long-term memory, learning, and anxiety responses, and it has been also found to be involved in neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. Adult neurogenesis has been studied extensively in many vertebrate models, from fish to human, and observed also in the more basal cartilaginous fish, such as the lesser-spotted dogfish, Scyliorhinus canicula, but a detailed description of neurogenic niches in this animal is, to date, limited to the telencephalic areas. With this article, we aim to extend the characterization of the neurogenic niches of S. canicula in other main areas of the brain: we analyzed via double immunofluorescence sections of telencephalon, optic tectum, and cerebellum with markers of proliferation (PCNA) and mitosis (pH3) in conjunction with glial cell (S100 beta) and stem cell (Msi1) markers, to identify the actively proliferating cells inside the neurogenic niches. We also labeled adult postmitotic neurons (NeuN) to exclude double labeling with actively proliferating cells (PCNA). Lastly, we observed the presence of the autofluorescent aging marker, lipofuscin, contained inside lysosomes in neurogenic areas.

AB  - (E)-7-Phenyl-2-hepten-4,6-diyn-1-ol (1) and (Z)-7-Phenyl-2-hepten-4,6-diyn-1-ol (2) are isomeric natural polyacetylenes isolated from the Chinese medicinal plant Bidens pilosa L. This study first revealed the excellent anti-metastasis potential of these two polyacetylenes on human gastric cancer HGC-27 cells and the distinctive molecular mechanisms underlying their activities. Polyacetylenes 1 and 2 significantly inhibited the migration, invasion, and adhesion of HGC-27 cells at their non-toxic concentrations in a dose-dependent manner. The results of a further mechanism investigation showed that polyacetylene 1 inhibited the expressions of Vimentin, Snail, beta-catenin, GSK3 beta, MST1, YAP, YAP/TAZ, and their phosphorylation, and upregulated the expression of E-cadherin and p-LATS1. In addition, the expressions of various downstream metastasis-related proteins, such as MMP2/7/9/14, c-Myc, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, MAPK, p-MAPK, Sox2, Cox2, and Cyr61, were also suppressed in a dose-dependent manner. These findings suggested that polyacetylene 1 exhibited its anti-metastasis activities on HGC-27 cells through the reversal of the EMT process and the suppression of the Wnt/beta-catenin and Hippo/YAP signaling pathways.

AB  - Extracellular adenosine 5 '-triphosphate (ATP) in the brain is suggested to be an etiological factor of major depressive disorder (MDD). It has been assumed that stress-released ATP stimulates P2X7 receptors (Rs) at the microglia, thereby causing neuroinflammation; however, other central nervous system (CNS) cell types such as astrocytes also possess P2X7Rs. In order to elucidate the possible involvement of the MDD-relevant hippocampal astrocytes in the development of a depressive-like state, we used various behavioral tests (tail suspension test [TST], forced swim test [FST], restraint stress, inescapable foot shock, unpredictable chronic mild stress [UCMS]), as well as fluorescence immunohistochemistry, and patch-clamp electrophysiology in wild-type (WT) and genetically manipulated rodents. The TST and FST resulted in learned helplessness manifested as a prolongation of the immobility time, while inescapable foot shock caused lower sucrose consumption as a sign of anhedonia. We confirmed the participation of P2X7Rs in the development of the depressive-like behaviors in all forms of acute (TST, FST, foot shock) and chronic stress (UCMS) in the rodent models used. Further, pharmacological agonists and antagonists acted in a different manner in rats and mice due to their diverse potencies at the respective receptor orthologs. In hippocampal slices of mice and rats, only foot shock increased the current responses to locally applied dibenzoyl-ATP (Bz-ATP) in CA1 astrocytes; in contrast, TST and restraint depressed these responses. Following stressful stimuli, immunohistochemistry demonstrated an increased co-localization of P2X7Rs with a microglial marker, but no change in co-localization with an astroglial marker. Pharmacological damage to the microglia and astroglia has proven the significance of the microglia for mediating all types of depression-like behavioral reactions, while the astroglia participated only in reactions induced by strong stressors, such as foot shock. Because, in addition to acute stressors, their chronic counterparts induce a depressive-like state in rodents via P2X7R activation, we suggest that our data may have relevance for the etiology of MDD in humans.

AB  - Although tea can be beneficial for our health, consuming excess trace elements in tea can be harmful. In this study, the carcinogenic and noncarcinogenic health risk for trace elements in tea influenced by the country of origin, tea type, and infusion process was assessed. Tea (Camellia sinensis) purchased from China, India, and the USA, including black and green tea, were analyzed for essential micronutrients (Cu, Se, and Zn) and nonessential trace elements (Ag, As, Ba, Cd, Cr, and Pb) in leaves and three types of infusions. The results showed that country of origin, tea type, and infusion process had a significant influence on the trace element contents in tea leaves and infusions, also on health risk. Country of origin had a significant influence on Ba, Cr, Pb, and Zn contents in tea leaves and on As, Ba, Cd, Cr, Pb, and Zn contents in tea infusions. Black tea had significantly higher (p < 0.05) Cr and Cu content in tea leaves than green tea, but only Cr content was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than that of green tea in tea infusion. The trace element contents were the highest in the first infusion and decreased as the number of infusion steps increased. The results showed that the consumption of tea infusion was not likely to cause noncarcinogenic risk. However, the carcinogenic risk for As was of concern. Our results indicate that avoiding drinking the first infusion can help to reduce both carcinogenic and noncarcinogenic health risks for trace elements.

AB  - While understanding the genetic underpinnings of osteogenesis has far-reaching implications for skeletal diseases and evolution, a comprehensive characterization of the osteoblastic regulatory landscape in non-mammalian vertebrates is still lacking. Here, we compared the ATAC-Seq profile of Xenopus tropicalis (Xt) osteoblasts to a variety of non mineralizing control tissues, and identified osteoblast-specific nucleosome free regions (NFRs) at 527 promoters and 6747 distal regions. Sequence analyses, Gene Ontology, RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq against four key histone marks confirmed that the distal regions correspond to bona fide osteogenic transcriptional enhancers exhibiting a shared regulatory logic with mammals. We report 425 regulatory regions conserved with human and globally associated to skeletogenic genes. Of these, 35 regions have been shown to impact human skeletal phenotypes by GWAS, including one trps1 enhancer and the runx2 promoter, two genes which are respectively involved in trichorhinophalangeal syndrome type I and cleidocranial dysplasia. Intriguingly, 60 osteoblastic NFRs also align to the genome of the elephant shark, a species lacking osteoblasts and bone tissue. To tackle this paradox, we chose to focus on dlx5 because its conserved promoter, known to integrate regulatory inputs during mammalian osteogenesis, harbours an osteoblast-specific NFR in both frog and human. Hence, we show that dlx5 is expressed in Xt and elephant shark odontoblasts, supporting a common cellular and genetic origin of bone and dentine. Taken together, our work (i) unravels the Xt osteogenic regulatory landscape, (ii) illustrates how crossspecies comparisons harvest data relevant to human biology and (iii) reveals that a set of genes including bnc2, dlx5, ebf3, mir199a, nfia, runx2 and zfhx4 drove the development of a primitive form of mineralized skeletal tissue deep in the vertebrate lineage.

AB  - Fear overgeneralization is a maladaptive response to traumatic stress that is associated with the inability to discriminate between threat and safety contexts, a hallmark feature of post -traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, the neural mechanisms underlying this deficit remain unclear. Here, we show that traumatic stress exposure impairs contextual discrimination between threat and safety contexts in the learned helplessness (LH) model. Mossy cells (MCs) in the dorsal hippocampus are suppressed in response to traumatic stress. Bidirectional manipulation of MC activity in the LH model reveals that MC inhibition is causally linked to impaired contextual discrimination. Mechanistically, MC inhibition increases the number of active granule cells in a given context, significantly overlapping context -specific ensembles. Our study demonstrates that maladaptive inhibition of MCs after traumatic stress is a substantial mechanism underlying fear overgen- eralization with contextual discrimination deficit, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for cognitive symptoms of PTSD.

AB  - A key step in regulation of Hippo pathway signaling in response to mechanical tension is recruitment of the LIM domain proteins TRIP6 and LIMD1 to adherens junctions. Mechanical tension also triggers TRIP6 and LIMD1 to bind and inhibit the Hippo pathway kinase LATS1. How TRIP6 and LIMD1 are recruited to adherens junctions in response to tension is not clear, but previous studies suggested that they could be regulated by the known mechanosensory proteins alpha-catenin and vinculin at adherens junctions. We found that the three LIM domains of TRIP6 and LIMD1 are necessary and sufficient for tension-dependent localization to adherens junctions. The LIM domains of TRIP6, LIMD1, and certain other LIM domain proteins have been shown to bind to actin networks under strain/tension. Consistent with this, we show that TRIP6 and LIMD1 colocalize with the ends of actin fibers at adherens junctions. Point mutations in a key conserved residue in each LIM domain that are predicted to impair binding to f-actin under strain inhibits TRIP6 and LIMD1 localization to adherens junctions and their ability to bind to and recruit LATS1 to adherens junctions. Together these results show that the ability of TRIP6 and LIMD1 to bind to strained actin underlies their ability to localize to adherens junctions and regulate LATS1 in response to mechanical tension.

AB  - The general understanding of hippocampal circuits is that the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex (EC) are topographically connected through parallel identical circuits along the dorsoventral axis. Our antero-grade tracing and in vitro electrophysiology data, however, show a markedly different dorsoventral organi-zation of the hippocampal projection to the medial EC (MEC). While dorsal hippocampal projections are confined to the dorsal MEC, ventral hippocampal projections innervate both dorsal and ventral MEC. Further, whereas the dorsal hippocampus preferentially targets layer Vb (LVb) neurons, the ventral hippocampus mainly targets cells in layer Va (LVa). This connectivity scheme differs from hippocampal projections to the lateral EC, which are topographically organized along the dorsoventral axis. As LVa neurons project to telencephalic structures, our findings indicate that the ventral hippocampus regulates LVa-mediated entorhi-nal-neocortical output from both dorsal and ventral MEC. Overall, the marked dorsoventral differences in hip-pocampal-entorhinal connectivity impose important constraints on signal flow in hippocampal-neocortical circuits.

AB  - The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a tortuous organelle that spans throughout a cell with a continuous mem-brane containing ion channels, pumps, and transporters. It is unclear if stimuli that gate ER ion channels trigger substantial membrane potential fluctuations and if those fluctuations spread beyond their site of origin. Here, we visualize ER membrane potential dynamics in HEK cells and cultured rat hippocampal neurons by targeting a genetically encoded voltage indicator specifically to the ER membrane. We report the existence of clear cell- type-and stimulus-specific ER membrane potential fluctuations. In neurons, direct stimulation of ER ryanodine receptors generates depolarizations that scale linearly with stimulus strength and reach tens of millivolts. However, ER potentials do not spread beyond the site of receptor activation, exhibiting steep attenuation that is exacerbated by intracellular large conductance K+ channels. Thus, segments of ER can generate large depolarizations that are actively restricted from impacting nearby, contiguous membrane.

AB  - Mechanotransduction sensing of tissue architecture and cellular microenvironment is a fundamental regulator of cell fate, including cancer. Meanwhile, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play multifunctions during cancer development and treatment. However, the link between lncRNAs and cellular mechanotransduction in the context of cancer progression has not yet been elucidated. In this study, using atomic force microscopy (AFM), we find that ionizing radiation reduces tumor stiffness. Ionizing radiation-induced lncRNA CRYBG3 can blunt YAP/TAZ activity through interference with mechanotransduction, resulting in the inhibition of cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of lung cancer cells. In vivo, we found that loss of lncRNA CRYBG3 could power the tumor initiation and metastasis ability, but this was abolished by concomitant deplete TAZ. At the molecular level, lncRNA CRYBG3 that in turn dysregulates F-actin organization, activates the LATS1/2 kinase, all in all resulting in YAP/TAZ nuclear exclusion. Our research proposes that lncRNA CRYBG3 is a mediator of radiotherapy through its control of cancer-tissue mechanotransduction and wiring YAP/TAZ activity to control tumor growth and metastasis.

AB  - Neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) are spatially tuned. Trajectory-specific firing with distinct spatial tuning on different paths to reward sites as well as generalized spatial tuning with similar responses on separate trajectories have been described. However, it is unclear whether such distinct populations contribute differently to the encoding of task space. Here, we find coexisting populations of neurons with trajectory-specific and generalized tuning profiles in an olfaction-guided spatial memory task in mice. Neurons with generalized representation show stable spatial tuning within and across days, allow accurate predictions of the animal's position, and preferentially emerge upon task learning. In contrast, cells with trajectory-specific spatial tuning display dynamically changing tuning functions, are less informative about the current position, and can be identified at a larger proportion early in task learning. These results highlight a role for neurons with generalized tuning in the efficient and stable representation of task space.

AB  - Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) first emerged in 2012 and causes human infections in endemic regions. Vaccines and therapeutics in development against MERS-CoV focus on the spike (S) glycoprotein to prevent viral entry into target cells. These efforts are limited by a poor understanding of antibody responses elicited by infection. Here, we analyze S-directed antibody responses in plasma collected from MERS-CoV-infected individuals. We observe that binding and neutralizing antibodies peak 1-6 weeks after symptom onset/hospitalization, persist for at least 6 months, and neutralize human and camel MERS-CoV strains. We show that the MERS-CoV S1 1 subunit is immunodominant and that antibodies targeting S1, 1 , particularly the receptor-binding domain (RBD), account for most plasma neutralizing activity. Antigenic site mapping reveals that plasma antibodies frequently target RBD epitopes, whereas targeting of S2 2 subunit epitopes is rare. Our data reveal the humoral immune responses elicited by MERS-CoV infection, which will guide vaccine and therapeutic design.

AB  - The phosphoinositide 3-kinase p110a is an essential mediator of insulin signaling and glucose homeostasis. We interrogated the human serine, threonine, and tyrosine kinome to search for novel regulators of p110a and found that the Hippo kinases phosphorylate p110a at T1061, which inhibits its activity. This inhibitory state corresponds to a conformational change of a membrane-binding domain on p110a, which impairs its ability to engage membranes. In human primary hepatocytes, cancer cell lines, and rodent tissues, activation of the Hippo kinases MST1/2 using forskolin or epinephrine is associated with phosphorylation of T1061 and inhi-bition of p110a, impairment of downstream insulin signaling, and suppression of glycolysis and glycogen synthesis. These changes are abrogated when MST1/2 are genetically deleted or inhibited with small mole-cules or if the T1061 is mutated to alanine. Our study defines an inhibitory pathway of PI3K signaling and a link between epinephrine and insulin signaling.

AB  - Background Integrins are closely related to mechanical conduction and play a crucial role in the osteogenesis of human mesenchymal stem cells. Here we wondered whether tensile stress could influence cell differentiation through integrin alpha V beta 3.Methods We inhibited the function of integrin alpha V beta 3 of human mesenchymal stem cells by treating with c(RGDyk). Using cytochalasin D and verteporfin to inhibit polymerization of microfilament and function of nuclear Yes-associated protein (YAP), respectively. For each application, mesenchymal stem cells were loaded by cyclic tensile stress of 10% at 0.5 Hz for 2 h daily. Mesenchymal stem cells were harvested on day 7 post-treatment. Western blotting and quantitative RT-PCR were used to detect the expression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), RUNX2, beta-actin, integrin alpha V beta 3, talin-1, vinculin, FAK, and nuclear YAP. Immunofluorescence staining detected vinculin, actin filaments, and YAP nuclear localization.Results Cyclic tensile stress could increase the expression of ALP and RUNX2. Inhibition of integrin alpha V beta 3 activation led to rearrangement of actin filaments and downregulated the expression of ALP, RUNX2 and promoted YAP nuclear localization. When microfilament polymerization was inhibited, ALP, RUNX2, and nuclear YAP nuclear localization decreased. Inhibition of YAP nuclear localization could reduce the expression of ALP and RUNX2.Conclusions Cyclic tensile stress promotes early osteogenesis of human mesenchymal stem cells via the integrin alpha V beta 3-actin filaments axis. YAP nuclear localization participates in this process of human mesenchymal stem cells.

AB  - Mutations in the GABRG2 gene encoding the gamma -aminobutyric acid (GABA) A receptor gamma 2 subunit are associated with genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus, febrile seizures plus, febrile seizures, and other symptoms of epilepsy. However, the mechanisms underlying Gabrg2-mediated febrile seizures are poorly understood. Here, we used the Cre/loxP system to generate conditional knockout (CKO) mice with deficient Gabrg2 in the hippocampus and neocortex. Heterozygous CKO mice (Gabrg2(fl/wt)Cre(+)) exhibited temperature-dependent myoclonic jerks, generalised tonic-clonic seizures, increased anxiety-like symptoms, and a predisposition to induce seizures. Cortical electroencephalography showed the hyperexcitability in response to temperature elevation in Gabrg2(fl/wt)Cre(+) mice, but not in wild-type mice. Gabrg2(fl/wt)Cre(+) mice exhibited spontaneous seizures and susceptibility to temperature-induced seizures. Loss of neurons were observed in cortical layers V-VI and hippocampus of Gabrg2(fl/wt)Cre(+) mice. Furthermore, the latency of temperature- or pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures were significantly decreased in Gabrg2(fl/wt)Cre(+) mice compared with wild-type mice. In summary, Gabrg2(fl/wt)Cre(+) mice with Gabrg2 deletion in the neocortex and hippocampus reproduce many features of febrile seizures and therefore provide a novel model to further understand this syndrome at the cellular and molecular level.

AB  - Phytosulfokine (PSK) is a tyrosine-sulfated pentapeptide found throughout the plant kingdom, playing key roles in plant growth, development, and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. However, there is still a lack of a comprehensive analysis of the CsPSK gene family in Camellia sinensis. In this study, we conducted a genome-wide identification and characterized 14 CsPSK genes in tea plants, which are unevenly distributed across seven chromosomes. CsPSK genes encode proteins ranging from 75 to 124 amino acids in length, all belonging to the PSK-alpha type and containing conserved PSK domains. A synteny analysis revealed that the expansion of the CsPSK gene family is primarily attributed to whole-genome duplication, with homology to Arabidopsis thaliana PSK genes. A promoter region analysis identified cis-regulatory elements related to hormone and stress responses. An expression profile analysis showed that CsPSK genes are highly expressed in roots, stems, flowers, and leaves, and are induced by both biotic and abiotic stresses. Furthermore, an RT-qPCR assay demonstrated that the expression levels of CsPSK8, CsPSK9, and CsPSK10 are significantly upregulated following Discula theae-sinensis infection. These findings establish a basis for further research into the role of the CsPSK gene family in tea plant disease resistance and underlying molecular mechanisms, offering valuable perspectives for developing novel antimicrobial peptides.

AB  - Acyl-CoA:lysophosphatidylethanolamine acyltransferases (LPEATs) are known as enzymes utilizing acyl-CoAs and lysophospholipids to produce phosphatidylethanolamine. Recently, it has been discovered that they are also involved in the growth regulation of Arabidopsis thaliana. In our study we investigated expression of each Camelina sativa LPEAT isoform and their behavior in response to temperature changes. In order to conduct a more extensive biochemical evaluation we focused both on LPEAT enzymes present in microsomal fractions from C. sativa plant tissues, and on cloned CsLPEAT isoforms expressed in yeast system. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that CsLPEAT1c and CsLPEAT2c originated from Camelina hispida, whereas other isoforms originated from Camelina neglecta. The expression ratio of all CsLPEAT1 isoforms to all CsLPEAT2 isoforms was higher in seeds than in other tissues. The isoforms also displayed divergent substrate specificities in utilization of LPE; CsLPEAT1 preferred 18:1-LPE, whereas CsLPEAT2 preferred 18:2-LPE. Unlike CsLPEAT1, CsLPEAT2 isoforms were specific towards very-long-chain fatty acids. Above all, we discovered that temperature strongly regulates LPEATs activity and substrate specificity towards different acyl donors, making LPEATs sort of a sensor of external thermal changes. We observed the presented findings not only for LPEAT activity in plant-derived microsomal fractions, but also for yeast-expressed individual CsLPEAT isoforms.

AB  - Tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1) plays important roles in regulating innate immunity. However, the precise role of TSC1 in macrophages in the regulation of oxidative stress response and hepatic inflammation in liver ischemia/reperfusion injury (I/R) remains unknown. In a mouse model of liver I/R injury, deletion of myeloid-specific TSC1 inhibited AKT and MST1 phosphorylation, and decreased NRF2 accumulation, whereas activated TLR4/NF-kappa B pathway, leading to increased hepatic inflammation. Adoptive transfer of AKT- or MST1-overexpressing macrophages, or Keap1 disruption in myeloid-specific TSC1-knockout mice promoted NRF2 activation but reduced TLR4 activity and mitigated I/R-induced liver inflammation. Mechanistically, TSC1 in macrophages promoted AKT and MST1 phosphorylation, and protected NRF2 from Keap1-mediated ubiquitination. Furthermore, overexpression AKT or MST1 in TSC1-knockout macrophages upregulated NRF2 expression, downregulated TLR4/NF-kappa B, resulting in reduced inflammatory factors, ROS and inflammatory cytokine-mediated hepatocyte apoptosis. Strikingly, TSC1 induction in NRF2-deficient macrophages failed to reverse the TLR4/NF-kappa B activity and production of pro-inflammatory factors. Conclusions: Macrophage TSC1 promoted the activation of the AKT/MST1 signaling pathway, increased NRF2 levels via reducing Keap1-mediated ubiquitination, and modulated oxidative stress-driven inflammatory responses in liver I/R injury. Our findings underscore the critical role of macrophage TSC1 as a novel regulator of innate immunity and imply the therapeutic potential for the treatment of sterile liver inflammation in transplant recipients.Schematic illustration of macrophage TSC1-mediated AKT/MST1/NRF2 signaling pathway in I/R-triggered liver inflammation. Macrophage TSC1 can be activated in I/R-stressed livers. TSC1 activation promotes phosphorylation of AKT and MST1, which in turn increases NRF2 expression and inhibits ROS production and TLR4/NF-kappa B activation, resulting in reduced hepatocellular apoptosis in I/R-triggered liver injury.

AB  - Reliable pregnancy diagnostics would be beneficial for monitoring polar bear (Ursus maritimus) populations both in situ and ex situ, but currently there is no method of non-invasive pregnancy detection in this species. Recent reports in several carnivore species described the identification of fecal proteins that may serve as pregnancy biomarkers; however, repeatability has been limited. The objective of the current analysis was to utilize an unbiased, antibody-free, label-free method for the identification and quantification of fecal proteins to determine if differences associated with pregnancy are detectable in polar bears. Protein was extracted from fecal samples (n = 48) obtained from parturient (n = 6) and non-parturient (n = 6) profiles each at four timepoints: pre-breeding season, embryonic diapause, early placental pregnancy, and mid-placental pregnancy. Protein was prepared and analyzed on the Thermo Orbitrap Eclipse nanoLC-MS/MS system. A total of 312 proteins was identified and quantified; however, coefficients of variation (CV) were high for both abundance ratio variability (384.8 +/- 61.0% SEM) and within group variability (86.8 +/- 1.5%). Results of this study suggest that the inconsistencies in specific protein concentrations revealed previously by antibody-based assays may not be due to that methodology's limitations, but rather, are reflective of true variation that exists among samples.

AB  - Background: The LH surge is a pivotal event that triggers multiple key ovarian processes including oocyte maturation, cumulus expansion, follicular wall rupture and luteinization of mural granulosa and theca cells. Recently, LH-dependent activation of the Hippo signaling pathway has been shown to be required for the differentiation of granulosa cells into luteal cells. Still, the precise interactions between Hippo and LH signaling in murine granulosa cells remain to be elucidated.
   Methods: To detect the expression of effectors of the Hippo pathway, western blot, immunohistochemical and RT-qPCR analyses were performed on granulosa cells treated with LH in vitro or isolated from immature mice treated with eCG and hCG. Cultured granulosa cells were pretreated with pharmacologic inhibitors to identify the signaling pathways involved in Hippo regulation by LH. To study the roles of Yap1 and Taz in the regulation of the LH signaling cascade, RT-qPCR and microarray analyses were done on granulosa cells from Yap1(f/f);Taz(f/f) mice treated with an adenovirus to drive cre expression. RT-qPCR was performed to evaluate YAP1 binding to the Areg promoter following chromatin immunoprecipitation of granulosa cells collected from mice prior to or 60 min following hCG treatment.
   Results: Granulosa cells showed a transient increase in LATS1, YAP1 and TAZ phosphorylation levels in response to the ovulatory signal. This Hippo activation by LH was mediated by protein kinase A. Furthermore, Yap1 and Taz are required for the induction of several LH target genes such as Areg, Pgr and Ptgs2, and for the activation of the ERK1/2 pathway. Consistent with these results, there was a substantial overlap between genes that are upregulated by LH and those that are downregulated following loss of Yap1/Taz, highlighting a major role for Hippo in mediating LH actions in the ovulation process. Finally, we showed that there is a marked recruitment of YAP1 to the Areg promoter of granulosa cells in response to hCG stimulation.
   Conclusions: Overall, these results indicate that Hippo collaborates with the cAMP/PKA and ERK1/2 pathways to participate in the precise regulation of the LH cascade, and that Areg, as a direct transcriptional target of YAP1, is involved in mediating its actions in the ovary.

AB  - Voltage-gated L-type calcium channels are expressed by various types of mammalian cells. These channels are usually located postsynaptically in neurons and are responsible for transmitting the excitatory signal and activation of Ca2+-dependent signaling cascades. One of the main approaches for studying the functions of voltage-gated channels is the use of various synthetic blockers. This work aimed to compare four blockers from three_pharmacological groups and determine the concentration required to completely suppress the influx of Ca2+ through L-type channels in cultured hippocampal neurons in response to depolarization induced by the application of KCI. We show that although an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration in response to depolarization is primarily mediated by the entry of Ca2+ through L-type channels, the activation of other voltage-dependent calcium channels also significantly contributes to Ca2+ influx in this case. In this regard, nifedipine and isradipine, which, apparently, are more selective in relation to L-channels, approximately halve the amplitude of the calcium response. In turn, diltiazem and verapamil completely blocked KCI-induced Ca2+ influx due to non-specific blocking of other non-L-type calcium channels. It should be noted that the concentration of blockers required for the complete suppression of Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated channels was 300 mu M in both cases, while the IC50 in the case of diltiazem and verapamil was 54.2 mu M and 56.4 mu M, respectively. Thus, substances from the dihydropyridine group are preferable to use if substantial selectivity to L-type channels is required. In turn, high concentrations of verapamil and diltiazem can be used if it is necessary to block most of the voltage-dependent calcium channels.

AB  - Tea plant calli (Camellia sinensis L.) are characterized by the accumulation of various phenolic compounds (PC)-substances with high antioxidant activity. However, there is still no clarity on the response of tea cells to light exposure of varying intensity. The purpose of the research was to study tea callus cultures grown under the influence of primary exposure to different light intensities (50, 75, and 100 mu mol<middle dot>m(-2)<middle dot>s(-1)). The cultures' growth, morphology, content of malondialdehyde and photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll a and b), accumulation of various PC, including phenylpropanoids and flavanols, and the composition of catechins were analyzed. Primary exposure to different light intensities led to the formation of chloroplasts in tea calli, which was more pronounced at 100 mu mol<middle dot>m(-2)<middle dot>s(-1). Significant similarity in the growth dynamics of cultures, accumulation of pigments, and content of malondialdehyde and various phenolics in tea calli grown at light intensities of 50 and 75 mu mol<middle dot>m(-2)<middle dot>s(-1) has been established, which is not typical for calli grown at 100 mu mol<middle dot>m(-2)<middle dot>s(-1). According to data collected using high-performance liquid chromatography, (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, epigallocatechin, gallocatechin gallate, epicatechin gallate, and epigallocatechin gallate were the main components of the tea callus culture's phenolic complex. Its content changed under the influence of primary exposure to light, reaching the greatest accumulation in the final stages of growth, and depended on the light intensity. The data obtained indicate changes in the morphophysiological and biochemical characteristics of tea callus cultures, including the accumulation of PC and their individual representatives under primary exposure to light exposure of varying intensity, which is most pronounced at its highest values (100 mu mol<middle dot>m(-2)<middle dot>s(-1)).

AB  - Background and Objectives: O-cyclic phytosphingosine-1-phosphate (cP1P) is a synthetic chemical and has a structure like sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). S1P is known to promote cell migration, invasion, proliferation, and anti-apoptosis through hippocampal signals. However, S1P mediated cellular-, molecular mechanism is still remained in the lung. Acute lung injury (ALI) and its severe form acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are characterized by excessive immune response, increased vascular permeability, alveolar-peritoneal barrier collapse, and edema. In this study, we determined whether cP1P primed human dermal derived mesenchymal stem cells (hdMSCs) ameliorate lung injury and its therapeutic pathway in ALI mice. Methods and Results: cP1P treatment significantly stimulated MSC migration and invasion ability. In cytokine array, secretion of vascular-related factors was increased in cP1P primed hdMSCs (hdMSCcP1P), and cP1P treatment induced inhibition of Lats while increased phosphorylation of Yap. We next determined whether hdMSCcP1P reduce inflammatory response in LPS exposed mice. hdMSCcP1P further decreased infiltration of macrophage and neutrophil, and release of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-6 were reduced rather than naive hdMSC treatment. In addition, phosphorylation of STAT1 and expression of iNOS were significantly decreased in the lungs of MSCcP1P treated mice. Conclusions: Taken together, these data suggest that cP1P treatment enhances hdMSC migration in regulation of Hippo signaling and MSCcP1P provide a therapeutic potential for ALI/ARDS treatment.

AB  - The young shoots of the tea plant Baiye No. 1 display an albino phenotype in the early spring under low environmental temperatures, and the leaves re-green like those of common tea cultivars during the warm season. Periodic albinism is precisely regulated by a complex gene network that leads to metabolic differences and enhances the nutritional value of tea leaves. Here, we identified messenger RNAs (mRNAs), long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), circular RNAs (circRNAs), and microRNAs (miRNAs) to construct competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) regulatory networks. We performed whole-transcriptome sequencing of 12 samples from four periods (Bud, leaves not expanded; Alb, albino leaves; Med, re-greening leaves; and Gre, green leaves) and identified a total of 6325 differentially expressed mRNAs (DEmRNAs), 667 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRNAs), 1702 differentially expressed lncRNAs (DElncRNAs), and 122 differentially expressed circRNAs (DEcircRNAs). Furthermore, we constructed ceRNA networks on the basis of co-differential expression analyses which comprised 112, 35, 38, and 15 DEmRNAs, DEmiRNAs, DElncRNAs, and DEcircRNAs, respectively. Based on the regulatory networks, we identified important genes and their interactions with lncRNAs, circRNAs, and miRNAs during periodic albinism, including the ceRNA regulatory network centered on miR5021x, the GAMYB-miR159-lncRNA regulatory network, and the NAC035-miR319x-circRNA regulatory network. These regulatory networks might be involved in the response to cold stress, photosynthesis, chlorophyll synthesis, amino acid synthesis, and flavonoid accumulation. Our findings provide novel insights into ceRNA regulatory mechanisms involved in Baiye No. 1 during periodic albinism and will aid future studies of the molecular mechanisms underlying albinism mutants.

AB  - Post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE) and neurocognitive deficits are devastating sequelae of head injuries that are common in adolescents. Investigating desperately needed treatments is hindered by the difficulties in inducing PTE in rodents and the lack of established immature rat models of pediatric PTE. Hemorrhage is a significant risk factor for PTE, but compared to humans, rats are less prone to bleeding because of their rapid blood coagulation system. In this study, we promoted bleeding in the controlled cortical impact (CCI) closed-head injury model with a 20 min pre-impact 600 IU/kg intraperitoneal heparin injection in postnatal day 35 (P35) periadolescent rats, given the preponderance of such injuries in this age group. Temporo-parietal CCI was performed post-heparin (HTBI group) or post-saline (TBI group). Controls were subjected to sham procedures following heparin or saline administration. Continuous long-term EEG monitoring was performed for 3 months post-CCI. Sensorimotor testing, the Morris water maze, and a modified active avoidance test were conducted between P80 and P100. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) levels and neuronal damage were also assessed. Compared to TBI rats, HTBI rats had persistently higher EEG spiking and increased hippocampal GFAP levels (p < 0.05). No sensorimotor deficits were detected in any group. Compared to controls, both HTBI and TBI groups had a long-term hippocampal neuronal loss (p < 0.05), as well as contextual and visuospatial learning deficits (p < 0.05). The hippocampal astrogliosis and EEG spiking detected in all rats subjected to our hemorrhage-promoting procedure suggest the emergence of hyperexcitable networks and pave the way to a periadolescent PTE rat model.

AB  - Mutations occurring in the MeCp2, CDKL5 and BDNF genes have been linked to epileptogenesis in various epilepsy syndromes. This study employed bioinformatics analysis of transcriptomic data to examine the interrelationship among these genes in both epileptic and healthy individuals. Moreover, we assessed the expression of MeCp2, CDKL5 and BDNF at both mRNA and protein levels in human hippocampal tissues obtained from 22 patients undergoing epilepsy surgery for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) as well as from 25 autopsied specimens. Bioinformatics findings suggest that MeCp2, CDKL5 and BDNF genes play a role in regulating genes associated with epilepsy and disruptions in these genes may contribute to epilepsy development. Furthermore, the study reveals significantly lower MeCp2 and CDKL5 protein levels in the epileptic hippocampus compared to controls. Positive correlations are observed between MeCp2 and CDKL5 mRNA expression in autopsied samples and between CDKL5 and BDNF mRNA expression in epileptic hippocampal tissues. Differences in mRNA expression correlation patterns of MeCp2 and CDKL5 with BDNF are found between epileptic and control hippocampal tissues. Moreover, a significant positive correlation between MeCp2 and CDKL5 protein expression is noted in control hippocampal tissues. Our data suggest that altered expression of MeCp2, CDKL5 and BDNF within the hippocampus may contribute to epileptogenic processes in MTLE, impacting seizure characteristics, surgical outcomes and responses to antiepileptic drugs. Alterations in the expression of MeCp2, CDKL5 and BDNF within the hippocampus might contribute to the epileptogenic processes in MTLE. These changes could be linked to distinct functional consequences in epilepsy.

AB  - Methylosome protein 50 (Mep50) functions as a partner to protein arginine methyltransferase 5. MEP50 serves as a coactivator for both the androgen receptor and estrogen receptor in humans. Mep50 plays a crucial role in the development of germ cells in Drosophila . The precise role of Mep50 in oogenesis remains unclear in vertebrates. The objective of this study was to investigate the role of Mep50 in oogenesis in medaka fish. Disruption of Mep50 resulted in impaired oogenesis and the formation of multiple oocyte follicles in medaka. RNA-seq analysis revealed significant differential gene expression in the mutant ovary, with 4542 genes up-regulated and 1264 genes down-regulated. The regulated genes were found to be enriched in cellular matrices and ECM-receptor interaction, the Notch signaling pathway, the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, the MAPK signaling pathway, the Hippo signaling pathway, and the Jak -Stat pathway, among others. In addition, the genes related to the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonad axis, steroid metabolism, and IGF system were impacted. Furthermore, the mutation of mep50 caused significant alterations in alternative splicing of pre-mRNA in ovarian cells. Quantitative RT-PCR results validated the findings from RNA-seq analysis in the specific genes, including akt2 , map3k5 , yap1 , fshr , cyp17a , igf1 , ythdc2 , cdk6 , and col1 , among others. The findings of this study demonstrate that Mep50 plays a crucial role in oogenesis, participating in a diverse range of biological processes such as steroid metabolism, cell matrix regulation, and signal pathways. This may be achieved through the regulation of gene expression via mRNA splicing in medaka ovarian cells.

AB  - The light-sensitive (LS) albino tea plant grows albinic shoots lacking chlorophylls (Chls) under high-light (HL) conditions, and the albinic shoots re-green under low light (LL) conditions. The albinic shoots contain a high level of amino acids and are preferential materials for processing quality green tea. The young plants of the albino tea cultivars are difficult to be cultivated owing to lacking Chls. The mechanisms of the tea leaf bleaching and re-greening are unknown. We detected the activity and composition of photosystem II (PSII) subunits in LS albino tea cultivar "Huangjinya" (HJY), with a normal green-leaf cultivar "Jinxuan" (JX) as control so as to find the relationship of PSII impairment to the albino phenotype in tea. The PSII of HJY is more vulnerable to HL-stress than JX. HL-induced degradation of PSII subunits CP43, CP47, PsbP, PsbR. and light-harvest chlorophyll-protein complexes led to the exposure and degradation of D1 and D2, in which partial fragments of the degraded subunits were crosslinked to form larger aggregates. Two copies of subunits PsbO, psbN, and Lhcb1 were expressed in response to HL stress. The cDNA sequencing of CP43 shows that there is no difference in sequences of PsbC cDNA and putative amino acids of CP43 between HJY and JX. The de novo synthesis and/or repair of PSII subunits is considered to be involved in the impairment of PSII complexes, and the latter played a predominant role in the albino phenotype in the LS albino tea plant.

AB  - Adenosine is an ubiquitous neuromodulator that ensures cerebral homeostasis. It exerts numerous functions through the activation of G-protein-coupled adenosine receptors (ARs), in particular A1 (A1R) and A2A (A2AR) receptors. Interestingly, A2AR levels are upregulated in cortical and hippocampal regions in several pathological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, tauopathies or epilepsia. Such abnormal upregulations have been particularly reported in astrocytes, glial cells that play a key role in regulating synaptic plasticity. However, the overall impact and the underlying mechanisms associated with increased A2AR in astrocytes remain poorly understood. In the present study, we induced the upregulation of A2AR in hippocampal astrocytes using dedicated AAVs and comprehensively evaluated the functional consequences in 4 months-old C57Bl6/J mice. Our results show that A2AR upregulation primarily promotes alterations of astrocyte reactivity, morphology and transcriptome, with a link to aging-like phenotype as well as secondary impairments of neuronal excitability and microglial phenotype. These changes driven by a restricted A2AR upregulation in hippocampal astrocytes were sufficient to induce impairments of short-term spatial memory and spatial learning. This study highlights the impact of astrocytic A2AR upregulation, as seen in various neurological conditions, on the development of a detrimental multicellular response associated with memory alterations and provides an additional proof-of-concept for the value of targeting this receptor in different neurodegenerative conditions.

AB  - Chronic inflammatory bowel disorders (IBD) are idiopathic diseases associated with altered intestinal permeability, which in turn causes an exaggerated immune response to enteric antigens in a genetically susceptible host. A rise in psych cognitive disorders, such as anxiety and depression, has been observed in IBD patients. We here report investigations on a model of chemically induced experimental colitis by oral administration of sodium dextran sulfate (DSS) in C57BL/6 mice. We investigate, in vivo, the crosstalk between the intestine and the brain, evaluating the consequences of intestinal inflammation on neuroinflammation and hippocampal adult neurogenesis. By using different DSS administration strategies, we are able to induce acute or chronic colitis, simulating clinical characteristics observed in IBD patients. Body weight loss, colon shortening, alterations of the intestinal mucosa and fecal metabolic changes in amino acids-, lipid- and thiamine-related pathways are observed in colitis. The activation of inflammatory processes in the colon is confirmed by macrophage infiltration and increased expression of the proinflammatory cytokine and oxidative stress marker (Il-6 and iNOS). Interestingly, in the hippocampus of acutely DSS-treated mice, we report the upregulation of inflammatory-related genes (Il-6, Il-1 beta, S-100, Tgf-beta and Smad-3), together with microgliosis. Chronic DSS treatment also resulted in neuroinflammation in the hippocampus, indicated by astrocyte activation. Evaluation of stage-specific neurogenesis markers reveals deficits in the dentate gyrus after acute and chronic DSS treatments, indicative of defective adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Finally, based on a possible causal relationship between gut-related inflammation and brain cancer, we investigate the impact of DSS-induced colitis on oncogenesis, using the Ptch1(+/-)/C57BL/6 mice, a well-established medulloblastoma (MB) mouse model, finding no differences in MB development between untreated and DSS-treated mice. In conclusion, in our experimental model, the intestinal inflammation associated with acute and chronic colitis markedly influences brain homeostasis, impairing hippocampal neurogenesis but not MB oncogenesis.

AB  - Ischemic stroke and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) pose significant challenges in an aging population, particularly in post-stroke recovery. Using the 5xFAD mouse model, we explore the relationship between CAA, ischemic stroke, and tissue recovery. We hypothesize that amyloid-beta accumulation worsens stroke outcomes by inducing blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction, leading to impaired neurogenesis. Our findings show that CAA exacerbates stroke outcomes, with mice exhibiting constricted BBB microvessels, reduced cerebral blood flow, and impaired tissue recovery. Transcriptional analysis shows that endothelial cells and neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in the hippocampus exhibit differential gene expression in response to CAA and stroke, specifically targeting the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. In vitro experiments with human NPCs validate these findings, showing that disruption of the CXCL12-PIK3C2A-CREB3L2- PIK3C2A- CREB3L2 axis impairs neurogenesis. Notably, PI3K pathway activation restores neurogenesis, highlighting a potential therapeutic approach. These results suggest that CAA combined with stroke induces microvascular dysfunction and aberrant neurogenesis through this specific pathway.

AB  - The majority of myxosporean species (Cnidaria: Myxozoa) of the genera Myxobolus (35 species), Henneguya (8 species), and Myxidium (9 species) from freshwater or brackish fish in Japan were recorded more than 30 years ago (accumulatively 81.1% [43/53]). The re-discovery and molecular-genetic characterization of these species is a current research priority. During our myxosporean survey in Japanese freshwater fish, we detected three species that had never been recorded in Japan, but in the Russian Far East (Sakhalin Island, and Maritime Province): Myxobolus tribolodonus sp. n., forming cysts in the gills of Tribolodon sachalinensis (syn. M. marinus sensu Aseeva, 2000; M. marinus sensu Sokolov et Frolova, 2015, recorded from the gills of Pseudaspius (syn. Tribolodon) spp.); Henneguya pungitii Achmerov, 1953, forming cysts in the subcutis of external skin and buccal submucosa of Pungitius sinensis; and Myxidium salvelini Konovalov et Shulman, 1966, in the urinary bladder of Oncorhynchus masou ishikawae. These new isolates were characterized by integrated taxonomic approaches, i.e., myxospore morphology and molecular-genetic characterization of the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene (SSU rDNA). These new isolates were phylogenetically differentiated from any species whose SSU rDNA sequences were deposited in the DNA databases, and concurrently compared with recorded species based on classical morphological criteria. All three species were differentiated from myxosporeans previously recorded in Japan, indicating new distribution records out of the Russian Far East. For reliable species identification, accumulation of at least SSU rDNA sequences of known species worldwide is critically important.

AB  - Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) is a heterogeneous and common upper airway disease divided into various inflammatory endotypes. Recent epidemiological findings showed a T helper 2 (Th2)-skewed dominance in CRSwNP patients. Histone modification alterations can regulate transcriptional and translational expression, resulting in abnormal pathogenic changes and the occurrence of diseases. Trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3) is considered an activator of gene expression through modulation of accessibility for transcription, which is closely related to CRSwNP. H3K4me3 levels in the human nasal epithelium may change under Th2-biased inflammatory conditions, resulting in exaggerated local nasal Th2 responses via the regulation of naive CD4+ T-cell differentiation. Here, we revealed that the level of SET and MYND domain-containing protein 3 (SMYD3)-mediated H3K4me3 was increased in NPs from Th2 CRSwNP patients compared with those from healthy controls. We demonstrated that SMYD3-mediated H3K4me3 is increased in human nasal epithelial cells under Th2-biased inflammatory conditions via S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) production and further found that the H3K4me3high status of insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) produced in primary human nasal epithelial cells could promote naive CD4+ T-cell differentiation into Th2 cells. Moreover, we found that SAM production was dependent on the c-Myc/methionine adenosyltransferase 2A (MAT2A) axis in the nasal epithelium. Understanding histone modifications in the nasal epithelium has immense potential utility in the development of novel classes of therapeutics targeting Th2 polarization in Th2 CRSwNP.Et9-hJKHbB2Mg3CRtXWvn_Video Abstract

AB  - Activity-induced changes in protein palmitoylation can regulate the plasticity of synaptic connections, critically impacting learning and memory. Palmitoylation is a reversible post-translational modification regulated by both palmitoyl-acyl transferases that mediate palmitoylation and palmitoyl thioesterases that depalmitoylate proteins. However, it is not clear how fluctuations in synaptic activity can mediate the dynamic palmitoylation of neuronal proteins. Using primary hippocampal cultures, we demonstrate that synaptic activity does not impact the transcription of palmitoylating and depalmitoylating enzymes, changes in thioesterase activity, or posttranslational modification of the depalmitoylating enzymes of the ABHD17 family and APT2 (also known as LYPLA2). In contrast, synaptic activity does mediate post-translational modification of the palmitoylating enzymes ZDHHC2, ZDHHC5 and ZDHHC9 (but not ZDHHC8) to influence protein-protein interactions, enzyme stability and enzyme function. Post-translational modifications of the ZDHHC enzymes were also observed in the hippocampus following fear conditioning. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that signaling events activated by synaptic activity largely impact activity of the ZDHHC family of palmitoyl-acyl transferases with less influence on the activity of palmitoyl thioesterases.

AB  - Phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) is a low abundant phospholipid with important roles in lipid transport and membrane trafficking. However, little is known of its metabolism and function in neurons. Here, we investigate its subcellular distribution and functional roles in dendrites of rodent hippocampal neurons during resting state and long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP). We show that neural activity causes dynamic reversible changes in PI4P metabolism in dendrites. Upon LTP induction, PI4KIII alpha, a type III phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase, localizes to the dendritic plasma membrane (PM) in a calcium-dependent manner and causes substantial increase in the levels of PI4P. Acute inhibition of PI4KIII alpha activity abolishes trafficking of the AMPA-type glutamate receptor to the PM during LTP induction, and silencing of PI4KIII alpha expression in the hippocampal CA1 region causes severe impairment of LTP and long-term memory. Collectively, our results identify an essential role for PI4KIII alpha-dependent PI4P synthesis in synaptic plasticity of central nervous system neurons.

AB  - Secretogranin III (SgIII) is a granin protein involved in secretory granule formation in peptide-hormone-producing endocrine cells. In this study, we analyzed the expression of the LacZ reporter in the SgIII knockout mice produced by gene trapping (SgIII-gtKO) for the purpose of comprehensively clarifying the expression patterns of SgIII at the cell and tissue levels. In the endocrine tissues of SgIII-gtKO mice, LacZ expression was observed in the pituitary gland, adrenal medulla, and pancreatic islets, where SgIII expression has been canonically revealed. LacZ expression was extensively observed in brain regions, especially in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamic nuclei, cerebellum, and spinal cord. In peripheral nervous tissues, LacZ expression was observed in the retina, optic nerve, and trigeminal ganglion. LacZ expression was particularly prominent in astrocytes, in addition to neurons and ependymal cells. In the cerebellum, at least four cell types expressed SgIII under basal conditions. The expression of SgIII in the glioma cell lines C6 and RGC-6 was enhanced by excitatory glutamate treatment. It also became clear that the expression level of SgIII varied among neuron and astrocyte subtypes. These results suggest that SgIII is involved in glial cell function, in addition to neuroendocrine functions, in the nervous system:

AB  - Color variation in plant leaves has a significant impact on their photosynthesis and plant growth. Camellia chekiangoleosa yellow-leaf mutants are ideal materials for studying the mechanisms of pigment synthesis and photosynthesis, but their mechanism of leaf variation is not clear. We systematically elucidated the intrinsic causes of leaf yellowing in the new Camellia chekiangoleosa variety 'Diecui Liuji' in terms of changes in its cell structure, pigment content, and transcript levels. This study indicates that the incomplete structure of chloroplast-like vesicles, the decrease in blue-green chlorophyll a, and the increase in yellow-green chlorophyll b in yellowing leaves are the direct causes of yellowing-leaf formation. The high expression of genes that catalyze the degradation of chlorophyll a (PAO and RCCR) and its conversion to chlorophyll b (CAO) in yellowing leaves leads to a decrease in the chlorophyll a content, while the low expression of CLH genes is the main reason for the increase in the chlorophyll b content. We also found transcription factors such as ERF, E2F, WRKY, MYB, TPC, TGA, and NFYC may regulate their expression. RT-qPCR assays of 12 DEGs confirm the RNA-seq results. This study will provide a foundation for investigating the transcriptional and regulatory mechanisms of leaf color changes.

AB  - The Hippo pathway plays a tumorigenic role in highly angiogenic glioblastoma (GBM), whereas little is known about clinically relevant Hippo pathway inhibitors' ability to target adaptive mechanisms involved in GBM chemoresistance. Their molecular impact was investigated here in vitro against an alternative process to tumour angiogenesis termed vasculogenic mimicry (VM) in GBM-derived cell models. In silico analysis of the downstream Hippo signalling members YAP1, TAZ and TEAD1 transcript levels in low-grade glioblastoma (LGG) and GBM tumour tissues was performed using GEPIA. TAZ transcript levels did not differ between the healthy and tumour tissues data analysed. In contrast, YAP1 transcript levels were elevated in GBM tissues, whereas TEAD1 levels were high in both LGG and GBM. All three Hippo pathway inhibitors tested, GNE7883, VT107 and IAG933 effectively inhibited U87 and U251 cell migration and in vitro VM as assessed on Cultrex matrix. YAP1 gene and protein expression were induced upon VM, and its translocation to the nucleus was inhibited by the Hippo pathway inhibitors tested. SiRNA-mediated transient silencing of YAP1 repressed cell migration, VM formation and CTGF and Cyr61 transcription. In conclusion, targeting of VM using Hippo pathway inhibitors could help circumvent GBM chemoresistance and effectively complement other brain cancer treatments.

AB  - In recent years, primary familial brain calcification (PFBC), a rare neurological disease characterized by a wide spectrum of cognitive disorders, has been associated to mutations in the sodium (Na)-Phosphate (Pi) co-transporter SLC20A2. However, the functional roles of the Na-Pi co-transporters in the brain remain still largely elusive. Here we show that Slc20a1 (PiT-1) and Slc20a2 (PiT-2) are the most abundant Na-Pi co-transporters expressed in the brain and are involved in the control of hippocampal-dependent learning and memory. We reveal that Slc20a1 and Slc20a2 are differentially distributed in the hippocampus and associated with independent gene clusters, suggesting that they influence cognition by different mechanisms. Accordingly, using a combination of molecular, electrophysiological and behavioral analyses, we show that while PiT-2 favors hippocampal neuronal branching and survival, PiT-1 promotes synaptic plasticity. The latter relies on a likely Otoferlin-dependent regulation of synaptic vesicle trafficking, which impacts the GABAergic system. These results provide the first demonstration that Na-Pi co-transporters play key albeit distinct roles in the hippocampus pertaining to the control of neuronal plasticity and cognition. These findings could provide the foundation for the development of novel effective therapies for PFBC and cognitive disorders.

AB  - The spread of tumor cells and the formation of distant metastasis remain the main causes of mortality in cancer patients. However, the mechanisms governing the release of cells from micro-environmental constraints remain unclear. E-cadherin negatively controls the invasion of epithelial cells by maintaining cell-cell contacts. Furthermore, the inactivation of E-cadherin triggers invasion in vitro. However, the role of E-cadherin is complex, as metastasizing cells maintain E-cadherin expression, which appears to have a positive role in the survival of tumor cells. In this report, we present a novel mechanism delineating how E-cadherin function is modulated to promote invasion. We have previously shown that E-cadherin is associated with p100AmotL2, which is required for radial actin formation and the transmission of mechanical force. Here, we present evidence that p60AmotL2, which is expressed in invading tumor cells, binds to the p100AmotL2 isoform and uncouples the mechanical constraint of radial actin filaments. We show for the first time that the coupling of E-cadherin to the actin cytoskeleton via p100AmotL2 is directly connected to the nuclear membrane. The expression of p60AmotL2 inactivates this connection and alters the properties of the nuclear lamina, potentiating the invasion of cells into micropores of the extracellular matrix. In summary, we propose that the balance of the two AmotL2 isoforms is important in the modulation of E-cadherin function and that an imbalance of this axis promotes ameboid cell invasion.

AB  - The regulation of neurons by circadian clock genes is thought to contribute to the maintenance of neuronal functions that ultimately underlie animal behavior. However, the impact of specific circadian genes on cellular and molecular mechanisms controlling synaptic plasticity and cognitive function remains elusive. Here, we show that the expression of the circadian protein TIMELESS displays circadian rhythmicity in the mammalian hippocampus. We identify TIMELESS as a chromatin-bound protein that targets synaptic-plasticity-related genes such as phosphodiesterase 4B (Pde4b). By promoting Pde4b transcription, TIMELESS negatively regulates cAMP signaling to modulate AMPA receptor GluA1 function and influence synaptic plasticity. Conditional deletion of Timeless in the adult forebrain impairs working and contextual fear memory in mice. These cognitive phenotypes were accompanied by attenuation of hippocampal Schaffer-collateral synapse long-term potentiation. Together, these data establish a neuron-specific function of mammalian TIMELESS by defining a mechanism that regulates synaptic plasticity and cognitive function.

AB  - Nucleotide oligomerization domain-like receptors (NLRs), belonging to a large family of pattern recognition receptors, participate in the host's first line of defense against invading pathogens. Caspase recruitment domain containing 5 (NLRC5), the largest member in the NLR family, is demonstrated to be involved in the innate immune response and inflammatory diseases far and wide. Recent studies report that NLRC5 is associated with some central nervous system (CNS) diseases. Besides, NLRC5 is a mastery regulator for the expression of MHC class I both in the immune system and the CNS, while MHC class I is expressed and exerts its function in the brain. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the expression pattern of NLRC5 in the developing and adult CNS. In our study, postnatal brain sections of C57BL/6 J mice are analyzed for the expression of NLRC5 protein by immunofluorescence. In the postnatal stages of developing telencephalon, NLRC5 exhibits a spatial and temporal expression pattern. NLRC5 is time-specifically expressed in subfields of hippocampus and different layers of prefrontal cortex. Moreover, it is shown that NLRC5 is highly cell type specific. It can be expressed in large quantities by neurons and microglia, but rarely expressed by astrocytes. Taken together, our research is important for further understanding the biological characteristics of NLRC5 and its function in the CNS.

AB  - Ankyrin repeat and KH domain-containing protein 1, ANKHD1, has been identified as a regulator of signaling pathways and cellular processes of relevance in carcinogenesis. However, the role of ANKHD1 in breast cancer remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to characterize the expression pattern and involvement of ANKHD1 in the malignant phenotype of breast cancer cell lines and to investigate the clinical relevance of ANKHD1 in a breast cancer context. Gene and protein expressions were assessed in the cell lines by quantitative reverse transcription PCR and Western blot analysis, respectively, and ANKHD1 silencing through siRNA transfection was conducted for further in vitro functional assays. The expression of ANKHD1 was identified in non-tumorigenic breast epithelium and breast cancer cell lines, but differences in cellular localization were found among the neoplasia subtypes. ANKHD1 silencing reduced the viability, clonogenicity, and migration of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. Bioinformatics analyses demonstrated that patients with triple-negative basal-like 2 and mesenchymal breast cancer subtypes had high ANKHD1 expression associated with poor recurrence-free survival. Therefore, these data indicate that ANKHD1 relevance in breast cancer varies among its subtypes, indicating the importance of ANKHD1 in TNBC.

AB  - Presynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are essential for the control of synaptic transmission. However, how the subsynaptic dynamics of these receptors is controlled and contributes to synaptic signaling remain poorly understood quantitatively. Particularly, since the affinity of individual mGluR subtypes for glutamate differs considerably, the activation of mGluR subtypes critically depends on their precise subsynaptic distribution. Here, using superresolution microscopy and single-molecule tracking, we unravel novel molecular mechanisms that control the nanoscale distribution and mobility of presynaptic mGluRs in hippocampal neurons. We demonstrate that the high-affinity group II receptor mGluR2 localizes diffusely along the axon, and is highly mobile, while the low-affinity group III receptor mGluR7 is stably anchored at the active zone. We demonstrate that intracellular interactions modulate surface diffusion of mGluR2, while immobilization of mGluR7 at the active zone relies on its extracellular domain. Receptor activation or increases in synaptic activity do not alter the surface mobility of presynaptic mGluRs. Finally, computational modeling of presynaptic mGluR activity revealed that this particular nanoscale arrangement directly impacts their ability to modulate neurotransmitter release. Altogether, this study demonstrates that distinct mechanisms control surface mobility of presynaptic mGluRs to contribute differentially to glutamatergic synaptic transmission.

AB  - During amphibian metamorphosis which is triggered by thyroid hormone (TH), the small intestine is extensively remodeled from the larval to adult form. In the Xenopus laevis intestine, some of the larval epithelial cells dedifferentiate into adult stem cells, which newly form the adult epithelium similar to the mammalian one. We have previously shown that TH-activated Shh, Wnt and Notch signaling pathways play important roles in adult epithelial development. Here we focus on the Hippo signaling pathway, which is known to interact with these pathways in the mammalian intestine. Our quantitative RT-PCR analysis indicates that the expression of genes involved in this pathway including YAP1, TAZ, TEAD1 and core kinases is differently regulated by TH in the metamorphosing intestine. Additionally, we show by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry that the transcriptional co-activator YAP1, a major effector of the Hippo signaling, is expressed in the adult stem cells and connective tissue cells surrounding them and that YAP1 protein is localized in either nucleus or cytoplasm of the stem cells. We further show that YAP1 binds its binding partner TEAD1 (transcription factor) in vivo and that their interaction is inhibited by verteporfin (VP). More importantly, by using VP in organ culture of the tadpole intestine, we experimentally demonstrate that the inhibition of YAP1-TEAD1 interaction decreases both TH-induced stem cells expressing LGR5 and nearby connective tissue cells in number and proliferation, leading to the failure of adult epithelial development. Our results indicate that YAP-TEAD complex is required for stem cell development during intestinal remodeling.

AB  - TSLP is an alarmin released upon activation of epithelia in response to various external stimuli and is involved in type 2 cytokine-mediated pathological disorders. The formation of a high-affinity heterodimeric receptor complex, comprising the thymic stromal lymphopoietin receptor (TSLPR) chain and IL-7R alpha, is required for signaling. This study investigated whether TSLP and TSLPR expression in peripheral blood or nasal polyps could provide a valuable approach for the molecular phenotyping of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). The study population comprised 156 unrelated Caucasian individuals, including 45 controls and 111 patients with CRSwNP. Quantitative PCR analysis of TSLP and TSLPR was performed on the population study's peripheral blood and nasal biopsy. The data were analyzed for potential associations, and possible use as a biomarker was studied. Significant differences were observed in TSLP and TSLPR blood expression between the control group and patients. Similarly, the expression of TSLP observed in biopsy samples was statistically significantly elevated in the polyp tissue of the patient compared with healthy controls. The combination of TSLP and TSLPR expression testing with peripheral blood eosinophils represents a more specific biomarker in patients exhibiting low eosinophil values. Further investigation of TSLP/TSLPR mRNA levels in peripheral blood may yield new minimally invasive biomarkers.

AB  - Women are more vulnerable to stress and have a higher likelihood of developing mood disorders. The serotonin (5HT) system has been highly implicated in stress response and mood regulation. However, sex-dependent mechanisms underlying serotonergic regulation of stress vulnerability remain poorly understood. Here, we report that adult hippocampal neural stem cells (NSCs) of the Ascl1 lineage (Ascl1-NSCs) in female mice express functional 5HT1A receptors (5HT1ARs), and selective deletion of 5HT1ARs in Ascl1-NSCs decreases the Ascl1-NSC pool only in females. Mechanistically, 5HT1AR deletion in Ascl1-NSCs of females leads to 5HT-induced depolarization mediated by upregulation of 5HT7Rs. Furthermore, repeated restraint stress (RRS) impairs Ascl1-NSC maintenance through a 5HT1AR-mediated mechanism. By contrast, Ascl1-NSCs in males express 5HT7R receptors (5HT7Rs) that are downregulated by RRS, thus maintaining the Ascl1NSC pool. These findings suggest that sex-specific expression of distinct 5HTRs and their differential interactions with stress may underlie sex differences in stress vulnerability.

AB  - New fossil remains of Rhinocerotidae, dated from the early Late Miocene, were discovered from the lowermost part of the Irrawaddy Formation in the Tebingan area, Magway Region, central Myanmar. The Tebingan rhinoceros fossils, consisting of isolated teeth, maxillae, and mandibles, are assigned to three taxa: Brachypotherium perimense defined by a constricted protocone, a well-developed parastyle and broad upper teeth, to 'Brachypotherium' fatehjangense with a flat ectoloph, crochet, and the absence of tubercle at the entrance of the median valley. Other specimens were assigned to Rhinoceros sp. due to having a developed parastyle, crochet and a strong anterior cingulum and the absence of a constricted protocone and ante-crochet. The evolutionary history of Rhinocerotidae is poorly known in Southeast Asia, and few rhinoceros' species have been identified from the Irrawaddy Formation. The newly identified Rhinoceros specimens from the early Late Miocene Tebingan area are the oldest fossil records for Rhinoceros in Southeast Asia. The Tebingan mammal fauna is similar to the Nagri and Dhok Pathan faunas of the lower/middle Siwaliks of the Indian subcontinent, indicating the faunal exchange between these two regions in the late Neogene.

AB  - Progestin resistance is a problem for patients with endometrial carcinoma (EC) who require conservative treatment with progestin, and its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. YAP and TAZ (YAP/TAZ), downstream transcription coactivators of Hippo pathway, promote viability, metastasis and also drug resistance of malignant tumors. According to our microarray analysis, YAP/TAZ were upregulated in progestin resistant IshikawaPR cell versus progestin sensitive Ishikawa cell, which implied that YAP/TAZ may be a vital promotor of resistance to progestin. We found YAP/TAZ had higher expression levels among the resistant tissues than sensitive tissues. In addition, knocking down YAP/TAZ decreased cell viability, inhibited cell migration and invasion and increased the sensitivity of IshikawaPR cell to progestin. On the contrary, overexpression of YAP/TAZ increased cell proliferation, metastasis and promoted progestin resistance. We also confirmed YAP/TAZ were involved in progestin resistant process by regulating PI3K-Akt pathway. Furthermore, Verteporfin as an inhibitor of YAP/TAZ could increase sensitivity of IshikawaPR cells to progestin in vivo and in vitro. Our study for the first time indicated that YAP/TAZ play an important role in progestin resistance by regulating PI3K-Akt pathway in EC, which may provide ideas for clinical targeted therapy of progestin resistance.

AB  - All organisms are constantly exposed to various stresses, necessitating adaptive strategies for survival. In bacteria, the main stress-coping mechanism is the stringent response triggered by the accumulation of "alarmone" (p)ppGpp to arrest proliferation and reprogram transcriptome. While mammalian genomes encode MESH1-the homolog of the (p)ppGpp hydrolase SpoT, current knowledge about its function remains limited. We found MESH1 expression tended to be higher in tumors and associated with poor patient outcomes. Consistently, MESH1 knockdown robustly inhibited proliferation, depleted dNTPs, reduced tumor sphere formation, and retarded xenograft growth. These antitumor phenotypes associated with MESH1 knockdown were accompanied by a significantly altered transcriptome, including the repressed expression of TAZ, a HIPPO coactivator, and proliferative gene. Importantly, TAZ restoration mitigated many anti-growth phenotypes of MESH1 knockdown, including proliferation arrest, reduced sphere formation, tumor growth inhibition, dNTP depletion, and transcriptional changes. Furthermore, TAZ repression was associated with the histone hypo-acetylation at TAZ regulatory loci due to the induction of epigenetic repressors HDAC5 and AHRR. Together, MESH1 knockdown in human cells altered the genome-wide transcriptional patterns and arrested proliferation that mimicked the bacterial stringent response through the epigenetic repression of TAZ expression.

AB  - In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), differentiation of pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) into myofibroblast-like cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) can both promote and suppress tumor progression. Here, we show that the Rho effector protein kinase N2 (PKN2) is critical for PSC myofibroblast differentiation. Loss of PKN2 is associated with reduced PSC proliferation, contractility, and alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) stress fibers. In spheroid co-cultures with PDAC cells, loss of PKN2 prevents PSC invasion but, counter-intuitively, promotes invasive cancer cell outgrowth. PKN2 deletion induces a myofibroblast to inflammatory CAF switch in the PSC matrisome signature both in vitro and in vivo. Further, deletion of PKN2 in the pancreatic stroma induces more locally invasive, orthotopic pancreatic tumors. Finally, we demonstrate that a PKN2KO matrisome signature predicts poor outcome in pancreatic and other solid human cancers. Our data indicate that suppressing PSC myofibroblast function can limit important stromal tumor-suppressive mechanisms, while promoting a switch to a cancer-supporting CAF phenotype.

AB  - Calcium-permeable kainate and AMPA receptors (CP-KARs and CP-AMPARs), as well as NMDARs, play a pivotal role in plasticity and in regulating neurotransmitter release. Here we visualized in the mature hippocampal neuroglial cultures the neurons expressing CP-AMPARs and CP-KARs. These neurons were visualized by a characteristic fast sustained [Ca2+](i) increase in response to the agonist of these receptors, domoic acid (DoA), and a selective agonist of GluK1-containing KARs, ATPA. Neurons from both subpopulations are GABAergic. The subpopulation of neurons expressing CP-AMPARs includes a larger percentage of calbindin-positive neurons (39.4 +/- 6.0%) than the subpopulation of neurons expressing CP-KARs (14.2 +/- 7.5% of CB+ neurons). In addition, we have shown for the first time that NH4Cl-induced depolarization faster induces an [Ca2+](i) elevation in GABAergic neurons expressing CP-KARs and CP-AMPARs than in most glutamatergic neurons. CP-AMPARs antagonist, NASPM, increased the amplitude of the DoA-induced Ca2+ response in GABAergic neurons expressing CP-KARs, indicating that neurons expressing CP-AMPARs innervate GABAergic neurons expressing CP-KARs. We assume that CP-KARs in inhibitory neurons are involved in the mechanism of outstripping GABA release upon hyperexcitation.

AB  - The use of lumpfish (Cyclopterus lumpus) as a cleaner fish to fight sea lice infestation in farmed Atlantic salmon has become increasingly common. Still, tools to increase our knowledge about lumpfish biology are lacking. Here, we successfully established and characterized the first Lumpfish Gill cell line (LG-1). LG-1 are adherent, homogenous and have a flat, stretched-out and almost transparent appearance. Transmission electron microscopy revealed cellular protrusions and desmosome-like structures that, together with their ability to generate a transcellular epithelial/endothelial resistance, suggest an epithelial or endothelial cell type. Furthermore, the cells exert Cytochrome P450 1A activity. LG-1 supported the propagation of several viruses that may lead to severe infectious diseases with high mortalities in fish farming, including viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) and infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV). Altogether, our data indicate that the LG-1 cell line originates from an epithelial or endothelial cell type and will be a valuable in vitro research tool to study gill cell function as well as host-pathogen interactions in lumpfish.

AB  - Somatic DNA copy number variations (CNVs) are prevalent in cancer and can drive cancer progression, albeit with often uncharacterized roles in altering cell signaling states. Here, we integrate genomic and proteomic data for 5,598 tumor samples to identify CNVs leading to aberrant signal transduction. The resulting associations recapitulate known kinase-substrate relationships, and further network analysis prioritizes likely causal genes. Of the 303 significant associations we identify from the pan-tumor analysis, 43% are replicated in cancer cell lines, including 44 robust gene-phosphosite associations identified across multiple tumor types. Several predicted regulators of hippo signaling are experimentally validated. Using RNAi, CRISPR, and drug screening data, we find evidence of kinase addiction in cancer cell lines, identifying inhibitors for targeting of kinase-dependent cell lines. We propose copy number status of genes as a useful predictor of differential impact of kinase inhibition, a strategy that may be of use in the future for anticancer therapies.

AB  - Mood, anxiety, and trauma-related disorders (MATRDs) are highly prevalent and comorbid. A sizable number of patients do not respond to first-line treatments. Non-invasive neuromodulation is a second-line treatment approach, but current methods rely on cortical targets to indirectly modulate subcortical structures, e.g., the amygdala, implicated in MATRDs. Low-intensity transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) is a non-invasive technique for direct subcortical neuromodulation, but its safety, feasibility, and promise as a potential treatment is largely unknown. In a target engagement study, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided tFUS to the left amygdala was administered during functional MRI (tFUS/fMRI) to test for acute modulation of blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal in a double-blind, within-subject, sham-controlled design in patients with MATRDs (N = 29) and healthy comparison subjects (N = 23). In an unblinded treatment trial, the same patients then underwent 3-week daily (15 sessions) MRI-guided repetitive tFUS (rtFUS) to the left amygdala to examine safety, feasibility, symptom change, and change in amygdala reactivity to emotional faces. Active vs. sham tFUS/fMRI reduced, on average, left amygdala BOLD signal and produced patient-related differences in hippocampal and insular responses. rtFUS was well-tolerated with no serious adverse events. There were significant reductions on the primary outcome (Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire General Distress subscale; p = 0.001, Cohen's d = 0.77), secondary outcomes (Cohen's d of 0.43-1.50), and amygdala activation to emotional stimuli. Findings provide initial evidence of tFUS capability to modulate amygdala function, rtFUS safety and feasibility in MATRDs, and motivate double-blind randomized controlled trials to examine efficacy.ClinicalTrials.gov registration: NCT05228964

AB  - Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and depression are both common conditions with significant socioeconomic impact. The high co-occurrence of depression in CRS patients suggests a common pathophysiology, but the mechanisms are unclear. This study aimed to identify potential molecular links between the two conditions. We retrieved gene expression datasets for CRS and depression from the GEO database. Using differentially expressed genes (DEGs) analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), we identified co-expression genes associated with CRS and depression. Enrichment analyses including GO, KEGG, and GSEA were performed to explore biological pathways. Machine learning algorithms including random forest and LASSO regression were engaged to screen for shared hub genes predictive of CRS and depression. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data were analyzed to delineate the expression profiles of the shared hub genes across different cell types. Animal experiments were employed to validate the role of core genes in CRS-related depression. We identified five shared hub genes: CHRDL1, DIO2, HSD17B6, PDE3A, and PLA2G5, with the TGF-beta signaling, cytokine-cytokine interaction receptors, and cell adhesion as key biological pathways. DIO2, as identified by machine learning, is a promising diagnostic biomarker for CRS and depression. The scRNA-seq analysis showed that DIO2 is primarily expressed in neurons and astrocytes. Animal experiments showed that overexpression of DIO2 improved the depressive-like behaviors in CRS mice. This study sheds new light on the molecular basis of the comorbidity between CRS and depression. DIO2 is a potential diagnostic and therapeutic target for CRS patients with comorbid depression.

AB  - BackgroundTauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease, are characterized by the pathological aggregation of tau protein, which is strongly linked to dysregulation of the autophagy-lysosomal degradation pathway. However, therapeutic strategies targeting this pathway remain limited.MethodsWe used both in vitro and in vivo models to investigate the role of Raptor in tau pathology. Knockdown of Raptor was performed to assess its impact on mTORC1 activation, autophagy, and tau accumulation. The relationship between USP9X and Raptor was also examined. Pharmacological inhibition of USP9X with WP1130 was employed to further confirm the involvement of the USP9X-Raptor-mTORC1 axis in tau degradation.ResultsElevated Raptor levels in the hippocampus of P301S mice led to hyperactivation of mTORC1, impairing autophagy flux. Knockdown of Raptor effectively suppressed mTORC1 activation, promoted autophagy, and mitigated the accumulation of tau and its phosphorylated isoforms. This reduction in tau pathology was accompanied by decreased neuronal loss in the hippocampus, amelioration of synaptic damage, and improvement in cognitive function. The increased Raptor protein observed in the hippocampus of P301S mice was likely attributable to elevated USP9X content, which enhanced Raptor deubiquitination and protected it from proteasomal degradation. Pharmacological inhibition of USP9X with WP1130 in vitro effectively suppressed Raptor, promoted autophagy, and accelerated the degradation of tau and phosphorylated tau.ConclusionsOur findings highlight Raptor and USP9X as promising molecular targets for therapeutic intervention in tauopathies. Targeting the USP9X-Raptor-mTORC1 axis may provide a novel strategy for promoting autophagy and mitigating tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies.

AB  - Recent findings show that effective integration of novel information in the brain requires coordinated processes of homo- and heterosynaptic plasticity. In this work, we hypothesize that activity -dependent remodeling of the peri-synaptic extracellular matrix (ECM) contributes to these processes. We show that clusters of the peri-synaptic ECM, recognized by CS56 antibody, emerge in response to sensory stimuli, showing temporal and spatial coincidence with dendritic spine plasticity. Using CS56 co-immunoprecipitation of synaptosomal proteins, we identify several molecules involved in Ca 2+ signaling, vesicle cycling, and AMPA-receptor exocytosis, thus suggesting a role in long-term potentiation (LTP). Finally, we show that, in the CA1 hippocampal region, the attenuation of CS56 glycoepitopes, through the depletion of versican as one of its main carriers, impairs LTP and object location memory in mice. These findings show that activity -dependent remodeling of the peri-synaptic ECM regulates the induction and consolidation of LTP, contributing to hippocampal-dependent memory.

AB  - Serotonin receptor 5-HT2A and tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) strongly contribute to neuroplasticity regulation and are implicated in numerous neuronal disorders. Here, we demonstrate a physical interaction between 5-HT2A and TrkB in vitro and in vivo using co-immunoprecipitation and biophysical and biochemical approaches. Heterodimerization decreased TrkB autophosphorylation, preventing its activation with agonist 7,8-DHF, even with low 5-HT2A receptor expression. A blockade of 5-HT2A receptor with the preferential antagonist ketanserin prevented the receptor-mediated downregulation of TrkB phosphorylation without restoring the TrkB response to its agonist 7,8-DHF in vitro. In adult mice, intraperitoneal ketanserin injection increased basal TrkB phosphorylation in the frontal cortex and hippocampus, which is in accordance with our findings demonstrating the prevalence of 5-HT2A-TrkB heteroreceptor complexes in these brain regions. An expression analysis revealed strong developmental regulation of 5-HT2A and TrkB expressions in the cortex, hippocampus, and especially the striatum, demonstrating that the balance between TrkB and 5-HT2A may shift in certain brain regions during postnatal development. Our data reveal the functional role of 5-HT2A-TrkB receptor heterodimerization and suggest that the regulated expression of 5-HT2A and TrkB is a molecular mechanism for the brain-region-specific modulation of TrkB functions during development and under pathophysiological conditions.

AB  - Evidence suggests that the hippocampus conveys memory-related neural patterns across distributed cortical circuits during high-frequency oscillations called sharp-wave ripples (SWRs). We investigate how circuit activity in the retrosplenial cortex (RSC), a primary hippocampal target, could aid in processing SWR-related input. Using patch-clamp recordings from awake mice, we find that SWR-aligned membrane potential modulation is widespread but weak, and that spiking responses are sparse. However, using cell -type-specific two-photon Ca2+ imaging and optogenetics, we show that, 1???2 s before SWRs, superficial in-hibition and thalamocortical input in RSC is reduced. We propose that pyramidal dendrites experience decreased local inhibition and subcortical interference in a seconds-long time window preceding SWRs. This may aid communication of weak and sparse SWR-aligned excitation between the hippocampus and neocortex and promote the strengthening of memory-related connections.

AB  - Adult-onset hypothyroidism is associated with learning and cognitive dysfunctions, which may be related to alterations in synaptic plasticity. Local reduced levels of thyroid hormones (THs) may impair glia morphology and activity, and promote the increase of pro-inflammatory cytokine levels mainly in the hippocampus. Given that neuroinflammation induces memory impairments, hypothyroidism-related glia dysfunction may participate in brain disorders. Thus, we investigated the mechanisms linking hypothyroidism and neuroinflammation, from a protective perspective. We induced hypothyroidism in adult C57BL/6J and wild-derived WSB/EiJ male mice by a seven-week propylthiouracil (PTU) treatment. We previously showed that WSB/EiJ mice were resistant to high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity, showing no neuroinflammatory response through adaptive abilities, unlike C57BL/6J. As PTU and HFD treatments are known to induce comparable inflammatory responses, we hypothesized that WSB/EiJ mice might also be protected against hypothyroidism-induced neuroinflammation. We showed that hypothyroid WSB/EiJ mice depicted no hippocampal neuroinflammatory response and were able to maintain their hippocampal thyroid signalling despite low circulatisng TH levels. In contrast, C57BL/6J mice exhibited disturbed hippocampal TH signalling, accompanied by neuroinflammation and memory impairment. Our results reinforce the preponderance of the hippocampal TH regulatory system over TH circulating levels in the hippocampal glial reactivity.

AB  - Brain G-protein coupled receptors have been hypothesized to be potential targets for maintaining or restoring cognitive function in normal aged individuals or in patients with neurodegenerative disease. A number of recent reports suggest that activation of melanocortin receptors (MCRs) in the brain can significantly improve cognitive functions of normal rodents and of different rodent models of the Alzheimer's disease. However, the potential impact of normative aging on the expression of MCRs and their potential roles for modulating cognitive function remains to be elucidated. In the present study, we first investigated the expression of these receptors in six different brain regions of young (6 months) and aged (23 months) rats following assessment of their cognitive status. Correlation analysis was further performed to reveal potential contributions of MCR subtypes to spatial learning and memory. Our results revealed statistically significant correlations between the expression of several MCR subtypes in the frontal cortex/hypothalamus and the hippocampus regions and the rats' performance in spatial learning and memory only in the aged rats. These findings support the hypothesis that aging has a direct impact on the expression and function of MCRs, establishing MCRs as potential drug targets to alleviate aging-induced decline of cognitive function.

AB  - JAV1-associated ubiquitin ligase 1 (JUL1) is a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase that catalyzes ubiquitination of JAV1, a jasmonate signaling repressor, in Arabidopsis thaliana in response to herbivore attack. Here we present a new insight into the nature of JUL1 as a multi-targeting enzyme for not only JAV1 but also transcription factors (TFs) screened using in vitro and in vivo protein interaction assays. Reporter assays using protoplasts showed that the JUL1-interacting TFs (JiTFs), including ERF15, bZIP53 and ORA59, were involved in transcriptional activation of jasmonate-responsive PDF1.2 and abscisic acid-responsive GEA6. Likewise, assays using mutant plants suggested that the 3 JiTFs were indeed responsible for transcriptional regulation of PDF1.2 and/or GEA6, and ERF15 and ORA59 were substantially responsible for the anti-herbivore trait. In vitro protein ubiqutination assays showed that JUL1 catalyzed ubiqutination of JAV1 but not any of the TFs. This was in accord with the finding that JUL1 abolished JAV1 ' s interference with ERF15 function, according to the reporter assay. Moreover, of great interest is our finding that ERF15 but not bZIP53 or ORA59 serves as a scaffold for the JAV1/JUL1 system, indicating that there is narrow selectivity of the transcriptional reprogramming by the JAV1/JUL1 system.

AB  - Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS), approximates the key histopathological, clinical, and immunological features of MS. Hippocampal dysfunction in MS and EAE causes varying degrees of cognitive and emotional impairments and synaptic abnormalities. However, the molecular alterations underlying hippocampal dysfunctions in MS and EAE are still under investigation. The purpose of this study was to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the hippocampus of mice with EAE in order to ascertain potential genes associated with hippocampal dysfunction. Gene expression in the hippocampus was analyzed by RNA-sequencing and validated by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Gene expression analysis revealed 1202 DEGs; 1023 were upregulated and 179 were downregulated in the hippocampus of mice with EAE (p-value < 0.05 and fold change >1.5). Gene ontology (GO) analysis showed that the upregulated genes in the hippocampi of mice with EAE were associated with immune system processes, defense responses, immune responses, and regulation of immune responses, whereas the downregulated genes were related to learning or memory, behavior, and nervous system processes in the GO biological process. The expressions of hub genes from the search tool for the retrieval of interacting genes/proteins (STRING) analysis were validated by RT-qPCR. Additionally, gene set enrichment analysis showed that the upregulated genes in the hippocampus were associated with inflammatory responses: interferon-gamma responses, allograft rejection, interferon-alpha responses, IL6_JAK_STAT3 signaling, inflammatory responses, complement, IL2_STAT5 signaling, TNF-alpha signaling via NF-kappa B, and apoptosis, whereas the downregulated genes were related to synaptic plasticity, dendritic development, and development of dendritic spine. This study characterized the transcriptome pattern in the hippocampi of mice with EAE and signaling pathways underpinning hippocampal dysfunction. However, further investigation is needed to determine the applicability of these findings from this rodent model to patients with MS. Collectively, these results indicate directions for further research to understand the mechanisms behind hippocampal dysfunction in EAE.

AB  - Tea is a perennial crop that requires acidic soil for better plant growth. Due to the acidic nature of tea-growing soil, metals can be easily absorbed by tea plants from growing medium. Other anthropogenic activities are also the major contributor of element in the tea. This study provided a comprehensive database of 24 elements which were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Selected 24 elements belong to alkali metal (Li, Rb, Cs), alkaline earth metal (Be, Sr, Ba), transition metal (V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ag, Cd, Hg), basic metal (Al, Ga, Sn, Tl, Pb), metalloid (As), non-metal (Se), and actinide (U). Total 321 drier mouth samples were collected during 2020-2021 from eight different regions (Darjeeling, Terai, Dooars, North Bank, Upper Assam, South Bank, Cachar, and Tripura) of north-east India. No inorganic mercury as well as uranium was detected in any tested tea samples. Mean concentrations of Be, As, Ga, Tl, Li, Se, Cd, Ag, Cs, V, Co, and Pb were at trace level, whereas macro-element mean concentrations were distributed in the manner of Al > Mn > Rb > Ba > Zn > Cu > Sr > Cr > Ni > Sn. Human health risk for non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic metals was also assessed for the studied elements. Hazard quotients (HQs) and hazard index (HI) values (< 1) for non-carcinogenic elements indicated no risk. The incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) values for carcinogenic elements indicated no risk for As, Cd, and Pb and medium level risk for Ni. Study concluded that north-east Indian tea would not pose any health hazard.

AB  - Transcriptome sequencing has offered immense opportunities to study non -model organisms. Abalone is an important marine mollusk that encounters harsh environmental conditions in its natural habitat and under aquaculture conditions; hence, research that increases molecular information to understand abalone physiology and stress response is noteworthy. Accordingly, the study used transcriptome sequencing of the gill tissues of abalone exposed to low salinity stress. The aim is to explore some enriched pathways during salinity stress and the crosstalk and functions of the genes involved in the candidate biological processes for future further analysis of their expression patterns. The data suggest that abalone genes such as YAP/TAZ, Myc, Nkd, and Axin (involved in the Hippo signaling pathway) and PI3K/Akt, SHC, and RTK (involved in the Ras signaling pathways) might mediate growth and development. Thus, deregulation of the Hippo and Ras pathways by salinity stress could be a possible mechanism by which unfavorable salinities influence growth in abalone. Furthermore, PEPCK, GYS, and PLC genes (mediating the Glucagon signaling pathway) might be necessary for glucose homeostasis, reproduction, and abalone meat sensory qualities; hence, a need to investigate how they might be influenced by environmental stress. Genes such as MYD88, IRAK1/4, JNK, AP -1, and TRAF6 (mediating the MAPK signaling pathway) could be useful in understanding abalone's innate immune response to environmental stresses. Finally, the aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis pathway hints at the mechanism by which new raw materials for protein biosynthesis are mobilized for physiological processes and how abalone might respond to this process during salinity stress. Low salinity clearly regulated genes in these pathways in a time -dependent manner, as hinted by the heat maps. In the future, qRT-PCR verification and in-depth study of the various genes and proteins discussed would provide enormous molecular information resources for the abalone biology.

AB  - Organelles play core roles in living beings, especially in internal cellular actions, but the hidden information inside the cell is difficult to extract in a label-free manner. In recent years, terahertz (THz) imaging has attracted much attention because of its penetration depth in nonpolar and non-metallic materials and label-free, non-invasive and non-ionizing ability to obtain the interior information of bio-samples. However, the low spatial resolution of traditional far-field THz imaging systems and the weak dielectric contrast of biological samples hinder the application of this technology in the biological field. In this paper, we used an advanced THz scattering near-field imaging method for detecting chloroplasts on gold substrate with nano-flatness combined with an image processing method to remove the background noise and successfully obtained the subcellular-grade internal reticular structure from an Arabidopsis chloroplast THz image. In contrast, little inner information could be observed in the tea chloroplast in similar THz images. Further, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and mass spectroscopy (MS) were also used to detect structural and chemical differences inside the chloroplasts of Arabidopsis and tea plants. The preliminary results suggested that the interspecific different THz information is related to the internal spatial structures of chloroplasts and metabolite differences among species. Therefore, this method could open a new way to study the structure of individual organelles.

AB  - The diurnal rodent Octodon degus (O. degus) is considered an attractive natural model for Alzheimer's disease and other human age-related features. However, it has not been explored so far if the O. degus could be used as a model to study Parkinson's disease. To test this idea, 10 adult male O. degus were divided into control group and MPTP-intoxicated animals. Motor condition and cognition were examined. Dopaminergic degeneration was studied in the ventral mesencephalon and in the striatum. Neuroinflammation was also evaluated in the ventral mesencephalon, in the striatum and in the dorsal hippocampus. MPTP animals showed significant alterations in motor activity and in visuospatial memory. Postmortem analysis revealed a significant decrease in the number of dopaminergic neurons in the ventral mesencephalon of MPTP animals, although no differences were found in their striatal terminals. We observed a significant increase in neuroinflammatory responses in the mesencephalon, in the striatum and in the hippocampus of MPTP-intoxicated animals. Additionally, changes in the subcellular expression of the calcium-binding protein S100 beta were found in the astrocytes in the nigrostriatal pathway. These findings prove for the first time that O. degus are sensitive to MPTP intoxication and, therefore, is a suitable model for experimental Parkinsonism in the context of aging.

AB  - Patients with focal temporal lobe seizures often experience loss of consciousness associated with cortical slow waves, like those in deep sleep. Previous work in rat models suggests that decreased subcortical arousal causes depressed cortical function during focal seizures. However, these studies were performed under light anesthesia, making it impossible to correlate conscious behavior with physiology. We show in an awake mouse model that electrically induced focal seizures in the hippocampus cause impaired behavioral responses to auditory stimuli, cortical slow waves, and reduced mean cortical high-frequency activity. Behavioral responses are related to cortical cholinergic release at two different timescales. Slow state- related decreases in acetylcholine correlate with overall impaired behavior during seizures. Fast phasic acetylcholine release is related to variable spared or impaired behavioral responses with each auditory stimulus. These findings establish a strong relationship between decreased cortical arousal and impaired consciousness in focal seizures, which may help guide future treatment.

AB  - In recent years, new DNA methylation variants have been reported in genes biologically relevant to Alzheimer's disease (AD) in human brain tissue. However, this AD-specific epigenetic information remains brain-locked and unreachable during patients' lifetimes. In a previous methylome performed in the hippocampus of 26 AD patients and 12 controls, we found higher methylation levels in AD patients in the promoter region of PRLHR, a gene involved in energy balance regulation. Our aim was to further characterize PRLHR's role in AD and to evaluate if the liquid biopsy technique would provide life access to this brain information in a non-invasive way. First, we extended the methylation mapping of PRLHR and validated previous methylome results via bisulfite cloning sequencing. Next, we observed a positive correlation between PRLHR methylation levels and AD-related neuropathological changes and a decreased expression of PRLHR in AD hippocampus. Then, we managed to replicate the hippocampal methylation differences in plasma cfDNA from an additional cohort of 35 AD patients and 35 controls. The isolation of cfDNA from the plasma of AD patients may constitute a source of potential epigenetic biomarkers to aid AD clinical management.

AB  - Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the major malignant tumors among men worldwide. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been documented as important modulators in human cancers, including PCa. In our study, we investigated the role and potential mechanism of RP1-59D14.5 in PCa. RP1-59D14.5 expressed at a low level in PCa cells. Gain-of-function assays including colony formation and transwell assays displayed that RP1-59D14.5 overexpression repressed PCa cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Besides, RP1-59D14.5 up-regulation induced autophagy in PCa cells. Mechanically, luciferase reporter assays and western blot verified that RP1-59D14.5 activated the Hippo pathway in PCa cells. Through RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP) and RNA pull-down assays, we validated that RP1-59D14.5 functioned as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) to regulate large tumor suppressor kinase 1/2 (LATS1/2) via targeting miR-147a. Moreover, RP1-59D14.5 recruited HUR to promote casein kinase 1 (CK1) expression. Collectively, RP1-59D14.5 promoted yes-associated protein (YAP) degradation to activate the Hippo pathway in PCa progression via targeting the miR-147a/LATS1/2 axis and recruiting HUR to promote the interaction of CK1 and beta-transducin repeat-containing protein (beta TrCP). These results implied that RP1-59D14.5 acted as a tumor suppressor in PCa, which might be a target for PCa treatment.

AB  - Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), the most common pediatric soft tissue sarcoma, comprises embryonal (ERMS) and alveolar (ARMS) subtypes with distinct histopathological features, clinical outcomes, and therapeutic responses. To better characterize their molecular distinctions, we performed untargeted plasma proteomics and metabolomics profiling in children with ERMS (n = 18), ARMS (n = 17), and matched healthy controls (n = 18). Differential expression, functional enrichment (GO, KEGG, RaMP-DB), co-expression network analysis (WGCNA/WMCNA), and multi-omics integration (DIABLO, MOFA) revealed distinct molecular signatures for each subtype. ARMS displayed elevated oncogenic and stemness-associated proteins (e.g., cyclin E1, FAP, myotrophin) and metabolites involved in lipid transport, fatty acid metabolism, and polyamine biosynthesis. In contrast, ERMS was enriched in immune-related and myogenic proteins (e.g., myosin-9, SAA2, S100A11) and metabolites linked to glutamate/glycine metabolism and redox homeostasis. Pathway analyses highlighted subtype-specific activation of PI3K-Akt and Hippo signaling in ARMS and immune and coagulation pathways in ERMS. Additionally, the proteomics and metabolomics datasets showed association with clinical parameters, including disease stage, lymph node involvement, and age, demonstrating clear molecular discrimination consistent with clinical observation. Co-expression networks and integrative analyses further reinforced these distinctions, uncovering coordinated protein-metabolite modules.

AB  - BackgroundThe neonatal mammalian heart exhibits considerable regenerative potential following injury through cardiomyocyte proliferation, whereas mature cardiomyocytes withdraw from the cell cycle and lose regenerative capacities. Therefore, investigating the mechanisms underlying neonatal cardiomyocyte proliferation and regeneration is crucial for unlocking the regenerative potential of adult mammalian heart to repair damage and restore contractile function following myocardial injury.MethodsThe Tudor staphylococcal nuclease (Tudor-SN) transgenic (TG) or cardiomyocyte-specific knockout mice (Myh6-Tudor-SN -/-) were generated to investigate the role of Tudor-SN in cardiomyocyte proliferation and heart regeneration following apical resection (AR) surgery. Primary cardiomyocytes isolated from neonatal mice were used to assess the influence of Tudor-SN on cardiomyocyte proliferation in vitro. Affinity purification and mass spectrometry were employed to elucidate the underlying mechanism. H9c2 cells and mouse myocardia with either overexpression or knockout of Tudor-SN were utilized to assess its impact on the phosphorylation of Yes-associated protein (YAP), both in vitro and in vivo.ResultsWe previously identified Tudor-SN as a cell cycle regulator that is highly expressed in neonatal mice myocardia but downregulated in adults. Our present study demonstrates that sustained expression of Tudor-SN promotes and prolongs the proliferation of neonatal cardiomyocytes, improves cardiac function, and enhances the ability to repair the left ventricular apex resection in neonatal mice. Consistently, cardiomyocyte-specific knockout of Tudor-SN impairs cardiac function and retards recovery after injury. Tudor-SN associates with YAP, which plays important roles in heart development and regeneration, inhibiting phosphorylation at Ser 127 and Ser 397 residues by preventing the association between Large Tumor Suppressor 1 (LATS1) and YAP, correspondingly maintaining stability and promoting nuclear translocation of YAP to enhance the proliferation-related genes transcription.ConclusionTudor-SN regulates the phosphorylation of YAP, consequently enhancing and prolonging neonatal cardiomyocyte proliferation under physiological conditions and promoting neonatal heart regeneration after injury.

AB  - CD38 is the main NADase in mammalian cells. It regulates the homeostasis of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and extracellular nucleotides. Its function plays an important role in infection and aging. However, its potential functions in tumor cells have not been fully elucidated. In the present study, we demonstrated that lactate, which is derived from tumor metabolism remodeling, upregulates the expression of CD38 through OXPHOS-driven Hippo-TAZ pathway. The highly expressed CD38 converts NAD + to adenosine through the CD203a/CD73 complex and adenosine binds and activates its receptor A2AR, inducing the expression of Snail and promoting the invasion and metastasis of lung cancer cells. This finding elucidates a new perspective on the interplay between NAD + metabolism and glycolysis in tumor development.
   Lactic acid derived from tumor metabolic reprogramming upregulates the expression of CD38 through the OXPHOS-driven Hippo-TAZ pathway, promoting the conversion of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) to adenosine and activating adenosine receptors. The activated adenosine receptors induce the expression of Snail through the Akt-Gsk3 beta pathway, promoting the progression of EMT in lung cancer cells. image

AB  - Neurons require large amounts of energy, but whether they can perform glycolysis or require glycolysis to maintain energy remains unclear. Using metabolomics, we show that human neurons do metabolize glucose through glycolysis and can rely on glycolysis to supply tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle metabolites. To inves-tigate the requirement for glycolysis, we generated mice with postnatal deletion of either the dominant neuronal glucose transporter (GLUT3cKO) or the neuronal-enriched pyruvate kinase isoform (PKM1cKO) in CA1 and other hippocampal neurons. GLUT3cKO and PKM1cKO mice show age-dependent learning and memory deficits. Hyperpolarized magnetic resonance spectroscopic (MRS) imaging shows that female PKM1cKO mice have increased pyruvate-to-lactate conversion, whereas female GLUT3cKO mice have decreased conversion, body weight, and brain volume. GLUT3KO neurons also have decreased cytosolic glucose and ATP at nerve terminals, with spatial genomics and metabolomics revealing compensatory changes in mitochondrial bioenergetics and galactose metabolism. Therefore, neurons metabolize glucose through glycolysis in vivo and require glycolysis for normal function.

AB  - Caspase-2 (Casp2) is a promising therapeutic target in several human diseases, including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the design of an active-site-directed inhibitor selective to individual caspase family members is challenging because caspases have extremely similar active sites. Here we present new peptidomimetics derived from the VDVAD pentapeptide structure, harboring non-natural modifications at the P2 position and an irreversible warhead. Enzyme kinetics show that these new compounds, such as LJ2 or its specific isomers LJ2a, and LJ3a, strongly and irreversibly inhibit Casp2 with genuine selectivity. In agreement with the established role of Casp2 in cellular stress responses, LJ2 inhibits cell death induced by microtubule destabilization or hydroxamic acid-based deacetylase inhibition. The most potent peptidomimetic, LJ2a, inhibits human Casp2 with a remarkably high inactivation rate (k(3)/K-i similar to 5,500,000 M-1 s(-1)), and the most selective inhibitor, LJ3a, has close to a 1000 times higher inactivation rate on Casp2 as compared to Casp3. Structural analysis of LJ3a shows that the spatial configuration of C-alpha at the P2 position determines inhibitor efficacy. In transfected human cell lines overexpressing site-1 protease (S1P), sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2) and Casp2, LJ2a and LJ3a fully inhibit Casp2-mediated S1P cleavage and thus SREBP2 activation, suggesting a potential to prevent NASH development. Furthermore, in primary hippocampal neurons treated with beta-amyloid oligomers, submicromolar concentrations of LJ2a and of LJ3a prevent synapse loss, indicating a potential for further investigations in AD treatment.

AB  - Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are increasingly recognized as functional units in cancer and powerful biomarkers; however, most remain uncharacterized. Here, we analyze 5,592 prognostic lncRNAs in 9,446 cancers of 30 types using machine learning. We identify 166 lncRNAs whose expression correlates with survival and improves the accuracy of common clinical variables, molecular features, and cancer subtypes. Prognostic lncRNAs are often characterized by switch-like expression patterns. In low-grade gliomas, HOXA10-AS activation is a robust marker of poor prognosis that complements IDH1/2 mutations, as validated in another retrospective cohort, and correlates with developmental pathways in tumor transcriptomes. Loss- and gain-of-function studies in patient-derived glioma cells, organoids, and xenograft models identify HOXA10-AS as a potent onco-lncRNA that regulates cell proliferation, contact inhibition, invasion, Hippo signaling, and mitotic and neuro-developmental pathways. Our study underscores the pan-cancer potential of the non-coding transcriptome for identifying biomarkers and regulators of cancer progression.

AB  - Human rhinovirus (RV) is the most common cause of upper respiratory infections and exacerbations of asthma. In this work, we selected 14 peptides (6 from RV A and 8 from RV C) encompassing potential CD4 T cell epitopes. Peptides were selected for being highly conserved in RV A and C serotypes and predicted to bind to multiple human leukocyte antigen class II (HLA II) molecules. We found positive T cell recall responses by interferon gamma (IFN gamma)-ELISPOT assays to eight peptides, validating seven of them (three from RV A and four from RV C) as CD4 T cell epitopes through intracellular cytokine staining assays. Additionally, we verified their promiscuous binding to multiple HLA II molecules by quantitative binding assays. According to their experimental HLA II binding profile, the combination of all these seven epitopes could be recognized by >95% of the world population. We actually determined IFN gamma responses to a pool encompassing these CD4 T cell epitopes by intracellular cytokine staining, finding positive responses in 29 out of 30 donors. The CD4 T cell epitopes identified in this study could be key to monitor RV infections and to develop peptide-based vaccines against most RV A and C serotypes.

AB  - Polarization of the actin cytoskeleton is vital for the collective migration of cells in vivo. During invasive border cell migration in Drosophila, actin polarization is directly controlled by the Hippo signaling complex, which resides at contacts between border cells in the cluster. Here, we identify, in a genetic screen for deubiquitinating enzymes involved in border cell migration, an essential role for nonstop/USP22 in the expression of Hippo pathway components expanded and merlin. Loss of nonstop function consequently leads to a redistribution of F-actin and the polarity determinant Crumbs, loss of polarized actin protrusions, and tumbling of the border cell cluster. Nonstop is a component of the Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltransferase (SAGA) transcriptional coactivator complex, but SAGA's histone acetyltransferase module, which does not bind to expanded or merlin, is dispensable for migration. Taken together, our results uncover novel roles for SAGA-independent nonstop/USP22 in collective cell migration, which may help guide studies in other systems where USP22 is necessary for cell motility and invasion.

AB  - Plant subtilases, as hydrolytic enzymes, contribute to certain plant stress response pathways by cleaving precursor proteins into active peptides or through other less well-characterized mechanisms. Phytaspases represent a specific subgroup of subtilases, and their participation in rapid stress responses, particularly to herbivory attacks and drought, is already well established, in contrast to their poorly understood role in long-term responses. This study investigated the involvement of phytaspase NbSBT1.9-2 in the long-term stress responses of Nicotiana benthamiana. Plants were subjected to either mild to severe mechanical wounding or drought stress, followed by the detection of phytaspase activity and gene expression in the leaf tissue. The results revealed a distinct involvement of phytaspase in the wounding response, showing increased activity and upregulated expression correlated with the extent and recurrence of wounding. In contrast, no significant change in phytaspase activity was observed in the leaves under drought, alongside salinity and heat stress conditions. Consequently, phytaspase association with the long-term response to mechanical injury was demonstrated using N. benthamiana as a model organism.

AB  - To date, data on the presence of adenoviral receptors in fish are very limited. In the present work, we used mouse recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors (rAAV) with a calcium indicator of the latest generation GCaMP6m that are usually applied for the dorsal hippocampus of mice but were not previously used for gene delivery into fish brain. The aim of our work was to study the feasibility of transduction of rAAV in the mouse hippocampus into brain cells of juvenile chum salmon and subsequent determination of the phenotype of rAAV-labeled cells by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Delivery of the gene in vivo was carried out by intracranial injection of a GCaMP6m-GFP-containing vector directly into the mesencephalic tegmentum region of juvenile (one-year-old) chum salmon, Oncorhynchus keta. AAV incorporation into brain cells of the juvenile chum salmon was assessed at 1 week after a single injection of the vector. AAV expression in various areas of the thalamus, pretectum, posterior-tuberal region, postcommissural region, medial and lateral regions of the tegmentum, and mesencephalic reticular formation of juvenile O. keta was evaluated using CLSM followed by immunohistochemical analysis of the localization of the neuron-specific calcium binding protein HuCD in combination with nuclear staining with DAPI. The results of the analysis showed partial colocalization of cells expressing GCaMP6m-GFP with red fluorescent HuCD protein. Thus, cells of the thalamus, posterior tuberal region, mesencephalic tegmentum, cells of the accessory visual system, mesencephalic reticular formation, hypothalamus, and postcommissural region of the mesencephalon of juvenile chum salmon expressing GCaMP6m-GFP were attributed to the neuron-specific line of chum salmon brain cells, which indicates the ability of hippocampal mammal rAAV to integrate into neurons of the central nervous system of fish with subsequent expression of viral proteins, which obviously indicates the neuronal expression of a mammalian adenoviral receptor homolog by juvenile chum salmon neurons.

AB  - Orthologs of human glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and human mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) first appear in cartilaginous fishes. Subsequently, the MR and GR diverged to respond to different steroids: the MR to aldosterone and the GR to cortisol and corticosterone. We report that cortisol, corticosterone and aldosterone activate full-length elephant shark GR, and progesterone, which activates elephant shark MR, does not activate elephant shark GR. However, progesterone inhibits steroid binding to elephant shark GR, but not to human GR. Together, this indicates partial functional divergence of elephant shark GR from the MR. Deletion of the N-terminal domain (NTD) from elephant shark GR (truncated GR) reduced the response to corticosteroids, while truncated and fulllength elephant shark MR had similar responses to corticosteroids. Swapping of NTDs of elephant shark GR and MR yielded an elephant shark MR chimera with full-length GR-like increased activation by corticosteroids and progesterone compared to full-length elephant shark MR. Elephant shark MR NTD fused to GR DBD + LBD had similar activation as full-length MR, indicating that the MR NTD lacked GR-like NTD activity. We propose that NTD activation of human GR evolved early in GR divergence from the MR.

AB  - Adriamycin (ADR) is widely used against breast cancer, but subsequent resistance always occurs. YAP, a downstream protein of angiomotin (AMOT), importantly contributes to ADR resistance, whereas the mechanism is largely unknown. MCF-7 cells and MDA-MB-231 cells were used to establish ADR-resistant cell. Then, mRNA and protein expressions of AMOT and YAP expressions were determined. After AMOT transfection alone or in combination with YAP, the sensitivity of the cells to ADR were evaluated in vitro by examining cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cell cycle, as well as in vivo by examining tumor growth. Additionally, the expressions of proteins in YAP pathway were determined in AMOT-overexpressing cells. In the ADR-resistant cells, the expression of AMOT was decreased while YAP was increased, respectively, and the nucleus localization of YAP was increased at the same time. After AMOT overexpression, these were inhibited, whereas the cell sensitivity to ADR was enhanced. However, the AMOT-induced changes were significantly suppressed by YAP knockdown. The consistent results in vivo showed that AMOT enhanced the inhibition of ADR on tumor growth, and inhibited YAP signaling, evidenced by decreased levels of YAP, CycD1, and p-ERK. Our data revealed that decreased AMOT contributed to ADR resistance in breast cancer cells, which was importantly negatively mediated YAP. These observations provide a potential therapy against breast cancer with ADR resistance.

AB  - The Jiaozigou Formation, the lowest fossiliferous stratum in the Linxia Basin, produces the most abundant mammalian fossils in East Asia. Although the Jiaozigou Fauna is renowned for the 'giant rhino' (Paraceratheriidae), evidence of relatively small rhinocerotoids is scant, consisting only of fragments. The newly identified species, Megacanodon dongxiangense gen. et sp. nov. is characterised by its small-sized body, the presence of a large canine, nearly completely molarised upper premolars, retracted nasal notch, and not-elevated occipital part. It remains unclear whether the new genus is phylogenetically close to Hyracodontidae, Eggysodontidae, or Rhinocerotidae. We tentatively designate it as a basal genus within Rhinocerotoidea, with the uncertain family affiliation.

AB  - Trafficking of cell-surface proteins from endosomes to the plasma membrane is a key mechanism to regulate synaptic function. In non-neuronal cells, proteins recycle to the plasma membrane either via the SNX27-Retromer-WASH pathway or via the recently discovered SNX17-Retriever-CCC-WASH pathway. While SNX27 is responsible for the recycling of key neuronal receptors, the roles of SNX17 in neurons are less understood. Here, using cultured hippocampal neurons, we demonstrate that the SNX17 pathway regulates synaptic function and plasticity. Disruption of this pathway results in a loss of excitatory synapses and prevents structural plasticity during chemical long-term potentiation (cLTP). cLTP drives SNX17 recruitment to synapses, where its roles are in part mediated by regulating the surface expression of beta 1-integrin. SNX17 recruitment relies on NMDAR activation, CaMKII signaling, and requires binding to the Retriever and PI(3)P. Together, these findings provide molecular insights into the regulation of SNX17 at synapses and define key roles for SNX17 in synaptic maintenance and in regulating enduring forms of synaptic plasticity.
   Rivero-Rios et al. demonstrate that the SNX17-Retriever endomembrane recycling pathway at postsynaptic sites is important for synaptic function and plasticity. The authors show that NMDAR-driven CaMKII signaling recruits SNX17 and Retriever to dendritic spines in a PI3(P)-dependent manner, where it promotes long-term potentiation of synaptic efficacy.

AB  - Pelvic girdles, fins and claspers are evolutionary novelties first recorded in jawed vertebrates. Over the course of the evolution of chondrichthyans (cartilaginous fish) two trends in the morphology of the pelvic skeleton have been suggested to have occurred. These evolutionary shifts involved both an enlargement of the metapterygium (basipterygium) and a transition of fin radial articulation from the pelvic girdle to the metapterygium. To determine how these changes in morphology have occurred it is essential to understand the development of extant taxa as this can indicate potential developmental mechanisms that may have been responsible for these changes. The study of the morphology of the appendicular skeleton across development in chondrichthyans is almost entirely restricted to the historical literature with little contemporary research. Here, we have examined the morphology and development of the pelvic skeleton of a holocephalan chondrichthyan, the elephant shark (Callorhinchus milii), through a combination of dissections, histology, and nanoCT imaging and redescribed the pelvic skeleton of Cladoselache kepleri (NHMUK PV P 9269), a stem holocephalan. To put our findings in their evolutionary context we compare them with the fossil record of chondrichthyans and the literature on pelvic development in elasmobranchs from the late 19th century. Our findings demonstrate that the pelvic skeleton of C. milii initially forms as a single mesenchymal condensation, consisting of the pelvic girdle and a series of fin rays, which fuse to form the basipterygium. The girdle and fin skeleton subsequently segment into distinct components whilst chondrifying. This confirms descriptions of the early pelvic development in Scyliorhinid sharks from the historical literature and suggests that chimaeras and elasmobranchs share common developmental patterns in their pelvic anatomy. Alterations in the location and degree of radial fusion during early development may be the mechanism responsible for changes in pelvic fin morphology over the course of the evolution of both elasmobranchs and holocephalans, which appears to be an example of parallel evolution.

AB  - NRT1/PTR FAMILY (NPF) genes are characterized as nitrate and peptide transporters that played important roles in various substrates transport in plants. However, little is known about the NPF gene in tea plants. Here, a total of 109 CsNPF members were identified from the tea plant genome, and divided into 8 groups according to their sequence characteristics and phylogenetic relationship. Gene structure and conserved motif analysis supported the evolutionary conservation of CsNPFs. Many hormone and stress response cis-acting elements and transcription factor binding sites were found in CsNPF promoters. Syntenic analysis suggested that multiple duplication types contributed to the expansion of NPF gene family in tea plants. Selection pressure analysis showed that CsNPF genes experienced strong purifying selective during the evolution process. The distribution of NPF family genes revealed that 8 NPF subfamilies were formed before the divergence of eudicots and monocots. Transcriptome analysis showed that CsNPFs were expressed differently in different tissues of the tea plant. The expression of 20 CsNPF genes at different nitrate concentrations was analyzed, and most of those genes responded to nitrate resupply. Subcellular localization showed that both CsNPF2.3 and CsNPF6.1 were localized in the plasma membrane, which was consistent with the characteristics of transmembrane proteins involved in NO3- transport. This study provides a theoretical basis for further investigating the evolution and function of NPF genes.

AB  - Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) play an essential part in transposon suppression, DNA methylation, and antiviral responses. The current understanding of the roles of piRNAs in honeybees is very limited. This study aims to analyze the expression pattern and regulatory role of piRNAs in the Asian honeybee (Apis cerana) responding to infection by Nosema ceranae, based on previously gained small RNA-seq data. Here, 450 and 422 piRNAs were respectively identified in the midgut tissues of Apis cerana cerana workers at 7 and 10 days post-inoculation (dpi) with N. ceranae, including 539 non-redundant ones. Additionally, one up-regulated (piR-ace-1216942) and one down-regulated (piR-ace-776728) piRNA were detected in the workers' midgut at 7 dpi, targeting 381 mRNAs involved in 31 GO terms, such as metabolic processes, catalytic activity, and organelles, as well as 178 KEGG pathways, including lysosome, MAPK signaling pathway, and purine metabolism. A total of 35 up-regulated and 11 down-regulated piRNAs were screened from the workers' midgut at 10 dpi, targeting 13,511 mRNAs engaged in 50 GO terms, such as biological regulation, transporter activity, and membrane, as well as 389 KEGG pathways, including the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, Hippo signaling pathway, and nitrogen metabolism. Further analysis indicated that 28 differentially expressed piRNAs (DEpiRNAs) in the midgut at 10 dpi could target 299 mRNAs annotated to three cellular immune pathways (lysosome, endocytosis, and phagosome), while 24 DEpiRNAs could target 205 mRNAs relevant to four humoral immune pathways (FoxO, JAK-STAT, NF-kappa B, and MAPK signaling pathway). Through Sanger sequencing and RT-qPCR, the expression of six randomly selected DEpiRNAs was verified. Moreover, the dual-luciferase reporter gene assay confirmed the binding relationships between piR-ace-446232 and CRT as well as between piR-ace-1008436 and EGFR. Our findings not only contribute to enrich our understanding of the role of piRNAs in honeybees but also provide a basis for exploring the host response to N. ceranae infection mediated by piRNAs.

AB  - Analyses of postmortem human brains and preclinical studies of rodents have identified somatostatin (SST)-positive, dendrite-targeting GABAergic interneurons as key elements that regulate the vulnerability to stress-related psychiatric disorders. Conversely, genetically induced disinhibition of SST neurons (induced by Cre-mediated deletion of the gamma 2 GABAA receptor subunit gene selectively from SST neurons, SSTCre:gamma 2f/f mice) results in stress resilience. Similarly, chronic chemogenetic activation of SST neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) results in stress resilience but only in male and not in female mice. Here, we used RNA sequencing of the mPFC of SSTCre:gamma 2f/f mice to characterize the transcriptome changes underlying GABAergic control of stress resilience. We found that stress resilience of male but not female SSTCre:gamma 2f/f mice is characterized by resilience to chronic stress-induced transcriptome changes in the mPFC. Interestingly, the transcriptome of non-stressed SSTCre:gamma 2f/f (stress-resilient) male mice resembled that of chronic stress-exposed SSTCre (stress-vulnerable) mice. However, the behavior and the serum corticosterone levels of non-stressed SSTCre:gamma 2f/f mice showed no signs of physiological stress. Most strikingly, chronic stress exposure of SSTCre:gamma 2f/f mice was associated with an almost complete reversal of their chronic stress-like transcriptome signature, along with pathway changes suggesting stress-induced enhancement of mRNA translation. Behaviorally, the SSTCre:gamma 2f/f mice were not only resilient to chronic stress-induced anhedonia - they also showed an inversed, anxiolytic-like behavioral response to chronic stress exposure that mirrored the chronic stress-induced reversal of the chronic stress-like transcriptome signature. We conclude that GABAergic dendritic inhibition by SST neurons exerts bidirectional control over behavioral vulnerability and resilience to chronic stress exposure that is mirrored in bidirectional changes in the expression of putative stress resilience genes, through a sex-specific brain substrate.

AB  - Cuttage is the main propagation method of tea plant cultivars in China. However, some tea softwood cuttings just form an expanded and loose callus at the base, without adventitious root (AR) formation during the propagation period. Meanwhile, exogenous auxin could promote the AR formation of tea plant cuttings, but the regulation mechanism has not yet explained clearly. We conducted this study to elucidate the regulatory mechanism of exogenous auxin-induced adventitious root (AR) formation of such cuttings. The transcriptional expression profile of non-rooting tea calluses in response to exogenous IBA and NAA was analyzed using ONT RNA Seq technology. In total, 56,178 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected, and most of genes were significantly differentially expressed after 12 h of exogenous auxin treatment. Among these DEGs, we further identified 80 DEGs involved in the auxin induction pathway and AR formation. Specifically, 14 auxin respective genes (ARFs, GH3s, and AUX/IAAs), 3 auxin transporters (AUX22), 19 auxin synthesis- and homeostasis-related genes (cytochrome P450 (CYP450) and calmodulin-like protein (CML) genes), and 44 transcription factors (LOB domain-containing protein (LBDs), SCARECROW-LIKE (SCL), zinc finger protein, WRKY, MYB, and NAC) were identified from these DEGs. Moreover, we found most of these DEGs were highly up-regulated at some stage before AR formation, suggesting that they may play a potential role in the AR formation of tea plant cuttings. In summary, this study will provide a theoretical foundation to deepen our understanding of the molecular mechanism of AR formation in tea cuttings induced by auxin during propagation time.

AB  - Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is an inflammatory condition of the sinonasal mucosa. Despite being a common health issue, the exact cause of CRS is yet to be understood. However, research suggests that Staphylococcus aureus, particularly in its biofilm form, is associated with the disease. This study aimed to investigate the impact of long-term exposure to secreted factors of Staphylococcus aureus biofilm (SABSFs), harvested from clinical isolates of non-CRS carrier and CRS patients, on the nasal mucosa in a rat model. Animals were randomised (n = 5/group) to receive daily intranasal instillations of 40 mu L (200 mu g/mu L) SABSFs for 28 days or vehicle control. The sinonasal samples were analysed through histopathology and transcriptome profiling. The results showed that all three intervention groups displayed significant lymphocytic infiltration (p <= 0.05). However, only the SABSFs collected from the CRSwNP patient caused significant mucosal damage, mast cell infiltration, and goblet cell hyperplasia compared to the control. The transcriptomics results indicated that SABSFs significantly enriched multiple inflammatory pathways and showed distinct transcriptional expression differences between the control group and the SABSFs collected from CRS patients (p <= 0.05). Additionally, the SABSF challenges induced the expression of IgA and IgG but not IgE. This in vivo study indicates that long-term exposure to SABSFs leads to an inflammatory response in the nasal mucosa with increased severity for S. aureus isolated from a CRSwNP patient. Moreover, exposure to SABSFs does not induce local production of IgE.

AB  - Oxalic acid is a small metabolite found in many plants. It serves as protection from herbivores, a chelator of metal ions, a regulator of calcium levels, and additional tasks. However, it is also a strong di-carboxylic acid that can compromise plant viability by reducing cellular pH. Several metabolic pathways have evolved to control oxalate levels in plants by enzymatic degradation. Among them is the pathway that utilizes oxalyl-CoA synthetase (OCS, EC 6.2.1.8) and ATP to convert oxalate to oxalyl-CoA. Oxalyl-CoA can then be degraded to CO2 or utilized as a precursor for the synthesis of other compounds. In grass pea (Lathyrus sativus L.), a grain legume grown in Asia and Africa for human and animal consumption, the neurotoxic compound beta-N-oxalyl-l-alpha,beta-diaminopropionic acid (beta-ODAP) is synthesized from oxalyl-CoA and l-alpha,beta-diaminopropionic acid (l-DAPA). Here, we report on the identification and characterization of oxalyl CoA-synthetase from grass pea (LsOCS). The gene encoding LsOCS was amplified from grass pea, and then expressed and purified from E. coli cells as an untagged, monomeric protein of 56 kDa. Its catalytic efficiency with oxalate, KoxalateM = 71.5 +/- 13.3 mu M, V-max = 8.2 +/- 0.8 mu mole min(-1) mg(-1), was similar to that of OCS homologs from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtAAE3) and Medicago truncatula (MtAAE3). The enzyme was crystalized in complex with AMP and is the first OCS whose structure was determined in the thioester-forming conformation. Finally, we propose that substituting LsOCS with an oxalate oxidase or decarboxylase may reduce the levels of beta-ODAP in grass pea.

AB  - Sleep deprivation (SD) is increasingly common in modern society, which can lead to the dysregulation of inflammatory responses and cognitive impairment, but the mechanisms remain unclear. Emerging evidence suggests that gut microbiota plays a critical role in the pathogenesis and development of inflammatory and psychiatric diseases, possibly via gut microbiota-brain interactions and neuroinflammation. The present study investigated the impact of SD on gut microbiota composition and explored whether alterations of the gut microbiota play a causal role in chronic inflammatory states and cognitive impairment that are induced by SD. We found that SD-induced gut dysbiosis, inflammatory responses, and cognitive impairment in humans. Moreover, the absence of the gut microbiota suppressed inflammatory response and cognitive impairment induced by SD in germ-free (GF) mice. Transplantation of the "SD microbiota" into GF mice activated the Toll-like receptor 4/nuclear factor-kappa B signaling pathway and impaired cognitive function in the recipient mice. Mice that harbored "SD microbiota" also exhibited increases in neuroinflammation and microglial activity in the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex. These findings indicate that gut dysbiosis contributes to both peripheral and central inflammatory processes and cognitive deficits that are induced by SD, which may open avenues for potential interventions that can relieve the detrimental consequences of sleep loss.

AB  - Neurofilament light chain (NfL) is a neuron-specific cytoskeletal protein that provides structural support for axons and is released into the extracellular space following neuronal injury. While NfL has been extensively studied as a disease biomarker, the underlying release mechanisms and role in neurodegeneration remain poorly understood. Here, we find that neurons secrete low baseline levels of NfL, while neuronal damage triggers calpain-driven proteolysis and release of fragmented NfL. Secreted NfL activates microglial cells, which can be blocked with anti-NfL antibodies. We utilize in vivo single-cell RNA sequencing to profile brain cells after injection of recombinant NfL into the mouse hippocampus and find robust macrophage and microglial responses. Consistently, NfL knockout mice ameliorate microgliosis and delay symptom onset in the SOD1 mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Our results show that released NfL can activate myeloid cells in the brain and is, thus, a potential therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Late Cretaceous Laurasia contained a typical dinosaur fauna consisting of herbivorous hadrosaurids, ceratopsians, and carnivorous tyrannosauroids. Previously, tyrannosauroid teeth have been found in the Upper Cretaceous Dalangshan Formation of Sihui City, China. We describe a fragmentary skeleton of a duck-billed dinosaur from the same general region. The skeleton includes dorsal and caudal vertebrae, a humerus, ilium, femur and tibia. Morphological comparison and cladistic analyses support that this specimen belongs to the tribe Lambeosaurini, which is otherwise poorly represented in China. The new specimens and the previously discovered tyrannosauroid teeth represent the dominant taxa of the typical Late Cretaceous dinosaur fauna of Laurasia.

AB  - The molecular mechanisms induced by hypoxia are misunderstood in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and above all the hypoxia and RASSF1A/Hippo signaling relationship. We confirmed that human NSCLC (n = 45) as their brain metastases (BM) counterpart are hypoxic since positive with CAIX-antibody (target gene of Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)). A severe and prolonged hypoxia (0.2% O2, 48 h) activated YAP (but not TAZ) in Human Bronchial Epithelial Cells (HBEC) lines by downregulating RASSF1A/kinases Hippo (except for NDR2) regardless their promoter methylation status. Subsequently, the NDR2-overactived HBEC cells exacerbated a HIF-1A, YAP and C-Jun-dependent-amoeboid migration, and mainly, support BM formation. Indeed, NDR2 is more expressed in human tumor of metastatic NSCLC than in human localized NSCLC while NDR2 silencing in HBEC lines (by shRNA) prevented the xenograft formation and growth in a lung cancer-derived BM model in mice. Collectively, our results indicated that NDR2 kinase is over-active in NSCLC by hypoxia and supports BM formation. NDR2 expression is thus a useful biomarker to predict the metastases risk in patients with NSCLC, easily measurable routinely by immunohistochemistry on tumor specimens.

KW  - CELLS
AB  - Hepatic leukemia factor (HLF) is aberrantly expressed in human malignancies. However, the role of HLF in the regulation of ovarian cancer (OC) remains unknown. Herein, we reported that HLF expression was upregulated in OC tissues and ovarian cancer stem cells (CSCs). Functional studies have revealed that HLF regulates OC cell stemness, proliferation, and metastasis. Mechanistically, HLF transcriptionally activated Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) expression and subsequently modulated the Hippo signaling pathway. Moreover, we found that miR-520e directly targeted HLF 3 & PRIME;-UTR in OC cells. miR-520e expression was negatively correlated with HLF and YAP1 expression in OC tissues. The combined immunohistochemical (IHC) panels exhibited a better prognostic value for OC patients than any of these components alone. Importantly, the HLF/YAP1 axis determines the response of OC cells to carboplatin treatment and HLF depletion or the YAP1 inhibitor verteporfin abrogated carboplatin resistance. Analysis of patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) further suggested that HLF might predict carboplatin benefits in OC patients. In conclusion, these findings suggest a crucial role of the miR-520e/HLF/YAP1 axis in OC progression and chemoresistance, suggesting potential therapeutic targets for OC.

AB  - Mitophagy alleviates neuronal damage after cerebral ischemia by selectively removing dysfunctional mitochondria. Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1)/Parkin-mediated mitophagy is the most well-known type of mitophagy. However, little is known about the role of PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy in ischemic tolerance induced by hypoxic postconditioning (HPC) with 8% O-2 against transient global cerebral ischemia (tGCI). Hence, we aimed to test the hypothesis that HPC-mediated PINK1/Parkin-induced mitochondrial ubiquitination and promotes mitophagy, thus exerting neuroprotection in the hippocampal CA1 subregion against tGCI. We found that mitochondrial clearance was disturbed at the late phase of reperfusion after tGCI, which was reversed by HPC, as evidenced by the reduction of the translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 20 homologs (TOMM20), translocase of inner mitochondrial membrane 23 (TIMM23) and heat shock protein 60 (HSP60) in CA1 after HPC. In addition, HPC further increased the ratio of LC3II/I in mitochondrial fraction and promoted the formation of mitophagosomes in CA1 neurons after tGCI. The administration of lysosome inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) intraperitoneally or mitophagy inhibitor (Mdivi-1) intracerebroventricularly abrogated HPC-induced mitochondrial turnover and neuroprotection in CA1 after tGCI. We also found that HPC activated PINK1/Parkin pathway after tGCI, as shown by the augment of mitochondrial PINK1 and Parkin and the promotion of mitochondrial ubiquitination in CA1. In addition, PINK1 or Parkin knockdown with small-interfering RNA (siRNA) suppressed the activation of PINK1/Parkin pathway and hampered mitochondrial clearance and attenuated neuroprotection induced by HPC, whereas PINK1 overexpression promoted PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy and ameliorated neuronal damage in CA1 after tGCI. Taken together, the new finding in this study is that HPC-induced neuroprotection against tGCI through promoting mitophagy mediated by PINK1/Parkin-dependent pathway.

AB  - Background: The perennial evergreen tea (Camellia sinensis) plant is one of the most popular nonalcoholic drinks in the world. Fertilizers and industrial, agricultural, and municipal activities are the usual drivers of soil contamination, contaminating tea plants with potentially toxic elements (PTEs). These elements might potentially accumulate to larger amounts in the leaves of plants after being taken up from the soil. Thus, frequent monitoring of these elements is critically important.<br /> Methods: The present study intended to determine PTEs (Al, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb) in both tea leaves and infusions using ICP-OES. Various multivariate data analysis methods such as principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) were employed to elucidate the potential sources of PTEs contamination, whether from anthropogenic activities or natural origins. Additionally, Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) was calculated to assess the relationships between the variables under study.<br /> Results: The mean contents (mg/L) of all studied elements in tea infusions decreased in order Mn (150.59 +/- 1.66) > Fe (11.39 +/- 0.99) > Zn (6.62 +/- 0.89) > Cu (5.86 +/- 0.62) > Co (3.25 +/- 0.64) > Ni (1.69 +/- 0.23) > Pb (1.08 +/- 0.16) > Cr (0.57 +/- 0.09) > Cd (0.46 +/- 0.09) > Al (0.05 +/- 0.008), indicating that Mn exhibits the highest abundance. The mean concentration trend in tea leaf samples mirrored that of infusions, albeit with higher concentrations of PTEs in the former. The tolerable dietary intake (TDI) value for Ni and provisional tolerable monthly intake (PTMI) value for Cd surpassed the standards set by the WHO and EFSA. Calculated hazard index (HI < 1) and cumulative cancer risk (CCR) values suggest negligible exposure risk. Conclusion: Elevated levels of PTEs in commonly consumed tea products concern the public and regulatory agencies.

AB  - Camellia oleifera a member of the family Theaceae, is a phosphorus (P) tolerator native to southern China. The SPX gene family critically regulates plant growth and development and maintains phosphate (Pi) homeostasis. However, the involvement of SPX genes in Pi signaling in Tea-Oil Camellia remains unknown. In this work, 20 SPX genes were identified and categorized into four subgroups. Conserved domains, motifs, gene structure, chromosomal location and gene duplication events were also investigated in the SPX gene family. Defense and stress responsiveness cis-elements were identified in the SPX gene promoters, which participated in low-Pi stress responses. Based on transcriptome data and qRT-PCR results, nine CoSPX genes had similar expression patterns and eight genes (except CoPHO1H3) were up-regulated at 30 days after exposure to low-Pi stress. CoSPX-MFS3 was selected as a key candidate gene by WGCNA analysis. CoSPX-MFS3 was a tonoplast protein. Overexpression of CoSPX-MFS3 in Arabidopsis promoted the accumulation of total P content and decreased the anthocyanin content. Overexpression of CoSPX-MFS3 could enhance low-Pi tolerance by increased biomass and organic acid contents in transgenic Arabidopsis lines. Furthermore, the expression patterns of seven phosphate starvation genes were higher in transgenic Arabidopsis than those in the wild type. These results highlight novel physiological roles of the SPX family genes in C. oleifera under low-Pi stress, and lays the foundation for a deeper knowledge of the response mechanism of C. oleifera to low-Pi stress.

AB  - Background: The use of plants for therapeutic purposes has been supported by growing scientific evidence. Methods: This work consisted of (i) characterizing the phenolic compounds present in both aqueous and hydroethanol (1:1, v/v) extracts of camel grass, by hyphenated liquid chromatographic techniques, (ii) evaluating their anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neuromodulation potential, through in vitro cell and cell-free models, and (iii) establishing a relationship between the chemical profiles of the extracts and their biological activities. Results: Several caffeic acid and flavonoid derivatives were determined in both extracts. The extracts displayed scavenging capacity against the physiologically relevant nitric oxide ((NO)-N-center dot) and superoxide anion (O-2(center dot-)) radicals, significantly reduced NO production in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages (RAW 264.7), and inhibited the activity of hyaluronidase (HAase), acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). Some of these bioactivities were found to be related with the chemical profile of the extracts, namely with 3-caffeoylquinic, 4-caffeoylquinic, chlorogenic, and p-coumaric acids, as well as with luteolin and apigenin derivatives. Conclusions: This study reports, for the first time, the potential medicinal properties of aqueous and hydroethanol extracts of camel grass in the RAW 264.7 cell model of inflammation, and in neurologically related conditions.

AB  - Saltasaurini is a derived clade of titanosaur sauropods whose members are characterised by their relatively small size, dermal ossicles, and a high development of postcranial pneumaticity. Such pneumaticity is generally recognised by osteological correlates, although recently it has been proposed that it can be identified at the histological level through the presence of delicate extrinsic fibres known as pneumosteal tissue, or pneumosteum. This study focuses on the histological correlates of caudal pneumaticity in vertebrae assigned to Rocasaurus muniozi, a saltasaurine from the Late Cretaceous of the Allen Formation of Argentina. Particularly, R. muniozi is one of the sauropod dinosaurs that exhibits the highest degree of pneumaticity in the postcranial skeleton. We perform osteohistological thin sections on six caudal vertebrae. Several occurrences of extrinsic fibres are recorded here, including a possible record of pneumosteal tissue. The latter was recorded in poorly preserved parts of bony trabeculae. Putative pneumosteal tissue is absent in most of the sampled (and well preserved) areas associated with invasion of pneumatic diverticula (e.g. camellae). This contribution reveals that, although endosteal extrinsic fibres can be recognised within pneumatized bones and identified as possible pneumosteonal tissue, this is a rather uncommon feature in Rocasaurus muniozi and possibly other sauropods.

AB  - Membrane budding, which underlies fundamental processes like endocytosis, intracellular trafficking, and viral infection, is thought to involve membrane coat-forming proteins, including the most observed clathrin, to form Omega-shape profiles and helix-forming proteins like dynamin to constrict Omega-profiles' pores and thus mediate fission. Challenging this fundamental concept, we report that polymerized clathrin is required for Omega-profiles' pore closure and that clathrin around Omega-profiles' base/pore region mediates pore constriction/closure in neuroendocrine chromaffin cells. Mathematical modeling suggests that clathrin polymerization at Omega-profiles' base/pore region generates forces from its intrinsically curved shape to constrict/close the pore. This new fission function may exert broader impacts than clathrin's well-known coat-forming function during clathrin (coat)-dependent endocytosis, because it underlies not only clathrin (coat)-dependent endocytosis, but also diverse endocytic modes, including ultrafast, fast, slow, bulk, and overshoot endocytosis previously considered clathrin (coat)-independent in chromaffin cells. It mediates kiss-and-run fusion (fusion pore closure) previously considered bona fide clathrin-independent, and limits the vesicular content release rate. Furthermore, analogous to results in chromaffin cells, we found that clathrin is essential for fast and slow endocytosis at hippocampal synapses where clathrin was previously considered dispensable, suggesting clathrin in mediating synaptic vesicle endocytosis and fission. These results suggest that clathrin and likely other intrinsically curved coat proteins are a new class of fission proteins underlying vesicle budding and fusion. The half-a-century concept and studies that attribute vesicle-coat contents' function to Omega-profile formation and classify budding as coat-protein (e.g., clathrin)-dependent or -independent may need to be re-defined and re-examined by considering clathrin's pivotal role in pore constriction/closure.

AB  - Intense stress, especially traumatic stress, can trigger disabling responses and in some cases even lead to the development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is heterogeneous, accompanied by a range of distress symptoms and treatment-resistant disorders that may be associated with a number of other psychopathologies. PTSD is a very heterogeneous disorder with different subtypes that depend on, among other factors, the type of stressor that provokes it. However, the neurobiological mechanisms are poorly understood. The study of early stress responses may hint at the way PTSD develops and improve the understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms involved in its onset, opening the opportunity for possible preventive treatments. Proteomics is a promising strategy for characterizing these early mechanisms underlying the development of PTSD. The aim of the work was to understand how exposure to acute and intense stress using water immersion restraint stress (WIRS), which could be reminiscent of natural disaster, may induce several PTSD-associated symptoms and changes in the hippocampal proteomic profile. The results showed that exposure to WIRS induced behavioural symptoms and corticosterone levels reminiscent of PTSD. Moreover, the expression profiles of hippocampal proteins at 1 h and 24 h after stress were deregulated in favour of increased inflammation and reduced neuroplasticity, which was validated by histological studies and cytokine determination. Taken together, these results suggest that neuroplastic and inflammatory dysregulation may be a therapeutic target for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorders.

AB  - Approximately 20 TP53 retrogenes exist in the African and Asian elephant genomes (Loxodonta Africana, Elephas Maximus) in addition to a conserved TP53 gene that encodes a full-length protein. Elephant TP53-RETROGENE 9 (TP53-R9) encodes a p53 protein (p53-R9) that is truncated in the middle of the canonical DNA binding domain. This C-terminally truncated p53 retrogene protein lacks the nuclear localization signals and oligomerization domain of its full-length counterpart. When expressed in human osteosarcoma cells (U2OS), p53-R9 binds to Tid1, the chaperone protein responsible for mitochondrial translocation of human p53 in response to cellular stress. Tid1 expression is required for p53-R9-induced apoptosis. At the mitochondria, p53-R9 binds to the pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family member Bax, which leads to caspase activation, cytochrome c release, and cell death. Our data show, for the first time, that expression of this truncated elephant p53 retrogene protein induces apoptosis in human cancer cells. Understanding the molecular mechanism by which the additional elephant TP53 retrogenes function may provide evolutionary insight that can be utilized for the development of therapeutics to treat human cancers.

Using a combination of in vivo intracellular and extracellular recordings with opto/chemogenetic manipulations and computational modeling, we investigate the influence of inhibitory and excitatory inputs on CA1 pyramidal cell responses. At the cell bodies, inhibition leads and is stronger than excitation across the entire theta cycle. Pyramidal neurons fire on the ascending phase of theta when released from inhibition. Computational models equipped with the observed conduc-tances reproduce these dynamics. In these models, place field properties are favored when the increased excitation is coupled with a reduction of inhibition within the field. As predicted by our simulations, firing rate within place fields and phase locking to theta are impaired by DREADDs activation of interneurons. Our results indicate that decreased inhibitory conductance is critical for place field expression.

AB  - Kinase D interacting substrate of 220 kDa (Kidins220), also known as ankyrin repeat-rich membrane spanning (ARMS), is a transmembrane scaffold protein that participates in fundamental aspects of neuronal physiology including cell survival, differentiation, and synaptic plasticity. The Kidins220 constitutive knockout line displays developmental defects in the nervous and cardiovascular systems that lead to embryonic lethality, which has so far precluded the study of this protein in the adult. Moreover, Kidins220 mRNA is tightly regulated by alternative splicing, whose impact on nervous system physiology has not yet been addressed in vivo. Here, we have asked to what extent the absence of Kidins220 splicing and the selective knockout of Kidins220 impact on adult brain homeostasis. To answer this question, we used a floxed line that expresses only the full-length, non-spliced Kidins220 mRNA, and a forebrain-specific, CaMKII-Cre driven Kidins220 conditional knockout (cKO) line. Kidins220 cKO brains are characterized by enlarged ventricles in the absence of cell death, and by deficient dendritic arborization in several cortical regions. The deletion of Kidins220 leads to behavioral changes, such as reduced anxiety-like traits linked to alterations in TrkB-BDNF signaling and sex-dependent alterations of hippocampal-dependent spatial memory. Kidins220 floxed mice present similarly enlarged brain ventricles and increased associative memory. Thus, both the absolute levels of Kidins220 expression and its splicing pattern are required for the correct brain development and related expression of behavioral phenotypes. These findings are relevant in light of the increasing evidence linking mutations in the human KIDINS220 gene to the onset of severe neurodevelopmental disorders.

TI  - WBP2 negatively regulates the Hippo pathway by competitively binding to WWC3 with LATS1 to promote non-small cell lung cancer progression
T2  - CELL DEATH & DISEASE
LA  - English
AB  - WW domain binding protein-2 (WBP2) can function as a Yes-associated protein/transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (YAP/TAZ) co-activator and has a crucial role in promoting breast cancer progression. However, the expression and potential molecular mechanisms of WBP2 in the context of lung cancer are not fully understood. We determined that WBP2 was highly expressed in lung cancer specimens and cell lines and that this expression was closely related to the advanced pTNM stage, lymph node metastasis, and poor prognosis of patients. In addition, gain- and loss-of-function experiments revealed that WBP2 could significantly promote the proliferation and invasion of lung cancer cells both in vivo and in vitro. To elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism, we determined that wild-type WBP2 could competitively bind to the WW domain of WWC3 (WW and C2 domain-containing-3) with LATS1 (Large tumor suppressor-1) through its PPxY motifs, thus inhibiting the formation of the WWC3-LATS1 complex, reducing the phosphorylation level of LATS1, suppressing the activity of the Hippo pathway, and ultimately promoting YAP nuclear translocation. Therefore, from the aspect of upstream molecules of Hippo signaling, WBP2 promotes the malignant phenotype of lung cancer cells in a unique manner that is not directly dependent upon YAP, thus providing a corresponding experimental basis for the development of targeted therapeutic drugs for lung cancer.

AB  - Although RAS family genes play essential roles in tumorigenesis, effective treatments targeting RAS-related tumors are lacking, partly because of an incomplete understanding of the complex signaling crosstalk within RAS-related tumors. Here, we performed a large-scale genetic screen in Drosophila eye imaginal discs and identified Misshapen (Msn) as a tumor suppressor that synergizes with oncogenic Ras (Ras(V12)) to induce c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation and Hippo inactivation, then subsequently leads to tumor overgrowth and invasion. Moreover, ectopic Msn expression activates Hippo signaling pathway and suppresses Hippo signaling disruption-induced overgrowth. Importantly, we further found that Msn acts downstream of protocadherin Fat (Ft) to regulate Hippo signaling. Finally, we identified msn as a Yki/Sd target gene that regulates Hippo pathway in a negative feedback manner. Together, our findings identified Msn as a tumor suppressor and provide a novel insight into RAS-related tumorigenesis that may be relevant to human cancer biology.

AB  - Metal ion measurements using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy revealed twofold-higher zinc content in rat brain compared to spinal cord. One hypothesis to explain this difference is the high prevalence of synapses that corelease glutamate and zinc in the brain, marked by the vesicular Zinc Transporter-3 (ZnT3). In contrast, spinal cord tissue showed significantly higher calcium content, reflecting calcifications in the arachnoid. The above observations were made in 60-day-old adult male and female rats fed ad libitum or a restricted diet. In this study, we asked if the calcium and zinc content of the brain and spinal cord was species-specific or evolutionarily conserved, and whether the distinct concentration of zinc in the brain and spinal cord resulted from a different expression pattern of ZnT3, the primary transporter in synaptic vesicles. To address these questions, we examined 8-week-old wild-type male and female mice raised under conventional laboratory conditions and used a knock-in mouse that expresses a human influenza hemagglutinin epitope tag at the C terminus of the endogenous ZnT3 gene to assess the transporter's abundance in spinal cord sections. Our results show conserved inverse differences in zinc and calcium content in mouse brain and spinal cord, but detectable ZnT3 signal in spinal cord. Whereas vesicular zinc modulates glutamatergic and GABAergic signaling and sensory processing, the functional significance of calcium aggregates in the arachnoid remains unknown.

AB  - Febrile seizure (FS), which occurs as a response to fever, is the most common seizure that occurs in infants and young children. FS is usually accompanied by diverse neuropsychiatric symptoms, including impaired social behaviors; however, research on neuropsychiatric disorders and hippocampal inflammatory changes following febrile seizure occurrences is very limited. Here, we provide evidence linking FS occurrence with ASD pathogenesis in rats. We developed an FS juvenile rats model and found ASD-like abnormal behaviors including deficits in social novelty, repetitive behaviors, and hyperlocomotion. In addition, FS model juvenile rats showed enhanced levels of gliosis and inflammation in the hippocampal CA2 region and cerebellum. Furthermore, abnormal levels of social and repetitive behaviors persisted in adults FS model rats. These findings suggest that the inflammatory response triggered by febrile seizures in young children could potentially serve as a mediator of social cognitive impairments.

AB  - Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydrate (NAD+) acts as the essential component of the tricarboxylic citric acid (TCA) cycle and has important functions in diverse biological processes. However, the roles of NAD+ in regulating adult neural stem/progenitor cells (aNSPCs) remain largely unknown. Here, we show that NAD+ exposure leads to the reduced proliferation and neuronal differentiation of aNSPCs and induces the apoptosis of aNSPCs. In addition, NAD+ exposure inhibits the morphological development of neurons. Mechanistically, RNA sequencing revealed that the transcriptome of aNSPCs is altered by NAD+ exposure. NAD+ exposure significantly decreases the expression of multiple genes related to ATP metabolism and the PI3k-Akt signaling pathway. Collectively, our findings provide some insights into the roles and mechanisms in which NAD+ regulates aNSPCs and neuronal development.

AB  - The picornavirus foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is the causative agent of the economically important disease of livestock, foot-and-mouth disease (FMD). VP4 is a highly conserved capsid protein, which is important during virus entry. Previous published work has shown that antibodies targeting the N-terminus of VP4 of the picornavirus human rhinovirus are broadly neutralising. In addition, previous studies showed that immunisation with the N-terminal 20 amino acids of enterovirus A71 VP4 displayed on the hepatitis B core (HBc) virus-like particles (VLP) can induce cross-genotype neutralisation. To investigate if a similar neutralising response against FMDV VP4 could be generated, HBc VLPs displaying the N-terminus of FMDV VP4 were designed. The N-terminal 15 amino acids of FMDV VP4 was inserted into the major immunodominant region. HBc VLPs were also decorated with peptides of the N-terminus of FMDV VP4 attached using a HBc-spike binding tag. Both types of VLPs were used to immunise mice and the resulting serum was investigated for VP4-specific antibodies. The VLP with VP4 inserted into the spike, induced VP4-specific antibodies, however the VLPs with peptides attached to the spikes did not. The VP4-specific antibodies could recognise native FMDV, but virus neutralisation was not demonstrated.

AB  - Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are a series of structurally complex and harmful compounds formed through the reaction between the carbonyl group of reducing sugars (such as glucose and fructose) and the free amino groups of proteins, lipids, or nucleic acids. Excessive accumulation of AGEs in the body can trigger oxidative stress, induce inflammatory responses, and contribute to the development of diabetes, atherosclerosis, and neurological disorders. Within the category of dicarbonyl compounds, methylglyoxal (MGO)-a byproduct resulting from glucose degradation-serves as a pivotal precursor in the formation of AGEs and the induction of neurotoxicity. Specifically, AGEs generated from MGO display significant cytotoxicity toward cells in the central nervous system. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the role of MGO-AGEs in neuroinflammation mediated by CUMS. Interestingly, we found that the overexpression of glyoxalase 1 (GLO1) reduced the levels of MGO in corticosterone-treated microglia, thereby alleviating the inflammatory response. Furthermore, overexpression of GLO1 in the hippocampus of chronically stressed mice reduced MGO levels, mitigating CUMS-induced neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment. Additionally, when using the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) inhibitor FPS-ZM1 in primary microglia cells, we observed that despite corticosterone-induced elevation of MGO, no significant inflammatory response occurred. This suggests that RAGE clearance can reduce MGO-AGE-mediated neurotoxicity. Subsequently, we used FPS-ZM1 to treat chronically stressed mice and found that it significantly ameliorated neuroinflammation and cognitive dysfunction. These results suggest that targeting MGO metabolism could serve as a therapeutic approach to manage neuroinflammation in stress-related mental disorders.

AB  - Metazoan 70 kDa heat shock protein (HSP70) genes have been classified into four lineages: cytosolic A (HSP70cA), cytosolic B (HSP70cB), endoplasmic reticulum (HSP70er), and mitochondria (HSP70m). Because previous studies have identified no HSP70cA genes in vertebrates, we hypothesized that this gene was lost on the evolutionary path to vertebrates. To test this hypothesis, the present study conducted a comprehensive database search followed by phylogenetic and synteny analyses. HSP70cA genes were found in invertebrates and in two of the three subphyla of Chordata, Cephalochordata (lancelets) and Tunicata (tunicates). However, no HSP70cA gene was found in the genomes of Craniata (another subphylum of Chordata; lamprey, hagfish, elephant shark, and coelacanth), suggesting the loss of the HSP70cA gene in the early period of vertebrate evolution. Synteny analysis using available genomic resources indicated that the synteny around the HSP70 genes was generally conserved between tunicates but was largely different between tunicates and lamprey. These results suggest the presence of dynamic chromosomal rearrangement in early vertebrates that possibly caused the loss of the HSP70cA gene in the vertebrate lineage.

AB  - In the adult rodent brain, neural stem cells (NSCs) reside in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles and the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampus. In these areas, NSCs and their progeny integrate intrinsic signals and extrinsic cues provided by their microenvironment that control their behavior. The vasculature in the SVZ and SGZ, and the choroid plexus (ChP) in the SVZ, have emerged as critical compartments of the neurogenic niches as they provide a rich repertoire of cues to regulate NSC quiescence, proliferation, self-renewal and dif-ferentiation. Physical contact between NSCs and blood vessels is also a feature within the niches and supports different processes such as quiescence, migration and vesicle transport. In this review, we provide a description of the brain and choroid plexus vasculature in both stem cell niches, highlighting the main properties and role of the vasculature in each niche. We also summarize the current understanding of how blood vessel-and ChP-derived signals influence the behavior of NSCs in physiological adulthood, as well as upon aging.

AB  - Idiopathic rhinitis represents more than 50% of non-allergic rhinitis, a heterogeneous group that involves the symptomatic inflammation of the nasal mucosa. The TRPV1 receptor of unmyelinated C-type neurons appears to be involved in its pathophysiology. Histamine, whose main catabolic enzyme is DAO, is one of the mediators that can activate this receptor. The failure of DAO causes an increase in the level of histamine in the body and, consequently, the activation of TRPV1. The objective was to investigate the existence of a DAO enzyme activity deficit in idiopathic rhinitis and its correlation with symptoms. A cross-sectional study was conducted in 116 idiopathic rhinitis patients, and DAO activity, nasal peak inspiratory flow, and rhinitis severity were recorded. The prevalence of a DAO activity deficit was 41.38% (95%CI 0.33-0.50; p = 0.05). The DAO activity in patients with mild rhinitis was 52.93 +/- 8.72 HDU/mL, in those with moderate rhinitis it was 120.33 +/- 71.63 HDU/mL, and in those with severe rhinitis it was 92.58 +/- 27.75 HDU/mL (p = 0.006). The NPIF in patients with a DAO activity deficit was 107.92 +/- 34.05 L/min, compared to 72.35 +/- 27.16 L/min in patients with normal enzymatic activity (p < 0.001), demonstrating a linear correlation between activity levels and nasal obstruction (-0.45; p < 0.001). Therefore, patients with a DAO deficiency and idiopathic rhinitis could present a milder disease course, because the repeated and continuous activation of TRPV1 led to a partial or total decrease in their response (desensitization). This new theory represents a different perspective for the study of idiopathic rhinitis and its relationship with TRPV1, with the regulation or modulation of the desensitization of TRPV1 being an important therapeutic target for patients with idiopathic rhinitis in the future.

AB  - Application of glutamate (Glu) in high concentrations to the rat brain primary neuronal cultures leads to a secondary rise in the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration (delayed calcium deregulation, DCD), which develops synchronously with a strong mitochondrial depolarization. In this work, pH in the mitochondrial matrix (pHm) and cytosol (pHc) was measured simultaneously with the intracellular concentration of free Ca2+ ([Ca2+](i)) in the soma of cultured neurons exposed to a toxic concentration of Glu (100 mu M). To this end, we performed the expression of the pH-sensitive fluorescence proteins, green mtYFP in the mitochondria and red mKate in the cytosol, in primary cultures from the hippocampus of newborn rats. To measure [Ca2+](i) simultaneously with pHm, and pHc neuronal cultures were loaded with low affinity Ca2+-sensitive indicator Fura-FF. It was found that during the first phase of the Ca2+-response to Glu, when only partial depolarization of mitochondria occurs, there is an increase in the pH gradient between the mitochondrial matrix and cytosol (Delta pH). The increase in.pH compensates for the decrease in the electrical mitochondrial potential (Delta Psi m), maintaining a relatively constant electrochemical mitochondrial potential and maintaining ATP synthesis at least until DCD begins. The development of DCD led to a sharp decrease both in Delta Psi m and Delta pH in the soma of neurons; however, a complete collapse of Delta pH was not observed. This probably means that DCD (1) is not caused by a nonspecific pore in the mitochondrial inner membrane (mPTP), as it is commonly thought, or (2) some of the mitochondria in the soma of neurons retain the barrier properties of the inner membrane and do not form mPTP even at high [Ca2+](i) plateau.

AB  - The regulated trafficking of AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) from dendritic compartments to the synaptic membrane in response to neuronal activity is a core mechanism for long-term potentiation (LTP). However, the contribution of the microtubule cytoskeleton to this synaptic transport is still unknown. In this work, using electrophysiological, biochemical, and imaging techniques, we have found that one member of the kinesin-3 family of motor proteins, KIF13A, is specifically required for the delivery of AMPARs to the spine surface during LTP induction. Accordingly, KIF13A depletion from hippocampal slices abolishes LTP expression. We also identify the vesicular protein centaurin-a1 as part of a motor transport machinery that is engaged with KIF13A and AMPARs upon LTP induction. Finally, we determine that KIF13A is responsible for the remodeling of Rab11-FIP2 endosomal structures in the dendritic shaft during LTP. Overall, these results identify specific kinesin molecular motors and endosomal transport machinery that catalyzes the dendrite-to-synapse translocation of AMPA receptors during synaptic plasticity.

AB  - Alzheimer<acute accent>s disease (AD) is the most frequent neurodegenerative disorder in the world and is characterised by the loss of memory and other cognitive functions. Metabolic changes associated with AD are important players in the development of the disease. However, the mechanism underlying these changes is still unknown. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nano-sized particles that play an important role in regulating pathophysiological processes and are a non-invasive manner to obtain information of the cell that is secreting them. The analysis of brain-derived EVs (bdEVs) will provide new insights in the metabolic processes associated with AD. To characterize bdEVs in AD, we optimised a method to isolate them from tissue of different brain regions, obtaining the highest enrichment in isolations from the temporal cortex. We performed unbiased untargeted metabolomics analysis on post-mortem human temporal cortex tissue and bdEVs from the same region of AD patients and healthy controls. Both, univariate and multivariate statistical analysis were used to determine the metabolites that influence the separation between AD patients and controls. Interestingly, a clear separation between control and AD groups was obtained with bdEVs, which allowed to select 12 relevant features by a validated PLS-DA model. Furthermore, comparison of tissue and bdEVs identified 68 common features. The pathway enrichment analysis of the common metabolites showed that the alanine, aspartate and glutamate pathway and the arginine, phenylalanine, tyrosine pathway were the most significant ones in the separation between the AD patients and controls. The phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan pathway, still had a very high influence in the separation between groups, albeit not significant. Notably, some metabolites were identified for the first time in bdEVs. For example, the N-acetyl aspartic acid (NAA) metabolite present in bdEVs was suitable to differentiate AD patients from healthy controls. Furthermore, the analysis of the hippocampus, midbrain, temporal and entorhinal cortex and their respective bdEVs indicated that the metabolic profiles of different brain areas were distinct and showed some correlation between the metabolome of the tissue and its respective bdEVs. Thus, our study highlights the potential of bdEVs to understand the metabolic fingerprint associated with AD and their potential use as diagnostic and therapeutic targets.

AB  - Thousand and one amino-acid protein kinases(TAOKs), as a key member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, has recently attracted widespread attention in the field of anti-cancer research. There are three members of this subfamily: TAOK1, TAOK2, and TAOK3. Studies have shown that members of the TAOK family participate in regulating cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion through various pathways, thereby playing an important role in tumorigenesis and progression. This review summarizes the functions of TAOK kinases in tumor cell signal transduction, cell cycle regulation, and the tumor microenvironment, with a particular emphasis on its potential as a target for anti-cancer drugs. Future research will further elucidate the specific mechanisms of action of TAOK kinase in different types of tumors and explore its clinical application prospects.

AB  - Blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction and neuroinflammation are key mechanisms of brain injury. We performed a time-course study following neonatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI) to characterize these events. HI brain injury was induced in postnatal day 10 rats by single carotid artery ligation followed by hypoxia (8% oxygen, 90 min). At 6, 12, 24, and 72 h (h) post-HI, brains were collected to assess neuropathology and BBB dysfunction. A significant breakdown of the BBB was observed in the HI injury group compared to the sham group from 6 h in the cortex and hippocampus (p < 0.001), including a significant increase in albumin extravasation (p < 0.0033) and decrease in basal lamina integrity and tight-junction proteins. There was a decrease in resting microglia (p < 0.0001) transitioning to an intermediate state from as early as 6 h post-HI, with the intermediate microglia peaking at 12 h (p < 0.0001), which significantly correlated to the peak of microbleeds. Neonatal HI insult leads to significant brain injury over the first 72 h that is mediated by BBB disruption within 6 h and a transitioning state of the resident microglia. Key BBB events coincide with the appearance of the intermediate microglial state and this relationship warrants further research and may be a key target for therapeutic intervention.

AB  - Time and space are primary dimensions of human experience. Separate lines of investigation have identified neural correlates of time and space, yet little is known about how these representations converge during self guided experience. Here, 10 subjects with intracranially implanted microelectrodes play a timed, virtual navigation game featuring object search and retrieval tasks separated by fixed delays. Time cells and place cells activate in parallel during timed navigation intervals, whereas a separate time cell sequence spans inter-task delays. The prevalence, firing rates, and behavioral coding strengths of time cells and place cells are indistinguishable-yet time cells selectively remap between search and retrieval tasks, while place cell responses remain stable. Thus, the brain can represent time and space as overlapping but dissociable dimensions. Time cells and place cells may constitute a biological basis for the cognitive map of spatiotemporal context onto which memories are written.

AB  - The transformation of astrocytes into reactive states constitutes a biological response of the central nervous system under a variety of pathological insults. Astrocytes display diverse homeostatic identities that are developmentally predetermined and regionally specified. Upon transformation into reactive states associated with neurodegenerative diseases and other neurological disorders, astrocytes acquire diverse reactive phenotypes. However, it is not clear whether their reactive phenotypes are dictated by region-specific homeostatic identity or by the nature of an insult. To address this question, region-specific gene expression profiling was performed for four brain regions (cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, and hypothalamus) in mice using a custom NanoString panel consisting of selected sets of genes associated with astrocyte functions and their reactivity for five conditions: prion disease, traumatic brain injury, brain ischemia, 5XFAD Alzheimer's disease model and normal aging. Upon transformation into reactive states, genes that are predominantly associated with astrocytes were found to respond to insults in a region-specific manner. Regardless of the nature of the insult or the insult-specificity of astrocyte response, strong correlations between undirected GSA (gene set analysis) scores reporting on astrocyte reactivity and on their homeostatic functions were observed within each individual brain region. The insult-specific gene expression signatures did not separate well from each other and instead partially overlapped, forming continuums. The current study demonstrates that region-specific homeostatic identities of astrocytes are important for defining their response to pathological insults. Within region-specific populations, reactive astrocytes show continuums of gene expression signatures, partially overlapping between individual insults.

AB  - Febrile seizure (FS) is a common type of seizure occurring in human during infancy and childhood. Although an epileptic seizure is associated with psychiatric disorders and comorbid diseases such as depression, anxiety, autism spectrum disorders, sleep disorders, attention deficits, cognitive impairment, and migraine, the causal relationship between FS and psychiatric disorders is poorly understood. The objective of the current study was to investigate the relationship of FS occurrence in childhood with the pathogenesis of anxiety disorder and depression using an FS rat model. We induced febrile seizures in infantile rats (11 days postnatal) using a mercury vapor lamp. At 3 weeks and 12 weeks after FS induction, we examined behaviors and recorded local field potentials (LFPs) to assess anxiety and depression disorder. Interestingly, after FS induction in infantile rats, anxiogenic behaviors and depression-like phenotypes were found in both adult and juvenile FS rats. The analysis of LFPs revealed that 4-7 Hz hippocampal theta rhythm, a neural oscillatory marker for anxiety disorder, was significantly increased in FS rats compared with their wild-type littermates. Taken together, our findings suggest that FS occurrence in infants is causally related to increased levels of anxiety-related behaviors and depression-like symptoms in juvenile and adult rodents.

AB  - Down syndrome (DS), caused by trisomy of chromosome 21 (HSA21), results in a broad range of phenotypes. However, the determinants contributing to the complex and variable phenotypic expression of DS are still not fully known. Changes in microRNAs (miRNAs), short non-coding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally, have been associated with some DS phenotypes. Here, we investigated the genome-wide mature miRNA expression profile in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of children with DS and controls and identified biological processes and pathways relevant to the DS pathogenesis. The expression of 754 mature miRNAs was profiled in PBMCs from six children with DS and six controls by RT-qPCR using TaqMan(R) Array Human MicroRNA Cards. Functions and signaling pathways analyses were performed using DIANA-miRPath v.3 and DIANA-microT-CDS software. Children with DS presented six differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRs): four overexpressed (miR-378a-3p, miR-130b-5p, miR-942-5p, and miR-424-3p) and two downregulated (miR-452-5p and miR-668-3p). HSA21-derived miRNAs investigated were not found to be differentially expressed between the groups. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses showed potential target genes involved in biological processes and pathways pertinent to immune response, e.g., toll-like receptors (TLRs) signaling, Hippo, and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) signaling pathways. These results suggest that altered miRNA expression could be contributing to the well-known immunological dysfunction observed in individuals with DS.

AB  - Objectives. Inhibition of calcium-/calmodulin- (CaM-) dependent kinase II (CaMKII) is correlated with epilepsy. However, the specific mechanism that underlies learning and memory impairment and neuronal death by CaMKII inhibition remains unclear. Materials and Methods. In this study, KN93, a CaMKII inhibitor, was used to investigate the role of CaMKII during epileptogenesis. We first identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in primary cultured hippocampal neurons with or without KN93 treatment using RNA-sequencing. Then, the impairment of learning and memory by KN93-induced CaMKII inhibition was assessed using the Morris water maze test. In addition, Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and TUNEL staining were performed to determine neuronal death, apoptosis, and the relative signaling pathway. Results. KN93-induced CaMKII inhibition decreased cAMP response element-binding (CREB) protein activity and impaired learning and memory in Wistar and tremor (TRM) rats, an animal model of genetic epilepsy. CaMKII inhibition also induced neuronal death and reactive astrocyte activation in both the Wistar and TRM hippocampi, deregulating mitogen-activated protein kinases. Meanwhile, neuronal death and neuron apoptosis were observed in PC12 and primary cultured hippocampal neurons after exposure to KN93, which was reversed by SP600125, an inhibitor of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Conclusions. CaMKII inhibition caused learning and memory impairment and apoptosis, which might be related to dysregulated JNK signaling.

AB  - The alpha-arrestin domain containing protein 3 (ARRDC3) is a tumor suppressor in triple-negative breast carcinoma (TNBC), a highly metastatic subtype of breast cancer that lacks targeted therapies. Thus, understanding the mechanisms and targets of ARRDC3 in TNBC is important. ARRDC3 regulates trafficking of protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1, also known as F2R), a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) implicated in breast cancer metastasis. Loss of ARRDC3 causes overexpression of PAR1 and aberrant signaling. Moreover, dysregulation of GPCR-induced Hippo signaling is associated with breast cancer progression. However, the mechanisms responsible for Hippo dysregulation remain unknown. Here, we report that the Hippo pathway transcriptional co-activator TAZ (also known as WWTR1) is the major effector of GPCR signaling and is required for TNBC migration and invasion. Additionally, ARRDC3 suppresses PAR1-induced Hippo signaling via sequestration of TAZ, which occurs independently of ARRDC3-regulated PAR1 trafficking. The ARRDC3 C-terminal PPXY motifs and TAZ WW domain are crucial for this interaction and are required for suppression of TNBC migration and lung metastasis in vivo. These studies are the first to demonstrate a role for ARRDC3 in regulating GPCR-induced TAZ activity in TNBC and reveal multi-faceted tumor suppressor functions of ARRDC3.

AB  - Mutations in genes encoding nuclear pore proteins (NUPs) lead to the development of steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). However, the precise molecular mechanisms by which NUP dysfunction contributes to podocyte injury preceding FSGS remain unclear. The tightly regulated activity of Yes-associated protein (YAP) and WW-domain-containing transcription regulator 1 (TAZ), the transcriptional effectors of the Hippo pathway, is crucial for podocytes and the maintenance of the glomerular filter. In this study, we investigate the impact of NUPs on the regulation of YAP/TAZ nuclear import and activity in podocytes. In unbiased interactome studies using quantitative label-free mass spectrometry, we identify the FSGS disease gene products NUP107, NUP133, NUP205, and Exportin-5 (XPO5) as components of YAP and TAZ protein complexes in podocytes. Moreover, we demonstrate that NUP205 is essential for YAP/TAZ nuclear import. Consistently, both the nuclear interaction of YAP/TAZ with TEA domain transcription factor 1 and their transcriptional activity were dependent on NUP205 expression. Additionally, we elucidate a regulatory feedback mechanism whereby YAP activity is modulated in response to TAZ-mediated NUP205 expression. In conclusion, this study establishes a connection between the FSGS disease protein NUP205 and the activity of the transcriptional regulators and Hippo effectors YAP and TAZ and it proposes a potential pathological role of YAP/TAZ dysregulation in podocytes of patients with pathogenic NUP205 variants.

AB  - The foraging behavior of the infective juveniles (IJs) of entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) relies on host-derived compounds, but in a tri-trophic context, herbivore-induced root volatiles act as signals enhancing the biological control of insect pests by recruiting EPNs. In southern Chile, the EPN Steinernema australe exhibits the potential to control the raspberry weevil, Aegorhinus superciliosus, a key pest of blueberry Vaccinium corymbosum. However, there is no information on the quality of the blueberry root volatile plume or the S. australe response to these chemicals as putative attractants. Here, we describe the root volatile profile of blueberries and the chemotaxis behavior of S. australe towards the volatiles identified from Vaccinium corymbosum roots, infested or uninfested with A. superciliosus larvae. Among others, we found linalool, & alpha;-terpineol, limonene, eucalyptol, 2-carene, 1-nonine, 10-undecyn-1-ol, and methyl salicylate in root volatiles and, depending on the level of the emissions, they were selected for bioassays. In the dose-response tests, S. australe was attracted to all five tested concentrations of methyl salicylate, 1-nonine, & alpha;-terpineol, and 2-carene, as well as to 100 & mu;g mL(-1) of 10-undecyn-1-ol, 0.1 and 100 & mu;g mL(-1) of linalool, and 100 & mu;g mL(-1) of limonene, whereas eucalyptol elicited no attraction or repellency. These results suggest that some volatiles released from damaged roots attract S. australe and may have implications for the biocontrol of subterranean pests.

AB  - Pod borer Helicoverpa armigera, a polyphagus herbivorous pest, tremendously incurs crop damage in economically important crops. This necessitates the identification and utility of novel genes for the control of the herbivore. The present study deals with the characterization of a flavonoid 3 ' 5 ' hydroxylase_2 (F3 ' 5 ' H_2) from a pigeonpea wild relative Cajanus platycarpus, possessing a robust chemical resistance response to H. armigera. Though F3 ' 5 ' H_2 displayed a dynamic expression pattern in both C. platycarpus (Cp) and the cultivated pigeonpea, Cajanus cajan (Cc) during continued herbivory, CpF3 ' 5 ' H_2 showed a 4.6-fold increase vis a vis 3-fold in CcF3 ' 5 ' H_2. Despite similar gene copy numbers in the two Cajanus spp., interesting genic and promoter sequence changes highlighted the stress responsiveness of CpF3 ' 5 ' H_2. The relevance of CpF3 ' 5 ' H_2 in H. armigera resistance was further validated in CpF3 ' 5 ' H_2-overexpressed transgenic tobacco based on reduced leaf damage and increased larval mortality through an in vitro bioassay. As exciting maiden clues, CpF3 ' 5 ' H_2 deterred herbivory in transgenic tobacco by increasing total flavonoids, polyphenols and reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging capacity. To the best of our knowledge, this is a maiden attempt ascertaining the role of F3 ' 5 ' H_2 gene in the management of H. armigera. These interesting leads suggest the potential of this pivotal branch-point gene in biotic stress management programs.

AB  - Leaf mechanical wounding triggers a rapid release-within minutes-of a blend of volatile organic compounds. A wounding-induced VOC blend is mainly composed of oxygenated ubiquitous stress volatiles such as methanol and volatile products of lipoxygenase (LOX) pathway (mainly C5 and C6 alcohols and aldehydes and their derivatives), but also includes multiple minor VOCs that collectively act as infochemicals, inducing defences in non-damaged plant leaves and neighbouring plants and attracting herbivore enemies. At present, the interspecific variability of the rate of induction and magnitude of wounding-induced emissions and the extent to which plant structural traits and physiological activity alter these emissions are poorly known. Particularly scarce is information on the induced emissions in tropical agricultural plant species, despite their economic importance and large area of cultivation at regional and global scales. We chose five tropical crops with varying photosynthetic activity and leaf structural characteristics-Abelmoschus esculentus, Amaranthus cruentus, Amaranthus hybridus, Solanum aethiopicum, and Telfairia occidentalis-to characterize the kinetics and magnitude of wounding-induced emissions, hypothesizing that the induced emission response is greater and faster in physiologically more active species with greater photosynthetic activity than in less active species. Rapid highly repeatable leaf wounds (12 mm cuts) were generated by a within-leaf-chamber cutting knife. Wounding-induced VOC emissions were measured continuously with a proton-transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer and gas-chromatography mass spectrometry was used to separate isomers. Twenty-three ion VOCs and twelve terpenoid molecule structures were identified, whereas ubiquitous stress volatiles methanol (on average 40% of total emissions), hexenal (24%), and acetaldehyde (11%) were the main compounds across the species. Emissions of low-weight oxygenated compounds (LOC, 70% of total) and LOX products (29%) were positively correlated across species, but minor VOC components, monoterpenoids and benzenoids, were negatively correlated with LOC and LOX, indicating a reverse relationship between signal specificity and strength. There was a large interspecific variability in the rate of induction and emission magnitude, but the hypothesis of a stronger emission response in physiologically more active species was only partly supported. In addition, the overall emission levels were somewhat lower with different emission blend compared to the data reported for wild species, as well as different shares for the VOCs in the blend. The study demonstrates that wounding-dependent emissions from tropical agricultural crops can significantly contribute to atmospheric volatiles, and these emissions cannot be predicted based on current evidence of wild plant model systems.

AB  - The genus Brachypotherium is an extinct rhinoceros that has been mainly found in the Miocene in Eurasia and Africa. Among of them, the taxonomic status of the East Asian Brachypotherium is controversial. Here, the study re-describes tooth fragments of rhinoceros from the Upper Miocene locality in Japan. This specimen (KPM-NNV 50) has been previously identified as Brachypotherium sp. Compared with the Asian Miocene rhinoceros, KPM-NNV 50 is re-identified as Aceratheriinae gen. et sp. indet. in this study. Both previous studies and the present study suggest that the Late Miocene Japanese rhinoceroses are ranging from about 10 Ma to 5.5 Ma, indicating that a large gap of the rhinocerotid fossil records (16 Ma to 10 Ma) between the Early and Late Miocene. We summarise the taxonomic status of Brachypotherium in East Asia, resulting that the East Asian 'Brachypotherium' are possibly different species. The present study confirms that the genus Brachypotherium existed throughout the Miocene in Europe, South Asia, and Southeast Asia, and possibly persisted into the African Pliocene.

AB  - Extracellular matrix (ECM) rigidity is a major effector of cell fate decisions. Whereas cell proliferation on stiff matrices, wherein Yes -associated protein (YAP) plays a pivotal role, is well documented, activation of apoptosis in response to soft matrices is poorly understood. Here, we show that YAP drives the apoptotic decision as well. We find that in cells on soft matrices, YAP is recruited to small adhesions, phosphorylated at the Y357 residue, and translocated into the nucleus, ultimately leading to apoptosis. In contrast, Y357 phosphorylation levels are dramatically low in large adhesions on stiff matrices. Furthermore, mild attenuation of actomyosin contractility allows adhesion growth on soft matrices, leading to reduced Y357 phosphorylation levels and resulting in cell growth. These findings indicate that failed adhesion reinforcement drives rigidity -dependent apoptosis through YAP and that this decision is not determined solely by ECM rigidity but rather by the balance between cellular forces and ECM rigidity.

AB  - Cellular signaling involves a large repertoire of membrane receptors operating in overlapping spatiotemporal regimes and targeting many common intracellular effectors. However, both the molecular mechanisms and the physiological roles of crosstalk between receptors, especially those from different superfamilies, are poorly understood. We find that the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) TrkB and the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) together mediate hippocampal synaptic plasticity in response to brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Activated TrkB enhances constitutive mGluR5 activity to initiate a mode switch that drives BDNF-dependent sustained, oscillatory Ca2+ signaling and enhanced MAP kinase activation. This crosstalk is mediated, in part, by synergy between G beta gamma, released by TrkB, and G alpha(q)-GTP, released by mGluR5, to enable physiologically relevant RTK/GPCR crosstalk.

AB  - KCC2 mediates extrusion of K+ and Cl- and assuresthe developmental "switch" in GABA function during neuronal maturation. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying KCC2 regulation are not fully elucidated. We investigated the impact of transforming growth factor beta 2 (TGF-beta 2) on KCC2 during neuronal maturation using quantitative RT-PCR, immunoblotting, immunofluorescence and chromatin immunoprecipitation in primary mouse hippocampal neurons and brain tissue from Tgf-beta 2-deficient mice. Inhibition of TGF-beta/activin signaling downregulates Kcc2 transcript in immature neurons. In the forebrain of Tgf-beta 2(-/-) mice, expression of Kcc2, transcription factor Ap2 beta and KCC2 protein is downregulated. AP2 beta binds to Kcc2 promoter, a binding absent in Tgf-beta 2(-/-). In hindbrain/brainstem tissue of Tgf-beta 2(-/-) mice, KCC2 phosphorylation at T1007 is increased and approximately half of pre-Botzinger-complex neurons lack membrane KCC2 phenotypes rescued through exogenous TGF-beta 2. These results demonstrate that TGF-beta 2 regulates KCC2 transcription in immature neurons, possibly acting upstream of AP2 beta, and contributes to the developmental dephosphorylation of KCC2 at T1007. The present work suggests multiple and divergent roles for TGF-beta 2 on KCC2 during neuronal maturation and provides novel mechanistic insights for TGF-beta 2-mediated regulation of KCC2 gene expression, posttranslational modification and surface expression. We propose TGF-beta 2 as a major regulator of KCC2 with putative implications for pathophysiological conditions.

AB  - Upon chronic stress, a fraction of individuals shows stress resilience, which can prevent long-term mental dysfunction. The underlying molecular mechanisms are complex and have not yet been fully understood. In this study, we performed a data-driven behavioural stratification together with single-cell transcriptomics of the hippocampus in a mouse model of chronic social defeat stress. Our work revealed that in a sub-group exhibiting molecular responses upon chronic stress, the dorsal hippocampus is particularly involved in neuroimmune responses, angiogenesis, myelination, and neurogenesis, thereby enabling brain restoration and homeostasis after chronic stress. Based on these molecular insights, we applied rapamycin after the stress as a proof-of-concept pharmacological intervention and were able to substantially increase stress resilience. Our findings serve as a data resource and can open new avenues for further understanding of molecular processes underlying stress response and for targeted interventions supporting resilience.

AB  - Background: Skin innervation is crucial for normal wound healing. However, the relationship between nerve receptors and wound healing and the intrinsic mechanism remains to be further identified. In this study, we investigated the role of a calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor component, receptor activity-modifying protein 1 (RAMP1), in mouse skin fibroblast (MSF) proliferation.
   Methods: In vivo, Western blotting and immunohistochemical (INC) staining of mouse skin wounds tissue was used to detect changes in RAMP1 expression. In vitro, RAMP1 was overexpressed in MSF cell lines by infection with Tet-On-Flag-RAMP1 lentivirus and doxycycline (DOX) induction. An IncuCyte S3 Live-Cell Analysis System was used to assess and compare the proliferation rate differences between different treatment groups. Total protein and subcellular extraction Western blot analysis, quantitative real-time-polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis, and immunofluorescence (IF) staining analysis were conducted to detect signalling molecule expression and/or distribution. The CUT & RUN assay and dual-luciferase reporter assay were applied to measure protein-DNA interactions.
   Results: RAMP1 expression levels were altered during skin wound healing in mice. RAMP1 overexpression promoted MSF proliferation. Mechanistically, total Yes-associated protein (YAP) and nuclear YAP protein expression was increased in RAMP1-overexpressing MSFs. RAMP1 overexpression increased inhibitory guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) alpha subunit 3 (G alpha i3) expression and activated downstream protein kinase A (PKA), and both elevated the expression of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element-binding protein (CREB) and activated it, promoting the transcription of YAP, elevating the total YAP level and promoting MSF proliferation.
   Conclusions: Based on these data, we report, for the first time, that changes in the total RAMP1 levels during wound healing and RAMP1 overexpression alone can promote MSF proliferation via the G alpha i3-PKA-CREB-YAP axis, a finding critical for understanding RAMP1 function, suggesting that this pathway is an attractive and accurate nerve target for skin wound treatment.

AB  - Dromedaries are an important livestock, used as beasts of burden and for meat and milk production. However, they can act as an intermediate source or vector for transmitting zoonotic viruses to humans, such as the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) or Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV). After several outbreaks of CCHFV in the Arabian Peninsula, recent studies have demonstrated that CCHFV is endemic in dromedaries and camel ticks in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). There is no apparent disease in dromedaries after the bite of infected ticks; in contrast, fever, myalgia, lymphadenopathy, and petechial hemorrhaging are common symptoms in humans, with a case fatality ratio of up to 40%. We used the in-solution hybridization capture of 100 annotated immune genes to genotype 121 dromedaries from the UAE tested for seropositivity to CCHFV. Through univariate linear regression analysis, we identified two candidate genes belonging to the innate immune system: FCAR and CLEC2B. These genes have important functions in the host defense against viral infections and in stimulating natural killer cells, respectively. This study opens doors for future research into immune defense mechanisms in an enzootic host against an important zoonotic disease.

AB  - Aging and aging-related metabolic complications are global problems that seriously threaten public health. Taxifolin (TAX) is a novel health food and has been widely proved to have a variety of biological activities used in food and medicine. However, the delayed effect of TAX on the aging process has not been investigated. The purpose of this study is to explore the role of TAX as a natural active substance on aging brain tissue induced by d-galactose (d-Gal) and to determine the effect of supplementing TAX on the metabolism of the intestinal flora in aging bodies. The aging model was established by intraperitoneal injection of d-Gal (800 mg kg(-1)) once per 3 days for 12 weeks, and TAX (20 and 40 mg kg(-1)) was administered daily by oral gavage after 6 weeks of induction with d-Gal. After testing aging mice in an eight-arm maze, the results showed that TAX treatment significantly restored spatial learning and memory impairment. Moreover, long-term d-Gal treatment incited cholinergic dysfunction of aging mice, and H&E staining revealed obvious histopathological damage and structural disorder in the hippocampus of mouse brain tissue, while TAX treatment significantly reversed these changes. Importantly, supplementing with TAX significantly mitigated oxidative stress injury by alleviating the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) while increasing antioxidant enzymes. Furthermore, TAX decreased the apoptosis of the aging brain by regulating the phosphorylation levels of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (AKT), and activating nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), nuclear heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and NADH dehydrogenase quinone 1 (NQO1) to maximally moderate the oxidative stress injury that occurred after d-Gal induction. In addition, 16S rDNA analysis revealed that TAX treatment decelerated the d-gal-induced aging process by regulating the composition of the intestinal flora and abundance of beneficial bacteria, including Enterorhabdus, Clostridium, Bifidobacterium, and Parvibacter. In conclusion, the results of this study demonstrated that TAX alleviated oxidative stress injury in mice aged by d-Gal and also confirmed that TAX improved the aging process by regulating intestinal microbes, which provides the possibility of prevention and treatment for aging and metabolic disorders through the potential food health factors.

AB  - Alzheimer ' s disease (AD) is one of the most prevalent and progressive neurodegenerative disorders, hallmarked by increased amyloid-ss deposition and enhanced oxidative load in the brain, ensuing cognitive decline. The present study is aimed at elucidating the neuroprotective effect of saroglitazar, a dual peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor (PPARa/gamma) agonist used in the treatment of diabetic dyslipidemia, against memory impairment induced by intraperitoneal scopolamine injection. 30 male Wistar rats were randomly divided into the following five groups: (A) Veh + Veh, (B) SGZ + Veh, (C) Veh + SCOP, (D) DPZ + SCOP, and (E) SGZ + SCOP. Rats of the respective groups were pretreated with saroglitazar (10 mg/kg, p.o.) and donepezil (3 mg/kg, p.o.) once daily for 16 days. During the final 9 days of the study, a daily injection of scopolamine (3 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered to the respective groups. Adjacent to the scopolamine injection, behavioral tests such as the open field, Y maze, novel object recognition test, and Morris water maze were conducted to assess learning and memory. Additionally, biochemical parameters such as acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), nitric oxide (NO), malondialdehyde (MDA), reduced glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), ss-amyloid levels, and NF-kappa B were measured in the hippocampus. The rats that received scopolamine injections showed significantly impaired short-term spatial and learning memory. This was associated with an increase in ss-amyloid, iNOS, nitric oxide (NO), malondialdehyde, NF-kappa B, and TNF-alpha levels in the hippocampus of AD rats. On the other hand, saroglitazar has provided promising data on its protective role in cognition by protecting the BDNF, SOD, and GSH decline. As a result, saroglitazar was found to be a promising therapy in AD by upregulating the antioxidant status and cholinergic activity and preventing memory loss. Collectively, findings in the present study revealed that saroglitazar protected AD by suppressing scopolamine-mediated learning and memory deficits, oxidative stress, and cholinergic damage. Studying these mechanisms may conclude the protective role of saroglitazar against AD. However, further studies in transgenic animals will provide numerous insights into treatment mechanisms and contribute to developing a therapeutic intervention for AD.

AB  - ObjectiveTo investigate the effect of hypericin on ameliorating depressive behaviour in post-stroke depression (PSD) rats.MethodsRats underwent a middle cerebral artery occlusion and chronic mild stress for 28 days to create a PSD model. Behavioural tests included the open field test (OFT) and the elevated plus maze test. Hypericin at a low (100 mg/kg) and a high (400 mg/kg) dose was administered via gavage. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to establish a microglia-injury model, with hypericin treatment at 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2 mu mol/L, and ELISA was used to measure serotonin (5-HT), interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 levels. Additionally, Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry analysed protein levels and the expression of iNOS and Arg-1 in the hippocampus.ResultsFollowing the PSD model preparation, the rats showed substantially reduced movement in the OFT and spent less time in the open arms of the elevated plus maze, whereas treatment with hypericin and fluoxetine improved depressive behaviour in these tests. In addition, hypericin decreased IL-6, increased IL-10 and 5-HT and enhanced p-MEK/MEK, p-ERK/ERK and p-CREB/CREB expression in the serum of the PSD rats and the LPS cell model. Hypericin also reduced iNOS but increased Arg-1 expression in the PSD rat hippocampus.ConclusionHypericin promotes M2 microglial polarisation, reduces inflammation and improves depressive behaviour in PSD rats by activating the MEK/ERK/CREB pathway.

AB  - Sirtuin 6 (SIRT6), a member of the Sirtuin family, acts as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-dependent protein deacetylase, mono-adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribosyltransferase, and fatty acid deacylase, and plays critical roles in inflammation, aging, glycolysis, and DNA repair. Accumulating evidence has suggested that SIRT6 is involved in brain functions such as neuronal differentiation, neurogenesis, and learning and memory. However, the precise molecular roles of SIRT6 during neuronal circuit formation are not yet well understood. In this study, we tried to elucidate molecular roles of SIRT6 on neurite development by using primary-cultured hippocampal neurons. We observed that SIRT6 was abundantly localized in the nucleus, and its expression was markedly increased during neurite outgrowth and synaptogenesis. By using shRNA-mediated SIRT6knockdown, we show that both dendritic length and the number of dendrite branches were significantly reduced in the SIRT6-knockdown neurons. Microarray and subsequent gene ontology analysis revealed that reducing SIRT6 caused the downregulation of immediate early genes (IEGs) and alteration of several biological processes including MAPK (ERK1/2) signaling. We found that nuclear accumulation of phosphorylated ERK1/2 was significantly reduced in SIRT6-knockdown neurons. Overexpression of SIRT6 promoted dendritic length and branching, but the mutants lacking deacetylase activity had no significant effect on the dendritic morphology. Collectively, the presented findings reveal a role of SIRT6 in dendrite morphogenesis, and suggest that SIRT6 may act as an important regulator of ERK1/2 signaling pathway that mediates IEG expression, which leads to dendritic development.

AB  - Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), as one of the most severe hemorrhagic strokes, is closely related to neuronal damage. Neurogenesis is a promising therapy, however, reliable targets are currently lacking. Increasing evidence has indicated that CD24 is associated with the growth of hippocampal neurons and the regulation of neural stem/precursor cell proliferation. To investigate the potential effect of CD24 in astrocytes on neuron growth in the hippocampus, we used a Transwell co-culture system of hippocampal astrocytes and neurons, and oxyhemoglobin (OxyHb) was added to the culture medium to mimic SAH in vitro. A specific lentivirus was used to knock down CD24 expression in astrocytes, which was verified by western blot, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and immunofluorescent staining. Astrocyte activation, neurite elongation, neuronal apoptosis, and cell viability were also assessed. We first determined the augmented expression level of CD24 in hippocampal astrocytes after SAH. A similar result was observed in cultured astrocytes exposed to OxyHb, and a corresponding change in SHP2/ERK was also noticed. CD24 in astrocytes was then downregulated by the lentivirus, which led to the impairment of axons and dendrites on the co-cultured neurons. Aggravated neuronal apoptosis was induced by the CD24 downregulation in astrocytes, which might be a result of a lower level of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). In conclusion, the knock-down of CD24 in astrocytes suppressed hippocampal neuron growth, in which the SHP2-ERK signaling pathway and BNDF were possibly involved.

AB  - The NLRP3 inflammasome is involved in the neuroinflammatory pathway of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aim of this study is to explore the roles and underlying mechanisms of ginkgolide (Baiyu (R)) on amyloid precursor protein (APP)/presenilin 1 (PS1) transgenic mice and a murine microglial cell line, BV-2. In the present study, the APP/PS1 mice were administered with ginkgolide, followed by a Morris water maze test. The mice were then euthanized to obtain brain tissue for histological and AB analysis. Additionally, BV-2 cells were pretreated with ginkgolide and then incubated with AB1-42 peptide. NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1 mRNA and protein expression in brain tissue of mice and BV-2 cells were quantified by real-time PCR and western blotting, as well as reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, interleukin (IL)-1B and IL-18 levels by lucigenin technique and ELISA. Compared with the APP/PS1 mice, ginkgolide-treated mice demonstrated the shortened escape latency, reduced plaques, less inflammatory cell infiltration and neuron loss in the hippocampi of APP/PS1 mice. The levels of NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1, ROS, IL-1B, and IL-18 were also decreased in the brain tissue of APP/PS1 mice or AB1-42-treated BV-2 cells following ginkgolide treatment. Ginkgolide exerted protective effects on AD, at least partly by inactivating the NLRP3/caspase-1 pathway.

AB  - Depression is a disabling and highly prevalent psychiatric illness. Multiple studies have linked glutamatergic dysfunction with the pathophysiology of depression, but the exact alterations in the glutamatergic system that contribute to depressive-like behaviors are not fully understood. Recent evidence suggests that a decreased level in neuronal glutamate transporter (EAAT3), known to control glutamate levels and limit the activation of glutamate receptors at synaptic sites, may contribute to the manifestation of a depressive phenotype. Here, we tested the possibility that increased EAAT3 expression at excitatory synapses could reduce the susceptibility of mice to develop depressive-like behaviors when challenged to a 5-week unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) protocol. Mice overexpressing EAAT3 in the forebrain (EAAT3(glo)/CMKII) and control littermates (EAAT3(glo)) were assessed for depressive-like behaviors and long-term memory performance after being subjected to UCMS conditions. We found that, after UCMS, EAAT3(glo)/CMKII mice did not exhibit depressive-like behaviors or memory alterations observed in control mice. Moreover, we found that EAAT3(glo)/CMKII mice did not show alterations in phasic dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens neither in long-term synaptic plasticity in the CA1 region of the hippocampus after UCMS, as observed in control littermates. Altogether these results suggest that forebrain EAAT3 overexpression may be related to a resilient phenotype, both at behavioral and functional level, to the deleterious effect of chronic stress, highlighting the importance of neuronal EAAT3 in the pathophysiology of depressive-like behaviors.

AB  - Cognitive dysfunction is an important complication observed in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients. Tetramethylpyrazine (TMP) is known to exhibit anti-diabetic and neuroprotective properties. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the possible therapeutic effects of TMP against type 2 diabetes-associated cognitive impairment in rats. High-fat diet (HFD) followed by a low dose of streptozotocin (35 mg/kg) was used to induce diabetes in Sprague-Dawley rats. TMP (20, 40, and 80 mg/kg) and Pioglitazone (10 mg/kg) were administered for 4 weeks. The Morris water maze (MWM) and novel objective recognition task (NOR) tests were used to assess memory function. Fasting blood glucose (FBG), lipid profile, HOMA-IR, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and glucose tolerance were measured. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and choline acetytransferase (ChAT) activity, acetylcholine (ACh) levels, oxidative stress, apoptotic (Bcl-2, Bax, caspase-3), and inflammatory markers (TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, and NF-k beta) were assessed. BDNF, p-AKT, and p-CREB levels were also measured. In the present work, we observed that treatment of diabetic rats with TMP alleviated learning and memory deficits, improved insulin sensitivity, and attenuated hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia. Furthermore, treatment with TMP increased BDNF, p-Akt, and p-CREB levels, normalized cholinergic dysfunction, and suppressed oxidative, inflammatory, and apoptotic markers in the hippocampus. Collectively, our results suggest that the TMP may be an effective neuroprotective agent in alleviating type 2 diabetes-associated cognitive deficits.

AB  - BackgroundNanotechnology and its application to manipulate herbal compounds to design new neuroprotective agents to manage neurotoxicity has recently increased. Cur-ZnO conjugated nanoparticles were synthesized and used in an experimental model of ketamine-induced neurotoxicity.MethodsCur-ZnO conjugated nanoparticles were chemically characterized, and the average crystalline size was determined. Forty-nine adult mice were divided into seven groups of seven animals each. Normal saline was given to control mice (group 1). Ketamine (25 mg/kg) was given to a second group. A third group of mice was given ketamine (25 mg/kg) in combination with curcumin (40 mg/kg), while mice in groups 4, 5, and 6 received ketamine (25 mg/kg) plus Cur-ZnO nanoparticles (10, 20, and 40 mg/kg). Group 7 received only ZnO (5 mg/kg). All doses were ip for 14 days. Hippocampal mitochondrial quadruple complex enzymes, oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptotic characteristics were assessed.ResultsCur-ZnO nanoparticles and curcumin decreased lipid peroxidation, GSSG content, IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, and Bax levels while increasing GSH and antioxidant enzymes like GPx, GR, and SOD while increasing Bcl-2 level and mitochondrial quadruple complex enzymes in ketamine treatment groups.ConclusionThe neuroprotective properties of Cur-ZnO nanoparticles were efficient in preventing ketamine-induced neurotoxicity in the mouse brain. The nanoparticle form of curcumin (Cur-ZnO) required lower doses to produce neuroprotective effects against ketamine-induced toxicity than conventional curcumin.

AB  - Coenzyme Q10 (KQ10) and curcumin (KUR) supplements are extensively used for their potential antioxidant, anticancer, and antiapoptotic properties. The present study investigated the neuroprotective potential of KQ10 and KUR against the side effect of cyclophosphamide (SF) (150 mg/kg) on the hippocampus of male Wistar albino rats. Forty-nine 10-12 weeks old rats were randomly divided into seven groups: control, olive oil (OL), SF, KQ10, KUR, SF+KQ10, and SF+KUR. Our biochemical finding showed a significant decrease in superoxide dismutase (SOD) level in the SF group compared to the control group (p < 0.05). There was also a significant reduction in the total number of the hippocampal pyramidal neurons in the CA1, CA2, and CA1-3 regions in the SF group compared to the control group (p < 0.05). In the SF+KQ10 group, we found a significant increase in serum SOD level and the total number of the hippocampal pyramidal neurons in the CA1, CA2, and CA1-3 regions compared to the SF group (p < 0.05). Immunohistochemical and histopathological examination exhibited noteworthy findings in the hippocampus tissues. Our findings showed that KQ10 administration significantly mitigated the hippocampal alteration caused by SF through enhancing antioxidant enzyme activity and reducing apoptosis. However, we found no protective activity of KUR on the hippocampus tissue, which may be due to its weak antioxidative activity.

AB  - Kainic acid (KA) model of epilepsy is a reliable tool to study temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), the most common type of partial epilepsy in adults. Substantial body of data suggest that the KA-induced status epilepticus (SE) leads to several molecular and structural changes in the hippocampus, including sclerosis, sprouting of mossy fiber, reorganization of inter-neuronal networks, alterations in neuropeptide signaling, gliosis, and synaptic transmission dysregulation. However, no details on the ultrastructural changes, especially in relationship to synapses are available. This information is important in providing a comprehensive understanding of subtle changes that occur in this debilitating disease. Thus, in this study, applying electron-microscopic morphometric analysis, we evaluated the ultrastructural effects of KA on the CA1 region of the hippocampus, an area intimately involved in SE. The total number of synaptic vesicles (SVs), the number of docking SVs, the length of synapse active zone (AZ) and the number and area of presynaptic and postsynaptic mitochondria in axo-dendritic (excitatory) synapses were measured at 24 h, and 8 and 21 days after KA administration. Results indicate a decrease in the total number and docking of SVs, an increase in the length of AZ and the number and area of presynaptic and postsynaptic mitochondria, which were more prominent at 8 days after KA injection. The findings suggest a timedependent ultrastructural changes in CA1 region of the hippocampus in an animal model of focal epilepsy.

AB  - Kaixin San (KXS) is a classical prescription for the treatment of depression. However, the mechanism is not clear. In this study, serum pharmacochemistry, mediated by the UHPLC-Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer, was used to identify compounds derived from the KXS-medicated serum. These components were used to construct a compound-target network for depression using a network pharmacology approach to predict potential biological targets of KXS. Subsequently, we established a mouse model of CUMS-induced depression and observed the antidepressant effect of KXS. The signalling pathways predicted by the network pharmacology were further validated in animal experiments. The results showed that 36 compounds were identified from the KXS-medicated serum. Based on this, 984 genes related to the compounds and 4966 genes related to depression were identified using network pharmacology. Critically, KEGG analysis identified the PI3K/Akt and NF-kappa B signalling pathways as the main pathways through which KXS exerts its antidepressant effect. KXS significantly alleviated depression-like behaviour and hippocampal histopathological changes in a mouse model of depression. Compared with the model group, the treatment of KXS significantly reduced the expression of protein targets in the PI3K/Akt/NF-kappa B signalling pathway. All these studies effectively corroborated the predicted results, confirming the feasibility of this integrated strategy.

AB  - Histone methylation, a common form of chromatin remodeling, has been found to be associated with various neurological and cognitive disorders. However, little is known about how this mechanism contributes to the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we found that lysine demethylase 5C (KDM5C), a histone H3 lysine 4 di- and tri-methyl (H3K4me2/3)-specific demethylase encoded by an X-linked mental retardation-related gene, displayed a progressive increase in the hippocampus with age in 3 x Tg-AD mice. Suppression of KDM5C partially mitigated the cognitive decline according to water maze, Y maze, and novel object recognition tests. In addition, significantly decreased amyloid plaques, enhanced long-term potentiation (LTP), and up-regulated expression of synaptic proteins were observed in KDM5C knockdown 3 x Tg-AD mice. Mechanistically, suppression of KDM5C could promote the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) to partially protect hippocampal neurons from beta-amyloid damage. In the promoter region of Bdnf, KDM5C was bound to the repressor element-1 (RE-1) motif to reduce the nearby H3K4me3 level and inhibit gene transcription. Mutations in the RE-1 motif reversed the inhibitory effect of KDM5C. Our results emphasize that KDM5C excess is one of the reasons for the onset and progression of AD and that suppression of KDM5C in the hippocampus should be considered a potential therapeutic target to ameliorate cognitive impairment and pathological symptoms in AD.

TI  - Ergosterol originated from Auricularia auricula attenuates high fat diet-induced obesity and cognitive impairment in mice
T2  - FOOD & FUNCTION
LA  - English
KW  - EXTRACTION
AB  - Excessive intake of a high fat diet (HFD) leads to accumulation of fat and obesity. Ergosterol (ERG) is a characteristic sterol of fungi with various bioactive functions; however, there are few studies on the ERG function of ameliorating obesity and following cognitive impairment. It was previously found that Zhashui Auricularia auricula (AA) is rich in ERG; therefore it was selected to enrich ERG through the intervention of exogenous inducers of rice bran oil (RBO), methyl jasmonate (Me JA) and salicylic acid (SA). The accumulated ERG was used to investigate alleviative effects on mouse obesity and cognitive impairment. According to LEfSe analysis of intestinal flora species, ERG reduced the abundance of obesity or inflammation-related intestinal microbial genera, while increasing the relative abundance of beneficial bacteria. The ERG sourced from AA significantly ameliorated HFD-induced mouse obesity by reducing lipid levels and liver oxidative stress, recovering memory and learning abilities of the mice by restoring the hippocampus function and downregulating inflammatory factors.

AB  - It has been consistently found that exposure to ambient air pollution, such as particulate matter (PM), results in cognitive impairments and mental disorders. This study aimed to investigate the possible neuroprotective effects of curcumin, a polyphenol compound, on the neurobehavioral deficits and to identify the role of oxidative stress in dusty PM exposure rats. Rats received curcumin (50 mg/kg, daily, gavage, 2 weeks) 30 min before placing animals in a clean air chamber (<= 150 mu g/m(3), 60 min daily, 2 weeks) or ambient dusty PM chamber (2000-8000 mu g/m(3), 60 min daily, 2 weeks). Subsequently, the cognitive and non-cognitive functions of the animals were evaluated using standard behavioral tests. Moreover, blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, brain water content (BWC), oxidative-antioxidative status, and histological changes were determined in the cerebral cortex and hippocampal areas of the rats. Our results showed that curcumin administration in dusty PM exposure rats attenuates memory impairment, decreases anxiety-/depression-like behaviors, and improves locomotor/exploratory activities. These findings were accompanied by reduced BBB permeability and BWC, decreasing oxidative stress, and lessening neuronal loss in the cerebral cortex and different hippocampal areas. The results of this study suggest that curcumin's antioxidant properties may contribute to its efficacy in improving neurobehavioral deficits and preventing neuronal loss associated with dusty PM exposure.

AB  - The effect of Shenfu injection on brain injury after cardiac arrest (CA) and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) along with the underlying mechanism of axonal regeneration was explored. CA/CPR model in rats was established for subsequent experiments. A total of 160 rats were randomly divided into sham group, model group, conventional western medicine (CWM) group, Shenfu group, and antagonist group (n=32 per group). After 3 hours, 24 hours, 3 days, and 7 days of drug administration, the modified Neurological Severity Score tests were performed. The ultrastructure of the brain and hippocampus was observed by electron microscopy. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), western blotting, and immunohistochemistry were used to detect Nogo receptor (NgR) expression in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, and Nogo-NgR expression in CA/CPR model. Neurological deficits in the model group were severe at 3 hours, 24 hours, 3 days, and 7 days after the recovery of natural circulation, whereas the neurological deficits in CWM, antagonist, and Shenfu group were relatively mild. The ultrastructure of neuronal cells in Shenfu group had relatively complete cell membranes and more vesicles than those in the model group. The results of PCR and western blotting showed lower messenger ribonucleic acid and protein expression of NgR in Shenfu group than the model group and CWM group. Immunohistochemical examination indicated a reduction of Nogo-NgR expression in Shenfu group and antagonist group. Our results suggested that Shenfu injection reduced brain injury by attenuating Nogo-NgR signaling pathway and promoting axonal regeneration.

AB  - Cerebral amyloid-beta (A beta) deposition is a representative hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Development of A beta-clearing small molecules could be an advantageous therapeutic strategy for A beta clearance considering the advantages in terms of side effects, cost-effectiveness, stability, and oral bioavailability. Here, we report an A beta-dissociating small molecule, YIAD-0121, a derivative of 4-acyl-3,4-dihydropyrrolo[1,2-alpha]pyrazine. Through a series of anti-A beta screening assays, YIAD-0121 was identified to inhibit A beta aggregation and dissociate preformed A beta fibrils in vitro. Furthermore, the administration of YIAD-0121 in 5XFAD transgenic AD mice inhibited the increase of cerebral A beta aggregation and progression of hippocampus-dependent cognitive decline, with ameliorated neuroinflammation.

AB  - Zinc has been suggested to act as an intracellular signaling molecule due to its regulatory effects on numerous protein targets including enzymes, transcription factors, ion channels, neurotrophic factors, and postsynaptic scaffolding proteins. However, intracellular zinc concentration is tightly maintained at steady levels under natural physiological conditions. Dynamic changes in intracellular zinc concentration have only been detected in certain types of cells that are exposed to pathologic stimuli or upon receptor ligand binding. Unlike calcium, the ubiquitous signaling metal ion that can oscillate periodically and spontaneously in various cells, spontaneous zinc, oscillations have never been reported. In this work, we made the novel observation that the developing neurons generated spontaneous and synchronous zinc spikes in primary hippocampal cultures using a fluorescent zinc sensor, FluoZin-3. Blocking of glutamate receptor-dependent calcium influx depleted the zinc spikes, suggesting that these zinc spikes were driven by the glutamate-mediated spontaneous neural excitability and calcium spikes that have been characterized in early developing neurons. Simultaneous imaging of calcium or pH together with zinc, we uncovered that a downward pH spike was evoked with each zinc spike and this transient cellular acidification occurred downstream of calcium spikes but upstream of zinc spikes. Our results suggest that spontaneous, synchronous zinc spikes were generated through calcium influx-induced cellular acidification, which liberates zinc from intracellular zinc binding ligands. Given that changes in zinc concentration can modulate activities of proteins essential for synapse maturation and neuronal differentiation, these zinc spikes might act as important signaling roles in neuronal development.

AB  - Deferoxamine mesylate (DFX) is a microorganism-derived iron chelator used in hematology to treat acute iron intoxication and chronic iron overload. Many studies have reported adverse neurological events from DFX exposure, but it is challenging to distinguish these from the effects of iron intoxication. This study aimed to evaluate whether DFX exposure alone can directly impair neurological functions and to elucidate its toxicological mechanisms. Our findings from in vivo and in vitro experiments indicate that DFX exposure can directly cause emotional and cognitive dysfunction in mice. Neuronal apoptosis, resulting from chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMS) dysfunction, was identified as a key toxicological mechanism underlying DFX-induced neuronal impairment. This study provides evidence for the comprehensive monitoring and timely management of neurotoxic adverse events associated with DFX exposure, as well as a foundation for developing medications to prevent and treat these events to enhance patient quality of life.

AB  - Vascular dementia (VD) is a degenerative cerebrovascular disorder associated with progressive cognitive decline. Previous reports have shown that 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF), a well-known TrkB agonist, effectively ameliorates cognitive deficits in several disease models. Therefore, this study investigated the protective effects of 7,8-DHF against 2-VO-induced VD. VD was established in rats using the permanent bilateral carotid arteries occlusion (two-vessel occlusion, 2-VO) model. 7,8-DHF (5, 10, and 20 mg/kg) and Donepezil (10 mg/kg) were administered for 4 weeks. Memory function was assessed by the novel objective recognition task (NOR) and Morris water maze (MWM) tests. Inflammatory (TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, and NF-k beta), oxidative stress, and apoptotic (BAX, BCL-2, caspase-3) markers, along with the activity of choline acetylcholinesterase (AChE) was assessed. p-AKT, p-CREB, BDNF, and neurotransmitter (NT) (GLU, GABA, and ACh) levels were also analyzed in the hippocampus of 2-VO rats. Our results show that 7,8-DHF effectively improved memory performance and cholinergic dysfunction in 2-VO model rats. Furthermore, 7,8-DHF treatment also increased p-AKT, p-CREB, and BDNF levels, suppressed oxidative, inflammatory, and apoptotic markers, and restored altered NT levels in the hippocampus. These findings imply that 7, 8-DHF may act via multiple mechanisms and as such serve as a promising neuroprotective agent in the context of VD.

AB  - Objective: Taekwondo, which is the most preferred sport among the martial arts, is known to improve individuals physically, spiritually and mentally. The aim of this study is to reveal the effect of teakwondo sport on the brain and brain structures.Design;: 30 taekwondo athletes and 15 control groups were included in this study. Diffusion tensor MR images of each participant were taken. The information was obtained by the self-declaration of the athletes, whether they were sports years, amateur or elite.Method: Total brain volume and volumes of white matter, gray matter, frontal lobe, precentral gyrus, cortico-spinal tract, basal nuclei, postcentral gyrus, hippocampus and amigdala and the ratio of these volumes to total brain volume were evaluated statistically between the groups using MriCloud software and ROIEditor program.Results: An increase in total brain volume, gray matter, frontal lobe and precentral gyrus volume in athletes was associated with taekwondo training. When the ratio of brain parts to total brain volume was examined, it was determined that there was a difference in the ratio of gray matter, white matter volumes in amateur athletes, right frontal lobe, left corticospinal tract, right postcentral gyrus volumes in elite athletes, and left postcentral gyrus volumes of both athletes compared to sedentary individuals.Conclusions: The increase in the volume of gray matter, frontal lobe, postcentral gyrus and corticospinal tract together with the brain volume shows that taekwondo exercise contributes to physical, spiritual and mental development.

AB  - Liver ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) continues to play a major role in liver dysfunction and failure, which is involved in the process of liver transplantation, partial hepatectomy, and hemorrhagic shock. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is involved in a variety of biological processes. However, bFGF's role in hepatic IRI remains unclear. In our study, we constructed hepatic I/R surgery in WT and nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) KO mice and hypoxia-reoxygenation (H/R) model in AML12 cells to research bFGF's possible role. We found that the expression level of bFGF was highly upregulated in livers after hepatic IRI. In vivo, bFGF treatment led to a significant reduction in the necrotic area, accompanied by alleviation of oxidative stress, cell apoptosis, and inflammation in WT mice. bFGF-induced Nrf2 nuclear translocation and its downstream anti-oxidative proteins production in AML12 cells provide a mechanistic explanation for this phenomenon. In addition, bFGF-induced Nrf2 activation via the protein kinase B (AKT)/glycogen synthase kinase-30 (GSK-30) pathway. bFGF activated Nrf2 to restrain the phosphorylation of promote Yes-associated protein (YAP) and YAP stabili-zation, thus reducing cell apoptosis and inflammation in ROS-dependent manner, revealed that Hippo signaling was the downstream of Nrf2 mediating protective effects of bFGF during hepatic IRI. In conclusion, our findings suggest that bFGF could reduce hepatic IRI and hepatocyte injury via the Nrf2/Hippo signaling pathway.

AB  - Thiopyranothiazoles represent a promising class of drug-like molecules with broad pharmacological profiles. Some novel derivatives of isothiochromeno[4a,4-d]thiazole and chromeno[4 ',3':4,5]thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazole were synthesized and screened against diverse viruses: coronavirus SARS, Influenza Viruses of type A and type B, Adeno-and Rhinovirus, Dengue Fever Virus, Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Rift Valley Fever Virus, Tacaribe Virus, Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis Virus, as well as Vaccinia and Human Cytomegalovirus. The antiviral activity assays revealed highly active isothiochromeno[4a,4-d]thiazole bearing phenazone fragment towards Influenza Virus type A (H1N1) with the selectivity index (SI) within 150. 5,8-Dihydro-2H-[1,3]thiazolo [5 ',4':5,6]thio-pyrano [2,3-d][1,3]thiazol-2,6(3H)-diones showed moderate antiviral activity against influenza viruses and SARS-CoV. The obtained data indicate thiopyranothiazoles as promising class of fused 4-thiazolidinone de-rivatives possessing antiviral effects.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common neurodegenerative disease, has limited treatment options. As such, extensive studies have been conducted to identify novel therapeutic approaches. We previously reported that rhynchophylline (Rhy), a small molecule EphA4 inhibitor, rescues impaired hippocampal synaptic plasticity and cognitive dysfunctions in APP/PS1 mice, an AD transgenic mouse model. To assess whether Rhy can be developed as an alternative treatment for AD, it is important to examine its pharmacokinetics and effects on other disease-associated pathologies. Here, we show that Rhy ameliorates amyloid plaque burden and reduces inflammation in APP/PS1 mice. Transcriptome analysis revealed that Rhy regulates various molecular pathways in APP/PS1 mouse brains associated with amyloid metabolism and inflammation, specifically the ubiquitin proteasome system, angiogenesis, and microglial functional states. These results show that Rhy, which is blood-brain barrier permeable, is beneficial to amyloid pathology and regulates multiple molecular pathways.

AB  - Background: A high-fat diet (HFD) is generally associated with an increased risk of mental disorders that constitute a sizeable worldwide health. A HFD results in the gut microbiota-brain axis being altered and linked to mental disorders. Hypocretin-1, which can promote appetite, has been previously confirmed to be associated with depression. However, no exact relationship has been found for hypocretin between depression and HFDs. Methods: Adult male SD rats were randomly assigned to either a HFD or a normal diet for eight weeks, followed by behavioral tests and plasma biochemical analyses. Then, we investigated the protein and mRNA levels of inflammation-related factors in the hippocampus. We also observed morphological changes in brain microglia and lipid accumulation. Additionally, metagenomic and metabolomic analyses of gut microbiomes were performed. 3T3-L1 cells were utilized in vitro to investigate the impact of hypocretin receptor 1 antagonists (SB334867) on lipid accumulation. To consider the connection between the brain and adipose tissue, we used a conditioned medium (CM) treated with 3T3-L1 cells to observe the activation and phagocytosis of BV2 cells. Following a 12-week period of feeding a HFD to C57BL/6 mice, a three-week intervention period was initiated during which the administration of SB334867 was observed. This was followed by a series of assessments, including monitoring of body weight changes and emotional problems, as well as attention to plasma biochemical levels and microglial cell phenotypes in the brain. Results: The HFD rats displayed anxiety and depressive-like behaviors. HFD rats exhibited increased plasma HDL, LDL, and TC levels. A HFD also causes an increase in hypocretin-1 and hypocretin-2 in the hypothalamus. Metagenomics and metabolomics revealed that the HFD caused an increase in the relative abundance of associated inflammatory bacteria and decreased the abundance of anti-inflammatory and bile acid metabolites. Compared with the CTR group, hippocampal microglia in the HFD group were significantly activated and accompanied by lipid deposition. At the same time, protein and mRNA expression levels of inflammation-related factors were increased. We found that SB334867 could significantly reduce lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 cells after differentiation. The expression of inflammatory factors decreased in the SB334867 group. The administration of SB334867 was found to reverse the adverse effects of the HFD on body weight, depressive-like behaviour and anxiety-like mood. Furthermore, this treatment was associated with improvements in plasma biochemical levels and a reduction in the number of microglia in the brain. Conclusions: In summary, our results demonstrated that a HFD induced anxiety and depressive-like behaviors, which may be linked to the increased hypocretin-1 level and lipid accumulation. Supplementation with SB334867 improved the above. These observations highlight the possibility of hypocretin-1 inducing the risk of HFD-associated emotional dysfunctions.

AB  - NMDAR-dependent synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus consists of two opposing forces: long-term potentiation (LTP), which strengthens synapses and long-term depression (LTD), which weakens synapses. LTP and LTD are associated with memory formation and loss, respectively. Synaptic plasticity is controlled at a molecular level by Ca2+-mediated protein signaling. Here, Ca2+ binds the protein, calmodulin (CaM), which modulates synaptic plasticity in both directions. This is because Ca2+-bound CaM activates both LTD-and LTP-inducing proteins. Understanding how CaM responds to Ca2+ signaling and how this translates into synaptic plasticity is therefore important to understanding synaptic plasticity induction. In this paper, CaM activation by Ca2+ and calmodulin binding to downstream proteins was mathematically modeled using differential equations. Simulations were monitored with and without theoretical knockouts and, global sensitivity analyses were performed to determine how Ca2+/CaM signaling occurred at various Ca2+ signals when CaM levels were limiting. At elevated stimulations, the total CaM pool rapidly bound to its protein binding targets which regulate both LTP and LTD. This was followed by CaM becoming redistributed from low-affinity to high-affinity binding targets. Specifically, CaM was redistributed away from LTD-inducing proteins to bind the high-affinity LTP-inducing protein, calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII). In this way, CaMKII acted as a dominant affecter and repressed activation of opposing CaM-binding protein targets. The model thereby showed a novel form of CaM signaling by which the two opposing pathways crosstalk indirectly. The model also found that CaMKII can repress cAMP production by repressing CaM-regulated proteins, which catalyze cAMP production. The model also found that at low Ca2+ stimulation levels, typical of LTD induction, CaM signaling was unstable and is therefore unlikely to alone be enough to induce synaptic depression. Overall, this paper demonstrates how limiting levels of CaM may be a fundamental aspect of Ca2+ regulated signaling which allows crosstalk among proteins without requiring directly interaction.

AB  - The nucleoredoxin gene NXNL2 encodes for two products through alternative splicing, rod-derived cone viability factor-2 (RdCVF2) that mediates neuronal survival and the thioredoxin-related protein (RdCVF2L), an enzyme that regulates the phosphorylation of TAU. To investigate the link between NXNL2 and tauopathies, we studied the Nxnl2 knockout mouse (Nxnl2(-/-)). We established the expression pattern of the Nxnl2 gene in the brain using a Nxnl2 reporter mouse line, and characterized the behavior of the Nxnl2(-/-) mouse at 2 months of age. Additionally, long term potentiation and metabolomic from hippocampal specimens were collected at 2 months of age. We studied TAU oligomerization, phosphorylation and aggregation in Nxnl2(-/-) brain at 18 months of age. Finally, newborn Nxnl2(-/-) mice were treated with adeno-associated viral vectors encoding for RdCVF2, RdCVF2L or both and measured the effect of this therapy on long-term potential, glucose metabolism and late-onset tauopathy. Nxnl2(-/-) mice at 2 months of age showed severe behavioral deficiency in fear, pain sensitivity, coordination, learning and memory. The Nxnl2(-/-) also showed deficits in long-term potentiation, demonstrating that the Nxnl2 gene is involved in regulating brain functions. Dual delivery of RdCVF2 and RdCVF2L in newborn Nxnl2(-/-) mice fully correct long-term potentiation through their synergistic action. The expression pattern of the Nxnl2 gene in the brain shows a predominant expression in circumventricular organs, such as the area postrema. Glucose metabolism of the hippocampus of Nxnl2(-/-) mice at 2 months of age was reduced, and was not corrected by gene therapy. At 18-month-old Nxnl2(-/-) mice showed brain stigmas of tauopathy, such as oligomerization, phosphorylation and aggregation of TAU. This late-onset tauopathy can be prevented, albeit with modest efficacy, by recombinant AAVs administrated to newborn mice. The Nxnl2(-/-) mice have memory dysfunction at 2-months that resembles mild-cognitive impairment and at 18-months exhibit tauopathy, resembling to the progression of Alzheimer's disease. We propose the Nxnl2(-/-) mouse is a model to study multistage aged related neurodegenerative diseases. The NXNL2 metabolic and redox signaling is a new area of therapeutic research in neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - BackgroundAs a neuroprotective agent, ellagic acid (EA) is extremely beneficial. Our previous study found that EA can alleviate sleep deprivation (SD)-induced abnormal behaviors, although the mechanisms underlying this protective effect have not yet been fully elucidated. ObjectiveAn integrated network pharmacology and targeted metabolomics approach was utilized in this study to investigate the mechanism of EA against SD-induced memory impairment and anxiety. MethodsBehavioral tests were conducted on mice after 72 h of SD. Hematoxylin and eosin staining and nissl staining were then carried out. Integration of network pharmacology and targeted metabolomics was performed. Eventually, the putative targets were further verified using molecular docking analyses and immunoblotting assays. ResultsThe present study findings confirmed that EA ameliorated the behavioral abnormalities induced by SD and prevented histopathological and morphological damage to hippocampal neurons. Through multivariate analysis, clear clustering was obtained among different groups, and potential biomarkers were identified. Four key targets, catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), cytochrome P450 1B1 (CYP1B1), glutathione S-transferase A2 (GSTA2), and glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1), as well as the related potential metabolites and metabolic pathways, were determined by further integrated analysis. Meanwhile, in-silico studies revealed that EA is well located inside the binding site of CYP1B1 and COMT. The experimental results further demonstrated that EA significantly reduced the increased expression of CYP1B1 and COMT caused by SD. ConclusionThe findings of this study extended our understanding of the underlying mechanisms by which EA treats SD-induced memory impairment and anxiety, and suggested a novel approach to address the increased health risks associated with sleep loss.

AB  - Temporal lobe epilepsy is a multifactorial neurological dysfunction syndrome that is refractory, resistant to antiepileptic drugs, and has a high recurrence rate. The pathogenesis of temporal lobe epilepsy is complex and is not fully understood. Intracellular calcium dynamics have been implicated in temporal lobe epilepsy. However, the effect of fluctuating calcium activity in CA1 pyramidal neurons on temporal lobe epilepsy is unknown, and no longitudinal studies have investigated calcium activity in pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal CA1 and primary motor cortex M1 of freely moving mice. In this study, we used a multi-channel fiber photometry system to continuously record calcium signals in CA1 and M1 during the temporal lobe epilepsy process. We found that calcium signals varied according to the grade of temporal lobe epilepsy episodes. In particular, cortical spreading depression, which has recently been frequently used to represent the continuously and substantially increased calcium signals, was found to correspond to complex and severe behavioral characteristics of temporal lobe epilepsy ranging from grade II to grade V. However, vigorous calcium oscillations and highly synchronized calcium signals in CA1 and M1 were strongly related to convulsive motor seizures. Chemogenetic inhibition of pyramidal neurons in CA1 significantly attenuated the amplitudes of the calcium signals corresponding to grade I episodes. In addition, the latency of cortical spreading depression was prolonged, and the above-mentioned abnormal calcium signals in CA1 and M1 were also significantly reduced. Intriguingly, it was possible to rescue the altered intracellular calcium dynamics. Via simultaneous analysis of calcium signals and epileptic behaviors, we found that the progression of temporal lobe epilepsy was alleviated when specific calcium signals were reduced, and that the end-point behaviors of temporal lobe epilepsy were improved. Our results indicate that the calcium dynamic between CA1 and M1 may reflect specific epileptic behaviors corresponding to different grades. Furthermore, the selective regulation of abnormal calcium signals in CA1 pyramidal neurons appears to effectively alleviate temporal lobe epilepsy, thereby providing a potential molecular mechanism for a new temporal lobe epilepsy diagnosis and treatment strategy.

AB  - More than 15 million out of 70 million patients worldwide do not respond to available antiepilepticus drugs (AEDs). With the emergence of nanomedicine, nanomaterials are increasingly being used to treat many diseases. Here, we report that tetrahedral framework nucleic acid (tFNA), an assembled nucleic acid nanoparticle, showed an excellent ability to the cross blood-brain barrier (BBB) to inhibit M1 microglial activation and A1 reactive astrogliosis in the hippocampus of mice after status epilepticus. Furthermore, tFNA inhibited the downregulation of glutamine synthetase by alleviating oxidative stress in reactive astrocytes and subsequently reduced glutamate accumulation and glutamate-mediated neuronal hyperexcitability. Meanwhile, tFNA promotes a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) internalization in the postsynaptic membrane by regulating AMPAR endocytosis, which contributed to reduced calcium influx and ultimately reduced hyperexcitability and spontaneous epilepticus spike frequencies. These findings demonstrated tFNA as a potential AED and that nucleic acid material may be a new direction for the treatment of epilepsy.

AB  - The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is increasing worldwide annually. However, traditional treatments like surgery, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy have limited efficacy, often accompanied by adverse reactions or drug resistance. Precision therapy via tumor-specific gene therapy and targeted delivery would potentially improve therapeutic efficiency with desirable biosafety. In this study, CHRDL-1 is identified in clinic specimens and comprehensively evaluated as a tumor suppressor gene against HCC via activation of the Hippo pathway. By integrating pDNA-CHRDL-1, layered double hydroxides, membrane-penetrating peptide and folic acid, a novel nano-platform (FT-BL@P) is designed for HCC-targeted gene therapy. As prepared FT-BL@P effectively suppress the growth of HCC cells and induces apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. Combined with JPH203, a phase 2 L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT-1) inhibitor, FT-BL@P achieves synergistic anti-tumor effects in a xenograft HCC model, suggesting that the co-delivery of CHRDL-1 combined with JPH203 holds promise as a potential therapeutic strategy for HCC.

Previous studies have reported an increase in retrotransposon transcription in Drosophila models as well as in human tauopathies. In this context, we tested the possible protective effects of a reverse transcriptase inhibitor, namely lamivudine (also known as 3TC), in P301S mice, an animal model of Alzheimer's disease based on FTDP-17-tau overexpression. Transgenic P301S mice administered lamivudine through drinking water showed a decrease in the following histopathological marks typical of tauopathies: tau phosphorylation; inflammation; neuronal death; and hippocampal atrophy. Lamivudine treatment attenuated motor deficits (Rotarod test) and improved short-term memory (Y-maze test). To evaluate the role of tau in retrotransposition, we cotransfected HeLa cells with a plasmid containing a complete LINE-1 sequence and a neomycin reporter cassette designed for retrotransposition assays, and a plasmid with the tau sequence. LINE-1 insertion increased considerably in the cotransfection compared to the transfection without tau. In addition, lamivudine inhibited the insertion of LINE-1. Our data suggest that the progression of the tauopathy can be attenuated by the administration of lamivudine upon the first symptoms of neuropathology.

AB  - Tacrolimus (TAC) has emerged as a potential therapy for Alzheimer's disease (AD), with the challenge of balancing its therapeutic benefits against its immunosuppressive effects. This study explores the efficacy of a sub-immunosuppressive TAC dosing regimen to ameliorate AD-related pathologies. TAC was administered daily for 14 days, with drug concentrations measured via liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in whole blood and hippocampal tissue from C57BL6J mice, while immunofluorescence analyses and Western blotting (performed on hippocampal extracts) were conducted in 10-12 month old 3xTg-AD mice to evaluate levels of tau and amyloid-beta (A beta) proteins. The results from LC-MS/MS revealed that lower TAC doses resulted in sub-immunosuppressive blood levels, while still penetrating the hippocampi. Immunofluorescence showed reductions in tau and A beta proteins in 3xTg-AD mice. Additionally, Western blot analyses revealed reductions in tau and A beta, along with increases in synaptic and autophagy-related proteins. These findings highlight the potential of sub-immunosuppressive TAC doses in effectively targeting AD pathology while minimizing the risk of chronic systemic immunosuppression. Further research and clinical trials are warranted to establish the optimal TAC dosing regimen for AD treatment.

AB  - Adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) is associated with hippocampus-dependent cognitive function, and its initiation is attributed to neural stem cells (NSCs). Dysregulated AHN has been identified in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and may underlie impaired cognitive function in AD. Modulating the function of NSCs and stimulating AHN are potential ways to manipulate AD. Plasmalogen (PLA) are a class of cell membrane glycerophospholipids which exhibit neuroprotective properties. However, the effect of PLA on altered AHN in AD has not been investigated. In our study, PLA(10 & mu;g/mL) -attenuated A & beta; (1-42) (5 & mu;M) induced a decrease in NSC viability and neuronal differentiation of NSCs, partially through regulating the Wnt/& beta;-catenin pathway. Additionally, AD mice were supplemented with PLA (67mg/kg/day) for 6 weeks. PLA treatment improved the impaired AHN in AD mice, including increasing the number of neural stem cells (NSCs) and newly generated neurons. The memory function of AD mice was also enhanced after PLA administration. Therefore, it was summarized that PLA could regulate NSC differentiation by activating the Wnt/& beta;-catenin pathway and ameliorate AD-related memory impairment through up-regulating AHN.

AB  - Manganese (Mn) is now known to have a variety of toxicities, particularly when exposed to it in the workplace. However, there are still ineffective methods for reducing Mn's hazardous effects. In this study, a new selenium polysaccharide (Se-PCS) was developed from the shell of Camellia oleifera to reduce Mn toxicity in vitro and in vivo. The results revealed that Se-PCS may boost cell survival in Hep G2 cells exposed to Mn and activate antioxidant enzyme activity, lowering ROS and cell apoptosis. Furthermore, after being treated with Se-PCS, Caenorhabditis elegans survived longer under Mn stress. daf-16, a tolerant critical gene, was turned on. Moreover, the antioxidant system was enhanced as the increase in strong antioxidant enzyme activity and high expression of the sod-3, ctl-2, and gst-1 genes. A variety of mutations were also used to confirm that Se-PCS downregulated the insulin signaling pathway. These findings showed that Se-PCS protected Hep G2 cells and C. elegans via the insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway and that it could be developed into a promising medication to treat Mn toxicity.

AB  - The brain has a high metabolism rate that may generate reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. Consequently, nerve cells require highly efficient antioxidant defenses in order to prevent a condition of deleterious oxidative stress. This is particularly relevant in the hippocampus, a highly complex cerebral area involved in processing superior cognitive functions. Most current evidence points to hippocampal oxidative damage as a causal effect for neurodegenerative disorders, especially Alzheimer's disease. Nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2/Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Nrf2/Keap1) is a master key for the transcriptional regulation of antioxidant and detoxifying systems. It is ubiquitously expressed in brain areas, mainly supporting glial cells. In the present study, we have analyzed the relationships between Nrf2 and Keap1 isoforms in hippocampal tissue in response to aging and dietary long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) supplementation. The possible involvement of lipoxidative and nitrosative by-products in the dynamics of the Nrf2/Keap1 complex was examined though determination of protein adducts, namely malondialdehyde (MDA), 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE), and 3-nitro-tyrosine (NTyr) under basal conditions. The results were correlated to the expression of target proteins heme-oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4), whose expressions are known to be regulated by Nrf2/Keap1 signaling activation. All variables in this study were obtained simultaneously from the same preparations, allowing multivariate approaches. The results demonstrate a complex modification of the protein expression patterns together with the formation of adducts in response to aging and diet supplementation. Both parameters exhibited a strong interaction. Noticeably, LCPUFA supplementation to aged animals restored the Nrf2/Keap1/target protein patterns to the status observed in young animals, therefore driving a "rejuvenation" of hippocampal antioxidant defense.

AB  - Hyperexcitability-induced neuronal damage plays a role both in epilepsy as well as in inflammatory brain diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and as such represents an important disease pathway which potentially can be targeted to mitigate neuronal damage. Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) and its pharmacologically active metabolite monomethyl fumarate (MMF) are FDA-approved therapeutics for MS, which can induce immunosuppressive and antioxidant pathways, and their neuroprotective capacity has been demonstrated in other preclinical neurological disease models before.In this study, we used an unbiased proteomic approach to identify potential new targets upon the treatment of MMF in glio-neuronal hippocampal cultures. MMF treatment results in induction of antioxidative (HMOX1, NQO1) and anaplerotic metabolic (GAPDH, PC) pathways, which correlated with reduction in ROS production, increased mitochondrial NADH-redox index and decreased NADH pool, independent of glutathione levels. Additionally, MMF reduced glycolytic capacity indicating individual intra-cellular metabolic programs within different cell types. Furthermore, we demonstrate a neuroprotective effect of MMF upon hyperexcitability in vitro (low magnesium model), where MMF prevents glio-neuronal death via reduced ROS production.These results highlight MMF as a potential new therapeutic opportunity in hyperexcitability-induced neurodegeneration.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis involves progressive synaptic degeneration, a process potentially driven by maladaptive microglial pruning activity. While synaptic loss is a hallmark of AD, the molecular signals triggering pathological microglia-mediated synaptic engulfment remain elusive. Clec7a-a key marker of disease-associated microglia (DAM)-is known to activate spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) signaling, enhancing A beta phagocytosis and neuroprotective functions in 5xFAD models. However, its role in regulating synapse-microglia interactions under tauopathic conditions remains undefined. Our analysis revealed a progressive activation of the Clec7a-SYK signaling axis in the hippocampus of PS19 tauopathy mice, correlating with disease progression. Spatial mapping demonstrated a significant co-localization of Clec7a with hippocampal microglia, suggesting cell-autonomous signaling. The pharmacological inhibition of Clec7a achieved multimodal therapeutic effects by attenuating microglial hyperreactivity, suppressing neuroinflammatory cytokine release, and restoring physiological synaptic turnover. Mechanistically, we identified MD2 as a synaptic "eat-me" signal on tauopathy-related synapses, recruiting Clec7a+ microglia to drive aberrant synaptic elimination in PS19 mice. Strikingly, Clec7a blockade rescued hippocampal-dependent memory deficits in behavioral tests. These findings position Clec7a as a context-dependent therapeutic target, with inhibition strategies showing particular promise for tauopathy-related synaptic degeneration.

AB  - The mammalian myocardium grows rapidly during early development due to cardiomyocyte proliferation, which later transitions to cell hypertrophy to sustain the heart's postnatal growth. Although this cell transition in the postnatal heart is consistently preserved in mammalian biology, little is known about the regulatory mechanisms that link proliferation suppression with hypertrophy induction. We reasoned that the production of a micro-RNA(s) could serve as a key bridge to permit changes in gene expression that control the changed cell fate of postnatal cardiomyocytes. We used sequential expression analysis to identify miR205 as a micro-RNA that was uniquely expressed at the cessation of cardiomyocyte growth. Cardiomyocyte-specific miR205 deletion animals showed a 35% increase in heart mass by 3 months of age, with commensurate changes in cell cycle and Hippo pathway activity, confirming miR205's potential role in controlling cardiomyocyte proliferation. In contrast, overexpression of miR205 in newborn hearts had little effect on heart size or function, indicating a complex, probably redundant regulatory system. These findings highlight miR205's role in controlling the shift from cardiomyocyte proliferation to hypertrophic development in the postnatal period.

AB  - Cerebral hypoperfusion is associated with enhanced cognitive decline and increased risk of neuropsychiatric disorders. Erythropoietin (EPO) is a neurotrophic factor known to improve cognitive function in preclinical and clinical studies of neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. However, the clinical application of EPO is limited due to its erythropoietic activity that can adversely elevate hematocrit in non-anemic populations. Carbamoylated erythropoietin (CEPO), a chemically engineered non-erythropoietic derivative of EPO, does not alter hematocrit and maintains neurotrophic and behavioral effects comparable to EPO. Our study aimed to investigate the role of CEPO in cerebral hemodynamics. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis indicated increased blood perfusion in the hippocampal and striatal region without altering tight junction integrity. In vitro and in vivo analyses indicated that hippocampal neurotransmission was unaltered and increased cerebral perfusion was likely due to EDRF, CGRP, and NOS-mediated vasodilation. In vitro analysis using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and hippocampal vascular gene expression analysis showed CEPO to be a non-angiogenic agent which regulates the MEOX2 gene expression. The results from our study demonstrate a novel role of CEPO in modulating cerebral vasodilation and blood perfusion.

AB  - Kaempferol (Kam) is a flavonoid antioxidant found in fruits and vegetables, which was discovered as neuroprotective antioxidants. Lead (Pb), an environmental pollution, could induce learning and memory deficits. Nevertheless, little is known about the mechanisms underlying Kam actions in Pb-induced learning and memory deficits. In this study, we investigated the effects of Kam on Pb-induced cognitive deficits. Pb-exposed rats were treated with 50 mg/kg Kam from postnatal day (PND) 30 to PND 60. Then, Y-maze and Morris water maze have been used to detect the spatial memory in all groups of rats. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining and Nissl staining were used to analyze the neuronal structure damages. The results found Kam treatment improved the learning and memory ability and alleviated hippocampal neuronal pathological damages. Besides, Kam could significantly reverse the synaptic transmission related protein expression including PSD95 and NMDAR2B. Further research found that Kam downregulated autophagy markers, P62, ATG5, Beclin1, and LC3-II. Furthermore, 3 -MA, autophagy inhibitor, increased the levels of NMDAR2B and PSD95 in Pb-induced PC12 cells, indicating Kam alleviated Pb-induced neurotoxicity through inhibiting autophagy activation. Our results showed that Kam could ameliorate Pb-induced cognitive impairments and neuronal damages by decreasing Pb-induced excess autophagy accumulation. (c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) has become a global public health problem characterized by memory and cognitive impairments. Electroacupuncture (EA) has been indicated to exert promising therapeutic effects on AD. This study aimed to further investigate the underlying mechanism of EA in AD treatment. APP/PS1 transgenic mice and wide-type mice underwent with or without EA treatment at GV20 and BL23 acupoints. Morris water maze test was utilized for examining the learning and memory of mice. Hematoxylin-eosin, Congo red, immunofluorescence, and TUNEL staining were employed for detecting the pathological changes of mouse brain hippocampus. Western blotting was implemented for measuring protein levels of autophagy- and AMPK/mTOR pathway-associated markers. APP/PS1 mice exhibited significant impairments in the spatial learning and memory. EA treatment improved the cognitive impairments, reduced amyloid-beta (A beta) deposition, and alleviated neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampal tissues of APP/PS1 mice. EA promoted autophagy and activated the AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. EA improves the cognitive deficits, enhances A beta clearance, and attenuates neuronal apoptosis in APP/PS1 mice in part by activating AMPK/mTOR-mediated autophagy.

AB  - Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a severe neurological complication of sepsis, characterized by cognitive impairment and increased mortality. Owing to the established neuroprotective and immunomodulatory effects of Mesencephalic Astrocyte-derived Neurotrophic Factor (MANF) in a plethora of neurological disorders, our study aimed to investigate the role of MANF in SAE and evaluate its potential as a therapeutic target. Employing a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) mouse model of sepsis, we analyzed MANF expression in the hippocampus and cortex, and evaluated the influence of intranasally administered recombinant human MANF (rhMANF) on symptoms of SAE. Our results disclosed a substantial increase in MANF protein levels within the hippocampus and cortex of septic mice, primarily found in neurons. Post-CLP surgical administration of rhMANF led to numerous favorable outcomes. Specifically, rhMANF therapy mitigated sepsis-induced behavioral deviations and cognitive impairments, as gauged by SHIRPA scores and Morris water maze tests, and enhanced survival rates in septic mice. These enhancements were concomitant with alterations in neuroinflammation and synaptic integrity. The rhMANF treatment attenuated activation of microglia and astrocytes in the hippocampus and cortex, as evidenced by diminished Iba-1 and GFAP positive cells. It also curtailed the generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-6, and obstructed the p38 MAPK inflammatory pathway. Moreover, rhMANF sustained the expression of synaptic proteins PSD95 and SYN, and conserved neuronal integrity, as demonstrated by Nissl staining. In conclusion, our study underscores the potential of MANF as an innovative therapeutic target for SAE, emphasizing its anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective capabilities.

AB  - Camellia oil (CO) is a high medicinal and nutritional value edible oil. However, its ability to alleviate fat accumulation in high-fat Caenorhabditis elegans has not been well elucidated. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effect of CO on fat accumulation in high-fat C. elegans via transcriptome and metabolome analysis. The results showed that CO significantly reduced fat accumulation in high-fat C. elegans by 10.34% (Oil Red O method) and 11.54% (TG content method), respectively. Furthermore, CO primarily altered the transcription levels of genes involved in longevity regulating pathway. Specifically, CO decreased lipid storage in high-fat C. elegans by inhibiting fat synthesis. In addition, CO supplementation modulated the abundance of metabolic biomarkers related to pyrimidine metabolism and riboflavin metabolism. The integrated transcriptome and metabolome analyses indicated that CO supplementation could alleviate fat accumulation in high-fat C. elegans by regulating retinol metabolism, drug metabolism-cytochrome P450, metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450, ascorbate and aldarate metabolism, and pentose and glucuronate interconversions. Overall, these findings highlight the potential health benefits of CO that could potentially be used as a functional edible oil.

AB  - Fibromyalgia is a chronic condition characterized by persistent widespread pain that significantly reduces quality of life in patients. The purinergic P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) seems to be involved in different pain states and neuroinflammation. The purpose of this study is to investigate the positive effects of P2X7R inhibition by the antagonist Brilliant Blue G (BBG) in a rat model of reserpine-induced fibromyalgia. Sprague-Dawley male rats were injected with 1 mg/kg of reserpine for three consecutive days. Later, animals were administered BBG (50 mg/kg) intraperitoneally for seven days. Reserpine injections induced a significant increase in pain pro-inflammatory mediators as well as a significant increase in neuroinflammation. Chronic pain, in turn, led to depressive-like symptoms and reduced neurogenesis. Blockage of P2X7R by BBG administrations is able to attenuate the behavioral deficits, pain mediators and microglial activation induced by reserpine injection. Additionally, BBG prevents NLRP3 inflammasome activation and consequently the release of active interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-18, involved in the activation of nociceptors. In conclusion, these results suggest that inhibition of P2X7R should be further investigated to develop a potential approach for the management of fibromyalgia.

AB  - Fear overgeneralization is widely accepted as a pathogenic marker of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Recently, GABAergic interneurons have been regarded as key players in the regulation of fear memory. The role of hippocampal GABAergic interneurons in contextual fear generalization of PTSD remains incompletely understood. In the present study, we established a rat model of PTSD with inescapable foot shocks (IFS) and observed the loss of GABAergic interneuron phenotype in the hippocampal cornu ammonis-1 (CA1) subfield. To determine whether the loss of GABAergic interneuron phenotype was associated with fear generalization in PTSD rats, we used adeno-associated virus (AAV) to reduce the expression of GAD67 in CA1 and observed its effect on fear generalization. The results showed that the reduction of GAD67 in CA1 enhanced contextual fear generalization in rats. We investigated whether the PERK pathway was involved in the GABAergic interneuron injury. Increased expression of p-PERK, CHOP, and Caspase12 in GABAergic interneurons of PTSD rats was observed. Then, we used salubrinal, an endoplasmic reticulum stress inhibitor, to modulate the PERK pathway. The salubrinal treatment significantly protected the GABAergic interneurons and relieved fear generalization in PTSD rats. In addition, the results showed that salubrinal down-regulated the expression of CHOP and Caspase12 in GABAergic interneurons of PTSD rats. In conclusion, this study provided evidence that the loss of GABAergic interneuron phenotype in CA1 may contribute to contextual fear generalization in PTSD. The PERK pathway is involved in the GABAergic interneuron injury of PTSD rats and modulating it can protect GABAergic interneurons and constrain contextual fear generalization.

AB  - Background: Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is high in women of childbearing age with obvious premenstrual irritability. However, reliable animal models are still lacking. Materials and Methods: PMDD rat model of premenstrual irritability was induced by the resident-intruder paradigm (RIP). Behavioral characteristics were determined by the aggressive behavior test, elevated plus maze, open-field test, and breast width measurement. The estrous cycle in rats was artificially manipulated by bilateral ovariectomy and exogenous hormone injection to verify the model phenotype's dependence on the estrous cycle. Fluoxetine and Baixiangdan capsules were administered by gavage to determine the symptom improvement effect of PMDD irritability. Biomarkers in serum and brain were detected using ELISA, and GABRA4 was detected in the brain by RT-PCR and Western blot. Results: Rat models demonstrated similar clinical characteristics as PMDD, such as premenstrual irritability and anxiety, and the above symptoms were estrous cycle-dependent. In addition, the levels of progesterone (P) and ALLO hormones decreased in the serum, hippocampus, amygdala, and frontal lobe in the NR phase. The contents of 5-HT in the brain were significantly increased, while NE and GABA contents were considerably reduced. Moreover, mRNA and protein expression of GABRA4 levels in model rats' amygdala, hippocampus, and frontal lobe were significantly increased, while drug intervention downregulated its expression in these tissues. Conclusion: Premenstrual irritability rat model of PMDD demonstrates a behavioral phenotype consistent with the clinical symptoms of PMDD and micro index. The increased levels of 5-HT, NE, and expression of GABRA4, as well as the decrease of GABA, P, and ALLO levels, may be critical biomarkers of the abnormal changes that occur during the pathogenesis of PMDD.

AB  - Background: Though early brain injury (EBI) is the primary cause of poor outcomes among patients with sub-arachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), its exact molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Improved the understanding of how transient receptor potential melastatin-related 2 (TRPM2) is involved in SAH-induced EBI will help develop novel interventions. Methods: Wild type (WT) male C57BL/6J mice were subjected to SAH for 12 h, 24 h or 48 h, after which neurological scores and pathological changes in the hippocampus (CA3, DG, and CA1) and temporal base cortex were observed. Expressions of TRPM2, Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), and Beclin-1 in hippocampus (CA3, DG, and CA1) and temporal base cortex were compared across post-SAH time-points. TRPM2-deficient (TRPM2(-/-)) male C57BL/6 J mice and a CaMKII inhibitor (KN-93) were used to analyze the effects oTRPM2 on the CaMKII-Beclin-1 signaling post SAH. Results: Neurological and temporal base cortex deterioration were more severe with increased time post-SAH induction, whereas hippocampal damage was not observed. Post-SAH, TRPM2-CaMKII-Beclin-1 cascade was activated in the temporal base cortex, but not the hippocampus. Using TRPM2(-/-) mice and KN-93 administration, SAH-induced EBI was improved, and CaMKII and Beclin-1 expressions in the temporal base cortex were significantly decreased compared with WT mice. TRPM2(-/-) mice also showed better neurological improvement compared with KN-93 treated mice. Conclusion: TRPM2 mediates CaMKII-Beclin-1 signaling that aggravates SAH-induced EBI in the temporal base cortex. TRPM2 may be an alternative therapy target in EBI after SAH.

AB  - Social isolation stress (SIS) is associated with affective disorders (i.e., anxiety and depression) in adults. In a preclinical study, we aimed to investigate the effects of resveratrol (RV) on the mood swings of rats exposed to SIS. Animals were randomized into six different groups, including control: healthy animals received normal saline (NS) as a vehicle; SIS + NS: SIS animals received NS; SIS + FL: SIS animals received fluoxetine (10 mg/kg/i.p.); SIS + RV20, SIS + RV40, and SIS + RV80: SIS animals received RV (20, 40, and 80 mg/kg/i.p). SIS was induced for 4 weeks, then animals were treated with NS, FL, and RV for 4 weeks. Rats were evaluated by the behavioral tests, including the elevated plus-maze, tail suspension test, the open field test, and forced-swimming test, for mood alterations and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) levels, along with NLRP3, apoptosis-associated speck-like (ASC), and proCaspase-1 were determined in the hippocampus. Behavioral tests confirmed that exposing the animals to SIS caused anxiety and depression. The highest concentrations of NLRP3, proCaspase-1, ASC, and NF-kappa B, were confirmed in the SIS + NS group. Compared to FL, RV showed antidepressant potential according to the behavioral tests. In particular, the administration of RV (20, 40, and 80 mg/kg) revered the NF-kappa B/NLRP3 axis cascade in rats exposed to chronic SIS. Our findings revealed that RV attenuated anxiety and depression of SIS-exposed rats via regulation of NF-kappa B/NLRP3 signaling pathways. RV can be used as a potential anxiolytic agent and antidepressant.

AB  - There are no approved symptomatic treatments for vascular dementia (VaD). Rapamycin (RAPA) improves cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease rats. To explore whether RAPA improves cognitive impairment after VaD and its possible molecular mechanisms. Thirty Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups: sham (received sham-operation), VaD model (received permanent ligation of bilateral carotid arteries) and RAPA (7.5 mg/kg) treatment. Cognitive function was evaluated by Morris water maze test. Neuronal apoptosis was evaluated by TUNEL staining. Mitophagy was assessed by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), ATP level, transmission electron microscope and mitophagy-associated proteins. Proteins were quantified by Western blot and immunofluorescence. BV2 cells were exposed to RAPA or/and MHY1485 (mTOR activator) to verify in vivo results. Compared to VaD rats, the escape latency of RAPA-treated rats was significantly decreased, and time spent in target quadrant was longer. Pathologic changes, mitochondrial dysfunction, increase of neuronal apoptosis and related proteins in VaD rats were remarkably alleviated by RAPA. After RAPA treatment, an increase in number of autophagosomes was observed, along with up-regulation of mitophagy-related proteins. Overexpression of PI3K, AKT and mTOR were suppressed by RAPA treatment. In vitro experiments confirmed effects of RAPA, and demonstrated that MHY1485 addition reversed the RAPA-caused apoptosis inhibition and mitophagy enhancement. Overall, RAPA improved the cognitive impairment of VaD rats, alleviated neuronal injury and mitochondrial dysfunction. We proposed a potential mechanism that RAPA may play improving role by inhibiting neuronal apoptosis and enhancing mitophagy through PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Findings provided an exciting possibility for novel treatment strategy of VaD.

AB  - In the present study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory and anti-melanogenic effects of Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. DB-21-derived exosomes (DB-21 exosomes), isolated from Camellia japonica flower in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW 264.7 macrophage cells and melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH)-induced B16F10 melanoma cells. We confirmed that DB-21 exosomes were not toxic to LPS-induced RAW 264.7 macrophage cells and alpha-MSH-induced B16F10 melanoma cells. Moreover, we confirmed that DB-21 exosomes inhibit the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, PGE2, and the expression of inflammatory factors iNOS and COX-2. We also found that DB-21 exosomes have a concentration-dependent ability to inhibit melanin, TRP-1, TRP-2, tyrosinase, and MITF, which are factors involved in melanogenesis. Additionally, it inhibits the phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3 beta, and MAP kinase pathway proteins such as ERK, JNK, and p38. We confirmed that DB-21 exosomes inhibit melanin synthesis in B16F10 cells through various pathways, and based on previous results, they may be used as a functional cosmetic material with anti-inflammatory and anti-melanogenic activities.

AB  - High-fat diet (HFD) has been associated with neuroinflammation and apoptosis in distinct brain regions. To explore the effect of short-term (7, 14 and 21 days) high-fat overfeeding on apoptosis, inflammatory signaling proteins, APP changes and glial cell activities in cerebral cortex and cerebellum. Mice were fed with HFD for different lengths (up to 21 days) and after each time body weights of mice was tested, then the apoptotic proteins, IL-1 beta, APP, BACE1 and MAPKs, Akt and NF-kappa B signaling activity were evaluated by western blots. Results demonstrate that short period of high-fat overnutrition significantly promotes apoptosis, APP expression at day 21 of cerebral cortex and at day 7 of cerebellum compared to chow diet. In addition, increased GFAP(+)astrocytes, Iba-1(+)microglia and IL-1 beta 30 were observed in cerebral cortex after 21 days HFD, but no changes for 7 days overfeeding of cerebellum. Serendipitously, ERK1/2 pathway was activated both in cerebral cortex and cerebellum for different time course of HFD. Furthermore, increased phospho-p38 MAPK level was observed in cerebellum only. In consistent with in vivo results, SH-SY5Y cells treatment with cholesterol (50 mu M, 100 mu M) for 48 h culture in vitro demonstrated that pro-apoptotic proteins were enhanced as well. In brief, short-term HFD consumption increases sensitivity to apoptosis, APP and IL-1 beta production as well as gliosis in cerebral cortex and cerebellum, which may be related to enhancement of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK activation.

AB  - The present study was conducted in two breeding seasons to compare the effect of two non-surgical techniques for embryo deposition intrauterine, trans-vaginal (TV) versus recto-vaginal (RV) techniques, on the pregnancy rate and early pregnancy loss (EPL) in dromedary camels. Embryos were collected from 70 donors and transferred to 210 recipients by TV (n = 256 transfers) or RV technique (n = 186 transfers). Pregnancy diagnosis was conducted on Day 10 after embryo transfer (ET) by using the progesterone-ELISA test and by trans-rectal ultrasonography at Day 60 of gestation. EPL was calculated as the re-cipients that were diagnosed pregnant on Day 10 post-ET and lost their pregnancy between Days 20-60 of their gestation. Using the RV technique in ET of a single embryo showed higher pregnancy rates at Day 19, especially with the embryos of folded, semi-transparent shapes, or those collected after superovu-lation with the recovery of >4 embryos per flush. While, the pregnancy rates at 60 days showed increases after ET with the RV technique of single, folded, transparent, and semi-transparent, medium-size em-bryos and/or those collected after superovulation with any number of the recovered embryos than those transferred by the TV technique. The rate of EPL was increased when the TV technique was used for ET of single, spherical, folded, semi-transparent, medium-sized embryos and those collected without or with the superovulation and recovery of >4 embryos per flush. In conclusion, using the RV technique to deposit the embryos intrauterine improves the pregnancy rate and reduces EPL compared to the TV technique.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Backpropagation has been regarded as the most favorable algorithm for training artificial neural networks. However, it has been criticized for its biological implausibility because its learning mechanism contradicts the human brain. Although backpropagation has achieved super-human performance in various machine learning applications, it often shows limited performance in specific tasks. We collectively referred to such tasks as machine-challenging tasks (MCTs) and aimed to investigate methods to enhance machine learning for MCTs. Specifically, we start with a natural question: Can a learning mechanism that mimics the human brain lead to the improvement of MCT performances? We hypothesized that a learning mechanism replicating the human brain is effective for tasks where machine intelligence is difficult. Multiple experiments corresponding to specific types of MCTs where machine intelligence has room to improve performance were performed using predictive coding, a more biologically plausible learning algorithm than backpropagation. This study regarded incremental learning, long-tailed, and few-shot recognition as representative MCTs. With extensive experiments, we examined the effectiveness of predictive coding that robustly outperformed backpropagation-trained networks for the MCTs. We demonstrated that predictive coding-based incremental learning alleviates the effect of catastrophic forgetting. Next, predictive coding-based learning mitigates the classification bias in long-tailed recognition. Finally, we verified that the network trained with predictive coding could correctly predict corresponding targets with few samples. We analyzed the experimental result by drawing analogies between the properties of predictive coding networks and those of the human brain and discussing the potential of predictive coding networks in general machine learning.

AB  - Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a public health problem and a risk of developing cardiometabolic and neurode-generative diseases. The biochemical-inflammatory impairment in brain areas related to learning and memory has not been differentiated between MetS models. We aimed to compare the effect of the MetS generated by consuming high-fat (HFD) or-carbohydrate diets (HCD) on the hippocampus and frontal cortex, related to astrocyte-neuron metabolism and neuroinflammation origin. Sixty male Wistar rats were separated into three groups: 1) control group, 2) HCD group, and 3) HFD group. After 3 months, we evaluated zoometry, a serum bioclinical profile, and in the hippocampus and frontal cortex, we performed biochemical assays (concentration of lactate, glutamate, fatty acids, and ASAT, ALAT, and LDH activity), immunoreactivity tests (GFAP, COX2, CD36, and BDNF), and immunoassays (TNF-alpha, IL-1(i, IL-6, and PGE2). The bioclinical parameters showed that both diets induce MetS. At the brain level, it is noteworthy that the HCD group had an increase in lactate and glutamate concentration, reactive astrogliosis, immunoreactive COX2 neurons in the CA1 subfield hippocampus and frontal cortex, and high levels of PGE2, TNF-alpha, IL-1(i, and IL-6, and low BDNF immunoreactivity. Meanwhile, the HFD is highlighted by increased fatty acid levels and CD36 expression in the hippocampus and frontal cortex, strong reactive astrogliosis and COX2 immunoreactivity, and the greatest inflammation with the lowest BDNF immunoreactivity. In conclusion, MetS induction by an HFD or HCD generates different biochemical, cellular, and inflammatory patterns in the hippocampus and frontal cortex.

AB  - Depression is one of the most common neuropsychiatric disorders that is characterized by low mood, lack of motivation, slow thinking, and recurrent suicidal thoughts. The mechanism of action of palmatine in depression has been rarely reported and remains unclear. The present study examined the neuroprotective effects of palmatine on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced oxidative stress, apoptosis, and depression-like behavior. In this study, cell apoptosis was evaluated by CCK-8, flow cytometry, and Hoechst 33258 staining in LPS-induced HT-22 cells. Meanwhile, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial membrane potential were detected in vitro. In vivo, we investigated depressive-like behaviors in mice by an open field test (OFT) and elevated plus-maze test (EPM). Additionally, the levels of superoxide dismutases (SOD), TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-6 were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The hematoxylin-eosin staining and TUNEL staining were used to evaluate the pathology of the hippocampus. The expression of Nrf2/HO-1 and BAX/Bcl-2 pathways in the hippocampus were assessed by Western blot analysis. Palmatine could significantly reduce apoptosis and ROS levels, and improve mitochondrial damage. Moreover, palmatine significantly improves movement time and central square crossing time in OFT, and improves open arms and movement time in EMP. And the levels of SOD, TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-6 were significantly decreased after palmatine treatment. More importantly, palmatine improved neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampus, and depression through BAX/Bcl-2 and Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathways. We provide evidence that palmatine further alleviates the depressive-like behavior of LPS-induced by improving apoptosis and oxidative stress.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative pathology responsible for 70% of dementia cases worldwide. Despite its relevance, the few drugs available for the treatment of this disease offer only symptomatic relief, with limited efficacy and serious adverse effects. The most accepted hypothesis about the pathogenesis involves the aggregation and deposition of beta-amyloid peptides, mainly in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, through the catalytic action of beta-secretase 1 (BACE-1), making this enzyme a promising target for the development of new drugs. In order to prioritize candidates for BACE-1 inhibitors, a hierarchical virtual screening by pharmacophore model and molecular docking was performed against the 216,833 molecules contained in several databases. Our previously built pharmacophore model was used for the first filtering step, which resulted in the selection of 399 molecules. The remaining molecules were filtered through molecular docking with GOLD 5.4.0. In this step, molecules with scoring values greater than the mean plus standard deviation were evaluated for commercial availability and absence of asymmetric centers. Four molecules were selected and evaluated for mutagenic potential by the AMES test with the help of the pkCSM server. Finally, they were tested against the descriptors on Lipinski and Veber rules, and ZINC01589617 (QFIT = 56.52/Score = 44.95) satisfied all requirements, being subjected to molecular dynamics simulations (t = 100 ns) in order to obtain robust data on the mode of bonding and profile of intermolecular interactions. Those in silico strategies demonstrated that ZINC01589617 is a potential candidate for biological tests. Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma

AB  - Akt signaling has been associated with adult neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG). We reported cognitive dysfunction in Akt3 knockout (Akt3-KO) mice with the down-regulation of mTOR activation. However, little is known about the effects of Akt3 signaling on hippocampal neurogenesis. Herein, we show that progenitor cells, neuroblasts, and mature newborn neurons in hippocampal DG expressed Akt3 protein. The Akt3 phosphorylation in hippocampal DG was increased after voluntary wheel running for 7 days in wild-type mice (running WT mice), but not in Akt3-KO mice (running Akt3-KO mice). Subsequently, we observed that the proliferation of progenitor cells was suppressed in Akt3-KO mice and the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin-treated mice, whereas enhanced in running WT mice rather than running Akt3-KO mice. Neurite growth of neuroblasts was impaired in Akt3-KO mice and rapamycin-treated mice. In contrast, neither differentiation of progenitor cells nor migrating of newly generated neurons was altered in Akt3-KO mice or running WT mice. The levels of p70S6K and 4EBP1 phosphorylation were declined in Akt3-KO mice and elevated in running WT mice depending on mTOR activation. Furthermore, telomerase activity, telomere length, and expression of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) were decreased in Akt3-KO mice but increased in running WT mice rather than running Akt3-KO mice, which required the mTOR activation. The study provides in vivo evidence that Akt3-mTOR signaling plays an important role in the proliferation of progenitor cells and neurite growth through positive regulated TERT expression and activation of p70S6K and 4EBP1.

AB  - The greatest risk factor for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) is increasing age. Understanding the changes that occur in aging that make an aged brain more susceptible to developing AD could result in novel therapeutic targets. In order to better understand these changes, the current study utilized mice harboring a regulatable mutant P301L human tau transgene (rTg(TauP301L)4510), in which P301L tau expression can be turned off or on by the addition or removal of doxycycline in the drinking water. This regulatable expression allowed for assessment of aging independent of prolonged mutant tau expression. Our results suggest that P301L expression in aged mice enhances memory deficits in the Morris water maze task. These behavioral changes may be due to enhanced late-stage tau pathology, as evidenced by immunoblotting and exacerbated hippocampal dysregulation of glutamate release and uptake measured by the microelectrode array technique. We additionally observed changes in proteins important for the regulation of glutamate and tau phosphorylation that may mediate these age-related changes. Thus, age and P301L tau interact to exacerbate tau-induced detrimental alterations in aged animals.

AB  - The primary cilium is a specialized microtubule-based sensory organelle that extends from the cell body of nearly all cell types. Neuronal primary cilia, which have their own unique signaling repertoire, are crucial for neuronal integrity and the maintenance of neuronal connectivity throughout adulthood. Dysfunction of cilia structure and ciliary signaling is associated with a variety of genetic syndromes, termed ciliopathies. One of the characteristic features of human ciliopathies is impairment of memory and cognition, which is also observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid fi peptide (Afi) is produced through the proteolytic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP), and Afi accumulation in the brain is proposed to be an early toxic event in the pathogenesis of AD. To evaluate the effect of increased Afi level on primary cilia, we assessed ciliary dynamics in hippocampal neurons in an APP knock-in AD model (AppNL-G-F mice) compared to that in wild-type mice. Neuronal cilia length in the CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus (DG) of wild-type mice increased significantly with age. In AppNL-G-F mice, such elongation was detected in the DG but not in the CA1 and CA3, where more Afi accumulation was observed. We further demonstrated that Afi1-42 treatment decreased cilia length both in hTERT-RPE1 cells and dissociated rat hippocampal neurons. There is growing evidence that reduced cilia length is associated with perturbations of synaptic connectivity and dendrite complexity. Thus, our observations raise the important possibility that structural alterations in neuronal cilia might have a role in AD development. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background. Acute pancreatitis (AP) is one of the most common gastrointestinal disorders, which causes death with a high mortality rate of about 30%. The study aims to identify whether the nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)-derived lncRNA MALAT1 participates in the inflammation of pancreatic cell and its potential mechanism. Methods. The NAFLD cell model was constructed by treating HepG2 cells with FFA. The in vitro model of acute pancreatitis (AP) was established by the administration of caerulein on AR42J cells. MALAT1 and si-MALAT1 were transfected into pancreatic cells, and then exosomes were collected from the NAFLD cell model and then were cocultured with AR42J cells. Transmission electron microscopy was used to observe the morphology of exosomes. Oil Red O staining was applied to reveal the lipid deposition. The triglyceride, IL-6, and TNF-alpha levels were detected using ELISA. The MALAT1 level in exosomes was detected by qRT-PCR. The CD9, CD63, CD81, and CYP2E1, LC3II, and LC3I levels were detected by western blot. Results. MALAT1 was upregulated in NAFLD-derived exosomes and increased the levels of IL-6 and TNF-alpha in pancreatic cells. NAFLD-derived exosomes inhibited YAP phosphorylation, decreased the levels of IL-6 and TNF-alpha, and reduced the ratio of LC3II/LC3I protein in pancreatic cells. Silencing MALAT1 significantly returned the inhibitory effect of NAFLD on hippo-YAP pathway. YAP1 signal transduction inhibitor CA3 reversed the decrease of LC3II/LC3I expression and the increase of IL-6 and TNF-alpha levels induced by MALAT1 in the AP cell model. Conclusions. NAFLD-derived MALAT1 exacerbates pancreatic cell inflammation via inhibiting autophagy by upregulating YAP.

AB  - In the adult brain, Wnt signaling is crucial for neurogenesis, and it also regulates neuronal development, neuronal maturation, neuronal differential, and proliferation. Impaired Wnt signaling pathways are associated with enhanced levels of amyloid-beta, reduced beta-catenin levels, and increased expression of GSK-3 beta enzyme, suggesting its direct association with the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disorder (AD). These findings are consolidated by reports where activation of Wnt signaling by genetic factors and pharmacological intervention has improved the cognitive functions in animals and restored neurogenesis in the adult brain. Various natural and synthetic molecules have been identified that modulate Wnt signaling in the adult brain and promote neurogenesis and alleviate behavioral dysfunction. These molecules include lithium, valproic acid, ethosuximide, selenomethionine, curcumin, andrographolide, xanthoceraside, huperzine A, pyridostigmine, ginkgolide-B, ricinine, cannabidiol, and resveratrol. These molecules are associated with the DKK1 and GSK-3 beta inhibition and beta-catenin stabilization along with their effects on neurogenesis, neuronal proliferation, and differentiation in the hippocampus through modulation of Wnt signaling and thereby could prove beneficial in the management of AD pathogenesis. Although modulation of the Wnt signaling seems to suggest to be promising in the management of AD, unfortunately, most of the literature available for the association of Wnt signaling and AD pathogenesis is either from preclinical studies or post-mortem brain. Therefore, it will be interesting to understand the role of Wnt signaling in AD patients, and a rigorous investigation could provide us with a better understanding of AD pathogenesis and the identification of novel targets for therapeutic interventions.

AB  - Meranzin hydrate (MH) is a frequently used antidepressant drug in China; however it underlying mechanism remains unknown. In this study, we aimed to explore whether MH could ameliorate depression-like behavior in rats by regulating the competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network. We developed a depression-like rat model using an unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) protocol, and the differentially expressed lncRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs were identified between the model group and MH group. Then, a ceRNA network responding to MH treatment was constructed by their corresponding relationships in the databases. Finally, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses were conducted to explore molecular mechanisms associated with MH treatment. The study indicated that rats in the model group showed loss of weight and deteriorated behavior in behavior tests compared with rats in the normal group. A total of 826 lncRNAs, 121 miRNAs, and 954 mRNAs were differentially expressed in the hippocampus of UCMS rats after MH treatment. In addition, 13 miRNAs were selected, and 12 of them were validated in the hippocampus by qRT-PCR. Then, we predicted upstream lncRNAs and downstream mRNAs of the validated miRNAs and interacted with the results of microarrays. Eventually, a lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory network, responding to MH treatment, was constructed based on the 314 lncRNAs, 11 miRNAs, and 221 mRNAs. KEGG pathways suggested that these genes may be highly related to Wnt signaling, axon guidance, and MAPK signaling pathways. All these results suggest that MH may be a potential representative compound for the treatment of depression, and its mechanism of action is related to the ceRNA modification.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is by far the most common cause of cognitive impairment in older adults. Current treatments are entirely focused on the symptoms of AD. A complex etiology for AD has been proposed recently, in which AD leads in elevated levels of inflammation. We previously studied digoxin's involvement in the sporadic-AD intracerebroventricular (ICV)-streptozotocin (STZ) animal model due to its anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective characteristics. 18 adult sprague-dawley rats were split into three groups: control (n = 6), STZ + Saline (n = 6), and STZ + Digoxin (n = 6). Twelve AD-induced rats were split into two groups using stereotaxy five days after STZ injection (3 mg/kg) into both lateral ventricles: one group got digoxin (0.1 mg/kg/day, i.p.) for three weeks, while the other group received saline. Following treatment, each subject was subjected to a passive avoidance learning (PAL) test, followed by brain tissue harvesting. The levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and choline acetyl transferase (ChAT) were measured in the brain, and neurons were counted using Cresyl violet staining in cornu ammonis-1 (CA1) and cornu ammonis-3 (CA3) cornu ammonis (CA3). ICV-STZ significantly shortened PAL latency, increased brain TNF-alpha levels, decreased brain ChAT activity, and decreased hippocampus neuron number. On the other hand, digoxin significantly reduced all of these STZ-induced deleterious effects. Digoxin significantly rescued rats from memory loss caused by ICV-STZ by decreasing hippocampal cell death, neuroinflammation, and cholinergic deficiency. These findings suggest that digoxin may be beneficial in treating cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - The present study aimed to determine the effect of 3',4'-dihydroxyflavonol (DiOHF) on apoptosis in the cerebellum and hippocampus in rats with ischemia-reperfusion. A total of 38 Wistar albino male rats were used. Experimental groups were designed as Group 1-Sham; Group 2-Ischemia-reperfusion (IR), in which animals were anesthetized and carotid arteries ligated for 30 minutes (ischemia) and reperfused 30 minutes; Group 3- IR + DiOHF (10 mg/kg); Group 4- Ischemia + DiOHF (10 mg/kg) + reperfusion; Group 5-DiOHF + IR. DiOHF was supplemented as 10 mg/kg by intraperitoneal injection 30 minutes before IR. Following application, the animals were sacrificed under general anesthetic by cervical dislocation, and the cerebellum and hippocampus tissues were analyzed for apoptosis. IR significantly increased hippocampus and cerebellum apoptosis activity, confirmed by Hematoxylin-Eosin, TUNEL labeling, and Caspase-8 activity. However, these values were significantly suppressed by the administration of DiOHF, especially when used before the ischemia and reperfusion. The results of the study show that increased apoptosis in the cerebellum and hippocampus tissue was inhibited by intraperitoneal DiOHF supplementation.

AB  - Strict metabolic regulation in discrete brain regions leads to neurochemical changes in cerebral ischemia. Accumulation of extracellular glutamate is one of the early neurochemical changes that take place during cerebral ischemia. Understanding the sequential neurochemical processes involved in cerebral ischemia-mediated excitotoxicity before the clinical intervention of revascularization and reperfusion may greatly influence future therapeutic strategies for clinical stroke recovery. This study investigated the influence of time and brain regions on excitatory neurochemical indices in the bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO) model of global ischemia. Male Wistar rats were subjected to BCCAO for 15 and 60 min to evaluate the effect of ischemia duration on excitatory neurochemical indices (dopamine level, glutamine synthetase, glutaminase, glutamate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, monoamine oxidase, acetylcholinesterase, and Na+ K+ ATPase activities) in the discrete brain regions (cortex, striatum, cerebellum, and hippocampus). BCCAO without reperfusion caused marked time and brain region-dependent alterations in glutamatergic, glutaminergic, dopaminergic, monoaminergic, cholinergic, and electrogenic homeostasis. Prolonged BCCAO decreased cortical, striatal, and cerebellar glutamatergic, glutaminergic, dopaminergic, cholinergic, and electrogenic activities; increased hippocampal glutamatergic, glutaminergic, dopaminergic, and cholinergic activities, increased cortical and striatal monoaminergic activity; decreased cerebellar and hippocampal monoaminergic activity; and decreased hippocampal electrogenic activity. This suggests that excitatory neurotransmitters play a major role in the tissue-specific metabolic plasticity and reprogramming that takes place between the onset of cardiac arrest-mediated global ischemia and clinical intervention of recanalization. These tissue-specific neurochemical indices may serve as diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for mitigating the progression of ischemic damage before revascularization.

AB  - During the establishment of neuronal circuits, axons and dendrites grow and branch to establish specific synaptic connections. This complex process is highly regulated by positive and negative extracellular cues guiding the axons and dendrites. Our group was pioneer in describing that one of these signals are the extracellular purines. We found that extracellular ATP, through its selective ionotropic P2X7 receptor (P2X7R), negatively regulates axonal growth and branching. Here, we evaluate if other purinergic compounds, such as the diadenosine pentaphosphate (Ap(5)A), may module the dynamics of dendritic or axonal growth and branching in cultured hippocampal neurons. Our results show that Ap(5)A negatively modulates the dendrite's growth and number by inducing transient intracellular calcium increases in the dendrites' growth cone. Interestingly, phenol red, commonly used as a pH indicator in culture media, also blocks the P2X1 receptors, avoided the negative modulation of Ap(5)A on dendrites. Subsequent pharmacological studies using a battery of selective P2X1R antagonists confirmed the involvement of this subunit. In agreement with pharmacological studies, P2X1R overexpression caused a similar reduction in dendritic length and number as that induced by Ap(5)A. This effect was reverted when neurons were co-transfected with the vector expressing the interference RNA for P2X1R. Despite small hairpin RNAs reverting the reduction in the number of dendrites caused by Ap(5)A, it did not avoid the dendritic length decrease induced by the polyphosphate, suggesting, therefore, the involvement of a heteromeric P2X receptor. Our results are indicating that Ap(5)A exerts a negative influence on dendritic growth.

AB  - Tri(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl)phosphate (TDCPP) is one of the most widely used organophosphorus flame retardants in consumer products. TDCPP has been confirmed to be neurotoxic, but its mechanism has not been clarified and may be related to mitophagy. AMBRA1 can promote neurological autophagy, but whether AMBRA1 is involved in the mechanism of TDCPP-induced neurotoxicity has not been elucidated. In this study, the optimal neuronal damage model was established by exposing mice hippocampal neurons to TDCPP. Furthermore, on the basis of this model, siRNA was used to knock down AMBRA1. Combined with qRT-PCR and Western blot techniques, we identified AMBRA1-mediated mitophagy-induced neuronal damage in vitro mechanism. The experimental results indicated that TDCPP treatment for 24 h led to a decrease in the cell viability of mouse hippocampal neurons, causing neuronal damage. Meanwhile, TDCPP exposure increased autophagy marker proteins p62 and LC3B, and down-regulated mitochondrial DNA ND1 damage and TOMM20 protein, suggesting that TDCPP exposure promoted mitophagy. In addition, TDCPP exposure led to changes in the expression of AMBRA1 and the key factors of mitophagy, FUNDC1, PINK1, and PARKIN, whereas mitophagy was inhibited after knockdown of AMBRA1. The research results indicated that exposure to TDCPP induced neuronal damage and promoted mitophagy. The mechanism may be that AMBRA1 promoted mitophagy in neuronal cells through the PARKIN-dependent/non-dependent pathway. This study revealed the toxic effects of TDCPP on the nervous system and its potential molecular mechanisms, which provided important clues for further understanding the mechanism of action of AMBAR1-mediated mitophagy.

AB  - Past assassinations and terrorist attacks demonstrate the need for a more effective antidote against nerve agents and other organophosphates (OP) that cause brain damage through inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Our lab has invented a platform of phenoxyalkyl pyridinium oximes (US patent 9,277,937) that demonstrate the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier in in vivo rat tests with a sarin surrogate nitrophenyl isopropyl methylphosphonate (NIMP) and provide evidence of brain penetration by reducing cessation time of seizure-like behaviors, accumulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and hippocampal neuropathology, as opposed to the currently approved oxime, 2-pyridine aldoxime methyl chloride (2-PAM). Using two of the novel oximes (Oximes 1 and 20), this project examined whether gene expression changes might help explain this protection. Expression changes in the piriform cortex were examined using polymerase chain reaction arrays for inflammatory cytokines and receptors. The hippocampus was examined via quantitative polymerase chain reaction for the expression of immediate-early genes involved in brain repair (Bdnf), increasing neurotoxicity (Fos), and apoptosis control (Jdp2, Bcl2l1, Bcl2l11). In the piriform cortex, NIMP significantly stimulated expression for the macrophage inflammatory proteins CCL4, IL-1A, and IL-1B. Oxime 20 by itself elicited the most changes. When it was given therapeutically post-NIMP, the largest change occurred: a 310-fold repression of the inflammatory cytokine, CCL12. In the hippocampus, NIMP increased the expression of the neurotoxicity marker Fos and decreased the expression of neuroprotective Bdnf and antiapoptotic Bcl2l1. Compared with 2-PAM, Oxime 20 stimulated Bcl2l1 expression more and returned expression closer to the vehicle control values.

AB  - Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a prevalent complication following major surgery, particularly in older adults, and is associated with increased morbidity, prolonged hospitalization, and reduced quality of life. Although blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption has been implicated in POCD pathogenesis, the molecular mechanisms remain poorly defined. In this study, we identify Caveolin-1 (Cav-1), a membrane scaffolding protein highly expressed in endothelial cells (ECs), as a key regulator of BBB integrity and cognitive function following surgical trauma. Using a tibial fracture internal fixation model in mice, we observed a significant upregulation of Cav-1 in the hippocampus, accompanied by reduced expression of tight junctions (TJs) proteins (Claudin-5 and ZO-1), increased BBB permeability, and impaired performance in behavioral assays indicative of cognitive decline. Pharmacological inhibition of Cav-1 via methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (M beta CD) attenuated these effects, restoring TJs expression, reducing BBB leakage, and improving cognitive outcomes. To elucidate the underlying mechanism, we employed an in vitro inflammation model using LPS-stimulated brain microvascular ECs. Cav-1 upregulation was found to increase the expression of matrix metalloproteinases MMP2 and MMP9, which in turn degraded TJs. Inhibition of Cav-1 suppressed MMP2/9 expression and preserved barrier integrity, confirming a Cav-1/MMP2/9 signaling axis. These findings demonstrate that Cav-1 plays a central role in mediating BBB breakdown and postoperative cognitive impairment via MMP-dependent degradation of TJs. Targeting Cav-1 may offer a novel therapeutic strategy to preserve BBB function and reduce the incidence of POCD in surgical patients.

AB  - Aim: Transplantation of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) has been suggested to be a promising method for treating neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the poor survival rate of transplanted MSCs has limited their therapeutic application. This study aimed to evaluate whether preconditioning MSCs with dimethyl fumarate (DMF), a Nrf2 inducer, could enhance MSC therapeutic efficacy in an amyloid-fi (Afi1_42)-induced AD rat model.Methods: The survival and antioxidant capacity of MSCs treated with DMF were assessed in vitro. Afi1-42 intrahippocampal injection was used to create a rat model of AD. Following the transplantation of MSCs preconditioned with DMF and using the Morris blue maze test, spatial learning and memory were assessed. Using RT-qPCR, we evaluated the gene expression related to apoptosis and neurotrophins in the hippocampus region.Results: Treatment with DMF enhanced cell survival and Nrf2 protein expression in MSCs in vitro. Preconditioning with DMF also enhanced the efficacy of transplanted MSCs in rescuing learning and spatial memory deficits in Afi-AD rats. Besides, DMF preconditioning enhanced the neuroprotective effect of transplanted MSCs in the hippocampus of rats treated with Afi1_42 by decreasing the expression of apoptotic markers (Bax, caspase 3, and cytochrome c), and elevating the expression of the anti-apoptotic marker Bcl2 and neurotrophins, including BDNF and NGF.Conclusion: Preconditioning MSCs with DMF boosted the therapeutic efficacy of these cells; therefore, it could serve as a targeted strategy for increasing the therapeutic efficacy of MSCs in treating neurodegenerative disorders, including AD.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Objective This study was designed to observe different durations of simulated weightlessness induced depressive-like behaviors and the change of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAD in hippocampi of rats, so as to explore its effects and possible mechanism. Methods Weightlessness was simulated by hindlimb suspension by tails (HLS) in rats. The rats were divided into the control and the HLS groups for each respective week (s), i. e., 1, 2, 3, and 4. The depressive-like behaviors in rats were investigated by using the open field test (OFT), novel object recognition test (NORT), forced swim test (FST), followed by hippocampal protein level estimation of SOD and CAT by ELISA. Results The OFT results showed increased stagnation time among HLS rats in each respective group compared to their corresponding control groups (P<0.05, P<0.01). In the NORT, the latency of exploration increased, while the number and the time of exploration decreased in the HLS groups in each week, compared to their corresponding control rats (P<0.05, P<0.01). Similarly, FST displayed enhanced immobility with the reduced climbing rate in HLS rats in each respective week, compared to the normal rats (P<0.05, P<0.01). Simulated weightlessness significantly reduced the SOD and CAT levels in the hippocampi in HLS rats compared to the normal rats (P<0.05, P<0.01). Conclusion Results suggest that short or long weightlessness could induce depressive-like behaviors in rats.

AB  - Stress is a primary risk factor in the onset of neuropsychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD). We have previously used the chronic mild stress (CMS) model of depression in male rats to show that CMS induces morphological, functional, and molecular changes in the hippocampus of vulnerable animals, the majority of which were recovered using acute subanesthetic ketamine in just 24 h. Here, we focused our attention on the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a brain area regulating emotional and cognitive functions, and asked whether vulnerability/resilience to CMS and ketamine antidepressant effects were associated with molecular and functional changes in the mPFC of rats. We found that most alterations induced by CMS in the mPFC were selectively observed in stress-vulnerable animals and were rescued by acute subanesthetic ketamine, while others were found only in resilient animals or were induced by ketamine treatment. Importantly, only a few of these modifications were also previously demonstrated in the hippocampus, while most are specific to mPFC. Overall, our results suggest that acute antidepressant ketamine rescues brain-area-specific glutamatergic changes induced by chronic stress.

AB  - Newborn neurons from the subventricular zone (SVZ) are essential to functional recovery following ischemic stroke. However, the number of newly generated neurons after stroke is far from enough to support a potent recovery. Adiponectin could increase neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of hippocampus in neurodegenerative diseases. However, the effect of adiponectin on the neurogenesis from SVZ and the functional recovery after ischemic stroke was unknown, and the underlying mechanism was not specified either. The middle cerebral artery occlusion model of mice was adopted and adiponectin was administrated once a day from day 3 to 7 of reperfusion. The levels of BDNF and p-STAT3 were detected by western blotting on day 7 of reperfusion. The virus-encoded BDNF shRNA with GFAP promoter and a STAT3 inhibitor Stattic were used, respectively. Neurogenesis was evidenced by the expression of doublecortin and 5-bromo-2MODIFIER LETTER PRIME-deoxyuridine (BrdU) labelling and brain atrophy was revealed by Nissl staining on day 28 of reperfusion. Neurological functional recovery was assessed by the adhesive removal test and the forepaw grip strength. We found that adiponectin increased both the doublecortin-positive cells and NeuN/BrdU double-positive cells around the injured area on day 28 of reperfusion, along with the improved long-term neurological recovery. Mechanistically, adiponectin increased the protein levels of p-STAT3 and BDNF in astrocytes on day 7 of reperfusion, while silencing BDNF diminished the adiponectin-induced neurogenesis and functional recovery. Moreover, inhibition of STAT3 not only prevented the increase of BDNF but also the improved neurogenesis and functional recovery after stroke. In conclusion, adiponectin enhances neurogenesis and functional recovery after ischemic stroke via STAT3/BDNF pathway in astrocytes.

AB  - Background: Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a common clinical complication in elderly patients, but its underlying mechanism remains unclear. Receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1), a key molecule mediating necroptosis and regulated by transforming growth factor ss-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), was reported to be associated with cognitive impairment in several neurodegenerative diseases. This study was conducted to investigate the possible role of TAK1/ RIPK1 signalling in POCD development following surgery in rats. Methods: Young (2-month-old) and old (24-month-old) Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to splenectomy under isoflurane anaesthesia. The young rats were treated with the TAK1 inhibitor takinib or the RIPK1 inhibitor necrostatin-1 (Nec-1) before surgery, and old rats received adeno-associated virus (AAV)-TAK1 before surgery. The open field test and contextual fear conditioning test were conducted on postoperative day 3. The changes in TNF-alpha, pro-IL-1 ss, AP-1, NF-kappa B p65, pRIPK1, pTAK1 and TAK1 expression and astrocyte and microglia activation in the hippocampus were assessed. Results: Old rats had low TAK1 expression and were more susceptible to surgery-induced POCD and neuroinflammation than young rats. TAK1 inhibition exacerbated surgeryinduced pRIPK1 expression, neuroinflammation and cognitive dysfunction in young rats, and this effect was reversed by a RIPK1 inhibitor. Conversely, genetic TAK1 overexpression attenuated surgery-induced pRIPK1 expression, neuroinflammation and cognitive dysfunction in old rats. Conclusion: Ageing-related decreases in TAK1 expression may contribute to surgery-induced RIPK1 overactivation, resulting in neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment in old rats.

AB  - Myocardia-Related Transcription Factors-A (MRTF-A), which is enriched in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, has been shown to have a protective function against ischemia hypoxia-induced neuronal apoptosis. However, the function of MRTF-A on beta-amyloid peptide (A beta)-induced neurotoxicity and autophagy dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease is still unclear. This study shows that the expression of MRTF-A in the hippocampus of Tg2576 transgenic mice is reduced, and the overexpression of MRTF-A mediated by lentiviral vectors carrying MRTF-A significantly reduces the accumulation of hippocampal beta-amyloid peptide and reduces cognition defect. Overexpression of MRTF-A inhibits neuronal apoptosis, increases the protein levels of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3-II ( MAP1LC3/LC3-II) and Beclin1, reduces the accumulation of SQSTM1/p62 protein, and promotes autophagosomes-Lysosomal fusion in vivo and in vitro. Microarray analysis and bioinformatics analysis show that MRTF-A reverses A beta-induced autophagy impairment by up-regulating miR1273g-3p level leading to negative regulation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which is confirmed in A beta(1-42)-treated SH-SY5Y cells. Further, overexpression of MRTF-A reduces A beta(1-42)-induced neuronal apoptosis. And the effect was abolished by miR-1273g-3p inhibitor or MHY1485 (mTOR agonist), indicating that the protection of MRTF-A on neuronal damage is through targeting miR-1273g-3p/mTOR axis. Targeting this signaling may be a promising approach to protect against A beta-induced neuronal injury.

AB  - Mitochondrial biogenesis in the brain is impaired in various neurological disorders including traumatic brain injury (TBI). The long-lasting effects of TBI may be, in part, attributed to epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation. However, the role of DNA methylation on regulatory elements of nuclear and mitochondrial genome in mitochondrial biogenesis is not known. We examined the epigenetic regulation of mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), and further probed its implications in mitochondrial dysfunction in the hippo campus of rats subjected to repeated mild TBI (rMTBI) using weight drop injury paradigm. rMTBI-induced hypermethylation at TFAM promoter resulted in deficits in its protein levels in mitochondria after immediate (48 h) and protracted (30 d) time points. Further, rMTBI also caused hypomethylation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) promoters (HSP1 and HSP2), which further culminated into low binding of TFAM. rMTBI-induced changes weakened mitochondrial biogenesis in terms of reduced mtDNA-encoded rRNA, mRNA, and protein levels leading to shortages of ATP. To verify the potential role of mtDNA methylation in rMTBI-induced persistent mitochondrial dysfunction, rMTBI-induced rats were treated with methionine, a methyl donor. Methionine treatment restored the methylation levels on HSP1 and HSP2 resulting in efficient binding of TFAM and normalized the rRNA, mRNA, and protein levels. These findings suggest the crucial role of DNA methylation at nuclear and mitochondrial promoter regions in mitochondrial gene expression and ATP activity in the hippocampus after rMTBI.

AB  - Purpose: To investigate the therapeutic effect of electroacupuncture (EA) on chronic and unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced depression in mice and the underlying mechanism.
   Methods: Male C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into 6 groups: Control, CUMS, CUMS+EA-placebo, CUMS+EA, CUMS+ ad-NC, CUMS+ ad-cGAS-shRNA. CUMS was utilized to establish the depression model in mice. The behavioral changes were determined by the forced swimming, open field, and sucrose preference experiments. The pathological changes in the hippocampus tissue were evaluated by HE staining. The release of TNF-alpha, IL-beta, IL-6, 5-HT, and NE in the hippocampus tissue was determined by ELISA. IBA-1 expression detected by the immunofluorescence was used to represent the activity of microglia. Western blot and RT-PCR were utilized to measure the expression of Bax, bcl-2, cGAS, STING, TBK1, IRF3, and NLRP3.
   Results: The depression behavior in CUMS mice was significantly alleviated by the treatment of EA and cGAS-shRNA, accompanied by ameliorated hippocampus pathological changes, declined production of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-6, elevated secretion of 5-HT and NE, and inhibition on the activity of microglia. Furthermore, significantly elevated expression level of Bax, cGAS, STING, TBK1, IRF3, and NLRP3 and declined expression level of bcl-2 were observed in the CUMS+EA and CUMS+ ad-cGAS-shRNA groups.
   Conclusions: EA significantly mitigated the symptom of depression in mice, which was closely associated with the repressed neuroinflammation, increased monoamine concentration, inactivated microglia, and inhibited cGAS-STING-NLRP3 signaling.

Soluble Amyloid-beta (A beta) oligomers are thought as the major trigger of synaptic malfunctions. Our earlier studies have demonstrated that A beta oligomers interfere with synaptic function through N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). Our recent in vitro study found the neuroprotective role of astrocytic GluN2A in the promotion of synapse survival and identified nerve growth factor (NGF) derived from astrocytes, as a likely mediator of astrocytic GluN2A buffering against A beta synaptotoxicity. Our present in vivo study focused on exploring the precise mechanism of astrocytic GluN2A influencing A beta synaptotoxicity through regulating NGF. We generated an adeno-associated virus (AAV) expressing an astrocytic promoter (GfaABC1D) shRNA targeted to Grin2a (the gene encoding GluN2A) to perform astrocyte-specific Grin2a knockdown in the hippocampal dentate gyrus, after 3 weeks of virus vector expression, A beta were bilaterally injected into the intracerebral ventricle. Our results showed that astrocyte-specific knockdown of Grin2a and A beta application both significantly impaired spatial memory and cognition, which associated with the reduced synaptic proteins PSD95, synaptophysin and compensatory increased NGF. The reduced astrocytic GluN2A can counteract A beta-induced compensatory protective increase of NGF through regulating pNF-kappa B, Furin and VAMP3, which modulating the synthesis, mature and secretion of NGF respectively. Our present data reveal, for the first time, a novel mechanism of astrocytic GluN2A in exerting protective effects on synapses at the early stage of A beta exposure, which may contribute to establish new targets for AD prevention and early therapy.

AB  - Background: Early exposure to sevoflurane may cause brain tissue degeneration; however, the mechanism involved in this process has not been explored. In this study, we investigated the role of long non-coding RNA small nucleolar RNA host gene 3 (lncRNA SNHG3) in sevoflurane-induced neuronal injury. Methods: The injury models of HT22 and primary cultures of neurons were constructed using sevoflurane treatment. The WST-8 reduction was detected by CCK-8 assay, the level of inflammatory factors was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and cell pyroptosis was detected by flow cytometry. The expression of genes and proteins was detected by qRT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. The level of beta-tubulin III in primary cultures of hippocampal neurons was analyzed by immunofluorescence. The relationship among SNHG3, PTBP1 and NEK7 was confirmed by RIP assay. Results: The expression of SNHG3 and NEK7 were enhanced in sevoflurane-treated HT22 cells. Sevoflurane inhibited the WST-8 reduction in a concentration-dependent manner, promoted the pyroptosis, and increased pyroptosis-related protein expression. SNHG3 knockdown significantly inhibited sevoflurane-induced pyroptosis and inflammatory injury in HT22 cells and primary cultures of neurons. Furthermore, SNHG3 regulated NEK7 expression by binding to PTBP1. NEK7 knockdown reversed the decrease in WST-8 reduction, inhibited pyroptosis, and decreased the release of inflammatory factors and pyroptosis-related protein expression by inactivation of NLRP3 signaling in sevoflurane-induced HT22 cells. Moreover, NEK7 overexpression attenuated the effect of SNHG3 knockdown on neuronal pyroptosis and inflammation injury. Conclusion: Downregulation of SNHG3 attenuates sevoflurane-induced neuronal inflammation and pyroptosis by mediating the NEK7/NLRP3 axis, suggesting that SNHG3 could be a potential target gene for neuronal injury.

AB  - Microglia-mediated neuroinflammation has been shown to exert an important effect on the progression of a growing number of neurodegenerative disorders. Prolonged exposure to detrimental stimuli leads to a state of progressive activation and aging-related features in microglia (also termed as senescent microglia). However, the mechanisms by which senescent microglia contribute to neuroinflammation-induced cognitive dysfunction remain to be elucidated. Here, we developed a mouse model of neuroinflammation induced by lipopolysaccharides at 0.5 mg/kg for 7 consecutive days. To evaluate cognitive function, C57BL/6J mice were employed and subjected to a series of behavioral assessments, including the open field, Y-maze, and novel object recognition tests. Employing single-cell RNA sequencing technology, we have delved into the differential expressions of RNA within microglia. Furthermore, to investigate anatomic and physiological alterations of pyramidal neurons, we utilized Golgi staining and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, respectively. Validation of our results in protein expression was performed using western blotting and immunofluorescence. We specifically identified senescent microglia with a high expression of p16INK4a and observed that microglia in the hippocampal CA1 region of the model exhibited signatures of elevated phagocytosis and senescence. A senolytic by ABT-737 treatment alleviated the production of senescence-associated secretory phenotypes, the accumulation of senescent microglia, and the microglial hyperphagocytosis of excitatory synapses following LPS exposures. This treatment also restored reduced excitatory synaptic transmission, impaired long-term potentiation, and cognitive function in the model. These results indicate that reducing senescent microglia may potentially serve as a therapeutic approach to prevent neuroinflammation-related cognitive dysfunction.

AB  - Neuron-restrictive silencer factor/repressor element 1 (RE1)-silencing transcription factor (NRSF/REST) is a transcriptional repressor of a large cluster of neural genes containing RE1 motifs in their promoter region. NRSF/REST is ubiquitously expressed in non-neuronal cells, including astrocytes, while it is down-regulated during neuronal differentiation. While neuronal NRSF/REST homeostatically regulates intrinsic excitability and synaptic transmission, the role of the high NRSF/REST expression levels in the homeostatic functions of astrocytes is poorly understood. Here, we investigated the functional consequences of NRSF/REST deletion in primary cortical astrocytes derived from NRSF/REST conditional knockout mice (KO). We found that NRSF/REST KO astrocyte displayed a markedly reduced activity of inward rectifying K+ channels subtype 4.1 (Kir4.1) underlying spatial K+ buffering that was associated with a decreased expression and activity of the glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1) responsible for glutamate uptake by astrocytes. The effects of the impaired astrocyte homeostatic functions on neuronal activity were investigated by co-culturing wild-type hippocampal neurons with NRSF/REST KO astrocytes. Interestingly, neurons experienced increased neuronal excitability at high firing rates associated with decrease after hyperpolarization and increased amplitude of excitatory postsynaptic currents. The data indicate that astrocytic NRSF/REST directly participates in neural circuit homeostasis by regulating intrinsic excitability and excitatory transmission and that dysfunctions of NRSF/REST expression in astrocytes may contribute to the pathogenesis of neurological disorders.

AB  - Background: Capsular contracture may occur after rhinoplasty due to rejection of silicone implants by the im-mune system. Our previous high-throughput sequencing of RNA in nasal capsular contracture tissue revealed that FPR3 was significantly increased in grade IV capsular contracture tissue, compared with grade II. Objective: This study aimed to elucidate the effect and specific mechanism of FPR3 on capsular formation and contracture following rhinoplasty.Methods: Using the GeneMANIA Database, the genes involved with FPR3 expression were searched, and the Gene Ontology analysis was performed to annotate the biological functions of the aforementioned genes. The mRNA and protein expressions of related genes in fibroblasts and capsular contracture tissues were analyzed using quantitative real-time PCR, western blot, and immunohistochemical staining. CCK-8 was used to determine the viability of cells. The migration capacity of fibroblasts was assessed using a wound healing assay. ELISA was used to detect levels of IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, and IL-6.Results: After rhinoplasty, the expression of FPR3 in the capsular tissue increased in proportion to the degree of contracture. By activating the PKA/Rap1/ERK1/2 axis, overexpression of FPR3 can significantly increase the cell viability of fibroblasts and promote their transformation into myofibroblasts. Moreover, FPR3 phosphorylates I Kappa B to decrease NF-Kappa B inhibition, thereby promoting the synthesis and release of the inflammatory cytokines IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, and IL-6.Conclusion: FPR3 is a crucial molecule that causes capsular development and contracture following rhinoplasty. In the future, local suppression of FPR3 may be an effective treatment for relieving capsular contracture.

AB  - As a general anesthetic widely used in surgical, sevoflurane has been shown to cause cognitive and memory deficits in the elderly. It's important to find out agents that can counteract sevoflurane-induced cognitive dysfunction. This study is aimed to investigate the effect of lovastatin on sevoflurane-induced cognitive impairment in aged rats and reveal the potential mechanisms. BV-2 cells, rat hippocampal neurons or male aged rats were exposed to 2% sevoflurane for 5 h. The cells were pretreated with 10 mu M lovastatin. The rats were intraperitoneally injected with 5 mg/kg/day lovastatin for three days. The results showed that lovastatin enhanced exosomal IDE secretion from sevoflurane-exposed BV-2 cells and promoted A beta degradation. Lovastatin treatment also inhibited the increased expressions of beta-secretase 1 (BACE1) and gamma-secretase in hippocampal neurons under sevoflurane exposure in vitro. In animal experiments, the discrimination index in novel object recognition test and percentage of spontaneous alternation in Y-maze test were significantly elevated after lovastatin administration. In addition, A beta plaque area and contents of soluble A beta(1-40) and A beta(1-42) in the hippocampal tissues were decreased upon lovastatin treatment. Furthermore, lovastatin reversed sevoflurane-induced A beta accumulation via up-regulating IDE expression, and down-regulating amyloid precursor protein (APP)-related protein expression (beta-C-terminal fragment (CTF), BACE1 and gamma-secretase). In conclusion, lovastatin alleviates sevoflurane-induced cognitive deficient in aged rats via promoting A beta degradation and reducing A beta production. Lovastatin may be beneficial in preventing anesthetic-induced cognitive impairment.

AB  - Postoperative neurocognitive disorder (PND) is a common complication in older patients. However, its pathogenesis has still remained elusive. Recent studies have shown that circular RNA (circRNA) plays an important role in the development of neurodegenerative diseases, such as PND after surgery. CircRNA, as a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA), mainly acts as a molecular sponge for miRNA to "adsorb " microRNA (miRNA) and to reduce the inhibitory effects of miRNAs on target mRNA. The sequencing data of circRNA were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. By bioinformatic methods, circAtlas, miRDB, miRTarBase and miRwalk databases were applied to construct circRNA-miRNA-mRNA networks and screen differentially expressed mRNAs. To improve the accuracy of the data, we randomly divided aging mice into control (non-PND group) and PND groups, and used high-throughput sequencing to analyze their brain hippocampal tissue for analysis. Three key genes were cross-detected in the data of both groups, which were Unc13c, Tbx20 and St8sia2 (as hub genes), providing new targets for PND treatment. According to the results of the Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses, immune cell infiltration analysis, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), Connectivity Map (CMap) analysis, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), the genes that were not related to the central nervous system were removed, and finally, mmu_circ_0000331/miR-1224-3p/Unc13c and mmu_circ_0000406/miR-24-3p/St8sia2 ceRNA networks were identified. In addition, the CMap method was used to select the top 4 active compounds with the largest negative correlation absolute values, including cimaterol, Rucaparib, FG-7142, and Hydrocortisone.

AB  - Objective: To explore the effect of Fasudil on HA spasm and its underlying mechanism. Methods: Rabbits were divided into Sham, Fasudil, and Model groups for experiments. Fasudil was injected into the left medial lobe of the rabbit liver using a 16G lumbar puncture needle through the laparotomic route. The spasm model was established by inserting the catheter sheath into the femoral arteries of rabbits, followed by celiac artery angiography and left HA catheterization with a micro-catheter. Next, the GSE60887 and GSE37924 datasets concerning Fasudil treatment were analyzed. Moreover, immunofluorescence staining was conducted for YAP1 and alpha-SMA. Finally, Western blotting was performed to examine the expressions of YAP1, ROCK, ERK1/2, ETA, and ETB. Results: Fasudil could relieve HA spasm. The Go and KEGG pathway analyses revealed that the MAPK signaling pathway and the Hippo signaling pathway were enriched in vasospasm. Besides, GSEA revealed that ROCK was functionally enriched in the MAPK and Hippo signaling pathways. Co-expression analysis revealed that MAPK1 was significantly correlated with YAP1 and MYC, and YAP1 was significantly correlated with ETA and ETB. It was manifested in the results of immunofluorescence staining that the YAP1-positive fluorescence area was significantly decreased after Fasudil treatment. Moreover, Western blotting results showed that Fasudil decreased the expressions of YAP1, RhoA, ROCK, ETA, ETB, and p-ERK1/2. In addition, in-vitro Western blotting revealed that Fasudil suppressed the YAP/ERK/ETA/ETB signaling pathway in the case of HA spasm by inhibiting ROCK activation. Conclusions: Fasudil ameliorates HA spasm through suppressing the YAP/ERK/ETA/ETB signaling pathway and the ROCK activation.

AB  - Glycosylphosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase D1 (GPLD1) hydrolyzes inositol phosphate linkages in proteins anchored to the cell membrane. Mice overexpressing GPLD1 show enhanced neurogenesis and cognition. Snell dwarf (DW) and growth hormone receptor knockout (GKO) mice show delays in age-dependent cognitive decline. We hypothesized that augmented GPLD1 might contribute to retained cognitive function in these mice. We report that DW and GKO show higher GPLD1 levels in the liver and plasma. These mice also have elevated levels of hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and of doublecortin (DCX), suggesting a mechanism for maintenance of cognitive function at older ages. GPLD1 was not increased in the hippocampus of DW or GKO mice, suggesting that plasma GPLD1 increases elevated these brain proteins. Alteration of the liver and plasma GPLD1 was unaltered in mice with liver-specific GHR deletion, suggesting that the GH effect was not intrinsic to the liver. GPLD1 was also induced by caloric restriction and by each of four drugs that extend lifespan. The proteome of DW and GKO mice is molded by selective translation of mRNAs, involving cap-independent translation (CIT) of mRNAs marked by N-6 methyladenosine. Because GPLD1 protein increases were independent of the mRNA level, we tested the idea that GPLD1 might be regulated by CIT. 4EGI-1, which enhances CIT, increased GPLD1 protein without changes in GPLD1 mRNA in cultured fibroblasts and mice. Furthermore, transgenic overexpression of YTHDF1, which promotes CIT by reading m6A signals, also led to increased GPLD1 protein, showing that elevation of GPLD1 reflects selective mRNA translation.

AB  - Human amniotic membrane-derived mesenchymal stem cell-conditioned medium (hAMSC-CM) has been known to improve neuronal survival following ischemic stroke. The present study was designed to examine whether protective effects of hAMSC-CM against stroke can be linked to reducing neuroinflamation by targeting TLR4 /NF-ccB and Jak2/Stat3 signaling pathways. Immunohistochemistry of hippocampus and western blot assay were performed to evaluate the expression of TLR4 /NF-ccB and Jak2/Stat3, respectively. Real-time PCR assay was applied to investigate the mRNA levels of Jak2/Stat3. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was used to investigate tissue damage and morphological changes in the CA1 region of hippocampus.
   Increased brain edema was seen in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rats compared to sham. Posttreatment with hAMSC-CM markedly reduced brain edema in comparison with MCAO group (P < 0.05). Compared to sham, significantly increased levels of TLR4 /NF-ccB and Jak2/Stat3 were seen in MCAO rats. Intravenous injection of hAMSC-CM after reperfusion markedly reduced levels of TLR4 /NF-ccB and Jak2/Stat3 in hippocampus region (P < 0.05). Tissue damage and neuronal cell increased in the CA1 region of hippocampus that reversed by post-treatment by hAMSC-CM. Interestingly, our finding showed that hAMSC-CM can be considered as good candidate to reduce injury following ischemic stroke by decreasing activity of TLR4 /NF-ccB and Jak2/Stat3 signaling pathways.

AB  - Gamma-decanolactone (GD) has been shown to reduce epileptic behavior in different models, inflammatory decreasing, oxidative stress, and genotoxic parameters. This study assessed the GD effect on the pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) model after acute and subchronic treatment. We evaluated the expression of the inflammatory marker cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), GluN2B, a subunit of the NMDA glutamate receptor, adenosine A1 receptor, and GD genotoxicity and mutagenicity. Male and female mice were treated with GD (300 mg/kg) for 12 days. On the tenth day, they were tested in the Hot Plate test. On the thirteenth day, all animals received PTZ (90 mg/kg), and epileptic behavior PTZ-induced was observed for 30 min. Pregabalin (PGB) (30 mg/kg) was used as a positive control. Samples of the hippocampus and blood were collected for Western Blotting analyses and Comet Assay and bone marrow to the Micronucleus test. Only the acute treatment of GD reduced the seizure occurrence and increased the latency to the first stage 3 seizures. Males treated with GD for 12 days demonstrated a significant increase in the expression of the GluN2B receptor and a decrease in the COX-2 expression. Acute and subchronic treatment with GD and PGB reduced the DNA damage produced by PTZ in males and females. There is no increase in the micronucleus frequency in bone marrow after subchronic treatment. This study suggests that GD, after 12 days, could not reduce PTZ-induced seizures, but it has been shown to protect against DNA damage, reduce COX-2 and increase GluN2B expression.

AB  - Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a widespread and severe mental health condition characterized by persistent low mood and loss of interest. Emerging evidence suggests that ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of cell death, and epigenetic dysregulation contribute to the pathogenesis of MDD. This study investigates the role of RNA demethylase FTO and autophagy regulator BECN1 in ferroptosis and their regulation by the active compound ginsenoside Rb1 (GRb1) as a potential antidepressant strategy. Hippocampal tissues from postmortem MDD patient brains and mice with chronic restraint stress (CRS)-induced depression were analyzed. Ferroptosis was evaluated by analyzing the levels of markers such as glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA). GRb1 was administered to CRS model mice by gavage to explore its effects on ferroptosis-related pathways. The results showed that FTO and BECN1 expression was reduced in the hippocampal tissues of MDD patients and CRS model mice, promoting ferroptosis via disruption of the antioxidant system. Moreover, GRb1 treatment increased FTO and BECN1 expression, modulated m6A methylation, restored the antioxidant balance, and inhibited ferroptosis in CRS model mice. These findings reveal a novel epigenetic mechanism of ferroptosis in MDD and highlight GRb1 as a promising agent for treating depression through the targeting of ferroptosis pathways.

AB  - Purpose: To investigate the influences and mechanism of erythropoietin (EPO) on the cognitive function of vascular dementia (VD) rats. Methods: 1) Spatial memory capacity was assessed by Morris water maze test; 2) Pathological conditions of brain tissues were detected by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining; 3) The effect of treatment on apoptosis was observed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining; 4) Western blotting was used to examine the protein expression in hippocampal neurons. Results: The escape latency and swimming distance in the EPO group were much shorter than those in the Model group on the fifth day. In the spatial exploration test, the time spent in the target quadrant was longer, the number of platform crossings was larger and the swimming speed was higher in the Sham group and EPO group than those in the Model group. The results of HE staining showed that the cells in the hippocampal CA1 region were arranged closely in the Sham group, loosely and disorderly in the Model group but significantly better in the EPO group. Compared with that in the Model group, the number of apoptotic cells in the EPO group was obviously smaller. The results of Western blotting revealed that the expressions of EPO, p-EPOR, p-SHP2, p-TrKB, p-PI3K, p-ERK1/2 and Bcl-2 rose, while the expressions of P22, P47, Caspase-3, Caspase-9 and Bax significantly declined in the EPO group. Conclusions: EPO can effectively ameliorate the cognitive dysfunction induced by chronic hypoperfusion in VD rats by mediating oxidative stress-related pathways.

AB  - Metabolic disorder, which commonly happens among senile people worldwide, is an important sign of aging. The early symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases include a decrease in energy metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction. Comparably, early dietary intervention may be more effective in preventing or delaying brain aging, owing to its role in regulating metabolism. Polyphenol intake has shown its potential in preventing Alzheimer's disease. However, whether there are close connections between polyphenols and the energy metabolism of the brain during aging remains unclear. This study sought to evaluate whether cyanidin 3-O-beta-galactoside from black chokeberry (Aronia melanocarpa (Michx.) Elliott) has positive effects on energy metabolism, as well as cognitive function in aging mice. Intragastrical administration of cyanidin 3-O-beta-galactoside (25 and 50 mg/kg/day) for 8 weeks effectively alleviated the decline in brain glucose uptake (decline rate 18.29% versus 1.05%, 7.63%) of aging mice. Moreover, cyanidin 3-O-beta-galactoside also alleviated neuronal damage in the hippocampus (number of neurons 212.33 +/- 16.19 versus 285.33 +/- 29.53, 301.67 +/- 10.07; p < 0.05) and cortex (number of neurons 82.00 +/- 4.58 versus 111.67 +/- 6.51, 112.00 +/- 1.00; p < 0.05). Furthermore, cyanidin 3-O-beta-galactoside reduced beta-amyloid load in the brain and significantly increased the crossing-platform number (0.92 +/- 1.11 versus 1.83 +/- 0.68, 2.08 +/- 0.58; p < 0.05) in the Morris water maze test. We further determined that protein kinase B (AKT) might be the target of cyanidin 3-O-beta-galactoside, which played a beneficial role in controlling the energy metabolism of the brain. These results suggested that early intervention of anthocyanins could promote neuroprotection under the challenge of brain energy metabolism.

AB  - The hippocampus plays a critical role in the rapid learning of new episodic memories. Many computational models propose that the hippocampus is an autoassociator that relies on Hebbian learning (i.e., "cells that fire together, wire together"). However, Hebbian learning is computationally suboptimal as it does not learn in a way that is driven toward, and limited by, the objective of achieving effective retrieval. Thus, Hebbian learning results in more interference and a lower overall capacity. Our previous computational models have utilized a powerful, biologically plausible form of error-driven learning in hippocampal CA1 and entorhinal cortex (EC) (functioning as a sparse autoencoder) by contrasting local activity states at different phases in the theta cycle. Based on specific neural data and a recent abstract computational model, we propose a new model called Theremin (Total Hippocampal ERror MINimization) that extends error-driven learning to area CA3-the mnemonic heart of the hippocampal system. In the model, CA3 responds to the EC monosynaptic input prior to the EC disynaptic input through dentate gyrus (DG), giving rise to a temporal difference between these two activation states, which drives error-driven learning in the EC -> CA3 and CA3 <-> CA3 projections. In effect, DG serves as a teacher to CA3, correcting its patterns into more pattern-separated ones, thereby reducing interference. Results showed that Theremin, compared with our original Hebbian-based model, has significantly increased capacity and learning speed. The model makes several novel predictions that can be tested in future studies.
   Author summary
   Exemplified by the famous case of patient H.M. (Henry Molaison) whose hippocampus was surgically removed, the hippocampus is critical for learning and remembering everyday events-what is typically called "episodic memory." The dominant theory for how it learns is based on the intuitive principle stated by Donald Hebb in 1949, that neurons that "fire together, wire together"-when two neurons are active at the same time, the strength of their connection increases. We show in this paper that using a different form of learning based on correcting errors (error-driven learning) results in significantly improved episodic memory function in a biologically-based computational model of the hippocampus. This model also provides a significantly better account of behavioral data on the testing effect, where learning by testing with partial cues is better than learning with the complete set of information.

AB  - In recent years, bioinspired insect flight has become a prominent research area, with a particular focus on beetle-inspired aerial vehicles. Studying the unique flight mechanisms and structural characteristics of beetles has significant implications for the optimization of biomimetic flying devices. Among beetles, Allomyrina dichotoma (rhinoceros beetle) exhibits a distinct wing deployment-flight-retraction sequence, whereby the interaction between the hindwings and protective elytra contributes to lift generation and maintenance. This study investigates A. dichotoma's wing deployment, flight, and retraction behaviors through motion analysis, uncovering the critical role of the elytra in wing folding. We capture the kinematic parameters throughout the entire flight process and develop an accurate kinematic model of A. dichotoma flight. Using smoke visualization, we analyze the flow field generated during flight, revealing the formation of enhanced leading-edge vortices and attached vortices during both upstroke and downstroke phases. These findings uncover the high-lift mechanism underlying A. dichotoma's flight dynamics, offering valuable insights for optimizing beetle-inspired micro aerial vehicles.

AB  - Green nanocomposites combining cellulose nano fibrils (CNFs), cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), and lignin nano particles (LNPs) were designed and applied for the first time as ternary protective coatings on cellulosic materials, i.e., substrates mainly composed of cellulose. All the nanostructures were obtained from elephant grass biomass. CNFs and CNCs are less than 10 nm thick and present a filament-like morphology, while LNPs are spheres with an average diameter of less than 100 nm. The use of water-based nanoparticle dispersions is a facile and greener alternative to synthetic varnishes usually based on toxic organic solvents. Moreover, the coatings from renewable sources were chemically stable; showed high compatibility with wood, paper, and fabric; and preserved the roughness and surface morphology of the substrates after application. Moist-heat accelerated aging and UV-shielding assays revealed that the nanocellulose/nanolignin coatings were able to protect the coated cellulosic substrates against degradation. The wettability of nanocomposite-coated substrates could be tailored and reduced to produce hydrophobic surfaces by applying additional layers of water-based carnauba wax nanoparticles, which are also sustainable. Additionally, two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy mapping confirmed the reversibility of the coating application, as the nanocomposite layers could be easily removed from the cellulosic substrates by water-loaded cleaning hydrogels. Therefore, the functional protective coating introduced here represents an environmentally friendly and nontoxic approach for the conservation of cellulosic artifacts in general, including cultural heritage objects based on paper, wood, and fabric.

AB  - Sporadic Alzheimer's disease (sAD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with dysfunctional insulin signaling and energy metabolism. Emerging evidence suggests impairments in brain insulin responsiveness, glucose utilization, and energy metabolism may be major causes of amyloid precursor protein mishandling. The support for this notion comes from the studies wherein streptozotocin (STZ) induced brain insulin resistance in rodent model resulted in sAD-like neuropathology with cognitive decline. Our previous study showed a compromised insulin signaling pathway, glucose uptake, glucose metabolism, and energy homeostasis in STZ-induced glial-neuronal coculture and in vivo model of sAD. Various components of insulin signaling pathway were examined to understand the metabolic correlation, and GSK3 beta was selected for gene knockdown strategy to reverse sAD pathology based on the data. In the present study, we have synthesized carboxylated graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets functionalized with PEG and subsequently with polyethylenimine (PEI) to provide attachment sites for GSK3 beta siRNA. Our results showed that siRNA mediated knockdown of the GSK3 beta gene reduced expression of amyloid pathway genes (APP and BACE1), which was further confirmed by reduced amyloid beta (A beta) levels in the in vitro STZ-induced sAD model. GSK3 beta knockdown also restored insulin signaling, AMPK and Mapk3 pathway by restoring the expression of corresponding candidate genes in these pathways (IR, Glut1/3, Prkaa1/2, Mapk3, BDNF) that reflected improved cellular energy homeostasis, neuronal proliferation, differentiation, maturation, and repair. Behavioral data from Morris water maze (MWM), open field (OF), novel object recognition (NOR), Y maze, and radial arm maze (RAM) tests showed that 0.5 mu g nanoformulation (GOc-PP-siRNA(GSK3 beta)) intranasally for 7 days improved spatial memory, rescued anxiety like behavior, improved visual and working memory, and rescued exploratory behavior in STZ-induced sAD rats. GSK3 beta silencing resulted in decreased BACE1 expression and prevented accumulation of A beta in the cortex and hippocampus. These molecular findings with improved behavioral performances were further correlated with reduced amyloid beta (A beta) and neurofibrillary tangle (NFTs) formation in the cortex and hippocampus of GOc-PPsiRNA(GSK3 beta) administered sAD rats. Therefore, it is conceivable from the present study that nanopartide-mediated targeting of GSK3 beta in the sAD appears to be a promising strategy to reverse sAD pathology.

AB  - Saw palmetto (Serenoa repens) fruit extract is a popular dietary supplement used as a therapy for benign prostatic hyperplasia and associated lower urinary tract symptoms in men. The United States Pharmacopeia has defined the quality determinant of saw palmetto fruit extract by its lipido-sterolic fingerprint characterized by >= 80 % total fatty acid (FA) content with specific FA ratios relative to lauric acid and minor portions of phytosterols (0.25-0.5 %). A comprehensive understanding of post-anthesis saw palmetto fruit development comparing saw palmetto forms, in addition to the impact of geographical adaptation on fruit phytochemical profiles is lacking. We characterized the morphology and development of saw palmetto fruit from green form (Serenoa repens Bartram) and silver form (S. repens forma glauca) collected from varied geographical locations in Florida, and analyzed the fruit phytochemicals focusing on FA content and composition using GC-MS. Notably, silver form fruits exhibited a longer fruit development period of 25 weeks after anthesis (WAA), where anthesis was defined by fully opened flowers, compared to 19WAA in green form leading to larger fruit with higher fatty acid content. In both ecotypes, the major FAs in mature fruit extracts were oleic acid (C18:1n-9, 35-60 %) and lauric acid (C12:0, 16-20 %). The lauric-to-oleic acid ratio was 0.46 in the green form and 0.34 in the silver form. In both saw palmetto forms, the optimal harvest period corresponding to the highest FA accumulation was at yellow/ orange fruit ripening stage, which occurred 3 weeks prior to fruits turning black. The present study provides new insights into the developmental FA profiling of saw palmetto fruit based on the form and geographical location which has practical implications in guiding saw palmetto berry harvest for nutraceutical applications.

AB  - The current global pandemic due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus has demonstrated the necessity to develop novel materials with antimicrobial and antiviral activities to prevent the infection. One significant route for the spread of diseases is by the transmission of the virus through contact with contaminated surfaces. Antiviral surface treatments can help to reduce or even avoid these hazards. In particular, the development of active-virucidal fabrics or paints represents a very important challenge with multiple applications in hospitals, public transports, or schools. Modern, cutting-edge methods for creating antiviral surface coatings use either materials with a metal base or sophisticated synthetic polymers. Even if these methods are effective, they will still face significant obstacles in terms of large-scale applicability. Here, we describe the preparation of fabrics and paints treated with a scaled-up novel nanostructured biohybrid material composed of very small crystalline phosphate copper(II) nanoparticles, synthesized based on a technology that employs the use of a small amount of biological agent for its formation at room temperature in aqueous media. We demonstrate the efficient inactivation of the human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, and non-enveloped human rhinovirus 14 (HRV-14) (>99.9%) using an inexpensive, ecologically friendly coating agent. The reactive oxygen species produced during the oxidation of water or the more intensive reaction with hydrogen peroxide are believed to be the cause of the antiviral mechanism of the nanostructured material. In contrast to the release of a specific antiviral drug, this process does not consume the surface coating and does not need regeneration. A 12-month aging research that revealed no decline in antiviral activity is proof that the coating is durable in ambient circumstances. Also, the coated fabric can be reused after different washing cycles, even at moderate to high temperatures.

AB  - Soft actuators made of thermoresponsive polymers have great potential for intelligent robotics and biomedical devices due to their reversible deformation capability in response to temperature fluctuations. However, they are constrained by a predefined phase transition temperature, limited directional deformation, and nonbiocompatible formulations, thereby restricting their practical utility. Herein a new biomimicry approach is presented to overcome these limitations by developing hydro- and hydrothermally responsive soft actuators made of biocompatible and pliable materials i.e. cotton yarn and polyurethane. We mimic the tubular shape of elephant trunks with their unique muscle orientation by embedding a helical cotton yarn within a hydrophilic polyurethane tube, followed by targeted surface patterning. Unlike the narrow-range shape morphing across the phase transition temperature boundary of typical thermoresponsive hydrogel actuators, we harness hydrothermal stiffness variations in polyurethane to obtain consistent morphing capabilities over a much wider temperature range. The developed actuators can perform versatile activities such as linear, bending, curvilinear, and rotating movements, overcoming the unidirectional motion limitations of conventional soft actuators. The cell viability assay on the building block materials also confirms the high biocompatibility of the actuators. The reported facile fabrication strategy provides new insights for designing complex yet free-standing soft actuators from readily available supple materials.

AB  - Wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) is a process included in the directed energy deposition (DED) category of additive manufacturing which involves building parts layer by layer using gas metal arc welding (GMAW), gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW), or plasma arc welding (PAW). Machining and heat treating often follow the WAAM deposition to achieve the desired geometric tolerances, surface finish, and properties. While many software applications exist for layer-by-layer additive manufacturing, few are designed specifically for robotic WAAM. The computer aided design (CAD) software, Rhino 7, and its built-in programming tool, Grasshopper, allow for quick parametric manipulation of primitives such as curves, points, and meshes in the virtual space, making development of dynamic slicing scripts possible and applicable to WAAM research. In combination with plug-ins such as KUKA|prc, slicing, path modification, process simulation, and code generation can all be completed within the software. This paper demonstrates scripts developed in Rhino 7 for control of welding paths in robotic WAAM and describes how these scripts may be applicable to other manufacturing processes.

AB  - STUDY QUESTION Which genetic factors regulate female propensity for giving birth to spontaneous dizygotic (DZ) twins?SUMMARY ANSWER We identified four new loci, GNRH1, FSHR, ZFPM1, and IPO8, in addition to previously identified loci, FSHB and SMAD3.WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY The propensity to give birth to DZ twins runs in families. Earlier, we reported that FSHB and SMAD3 as associated with DZ twinning and female fertility measures.STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION We conducted a genome-wide association meta-analysis (GWAMA) of mothers of spontaneous dizygotic (DZ) twins (8265 cases, 264 567 controls) and of independent DZ twin offspring (26 252 cases, 417 433 controls).PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS Over 700 000 mothers of DZ twins, twin individuals and singletons from large cohorts in Australia/New Zealand, Europe, and the USA were carefully screened to exclude twins born after use of ARTs. Genetic association analyses by cohort were followed by meta-analysis, phenome wide association studies (PheWAS), in silico and in vivo annotations, and Zebrafish functional validation.MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE This study enlarges the sample size considerably from previous efforts, finding four genome-wide significant loci, including two novel signals and a further two novel genes that are implicated by gene level enrichment analyses. The novel loci, GNRH1 and FSHR, have well-established roles in female reproduction whereas ZFPM1 and IPO8 have not previously been implicated in female fertility. We found significant genetic correlations with multiple aspects of female reproduction and body size as well as evidence for significant selection against DZ twinning during human evolution. The 26 top single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from our GWAMA in European-origin participants weakly predicted the crude twinning rates in 47 non-European populations (r = 0.23 between risk score and population prevalence, s.e. 0.11, 1-tail P = 0.058) indicating that genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are needed in African and Asian populations to explore the causes of their respectively high and low DZ twinning rates. In vivo functional tests in zebrafish for IPO8 validated its essential role in female, but not male, fertility. In most regions, risk SNPs linked to known expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). Top SNPs were associated with in vivo reproductive hormone levels with the top pathways including hormone ligand binding receptors and the ovulation cycle.LARGE SCALE DATA The full DZT GWAS summary statistics will made available after publication through the GWAS catalog (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/).LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION Our study only included European ancestry cohorts. Inclusion of data from Africa (with the highest twining rate) and Asia (with the lowest rate) would illuminate further the biology of twinning and female fertility.WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS About one in 40 babies born in the world is a twin and there is much speculation on why twinning runs in families. We hope our results will inform investigations of ovarian response in new and existing ARTs and the causes of female infertility.STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S) Support for the Netherlands Twin Register came from the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) and The Netherlands Organization for Health Research and Development (ZonMW) grants, 904-61-193, 480-04-004, 400-05-717, Addiction-31160008, 911-09-032, Biobanking and Biomolecular Resources Research Infrastructure (BBMRI.NL, 184.021.

AB  - Flexible neural probes with conductive polymer electrodes present promising alternatives to rigid devices for chronic brain stimulation and recording. Organic devices, characterized by higher charge injection capabilities and better compatibility with biological tissues compared to inorganic probes, hold significant potential in this field. However, demonstrating stability and consistent physiological responses during prolonged pulsing is crucial for their practical application. Moreover, their implantation into brain tissue remains a challenge. Due to their small size and flexibility, organic devices are difficult to insert into brain tissue. This limits their widespread use for recording and deep stimulation of the brain. In this study, we fabricated plastic depth probes with PEDOT:PSS electrodes and developed a reliable protocol for their implantation into brain tissue using a stiff, removable shuttle. We implanted two identical probes into the hippocampus of an adult rat, targeting the CA1 layer with recording electrodes and Schaffer collaterals with stimulating electrodes. We demonstrated that these fabricated devices are excellent tools for recording not only the activity of the neuronal network but also individual neurons. Using microampere range electrical current pulses, we stimulated Schaffer collaterals in freely moving rats and recorded the electrophysiological responses of CA1 pyramidal cells over a 12 day period. Histological analysis of the implanted brain revealed that the lesions caused by our probes were significantly smaller than those left by metal electrodes. Thus, we demonstrated that flexible organic devices are highly effective tools for deep brain recording and stimulation.

AB  - Material extrusion additive manufacturing offers great potential for customizing matters with complex external contours, and filament diameter-adjustable 3D (FDA-3D) printing strategy provides fresh impetus to create heterogeneous porous structures inside these complex matters. However, the absence of supporting algorithms to implement FDA-3D printing severely hinders its widespread use. In this paper, we develop a heterogeneous pore design (HPD) algorithm aimed at advancing the development of FDA-3D printing for producing heterogeneous porous matters. The HPD algorithm consists of three sub-algorithms: model design, collapse compensation, and fabrication file (G-codes) generation. As proofs of concept, we utilize this algorithm to 3D print radial gradient and letter-embedded gradient materials following specific steps: (1) designing the heterogeneous porous models with collapse compensation in Grasshopper (R) and displaying them in Rhinocores (R); (2) customizing and writing the corresponding G-codes files by following the material extrusion 3D printer's control rules; (3) upgrading a commercial extrusion printer to FDA-3D print the design models via the customized G-codes. Micro-computed tomography-based 3D reconstruction and quantified pore size maps for the fabricated objects demonstrate the high capability of this HPD algorithm. Overall, the HPD algorithm holds the potential to revolutionize material extrusion 3D printers cost-effectively, creating new possibilities for material extrusion of heterogeneous materials.

AB  - As additive manufacturing by fused filament fabrication has gained popularity, computational analysis has become fundamental in predicting the mechanical behavior of 3D models. This paper proposes the development of a method for the finite element (FE) simulation of 3D-printed parts, implementing model design reverse engineering using G-code to obtain their digital twins (DTs). Samples were printed under the ASTM D638 standard with different nozzle diameters and layer heights, which allowed them to be mechanically characterized by tensile tests. The tensile tests determined that the diameter of the nozzles used (between 0.2 mm and 1.0 mm) influences the material's tensile strength. The greater the diameter, the greater the stiffness, which translates into a change in the Young's modulus, as well as greater tensile strength and thus a reduction of the deformation, for which a value of 2.66 +/- 0.6% was obtained, i.e., the filament diameter did not influence this aspect. After carrying out the reverse engineering process of the samples to obtain DTs of the physical models, the printing G-code was used with the help of a Python script for their conversion to trajectories. These trajectories were introduced into Rhinoceros software with the Grasshopper add-on to obtain the reconstructed 3D models. The deposited filament profile used to reconstruct the DT was obtained by microscopy of the section of the physical samples. The predominant profile observed was that of a flattened oval. FE simulation was then carried out, obtaining a similarity of 90% between the simulated and mechanical tests, which validated the proposed method of predicting mechanical stresses in printed 3D elements.

AB  - Since epilepsy is still a complex neurological condition, better and more efficient treatment methods are needed. This study used PTZ- and PIL-induced seizure models to evaluate the anticonvulsant activity of some recently synthesized compounds (7a-f and 11a-c). Several candidates with significant seizure protection were found via initial screening in the PTZ model. In the pilocarpine model, compounds 7a and 11a showed the most promising efficacy by considerably delaying the start of seizures, lowering their severity, and increasing survival. According to biochemical analysis, both compounds successfully reduced oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, glial activation, and hippocampal excitotoxicity. Notably, 11a matched or surpassed valproic acid's effects, especially in lowering astrocytic activation (GFAP), while 7a performed better across all assessed parameters. The toxicological assessments validated both compounds' safety, and no evidence of neurotoxic, hepatic, renal, or cardiac damage was found. These results indicate the potential for additional preclinical development of 7a and 11a in epilepsy therapy by highlighting them as strong, safe, and versatile anticonvulsants.
